         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>THE following Discourses of our most Reverend
Author contain his judicious and pious Thoughts,
upon the Third Chapter to the end of the First Epistle
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which together with the <hi>Commentary</hi>
on the First and Second Chapters, published the last
year, make a compleat and useful Explication of that
whole Epistle. They might have been all of one Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and so have come into thy hands at the same time,
and in one Volume, had not some prudent considerations
oblig'd us to change the Printer: However we have
taken care so to print this Second Part, that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
be bound up with the first; and there is little
loss by the delay, but that of time, which perhaps
is not so much neither, but that it may (with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to thee) be happily redeemed.</p>
            <p>I know that some do not relish the phrase and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of such Discourses; but I am on the other
hand assured by others, very able and competent judges
of such performances, that they are highly valuable in
their whole scope and tendency: for they think
that they not only contain the purity of Doctrine
according to Scripture, but also the life and spirit of
<pb facs="tcp:104216:3"/>
Christian Morals; and that they happily cement toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and bear in upon the heart right notions of God
and Religion with solid Piety: In a word, that, as they
are written by a Primitive Spirit and in a plain Stile,
so they may, through Gods grace, sow the Seeds of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Devotion, which is too much worn out in this
Age; the seat whereof is more in the Heart, than in
the Head. If they serve in any measure those great
ends, our labour is highly rewarded.</p>
            <p>Let such then, as shall reap this benefit by these
well designed Papers, be pleased to know, that it is
not so much to me, as to the Pious Zeal and Care of
our Great and now Blessed Authors surviving Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that they owe this Happy Enjoyment: whose Virtue
and Piety afford matter enough for a large Preface, if
their Modesty did not so awfully restrain my too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
inclinations, that I must content my self to
say, that they now live like him, whom they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
loved whilst he was amongst them; and that
as he did, so they make it their business to do good,
without letting the World know of it. It has been
at their charge and pressing desire, that all those
papers that are already printed, have been copied out,
prepared for the press, and published. They neither
proposed to themselves, nor expect any other advantage
but thy Edification, and therein the glory of God; rich
returns indeed, and which nothing can rob them of, but
<pb facs="tcp:104216:3"/>
meerly thy inproficiency, and if that happen (which
God forbid) the loss shall be more thine than theirs.</p>
            <p>I was not willing that such good ends should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by my declining any part of the trouble that
fell to my share; on the contrary I considered it a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I owed first to God, and then to the memory of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Author, whose divine converse and wonderful
example, gave me early and powerful Resolutions to
dedicate my self to God, and the Service of his Church.</p>
            <p>In my performance I have done my best (tho short of
what I wished) to serve thee; there remains in our
Hands some brief but lively Discourses upon the Epistle
to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> upon the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi>
and the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> which possibly may be made
publick in a convenient time. When this is done, I
think we have ended all we intend to publish at present.
Let us therefore set about the reformation of our Lives,
in the use of these means, depending upon God for the
success; and that he by his free Grace and good
Spirit, may enable thee and me, by this and all other
helps, which this Age affords, to make greater and
greater Advances towards Heaven, and so to finish
our Course with Ioy, is and shall be the hearty Prayer
of,</p>

goes by and is no more seen; thus the great Pomps and
Solemnities of Marriages of Kings and Princes in former
times, where are they? Oh! how unseemly is it to
have an immortal Soul drowned in the esteem and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of any thing that perishes, and to be cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in seeking after a Good that will last as long
as it self. Aspire to that Good which is the only Match
for the Soul, that close Union with God, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be dissolved; which he calls an Everlasting Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that will make you happy, either with the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104216:5"/>
other or without it. All the happiness of the most
excellent Persons, and top of all Affection and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
meeting in Humane Marriages, are but a dark
and weak Representation of the solid joy that is in
that Mysterious Divine Union of the Spirit of Man
with the <hi>Father of Spirits</hi> from whence it issues. But
this by the way.</p>
                  <p>The Common Spring of all mutual Duties on both
sides is to be supposed <hi>Love:</hi> That peculiar conjugal
Love, that makes them one, that will infuse such
sweetness into the Authority of the Husband and
Obedience of the Wise, as will make their Lives har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious,
like the sound of a well tun'd instrument;
whereas without that, having such an Universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
of interest in all their Affairs, they cannot
escape frequent contests and discords, which is a sound
more unpleasant than the jarring of untuned Strings,
to an exact Ear. And this should be considered in
the choice, that it be not, as it is too often (which causeth
so many Domestick ills) contracted only as a Bargain of
outward Advantages, but as an Union of Hearts: And
where this is not, and that there is something wanting
in this point of Affection, there, if the Parties or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, have any saving knowledge of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to him in Prayer, they will be earnest Suiters for his
help in this, that his Hand may right what no other
can, that he who is Love it self may infuse that mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Love into their Hearts now, which they should
have sought sooner. And certainly they that sensibly
want this, and yet seek it not of him, what wonder
though they find much bitterness and discontent; and
where they agree only in Natural Affection, their
observance of the Duties requir'd is not by far either so
comfortable and pleasing, or so sure and lasting, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104216:6"/>
when it ariseth from a Religious and Christian Love
on both sides, that will cover many failings, and take
things by the best side.</p>
                  <p>Love is the prime Duty in both, the basis of all:
but because the particular Character of it, as proper to
the Wise, is conjugal Obedience and Subjection, therefore
that is usually specified, <hi>Eph 5. 12. Wives submit your selves
unto your own Husbands, as unto the Lord:</hi> So here. Now,
if it be such obedience as ought to arise from a special
kind of Love, then the Wife would remember this,
that it must not be constrained, unchearful obedience,
and the Husband would remember, that he ought not
to require base and servile Obedience; for both these are
contrary to that Love, whereof this obedience must
carry the true tincture and relish, as slowing from it,
there it will hold right, where Love commands, and
Love obeys.</p>
                  <p>This Subjection as all other, is qualified thus, that it
be <hi>in the Lord.</hi> His Authority is Primitive and binds first,
and all other have their Patents and Priviledges from
him: therefore he is supremely, and absolutely to be
observed in all, if the Husband would draw the Wife to
an irreligious course of Life and looseness he is not to
be followed in this, but in all things indifferent this
obedience must hold; which for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ids not neither, a
modest advice and representment to the Husband of that
which is more convenient: but that done, a submissive
yielding to the Husbands will is the suiting of this
rule. Yea possibly the Husband may not only impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
but unlawfully will that, which if not in its
own Nature a thing unlawful, the Wife by reason of
his will, may obey lawfully, yea could not lawfully
disobey.</p>
                  <p>Now though this Subjection was a Fundamental Law
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104216:6"/>
of pure Nature, and came from that hand that made all
things in perfect order, yet sin, that hath imbitter'd
all humane things with a Curse, hath disrelisht this
Subjection, and made it taste somewhat of a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16. and that as a suitable punishment
of the abuse of that power she had with him, to the
drawing of him to disobedience against God.</p>
                  <p>The bitterness in this Subjection arises from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Nature in both; in the Wife a perverse
desire rather to command, or at least a repining discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
at the obligation to obey; and this is increased by
the disorder, and imprudence, and harshness of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
in the use of their Authority.</p>
                  <p>But in a Christian, the Conscience of Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
will carry it, and weigh down all difficulties;
for the Wife considers her Station, that she is set in it,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>, 'tis the Rank the Lord's hand hath plac'd
her in, and therefore she will not break it; for respect
and love to him, she can digest much frowardness of
a Husband, and make that her patient subjection a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to God, <hi>Lord I offer this to thee, and for thy sake
I humbly bear it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The worth and love of a Husband may cause that
respect, where this Rule moves not: but the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

many others; yet because her <hi>own Husband,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

Providence in the particular dispose of his own, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she loves and obeys.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That if any obey not the Word.</hi>] This supposes a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Case, and applies the Rule to it, takes it for granted
a believing Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>e will chearfully observe and respect a
believing Husband; but if an Unbeliever, yet that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104216:7"/>
not this engagement, yea there is something in it
presses it and binds it the more, a singular good that
probably may follow upon obeying such; by that
good Conversation, they may be gained that believe
not the Word, not that they could be fully converted
without the Word, but having a prejudice against the
Word, that may be remov'd by the carriage of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Wife, and they may be somewhat mollified,
and prepar'd, and induc'd to hearken to Religion, and
take it into consideration.</p>
                  <p>This gives not Christians warrant to draw on this
Task, and make themselves this Work, by chusing to
be joyned to an Unbeliever, either a prophane or meer
natural Husband or Wife; but teaches them being so
matched, what should be their great desire, and their
suitable carriage to the attainment of it. And in the
primitive Christian times, this fell out often, that by
the Gospel preached, the Husband might be converted
from gross Infidelity, Judaism, or Paganism, and not
the Wife, or the Wife which is the supposition here,
and not the Husband, and there came in the use of this
consideration.</p>
                  <p>And in this is the freedom of Divine Grace, to pick
and chuse where he will, one of a Family, or two of
a Tribe, as the Prophet hath it, and according to our
Saviour's word, <hi>two in one Bed, the one taken and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
left.</hi> Some selected Ones in a Congregation, and
in a House, a Child possibly, or Servant, or Wife, and
leave the rest. The Apostle seems to imply particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that there were many instances of this, Wives
Converts, and Husbands unbelieving. We can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
nothing of their conjecture, that think there
shall be more of that Sex, here call'd the weaker Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
than of the other, that shall be Vessels of honour,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104216:7"/>
which God seasons with Grace here, and hereafter will
fill with Glory; but this is clear, that many of them
are converted, while many Men, and divers of them
very wise and learned Men, having the same and far
greater means and opportunities, do perish in unbelief.
This, I say, evidences the Liberty, and the Power of the
Spirit of God, that <hi>Wind, that bloweth where it listeth,</hi>
and withal it suits with that word of the Apostle, that
the Lord this way abases these things that men account
so much of, <hi>and hath chosen the weak things of the World to
confound the mighty,</hi> &amp;c. Nor doth the pliableness, and
tenderness of their affections (tho Grace once wrought
may make good use of that) make their conversion the
easier, but the harder rather; for through Natures
corruption; they would by that yield more to evil than
to good; but the efficacy of Grace appears much in
establishing their hearts in the love of God, and making
them once possess'd with that, to be inflexible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
by the tentations of the World, and the
strength, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lights of Satan.</p>
                  <p>That which is here said of their Conversation, holds
of the Husband in the like case, and of Friends and
Kindred, and generally of all Christians, in reference to
them with whom they converse, that their spotless
holy carriage as Christians, and in their particular
stations, as Christian Husbands, or Wives, or Friends, is a
very likely and hopeful means of converting others, that
believe not. Men that are prejudic'd observe actions a
great deal more than words. In those first times espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
the blameless carriage of Christians, did much
to the increasing of their number.</p>

those that are strangers to Religion, and possest with
false notions of it, and prejudices against it. 'Tis not
the regularness of some particular actions, nor the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of some duties, that will serve: but it is an even
uniform frame of Life, that the Apostle here teaches
Christian Wives, particularly in reference to this end,
the gaining, or conversion of unbelieving Husbands, and
this we have both in that word, <hi>their conversation,</hi>

                     <hi>Chaste Conversation.</hi>] It is the proper character of a
Christian to study Purity in all things, as the word in its
extent signifies. Let the World turn that to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
call them as you will, this is sure, that none
have less fancy and presumption of Purity, than these
that have most desire of it; but the particular pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

as the word is oft taken, it being a Grace that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
deserves that name, as the sins contrary to it
are usually and deservedly called Uncleanness. 'Tis the
pure whiteness of the Soul to be chaste, to abhor and
disdain the swinish puddle of Lust, than which there is
nothing doth more debase the excellent Soul, draws it
down below it self, and makes it truely brutish. The
three kinds of Chastity, Virginal, Conjugal, and
Vidual, are all of them acceptable to God, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Profession of a Christian: therefore in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

in that way conform to it, follow the Apostles Rule,
possessing those our earthen Vessels, our bodies, in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Honour; by which there is express'd this
same Chastity. And this we shall do, if we rightly
remember our Calling, as Christians, in what sort of
life soever; as there he tells us, <hi>That God hath not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis out of doubt, that though cloathing was
first drawn on by necessity, yet all regard of Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Ornament in Apparel is not unlawful, nor
doth the Apostle's expression here rightly considered,
fasten that upon the adorning he here speaks of, and he
doth no more universally condemn the use of Gold for
Ornament, than he doth any other comely Rayment,
which here he means by that general Word of putting
on of Apparel, for his (<hi>not</hi>) is comparative; <hi>not this
Adorning, but the Ornament of a meek Spirit,</hi> that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and as much more comely and precious; as that,
<hi>I will have mercy and not sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> According to the different place, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Persons there may be difference in this: Thus
the Robes of Judges and Princes are not only for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Ornament, but because there is in them, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to vulgar eyes, that seldom look deeper than the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104216:10"/>
outside of things, there is, I say, in that Apparel a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentment
of Authority or Majesty, that befits their
place; and besides this, in other Persons that are not in
Publick Place, Men or Women, that are here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
directed, yet may have in this some mark of their
Rank, and in Persons otherways little distant, some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
may be made for the Habitudes and Breeding
of some beyond others, or the quality of their Society,
and those with whom they converse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis not impossible that there may be in
some an affected Pride in the meaness of Apparel, and
in others,<note place="margin">Magnus qui fictilibus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, nec ille min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> under either neat or rich attire a very humble
unaffected mind, using it upon some of the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
engagements, or such like, and yet the heart not
at all upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis as sure as any of these, that real excess
and vanity in Apparel will creep in, and will always
willingly convey it self under the cloak of some of
these honest and lawful Considerations. This is a
prime peice of our hearts deceit, not only to hold out
fair Pretences to others, but to put the trick upon our
selves, to make our selves believe we are right, and
single minded, in those things wherein we are directly
seving our Lusts and feeding our own Vanity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To a sincere and humble Christian very
little, either dispute, or discourse in this will be needful;
a tender Conscience, and a Heart purg'd from Vanity,
and weaned from the World, will be sure to regulate
this, and all other things of this nature, after the safest
manner, and will be wary,</p>
                  <p>1. Of Lightness and fantastick garb in Apparel,
which is the very Bush or Sign hanging out, that
tells a vain Mind lodges within. 2. Of excessive
costliness, which both argues, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>eds the Pride of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104216:11"/>
Heart, and defrauds, if not others of their dues, yet
the poor of thy charity, which in God's sight, is a due
debt too, and far more comfort shall thou have on
thy death Bed, to remember such a time, in stead of
Lace on my own Cloaths, I helped a naked back to
cloathing. I abated somewhat of my former superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to supply the Poors necessities, sweeter this, than
to remember, that I could needlesly cast out many
pounds to serve my Pride, rather than give a penny to
relieve the Poor.</p>
                  <p>As conscientious Christians will not exceed in the
thing it self, so in as far as they use lawful Ornament
and Comeliness, they will do it without bestowing
much, either diligence or delight on the business.</p>
                  <p>To have the mind taken and pleas'd with such
things, is so foolish and childish a thing, that if most
might not find it in themselves, they would wonder at
many others, of years and common wit. And yet
truely,<note place="margin">Non bis pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri sed sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> 'tis a Disease that few escape, 'tis strange upon
how poor things Men and Women will be vain, and
think themselves some body; not only upon some
comeliness in their face or feature, which though poor,
yet is a part of themselves, but of things meerly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, that they are well lodged, or well mounted,
or well apparell'd, either richly, or well in fashion,
light empty minds, as bladders blown up with any
thing, and they that perceive not this in themselves,
are most drown'd; but such as have found it out, and
abhor their own follies, are still hunting and following
themselves in these, to beat them out of their hearts,
and to shame them from such fopperies. The Soul
fallen from God hath lost its true worth and beauty,
and therefore it basely descends to these mean things to
serve and dress the body, and take share with it of its
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104216:11"/>
unworthy borrow'd Ornaments, hath lost and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
God, and seeks not after him, knows not that he
is the alone Beauty, and Ornament of the Soul, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 32.
his Spirit, and the Graces of it, its rich attire, as here
particularly specified in one excellent Grace, and holds
true in the rest.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle doth indeed expresly on purpose check
and forbid vanity and excess in apparel, and excessive
delight in lawful decorum, but his prime end is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
this other Ornament of the Soul, <hi>The hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
man of the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis the thing the best Philosophy aim'd at, as some
of their choice men do express it, to reduce men, as much
as may be, from their Body to their Soul, but this is
the thing that true Religion alone doth effectually
and throughly, from the pampering and feeding of a
Morsel for the Worms to the nourishing of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
being infus'd into't, and directs it to the proper
nourishment of Souls, the Bread that came down from
Heaven, <hi>Io.</hi> 6. 27.</p>
                  <p>So here the Apostle, pulls off from Christian Women
their vain outside Ornaments: but is not this a wrong
to spoil all their dressing and fineness? No, he doth
but this, to send them to a better Wardrobe: there's
much profit in the change.</p>
                  <p>All the Gold and other riches of the Temple, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring
the Excellent Graces of Christians of Christ
indeed first, as having all fullness in himself, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
them: but secondarily of Christians, as the
living Temples of God, so the Church all glorious, but
within: and the embroidery, the variety of Graces, the
lively colours of other Graces shining best on the dark
ground of Humility. Christ delights to give much
Ornament to his Church, commends what she hath, and
adds more, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 10. 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:104216:12"/>
The particular Grace he recommends is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suitable to his subject in hand, the conjugal duty of
Wives, nothing so decoring their whole carriage as this
meekness and quietness of Spirit, but it is withal the
comeliness of every Christian in every estate, 'tis not
a Womans Garment or Ornament improper for Men,
there is somewhat (as I may say) of a particular cut or
fashion of it for Wives towards their Husbands, and in
their domestick Affairs, but Men, all Men ought to
wear of the same stuff, yea so to speak of the same
piece, for it is in all one and the same Spirit, fits the
stoutest and greatest Commanders. <hi>Moses</hi> a great
General, and yet no less great in this Virtue, <hi>the meekest
Man on Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing more uncomely in a Wife than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed,
turbulent Spirit, that is put out of frame
with every trifle, and inventive of false causes of
disquietness and fretting to it self. And so of a Husband,
and of all, an unquiet passionate Mind lays it self na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and discovers its own deformity to all. The
greatest part of things that vex us, are not from their
Nature or weight,<note place="margin">Nulla nos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

How comely is it to see a composed firm Mind and
Carriage that is not lightly moved.</p>
                  <p>I urge not a Stoical stupidness: but that in things
that deserve sharp reproof, the Mind keep in its own
Station and Seat still, not shaken out of it self, as the most
are; that the Tongue utter not unseemly rash words,
nor the Hand act any thing that discovers the mind
hath lost its command for the time; but truly the most
know so ill how to use just anger, upon just cause, that
it is easier, and the safer extream, not to be angry, but
still calm and serene, as the upper Region, not the
place of continual tempest, and storms, as the most are:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104216:12"/>
let it pass for a kind of sheepishness to be meek, 'tis
a likeness to him that <hi>was a Sheep before the shear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
not opening his Mouth,</hi> 'tis a Portion of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle commends his exchange of Ornaments
from two things. 1. Incorruptible, and therefore fits an
incorruptible Soul. Your varieties of Jewels and Rich
Apparel are perishing things, you shall one day see an
heap made of all, and that all on a slame; and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to you, they perish sooner, when death strips
you of your nearest Garment, your flesh, all the other
that were but loose upper Garments above it, must off
too, it gets indeed a covering to the Grave, but the
Soul is left stark naked, if no other Cloathing be provided
for it, for the Body was but borrowed; then it is denuded of
all. But spiritual Ornaments, and this here amongst them,
remain, and are incorruptible, they neither wear out,
nor out of fashion, but are still the better for the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and shall last Eternity, and shine there in full
lustre.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>2dly,</hi> because the opinion of others is much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in matter of Apparel, and 'tis most for that we use Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
in it, he tells us of the account of this, Men
think it poor and mean, nothing more expos'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
than the Spirit of Meekness, mere folly with
Men, that's no matter, this overweighs all their disesteem,
<hi>'tis with God of great price,</hi> and things are indeed as he
values them, and no otherways. Tho' it be not the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
fashion yet it is the fashion at Court, yea 'tis the Kings
own fashion, <hi>Matth. 11. 29. Learn of me for I am meek and
lowly,</hi> &amp;c. Some that are Court-bred will send for the
Masters of fashions tho' they live not in the Court;
and tho' the Peasants think them strange dresses, yet
they regard not that, but use them as finest and best:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104216:13"/>
Care not what the World say. You are not to stay
long with them, desire to have both fashions and stuff
from Court, from Heaven, this Spirit of meekness, and
it shall be sent you, 'tis never right in any thing with
us till we attain to this, to tread on the opinion of Men,
and eye nothing but Gods approbation.</p>

right way to use the Scriptures is to regulate our manners

for this end it is that a great part of it is historical.
There is not in the Saints a transmigration of Souls,
but there is, so to speak, an oneness of Souls, being
in all Ages partakers of the self same Spirit, hence
the Daughters of <hi>Sarah</hi> are called pious and obedient

himself: but hiding them both from others, and his

it self requires, that is to the wise rectifying of them

And to this, the reasons indeed sute well: it seems at first a

this kind of honour, not of reverence as Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
for that is their part, but such an esteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
without which indeed love cannot consist, for
we cannot love that which we do not in some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

and slighted, even because weaker, for of all injuries
contempt is one of the smartingest, and most sensible,<note place="margin">Omne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rÃ¢ querelum.</note>

the least touches of this, whereas greater Spirits are a

it, and tho' not all, yet some Wives may be
of a stronger Mind and Judgment than the Husbands,
yet those rules respect the general condition of the
Sexes, and speak of it so, as ordinarily weaker.</p>

in this, that the Woman is not called simply

yet is weak too, for both are Vessels of Earth, and

Christians the necessary and frequent use of this, takes
it for granted, that the Heir of Life cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prayer, this is the proper breathing and language
of these Heirs, none of them dumb, they can all speak,
these Heirs if they be alone, they pray alone, if Heirs
together, and living together, they pray together.
Can the Husband and Wife have that love, and
wisdom, and meekness that may make their life hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and that blessing that may make their Affairs suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful,
while they neglect God the only giver of these
and all good things? You think these needless motives,
but you cannot think how it would sweeten your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
if it were used. 'Tis prayer that sanctifies, and
seasons, and blesses all, and not enough that they pray
when with the Family; but even Husband and Wife
together by themselves, and with their Children, that
they, especially the Mother, as being most with them
in their Child-hood, when they begin to be capable,
may draw them apart, and offer them to God, often
praying with them, and instructing them in their
youth, for they are pliable while young, as glass when
hot, but after sooner break than bend.</p>
                  <p>But above all, Prayer is necessary as they are Heirs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104216:16"/>
of Heaven, often sending up their desires thither. You
that are not much in prayer, look as if you look'd for
no more than what you have here, if you had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
and Treasure above, would not your heart
delight to be there? Thus the Heart of a Christian is in
the constant frame of it, but after a special manner
Prayer raises the Soul above the World and sets it in
Heaven: 'tis its near access unto God, and dealing with
him especially about those Affairs that concern that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
Now in this lies a great part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
a Christian can have here, and the Apostle knew
this, that he would gain any thing at their hands, that
he press'd by this Argument, that otherwise they would
be hinder'd in their prayers. He knew that they who
are acquainted with prayer find such unspeakable sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in it, that they will rather do any thing than be
prejudic'd in that.</p>
                  <p>Now the breach of conjugal Love, the jarrs and
contentions of Husband and Wife, do out of doubt so
leaven and imbitter their Spirits, that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
unfit for Prayer, which is the sweet Harmony
of the Soul in God's ears, and when the Soul is so far
out of tune as those distempers make it, he cannot but
perceive it, whose ear is the most exact of all, for he
made and tun'd the Ear, and is the Fountain of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:
it cuts the sinews and strength of Prayer, makes
breaches and gaps, as wounds, at which the spirits fly
out, as the cutting of a vein, by which, as they speak,
it bleeds to death. When the Soul is calm and compos'd,
it may behold the Face of God shining on it; and they
that pray together, should not only have hearts in tune
within themselves in their own frame, but tun'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
especially Husband and Wife that are one, they
should have hearts consorted and sweetly tun'd to each

Judgment, but it extends likewise to Affection and
Action, especially in so far as they relate to, and depend
upon the other. And so, I conceive, it comprehends in
its full latitude, an harmony and agreement of minds
and affections, and carriage in Christians; as making
up one body, and a serious study of preserving and
increasing that agreement in all things; but especially
in spiritual things, in which their Communion doth
primely consist. And because in this, the consent of
their Judgments in matters of Religion is a prime point;

                  <p>1. 'Tis not a careless indifferency concerning
those things, not to be troubled about them at all,
nor to make any judgment concerning them; this
is not a loving agreement arising from oneness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

Religion in their Heads, and no Life of Religion in
their Hearts, fall into a conceit that all is but juggling,

concern Faith and Religion: and withal to use all due
means for the fullest consent and agreement in them

Synods, as the fittest and effectuallest way to this Unity,
should endeavour to bring the Church to the fullest
agreement that may be, yet they should beware, least
the straining it too high in all things, rather break it,
and an over diligence in appointing Uniformities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them further from it; leaving a latitude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency

preserver of Peace and Unity. But this by the way.

which cannot be found in any two alike in all things.</p>
                  <p>And these things would be of easier perswasion, if

the strength of Christian Charity, that if it dwelt
much in our hearts, would preserve this Union of Mind,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104216:20"/>
amidst very many different thoughts, such as they may
be, and would teach us that Excellent Lesson, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
gives to this purpose, <hi>Phil 3. 15, 16. Let us
therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if
in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
this unto you. Nevertheless, whereto we have already
attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the
same thing.</hi> Let us follow our Lord unanimously, in
what he hath clearly manifested to us, and given us
with one consent to embrace, as the Spheres, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
each one hath his particular motion, yet all
are wheel'd about together with the first.</p>
                  <p>And that leads us to consider the further extent of
this word, to agree in Heart and in Conversation,
walking by the Rule of those undoubted Truths we
have receiv'd. And in this I shall recommend these
two things to you.</p>
                  <p>1. In the defence of the Truth, as the Lord shall call
us, let us be of one Mind<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and all as one Man, Satan acts
by that Maxime and his Followers have it all, <hi>divide
and conquer,</hi> and therefore let us hold that counter Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime
<hi>Vnion invincible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In the Practice of that Truth agree as one, let
your Conversation be uniform by being squared to that
one Rule, and in all Spiritual Exercises joyn as one,
be of one Heart and Mind: would not our Publick
Worship, think you, prove much more both comfortable
and profitable, if our hearts m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And in your private Society, seek unanimously your
own, and each anothers Spiritual Good, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
in your affairs and civil converse; but having
one heart and mind as Christians: to eat and drink to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

and below them, to discourse together of civil business, is

in that notion, as born again to Immortality, an

towards that, to put one another in mind of Heaven
and things that are Heavenly. And 'tis strange that
men that profess to be Christians, when they meet, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fill one anothers ears with Lies and prophane
Speeches, or with Vanities and Trifles: or at the best
with the Affairs of Earth, and not a word of those

then? Is there such a thing, think ye, as <hi>Communion of

think of it as you will, the Publick Ministry will profit
little any where, where a People or some part of them
are not thus one, and do not live together as of one

                  <p>Consider, 1. How the Wicked are one in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Designs and Practices, the Scales of Leviathan, as

Followers be one in him? They unite to undermine the
Peace of the Church, shall not the Godly joyn their
Prayers to countermine them?</p>
                  <p>2. There is in the Heart of all the Saints one Spirit,
how can they be but one, since they have the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and journey, tend to the same home, and why
shall they not walk together in that way? When they
shall arrive there they shall be fully one, and of one

                     <hi>Having Compassion</hi>] This testifies that 'tis not a bare
speculative agreement of opinions, that is the badge
of Christian Unity, for this may accidentally be,
where there is no further Union; but that they are
themselves one, have one life, in that they feel how it
is one with another, there is a living sympathy amongst
them, as making up one Body, animated with one
Spirit, for that's the reason why the Members of the
Body have that mutual feeling even the remotest and
distantest, and the most excellent with the meanest,
this the Apostle urges at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4. and
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>And this lively Sense is in every living Member of the
Body of Christ, towards the whole, and towards each
other particular part. This makes a Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the welfare and good of another, as if it
were his own, and feel their griefs and distresses as
if himself were really sharer in them, for the word
comprehends all feeling, together feeling of j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

well as of grief, <hi>Heb. 13. 3. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 26. And
always where there is most of Grace, and of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Jesus Christ, there is most of this Sympathy.
The Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was eminent in all Grace,
had a large Portion of this, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 11. 29. And if
this ought to be in reference to their outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
much more in spiritual things, rejoycing at the
increases and flourishing of Grace in others. That base
envy, that dwells in the hearts of rotten Hypocrites,
that would have all ingross'd to themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they move not further than the compass of <hi>self,</hi>
that the pure love of God, and the sincere love of
their Brethren flowing from it, is not in them; but
when the heart can unfeigne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

far out-shining their own, truly 'tis an evidence,
that what Grace such a one hath, is upright and good,
and that the law of Love is engraven in their hearts.
And where that is, there will be likewise on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
a compassionate tender sense of the infirmities and
frailties of their Brethren. Whereas some accou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And thus to go on in a Censor-like-magisterial strain;
it were truly an evidence of more Grace, not to get

more than it self in present, but even to after Times
and Ages, and can rejoyce in the good to come, when
it self shall not be here to partake of it, is more dilated
and liker unto God, and to our head <hi>Iesus Christ. The
Lord,</hi> says the Prophet <hi>Esay, in all his peoples affliction,
was afflicted himself;</hi> and Jesus Christ accounts the
sufferings of his Body the Church his own. <hi>Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me?</hi> the heel was trod upon on earth
and the head cryeth from Heaven, as sensible of it,
and this in all our evils, especially our spiritual Griefs, is
a high point of comfort to us, that our Lord Jesus is not
insensible of them: This emboldens us to complain our
selves, and to put in our petitions for help to the Throne
of Grace through his hand, knowing that when he
presents he will speak his own sense of our condition, and
move for us as it were for himself, as we have it sweetly
express'd <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. 16. Now as it is our comfort
so it is our pattern.</p>

                     </gap>, Love is the cause of union, and union the
cause of sympathy, and of that unanimity before, they
that have the same spirit uniting and animating them,
cannot but have the same Mind, and the same feelings.
And this Spirit is derived from that head Christ, <hi>in whom</hi>
Christians <hi>live, and move, and have their being,</hi> their new
and excellent being, and so in living in him they love
him, and are one in him, they are Brethren, as here
the word is, their fraternity holds in him; he is head

of it, <hi>the first born among many Brethren.</hi> Men are Bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren
in two natural respects, their Bodies of the same
earth, and their Souls breathed from the same God;
but this third fraternity that is founded in Christ, is
far more excellent, and more firm than the other two;
for being one in him they have there taken in the other
two, for that in him is our whole Nature, he is the
<hi>Man Christ Iesus,</hi> but to the advantage, and 'tis an
infinite one, being one in him, we are united by the
Divine Nature in him, who is God blessed for ever;
and this is the highest certainly, and the strongest union
that can be imagin'd. Now this is a great Mystery
indeed, as the Apostle says, speaking of this same
point, the union of Christ and his Church; whence
their union and Communion one with another, that
make up that Body, the Church, is deriv'd. In Christ
every believer is born of God, is his Son, and so they
are not only Brethren, one with another, that are so
born: but Christ himself own's them as his Brethren,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 11.</note>

it is the burden and main strain, the great request, he

                  <p>So that certainly where this is, it is the ground
work of another kind of Friendship and love, than
the World is acquainted with, or is able to judge of,
and hath more worth in one drachme of it, than all the
quintessence of civil or natural assection can amount
to. The friendship of the World, the best of them, are
but tyed with chains of glass, but this fraternal love
of Christians, is a Golden chain, both more precious,
and more strong and lasting: the other are worthless
and brittle.</p>
                  <p>The Christian ows and pays a General Charity, and
good will to all; but peculiar and intimate friendship
he cannot have, but with such as come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of this fraternal love. Which after a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
flows from God, and returns to him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides
in him, and shall remain unto eternity.</p>

But many that are called Christians are not indeed
of this Brotherhood, and therefore no wonder they
know not what this love means, but are either of rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
unquiet Spirits, biting and devouring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the Apostle speaks, or at the best, only civilly
smooth and peaceable in their carriage, but rather scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
than partakers of this spiritual love and fraternity,
are strangers to Christ, not brought into acquaintance
and union with him, and therefore void of the life of
Grace, and the fruits of it, whereof this is a chief one.
Oh! how few amongst multitudes that throng in as we
do here together, are indeed partakers of the <hi>glorious
liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> or ambitious of that high and
happy estate.</p>
                  <p>As for you that know these things, and have a
portion in them, that have your communion with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his Son Jesus Christ, I beseech you adorn
your holy profession, and testifie you selves the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
and the Brethren of Jesus Christ by this mutual
love, seek to understand better what it is, and to know
it more practically. Consider that sourse of love, that
love that the Father hath shewed us in this, that we
should be called the Sons of God and so be Brethren,
and thence draw more of this sweet stream of love.
<hi>God is love,</hi> says the Apostle, therefore sure where
there is most of God, there is most of this Divine Grace,
this holy love. Look upon and study much that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
love of God, and his Son Jesus Christ towards us,
he gave his only begotten Son, the Son gave himself,
he sweeten'd his bitter cup with his tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and this he hath recommended to us, that even as he
loved us, so should we love one another: we know we
cannot reach this highest pattern, that's not meant, but
the more we look on it, the higher we shall reach in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104216:25"/>
this love, and shall learn some measure of such love on
Earth as is in Heaven, and that which so begins here
shall be perfected there.</p>

under Ground so that themselves are not seen, but they
appear in their Branches, and Flowers, and Fruits,
which argue there is a Root and Life in them; thus the
Graces of the Spirit planted in the Soul, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
invisible, yet discover their Being and Life in the
Tract of a Christian's Life, their Words, and Actions,
and the frame of their carriage; thus Faith shews that
it lives, as the Apostle St. <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth at large, and
thus Love, a Grace of so active a nature, that it is still
working and yet never weary, <hi>your labour of love,</hi> says
the Apostle; it labours, but delight makes the hardest
labour sweet and easie, and so proper is action to it,
that all action is null without it, <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 13. yea it knits
Faith and Action together, is the link that unites them,
<hi>Faith worketh;</hi> but 'tis by it, as the Apostle teaches
us, <hi>by Love,</hi> so then where this Root is, these Fruits
will spring from it and discover it, <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are of a larger extent in their full Sphere than
the precedcing, for from a general love due to all,
they act towards all, to men, or humanity, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
And this not from a bare natural tenderness, which
softer complexions may have, nor from a prudent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
consideration of their own possible falling under the
like, or greater calamities: but out of obedience to God,
who requires this mercifulness in all his Children, and
cannot own them for his, unless in this they resemble
him. And it is indeed an evidence of a truly Christian
mind, to have much of this pity to the miseries of all,
being rightly principled, and acting after a Pious and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104216:25"/>
Christian manner towards the Sick and Poor, of what
condition soever, yea most pitying the spiritual misery
of ungodly men, their hardness of heart, and unbelief,
and earnestly wishing their conversion, not repining
at the long-suffering of God, as if thou would'st have
the Bridge out, because thou art over, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi>
speaks, but longing rather to see that long-suffering
and goodness of God lead them to repentance, being
griev'd to see men ruining themselves, and diligently
working their own destruction, <hi>going in any way of
wickedness,</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of one particularly) <hi>as an Ox
to the Shambles or a Fool to the correction of the Stocks.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the ungodly Man is an object of the highest pity.</p>
                  <p>But there is a special debt of this pity to those that
we love as Brethren in our Lord Jesus, these are most
closely linkt by a peculiar fraternal love. Their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and calamities will move the Bowels that have
Christian affection within them. Nor is it an empty
helpless pity; but carries with it the real communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our help to our utmost power. [<gap reason="foreign">

Not only Bowels that are moved themselves with
pity, but that move their hand to succour for
by this word the natural affection of Parents, and
the tenderer of them, the Mother, are express'd, who
do not idly behold and be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sick or distress'd, but provides all possible help, their
bowels are not only stirr'd, but dilated and enlarged
towards them.</p>
                  <p>And if our feeling bowels and helping hand are due
to all, and particularly to the Godly, and we ought
to pay this due in outward distresses, how much more
in their Soul-afflictions, the rather, because these are
most heavy in themselves, and least understood, and
theref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104216:26"/>
Friends, possibly by their bitter scoffes and taunts,
or by their flighting, or at best by their misapplying
of proper helps and remedies, which as unfit Medicines
do rather exasperate the Disease: therefore they that
do understand, and can be sensible of that kind of
wound, ought so much the more to be tender and pitiful
towards it, and to deal mercifully and gently with it.
It may be very weak things sometimes trouble a weak
Christian, but there is in the Spirit of the Godly a
humble condescention learn'd from Christ, who <hi>broke
not the bruised reed, nor quenched the smoaking flax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The least difficulties and scruples in a tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
should not be roughly encounter'd, they are as a
knot in a silken thread, and require a gentle and wary
hand to loose them.</p>
                  <p>Now this tenderness of bowels, and inclinement to pity
all, especially Christians, and them especially in their
peculiar pressures, is not a weakness as some kind of
Spirits take it to be, this even naturally is a generous
pity in greatest Spirits. Christian pity is not womanish,
yea 'tis more than manly, 'tis divine, there is of it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
most in the best, and most ingenuous natures;
but where 'tis spiritual, 'tis a prime lineament of the
image of God, and the more absolute and disengag'd it
is, in regard of those towards whom it acts, the more
like unto God, looking upon misery as a sufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive
of pity and mercy, without the ingredient of
any other consideration: 'Tis a pure vulgar piece of
goodness to be helpful and bountiful to Friends, or to
such as are within appearance of requital, 'tis a trading
kind of Commerce that: but pity and bounty that
needs no inducements, but the meeting of a fit Object
to work on, where it can expect nothing, save only the
priviledge of doing good, (which in it self is so sweet)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104216:26"/>
is God-like indeed, who is rich in bounty without any
necessity, yea or possibility of return from us; for we
have neither any thing to confer upon him, nor hath
he need of receiving any thing, who is the spring
of Goodness and of Being.</p>
                  <p>And that we may the better understand him in this,
he is pleas'd to express this merciful nature in our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and language, by <hi>bowels of mercy and pity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Is. 54. 7, 8. Hos. 11. 8.</note> and the
<hi>stirring</hi> and <hi>sounding</hi> of them, and <hi>Ps. 103. The pity of

significant enough to express his compassions. Hence
our Redemptions, <hi>Is</hi> 63. 9. hence all our hopes of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
The gracious Lord saw his poor Creatures undone
by sin, and no power in Heaven nor in Earth able
to rescue but his own alone; therefore his pity was
moved, and his hand answers his heart, his own arm
brought Salvation, he sent <hi>the Deliverer out of Sion, to
turn away iniquity from Iacob.</hi> And in all exigences of
his Children, he is overcome with their Complaints,
cannot hold out against their moanings, he may as
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> seem strange for a while, but cannot act that
strangeness long, his heart moves and sounds to theirs,
gives the Eccho to their Griess and Groans, as they say
of two strings that are perfect Unisons, touch the one
the other also sounds, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 19. Oh the unspeakable
priviledge to have him for our Father, who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Mercies and Compassions, and those not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
fruitless pityings, for he is withal <hi>the God of all
consolations,</hi> do not think that he can shut out a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul that comes to him, and refuse to take, and to
bind up, and heal a broken heart that offers it self to him,
puts it self into his hand, and intreats his help, doth
he require pity of us, and doth he give it to us, and
is it not infinitely more in himself? all that is in

Angels and Men is but an insensible drop to that
Ocean.</p>
                  <p>Let us then consider both that we are oblig'd to pity
especially to our Christian Brethren, and to use all
means for their help within our reach, to have bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
stirr'd with the reports of such bloodsheds and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
as come to our ears, and to bestir our selves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Places and Power for them, but sure all
are to move this one way, for their help, to run to the
Throne of Grace: if your bowels sound for your
Brethren, let them sound that way for them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
their estate to him that hath highest, both pity
and power; for he expects to be rememoranced by
us, he put that office upon his People to be his Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

of iniquity, yet this is our universal guiltiness towards
God, he multiplying mercies and we vying with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd
sins, as the Lord complains of <hi>Israel, as they
were increased, so they sinned.</hi> The lowest step of good
mutual amongst Men, is not to be bent to provoke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with injuries, and being unoffended to offend none,
but this, not to repay offences, nor <hi>render evil for evil</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:104216:29"/>
is a Christians rule, and yet further to return <hi>good</hi> for
<hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>blessing</hi> for <hi>cursing,</hi> is not only counsell'd
(as some vainly distinguish) but commanded.</p>
                  <p>It is true the most have no ambition for this degree
of goodness; aspire no further but to do or say
no evil unprovoked, and think themselves sufficiently
just and equitable if they keep in that; but this is
lame, is but half the rule. Thou thinkest injury obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thee, or if not so, yet excuses thee to revenge, or
at least disobliges thee, unties thy engagement of wishing
and doing good; but these are all gross practical errours.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>1st.</hi> The second injury done by way of revenge
differs from the first that provoked it little or nothing,
but only in point of time, and certainly no one Man's
sin can procure priviledge to another to sin in that,
or the like kind. If another hath broken the bonds of
his allegiance and Obedience to God, and of charity to
thee, yet thou art not the less ty'd by the same Bonds still.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> By revenge of injuries thou usurpest upon
God's prerogative who is the <hi>Avenger,</hi> as the Apostle
teaches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. this doth not forbid either the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats
Sword for just punishment of Offenders, or the
Souldiers Sword in a just War; but such revenges, as
without authority or a lawfull call, the pride and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness
of Men do multiply one against another: In
which is involv'd a presumptuous contempt of God, and
his supreme authority, or at least the unbelief and
neglect of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> It cannot be genuine upright goodness
that hath its dependance upon the goodness of others
that are about us; that as they say of the vain glorious
Man, his vertue lyeth in the beholders eye, if thy
Meekness and Charity be such as lyeth in the good and
mild carriage of others towards <hi>thee,</hi> in their Hand
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104216:29"/>
and Tongues, thou art not owner of it intrinsecally:
such quiet and calm, if none provoke thee, is but an
accidental uncertain cessation of thy turbulent Spirit
unstirr'd, but move it and it acts it self according to
it self, sends up that Mind that lay at the bottom;
but true Grace doth then most manifest what it is,
when those things that are most contrary surround and
assault it; it cannot correspond and hold game with
injuries and raylings, hath no faculty for that, for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
evil with evil, a Tongue enur'd to gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and mild Speeches and Blessings, and a heart
stor'd so within can vent no other, try it, and stir it
as you will. A Christian acts and speaks not according to
what others are towards him, but according to what he
is through the grace and Spirit of God in him, as they
say, <hi>quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis</hi> the
same things are differently received and work differently
as the Nature and way is of that which receives them:
A sparkle blows up one of a sulphureous temper;
and many Coals, greater injuries, and reproaches are
quench'd and loose their force being thrown at another
of a Cool Spirit <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 27.</p>
                  <p>They that have malice, and bitterness, and cursings
within, though these sleep it may be, yet awake them
with the like, and the Provision comes forth out of the
abundance of the heart; give them an ill word and they
have another, or two for one in readiness for you; where
the Soul is furnished with spiritual blessings there blessings,
come forth even in answer to reproaches and indignities,
<hi>the mouth of the Wise is a Tree of Life,</hi> says <hi>Solomon,</hi>
can bear no other fruit, but according to its kind, and
the Nature of the root, an honest spiritual heart,
pluck at it who will, they can pull no other fruit
but such fruit. Love and Meekness lodge there, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104216:30"/>
therefore whosoever knocks, these make the answer.</p>
                  <p>Let the World account it a despicable simplicity,
seek you still more of that Dove-like Spirit, the Spirit
of meekness and blessing, a poor glory to vie railings
and contest in that faculty or any kind of vindictive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of evil; the most abject creatures have of that
great Spirit, as follish poor Spirited persons account it;
but it is the glory of Man to pass by a transgression,
the noblest victory, and, as we mention'd, the highest
example. God is our Pattern in Love and Compassions,
we are well warranted to do't in this. Men esteem
much more of some other vertues that make more shew,
and trample upon these, Love, and Compassion, and
Meekness: but though these violet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are <hi>as the smell of a Field that the Lord hath blessed,</hi>
as old <hi>Iacob</hi> said of his Son's Garments. The Lord
having spoke pardon to a Soul, and instead of the curse
due to sin, bless'd it with a title to glory; it easily and
readily speaks pardon, and not only pardon, but blessing
to the advantage, even to these that outrage it most and
deserve worst of it; reflects still on that, Oh! what

they to be enter'd into it by that joyful speech, <hi>come ye
blessed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Men can but bless one another in good wishes and

may be turned out of all his quiet possessions and easie
dwelling before that; (and in these times we may the
more readily think of this) but at the utmost at night,
when he should be for most rest, when that sad night
comes after this day of fairest prosperity, the unbeleiving
unrepenting sinner lies down in sorrow in a woful bed,

are treasures that neither Thief breaks into, nor is
there any inward moth to corrupt them; an inheritance
that tho' the whole World be turned upside down, is
in no hazard of a touch of damage, a Kingdom that not
only cannot sall, but cannot be shaken? Oh! be wise
and consider your latter end, and whatsoever you do,
look after this blessed inheritance, seek to have the
right to it in Jesus Christ, and the Evidences and Seals
of it from his Spirit, and if it be so with you, your
Hearts will be upon it and your lives will be like it.</p>

to recommend a Rule so exact, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

                  <p>The Rule is all of it one streight line running through
the whole Tract of a Godly Man's Life, yet you see
clearly that it is (not cut asunder indeed) but only
mark'd into four, whereof the two latter parcels are
somewhat longer, more generally reaching a man's
ways, the two former particularly regulating the
Tongue.</p>
                  <p>In the ten Words of the Law, that God delivered in,
so singular a manner both by Word and Writ from his
own mouth and hand, there be two, that if not wholly,
yet most especially, and most expressly concerd the
Tongue, as a very considerable, though a small part of
man, and of these four words here two are bestow'd on't.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle St. <hi>Iames</hi> is large in this, teaching the great
Concernment of this point, <hi>'tis a little member</hi> (says he)

                     <hi>but boasteth great things,</hi> needs a strong Bridle; and
than the bridling of it makes much for the ruling the
whole Course of a Man's Life, as he there applies the
resemblance; yea he gives the skill of this as the very
Character of perfection. And if we consider it, it must
be of very great consequence how we use that Tongue
being the main outlet of the thoughts of the heart, and
the means of Society amongst men in all Affairs Civil
and Spiritual; by which men give birth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of their own minds and seek to beget the like
in the minds of others. The bit that is here made for mens
mouths, hath these two halfs that make it up. 1. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain

guileful speaking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From Evil.</hi>] This is a large Field, the Evil of the
Tongue, but I give it too narrow a name, we have
good warrant to give it a much larger, a whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
<hi>a World of Iniquity,</hi> a vast bulk of Evils, and
great variety of them, as of Countries on the Earth, or
Creatures in the World, and multitudes of such are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
and full of deadly poyson, and not few Monsters,
new productions of wickedness, <hi>semper aliquid novi,</hi> as
they say of <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be in the daily discourses of the greatest part
many things that belong to this World of Evil, and yet
pass unsuspected, that we do not think them to be
within its compass, not using due diligence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
in our discoveries of the several parts of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
'tis all within our selves, yea within a small part
of our selves, our Tongues.</p>
                  <p>It were too quick a fancy to think to travel over
this World of Iniquity, the whole circuit of it, in an
hour, yea or so much as to aim exactly at all the parts
that can be taken of it in the smallest Map: but some
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104216:33"/>
of the chief we would particularly take notice of, in
the several four parts of it, for it will without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
hold resemblance in that division with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet habitable World.</p>
                  <p>I. Prophane Speech, that which is grossly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
wicked, and in that part. 1. Impious Speeches
that directly reflect upon the glory and name of God,
Blasphemies, and Oaths, and Cursings, of which so
great, so lamentable abundance amongst us, the whole
Land overspread and defiled with it, the common noise
that meets a man in Streets, and Houses, and almost
all places where he comes: and to these, joyn those
that are not scant amongst us neither, scoffs and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Religion, the power and strictness of it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the grosser sort, but by pretenders to some kind
of goodness, for they that have attained to a self-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
pitch of Civility or formal Religion, have usually
that point of presumption with it, that they make
their own size the model and rule to examine all by;
what is below it they condemn indeed, as prophane;
but what is beyond it they account needless and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
preciseness: and therefore are as ready as others
to let fly invectives or bitter taunts against it, which
are the keen and poysoned shafts of the Tongue, and
a persecution that shall be called to a strick account.
2. Impure or filthy speaking which either pollutes or
offends those that hear them, and are the noisom breath
of a rotten polluted heart.</p>
                  <p>II. Consider next as another grand part of the
Tongue, uncharitable Speeches tending to the defam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and disgrace of others, and these are likewise of two
sorts. 1. Open rayling and reproaches. 2. Secret
slander and detraction. The former is unjust and
cruel, but it is somewhat the less dangerous because
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104216:34"/>
open, 'tis a fight in plain field; but truly no piece of
a Christian's warfare to encounter it in the same kind,
the Sons of Peace are not for those Tongue-Combats,
they are often no doubt set upon so, but they have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abler way of overcoming it, than by the use of
the same Weapon, for they break and blunt the point
of ill reproaches by meekness, and triumph over cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
with more abundant blessing, as is in the former
words, which are seconded with these out of the
<hi>Psalm.</hi> 34. 13, 14. But they that enter the lists in this
kind, and are provided one for another with onraged
minds, are usually not unprovided of weapons, lay
hold on any thing comes next,<note place="margin">Furor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>

their quarrels in their Cups and Pots, if they have any
other great Reproach, they lay about them with that,
as their Sword; but if they want that, true or untrue,
pertinent or impertinent, all is one, they cast out any
revilings that come next to hand: but there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wickedness, but something of baseness in these kind
of conflicts that makes them more abound amongst
the baser sort, and not so frequent with such as are
but of a more civil breeding and quality than the
vulgar.</p>
                  <p>But the other of Detraction is more universal amongst
all sorts, as being a far easier way of mischief in this
kind, and of better conveyance. Raylings cry out
the matter openly, but Detraction works all by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
and Stratagem, and mines under Ground, and
therefore is much more pernicious. The former are,
as the Arrows that fly by day, but this, as the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
that walketh in darkness, as these two are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
together in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> it spreads and infects se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and insensibly, is not felt but in the effects of
it; and it works either by calumnies altogether forged
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104216:34"/>
and untrue, of which malice is inventive, or by the
advantage of real faults (of which it is very discerning)
and are stretch'd and aggravated to the utmost, and
'tis not expressible, how deep a wound a Tongue
sharpen'd to this work will give with a very little
word and little noise, as a Rasor, as it is called in the
<hi>Psalm,</hi> that with a small touch cuts very deep; taking
things by the worse, whereas Charity will try about
all ways for a good acceptation and sense of things, and
takes all in be best. This Pest is still killing some
almost in all Companies, many wounded as it's said of
the strange Woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. and they convey it under fair
prefacing of commendation, so giving them poyson in
wine, both that it may pass the better, and penetrate
the more. This is a great sin, that the Lord ranks
with the first, when he sets them in order against a
Man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.</p>
                  <p>III. Vain fruitless Speeches are an Evil of the Tongue,
not only those they call harmless lies, which some
poor people take a pleasure in, and trade much in, light
buffoonries and foolish jestings, but the greatest part of
those Discourses which Men account the blameless En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
one of another, come under compass of
this Evil, forthy, unsavory stuff, tending to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
nor good at all.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>
                     </note> Effectless Words as our
Saviour speaks, of which we must render account: for
that very reason they are in this World of evil in the
Tongue, if no other way ill, yet ill as the <hi>Arabian</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
and barren Sands, fruitless.</p>
                  <p>IV. Doubleness and Guile, so great apart, that 'tis
here particularly nam'd apart, though the Evil of it
is less known and discern'd, and so there is in it, as I
may say, much <hi>terra incognita,</hi> yet it is of a very
large compass, we may confidently say, as large as all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104216:35"/>
the other three together. What of mens speech is not
manifestly evil in any of the other kinds, is the most
of it nought this way; speech good to appearance
plausible and fair, but not upright, not Silver, but Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dross, as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it, <hi>burning Lips,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 23.
Each almost some way or other speaking falshood and
deceit to his Neighbour, and daring to act this faculty
with God in his Services, and our protestations of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
religious Speeches abus'd by some in Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
as holy Vestments for a mask or disguise, doing
nothing but compassing him about with lies, as he
complains of <hi>Ephraim, Hos.</hi> 11. 12. deceiving indeed
our selves, while we think to deceive him, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deceived, and will not be mocked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 1.
He saw through the disguises and hypocrisie of his own
People, when they came to enquire at him, and yet
still entertain'd their Heart-Idols, as he tells the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>The sins of each of us, would we enter into a strict
account of our selves, would be found to arise to a
great Sum in this kind, and they that do put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon the work of Self-trial, find (no doubt) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
matter of deepest humbling, though they had
no more, even in the sin of their lips, and are by it
often astonish'd at the Lord's patience, considering his
Holiness, as <hi>Esay</hi> cried out, having seen the Lord in a
glorious Vision, this in particular falls upon his
thoughts concerning himself and the people, <hi>polluted
lips, woe is me,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed 'tis a thing the Godly
mind cannot be satisfied with, to make mention of the
Lord till they be touch'd with a Coal from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Fire of the Altar, and they especially that are
call'd to be the Lord's Messengers will say, as St. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
had the Prophet need of a Coal then to unpollute his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104216:35"/>
lips, then do Ministers require <hi>totum globum ig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>eum.</hi> Go
through the Land and see if the sins of this kind will
take up much of the Bill against us, which the Lord
seems now to have taken into his hands, and to be read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and about to take order with it, because we will
not: would we fall to read it, he would let it fall.
Is it not because of Oaths that the Land mourns, or
I am sure hath now high cause to mourn? mocking
at the power of Godliness, fly thick in most Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
and Societies. And what is there to be found
almost but mutual detractions and supplantings of the
good name of another, and Tongues taught to lies,
and that frame, or sow,<note place="margin">Ier. 9. 4.</note> and <hi>weave together deceits,</hi> as
'tis in the <hi>50 Psalm.</hi> And even the Godly as to other
sins, so may be under the degrees of this, and too many
are very much, by reason of their unwatchfulness and
not staying themselves in this point, though not to
prophane, yet to vain, and it may be to detractive
Speeches, sometimes possibly not with malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
but out of an inadvertence of this evil, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
to stick on the failings of men, and it may be of
other Christians, than to consider, and commend, and
follow what is laudable in them; and it may be in
their best Discourses, not endeavouring to have hearts
purg'd from all guile and self-ends as becomes. Oh!
'tis a thing needs much diligent study, and is worth it
all to be throughly sincere and unfeigned in all, and
particularly in those things. Our Saviour's innocence
is exprest so, <hi>In his mouth was found no guile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to add something for remedy of those evils in
some part discovered, for to vanquish the World of
Evils is a great Conquest.</p>
                  <p>1. It must begin at the heart, otherwise it will be
but a Mountebank cure, a false imagin'd conquest, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104216:36"/>
weights and wheels are there, and the Clock strikes
according to their motion; even he that speaks
contrary to what is within him, guilfully contrary to
his inward conviction and knowledge, yet speaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
to what is within him, in the temper and
frame of his heart, which is double, <hi>a heart and a heart,</hi>
as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> hath it. A guileful Heart makes guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tongue and Lips, it is the Work-house, where
is the Forge of Deceits and Slanders, and other Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakings:
and the Tongue only the outer shop where
they vent, and the Lips the Door of it; so then such
Ware as is made within, such and no other can be set
out; from evil thoughts, evil speakings, from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
heart, prophane words, and from a malicious
heart bitter or calumnious words, and from a deceitful
heart, guileful words well varnish'd, but lin'd with
rottenness. And so generally <hi>from the abundance of
the heart the mouth speaketh,</hi> (as our Saviour teaches.)
That which the heart is full of, runs over by the
Tongue, if the heart be full of God, the Tongue will
delight to speak of him; much of heavenly things
within will sweetly breath forth something of
their smell by the mouth; and if nothing but earth
there, all that man's discourse will have an earthly smell,
and if nothing but wind, vanity, and folly, the Speech
will be airy, and vain, and purposeless, <hi>Ps. 37 30, 31.
Ps.</hi> 40. 8, 9. in the midst of my bowels, and as from
the center thou sends forth the lines and rays of suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
words, and will not, cannot refrain, as there it is;
so no more can the evil heart refrain the Tongue from
evil, as here is directed. <hi>The Tongue of the Righteous,</hi>
says <hi>Solomon, is as fined silver, but the heart of the wicked
is little worth,</hi> makes the <hi>Antithesis</hi> in the root, his
heart little worth, and therefore his tongue, no silver
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104216:36"/>
in it: he may be worth thousands (as we speak) that is
indeed in his Chests or Lands, and yet himself, his heart,
and all the thoughts of it, not worth a penny.</p>
                  <p>If thou art inur'd to oaths or cursing, in any kind or
fashion of it, taking the great name of God any ways
in vain, do not favour thy self in it as a small offence;
to excuse it by custom, is to wash thy self with Ink, and
to accuse thy self deeper that thou art long practic'd
in that sin, but if thou would'st indeed be deliver'd from
it, think not that a flight dislike of it (when reprov'd)
will do, but seek for a due knowledge of the Majesty
of God, and thence a deep reverence of him in thy
heart, and that will certainly help that habituated
Evil of thy Tongue, will quite alter that bias that
the custom thou speakest of hath given it, will cast
it in a new Mould, and teach it a new Language, will
turn thy regardless abuse of that name, in vain Oaths
and Asseverations, into a holy frequent use of it in
Prayers and Praises: thou wilt not then dare to indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
that blessed name, that Saints and Angels bless
and adore, but will set in with them to bless it.</p>
                  <p>None that knows the weight of it, will dally with
it, and <hi>lightly lift it up</hi> (as that word of taking in vain
in the command signifies) they that do continue to
lift it up in vain, as it were, to sport themselves with
it, will find the weight of it falling back upon them
and crushing them to pieces.</p>
                  <p>In like manner a purified heart will unteach the
Tongue of all filthy impure speeches, and will give it
a holy strain, and the Spirit of Charity, and Humility
will banish that mischievous humour, that sits so deep
in the most, of reproaching and disgracing others in
any kind, either openly or secretly; for 'tis wicked
self-love, and pride of heart, whence those do spring
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104216:37"/>
searching and disclosing the failings of others, which
love will rather cast a Mantle on to hide them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis an argument of a candid ingenuous mind, to
delight in the good name and commendation of others,
to pass by their defects, and take notice of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and to speak and hear of these willingly, and not
endure either to speak or hear of the other; for in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a Man may be little less guilty, than the evil Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
in taking pleasure in it, tho' you speak it not. And
this is a piece of Men's natural perversness to drink in
tales and calumnies,<note place="margin">Obtrectatio &amp; livor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis auribus accipiuntur.</note> and he that doth this will readily
from the delight he hath in hearing slide insensibly into
the humour of evil speaking; and it is strange how the
most dispence with themselves in this point, and that
in no Societies almost shall we find a hatred of this ill,
but rather some touches of pleasingness in it, and until
a Christian set himself to an inward watchfulness over
his heart, not suffering in it any thought either of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charity,
or vain self esteem upon the sight of others
frailties, they will still be subject to somewhat of this
in the Tongue, or Ear at least. So for the evil of
guile in the Tongue, a sincere heart, <hi>truth in the inward
parts,</hi> that powerfully redresses, therefore <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 'tis
express'd, <hi>that speaketh the truth from his heart.</hi> Thence
it flows, seek much after this, to speak nothing with God,
nor Men, but what is the sense of a single unfeigned heart.
O sweet truth! excellent, but rare sincerity! He that
loves that truth within alone can work it; seek it of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Be choice in your society, sit not with vain
persons, whose Tongues have nothing else to utter
but impurity, or malice, or folly. Men readily learn
the dialect, and tone of the people amongst whom
they live. If you sit down in the chair of scorners;
take a seat with them, you shall readily take a share
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104216:37"/>
of their diet with them, and sitting amongst them take
your turn by time of speaking with them in their own
language: but frequent grave and Godly Persons in
whose hearts and lips, piety, and love, and Wisdom
are set and 'tis the way to learn it.</p>

childish delight, and yet most Men carry it with them,
all along to speak of Persons and things not concerning
us; and this draws Men to speak many things that
agree not with the rules of wisdom, and charity, and
sincerity, <hi>he that refraineth his Lips is wise,</hi> saith
<hi>Solomon.</hi> A Vessel without a cover cannot escape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,
and much might be avoided by a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining

bablings that are usual; and were it no worse, is it
not a sufficient evil, that they waste away that time,
precious time, that cannot be recover'd, that the most
just or most thankful Man in the World cannot restore.
He that spares speech, favours his Tongue indeed, as
the Latin Phrase is <hi>[favere Linguae]</hi> not he that looses
the reins and lets it run, he may ponder and pre-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what he utters, whether it be profitable and

Hebrew proverb is, <hi>a penny in an earthen pot keeps a
great sound and tinkling.</hi> Certainly 'tis the way to have
much inward peace, to be wary in this point. Men
think to have solace by much free unbounded discourse
with others, and when they have done, they find it
otherways and sometimes contrary. He is wise that
hath learn't to speak little with others, and much with
himself, and with God. How much might be gained
for our Souls, if we would make a right use of this
silence, so <hi>David</hi> dumb to Men, found his Tongue to
God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38, 13, 15. a spiritual minded Man is quickly
weary of other discourse, but of that which he loves
and wherewith his affection is possess'd and taken up,
<hi>grave aestimant quicquid illud non sonat quod intus amant,</hi>
and by experience a Christian will find it, that when
the Lord is pleas'd to shew him most favour at Prayer
or other spiritual exercise, how unsavoury it makes
other discourses after it; as they that have tasted
something singularly sweet, think other things less
sweet, altogether tasteless and unpleasant.</p>
                  <p>4. In the use of the Tongue when thou doest speak,
divert it from evil and guile by a habitude of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in profitable and gracious discourse; thus St. <hi>Paul</hi>
makes the Opposition, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. no rotten communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and yet not total silence neither, but such <hi>as
may edifie and minister grace to the hearers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in this we should consider, to the end such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses
may be more fruitful, both what is the true
end of them, and the right means suiting it, they are
not only nor principally for the learning of some new
things, or the canvasing of debated questions, but their
chief good, the warming of the heart, stirring up in
it love to God, and remembrance of our present and
after Estate, our mortality and immortality, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104216:38"/>
the ways of Holiness, and the Promises and
Comforts of the Gospel, and the Excellency of Jesus
Christ, and in these sometimes one particular, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another, as our particular condition requires:
or any occasion makes them pertinent, so that in those
discourses seek not so much either to vent thy Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or to increase it; as to know more spiritually,
and effectually what thou do'st know. And in this
way those mean despised Truths, that each one thinks
they are sufficiently seen in, will have a new sweetness
and use in them which thou didst not so well perceive
before, for these flowers cannot be suck'd dry, and
in this humble sincere way thou shalt grow in Grace
and in Knowledge too.</p>
                  <p>There is no sweeter entertainment than for Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to be remembring of their Country, their blessed
Home, and the Happiness abiding them there, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
and encouraging one another in the hopes of
it, strengthening their hearts against all the hard en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
and difficulties in the way often, often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
this moment, and helping each other to higher
apprehensions of that vision of God, which we expect.</p>
                  <p>And are not such Discourses much more worthy the
choosing, than the base trash we usually fill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ears withal. Were our Tongues given us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
folly and sin? or were they not fram'd for the
glorifying of God, and therefore are called, <hi>our Glory:</hi>
some take it for the Soul; but they must be one in
this, and then indeed are both our Tongues and Souls
truely our Glory, when they are busied in exalting his,
and are tun'd together to that, <hi>that my Glory may sing
praise to thee and not be silent, Ps.</hi> 30. 12. Instead of
calumnies, and lies, and vanities that are the carrion, that

that which is still flying further off from us, catching
at a vanishing shadow of delight, and nothing to
fasten upon but real guiltiness and misery. Childish

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104216:39"/>
Gen.</hi> 31. 7. expressing the unfaithfulness of his Unkle
that changed his ways so often) but still we foolishly
and madly trust it, when it makes so gross a lie that
we might easily, if we took it to the light, see through
it, being a lie so often discovered, and of known falshood;
yet some new dream or guise makes it pass with us
again, and we go round in that Mill, having our eyes
out, as <hi>Sampsen,</hi> and still where we were, perpetual
fruitless toil. Strange that so base deceitful lusts of sin,
should still keep their credit with us; but the Beast
hath a false Prophet at his side to commend him and set
him off with new Inventions, and causes us to err by his
lies, as it is said of the false Prophets, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. But
evil 'tis still, not only void of all good, but the very
deformity and debasement of the Soul desacing in it
the Divine Image of its Maker, and impressing on it
the vile Image of Satan; and then further, is attended
with shame and sorrow, even at the very best, 'tis a
sowing of the wind, no solid good in it, and withal a
reaping of the Whirlwind, vexations and horrors:
they that know it in the sense of this after-view at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with the wrath of an offended God, ask them
what they think of it, if they would not in those
thoughts rather chuse any trouble or pain tho great,

                  <p>Obedience is that good, that beauty and comeliness
of the Soul, that conformity with the holy will of God,
that hath peace and sweetness in it, the hardest of it
truly delighful even in present, and hereafter sully.
Would we learn to consider it thus, to know sin to
be the greatest Evil, and the holy will of God the highest
good, it would be easie to perswade and prevail much in
this, to eschew the one, and do the other.</p>
                  <p>These do not only reach the actions, but require an

intrinsecal aversion of the heart from sin, and propesionn
to holiness and love of it.</p>

turn'd from sin, and carried towards God; and this is
principally to be considered by us, and enquir'd after
within us, an abhorrence of sin, as the Scripture
speaks, not simple forbearing, but hating and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and this springing from the love of God. Ye
that love the Lord, hate Evil, you will do so, cannot
choose but do so, and so know that Love to him to be
upright and true.</p>
                  <p>And where this is, the avoidance of sin, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in holiness, doing good, will be, 1. More constant,
not wavering with the variation of outwards, of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or society, or secrecy, but going on in its natural
course, as the Sun is as far from the earth, and goes as
fast under a cloud as when 'tis in our sight, and goes

a renewed Mind. And, 2. More Universal, <hi>viz.</hi> of all
sin; as natural antipathies are against the whole kind
of any thing. 3. More exact, keeping a far off from
the very appearances of sin, and from all the induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and steps towards it, and this is the true way
of eschewing it.</p>

being beset with those Ordinances knows they last but a
while, and therefore it gets into its strength, and keeps

                  <p>They again miss in the right of this <hi>eschewing,</hi> that
think themselves possibly some Body in it, in that they
do avoid the gross sins wherein the vulgar sort of sinners
wallow, or do eschew such evils as they have little
or no inclination of nature to; but where the heart
stands against sin, as a breach of God's Law, and an
offence against His Majesty, as <hi>Ioseph, shall I do this
evil and sin against God?</hi> there it will carry against all
kind of sin, the most refined, and the most beloved sin,
wherein the Truth of this aversion is most try'd and
approv'd; as they that have a strong natural dislike of
some kind of meat, dress it as you will, and mingle it
with what they love best, yet will not willingly eat
of it, and if they be surpriz'd and deceiv'd some way
to swallow some of it, yet they will find it after, and
be restless till they have vomited it up again. Thus is it
with the heart, that hath that inward contrariety to
sin wrought in it by a new Nature, no reconcilement
with it, nor with any kind of it, as those deadly
Feuds that were against whole Families, and Names
without exception. <hi>No fellowship with the unfrui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our calling, that which is in our hand, and is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
requir'd of us. For in this some deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
look upon such a condition as they imagin were

not the high condition, but much fidelity, cures it,

to answer occasions when they call, but to catch at

doing good, whether in the Lord's immediate Service
delighting in that, private and publick, or to Men, in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting

what hinders but we apply our hearts to it,
this is our work, and setting aside the advantage
that follows, consider the thing in it self. 1. The
opposition of Sin and Obedience under the Name of
<hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> 2. The Composition of our rule in
these <hi>Eschew</hi> and <hi>do.</hi> Consider it thus <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>good</hi>
and it will perswade us to <hi>eschew</hi> and <hi>do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if perswaded to it, then. 1. Desire light from
above, to discover to you what is evil, and offensive to
God in any kind, and what pleaseth him, what is his
will: for that is the rule and reason of good in our
actions, <hi>that ye may prove what is the good, and holy, and
acceptable will of God.</hi> And to discover in your selves
what is most enemy, and repugnant to that will. 2. A
renew'd mind to hate that evil, the closest and most
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104216:42"/>
connatural to you, and to love that good, even that is
most contrary. 3. Strength and skill, that by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Spirit than your own you may avoid evil and do
good, and resist the incursions and sollicitings of evil,
the slights and violences of Satan, who is both a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and a Lyon; and Power against your own inward
corruption and the fallacies of your own heart. And
thus you shall be able for every good work, and be
kept in such a measure as suits your present estate,
<hi>blameless in Soul and Body to the coming of Iesus
Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh! but I am often entangled and plunged in
Soul-evils, and often frustrate in my Thoughts against
these evils, and aims at the good, which is my task.</p>
                  <p>And was not this <hi>Paul</hi>'s condition? may you not
complain in his Language, and happy if with some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his sense, happy in crying out of wretchedness
was not this his malady, <hi>when I would do good, evil is present
with me.</hi> But know once that tho' thy duty is this,
to eschew evil and do good, yet thy Salvation is surer
founded, than on thine own good; that perfection
that answers Justice and the Law is not required of thee,
thou art to walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit,
but in so walking, whether in a low or high measure,
still thy comfort lyeth in this, <hi>that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
to them that are in Christ Iesus.</hi> As the
Apostle begins the next <hi>Chapter</hi> after his sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
Again consider his thoughts in the close of the
same <hi>Chapter,</hi> perceiving the Work of God in him, and
differencing that from the corrupt notions of himself,
and so finding at once matter of heavy complaint, and
yet of cheerful exultation. <hi>O! wretched Man that I
am,</hi> and yet with the same Breath, <hi>thanks to God
through Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>

So then mourn with him, and yet rejoyce with
him, and go on with courage as he, still fighting
the good fight of Faith, when thou fallest in the mire
be asham'd and humbled, yet return and wash in the
Fountain open'd, and return and beg new strength to
walk more surely, learn to trust thy self less and God
more, and up and be doing against thine enemies, how
tall and mighty soever be the Sons of <hi>Anak.</hi> Be of
good courage, and the Lord shall be with thee, and

the Spring of Being and Goodness, the Wise and Just
Ruler of the World.</p>
                  <p>This the Psalmist, and here with him the Apostle,
gives as the true reason of that truth they have averr'd
in the former words, the connexion of Holyness and
Happyness. If Life, and peace, and all good be
in God's Hand to bestow when it pleaseth him, then
sure the way to it, is an obedient and regular walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
observance of his will; and the way of sin is the
way to ruin: <hi>for the Eyes of the Lord are upon the
righteous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And his Face against them that do
Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the words there's a double opposition; of persons,
and of their portion. 1. Persons. <hi>The Righteous</hi> and
<hi>Evil Doers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. These two words are usual in the Scriptures,
and particularly in the Book of Psalms, to express the
Godly, and Wicked, and so this righteousness is not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104216:45"/>
absolute perfection or sinlessness; nor the opposed evil,
doing every act of sin or breach of God's Law; but
the righteous be they, that are students of obedience
and holyness, that desire to walk as in the sight of
God, and to walk with God, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did; that are
glad when they can any way serve him, and griev'd
when they of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>end him; that feel and bewail their
unrighteousness, and are earnestly breathing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
forward, have a sincere and unfeigned Love
to all the Commandments of God, and a diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to observe them, that vehemently hate what
most pleases their corrupt Nature, and love the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that crosses it most; this is an imperfect kind
of perfection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 15.</p>
                  <p>On the otherside, Evil-doers, are they that commit
sin with greediness, that walk in it, make it their
way, that live in sin as their Element, <hi>take pleasure in
unrighteousness,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, their great faculty
and their great delight lyes in sin, they are skillful
and cheerful Evil doers, not any one Man in all kind
of sins, that's impossible, there is a concatenation
of sin, and one disposes and induces to another, but
yet one ungodly Man is readily more vers'd in, and
delighted with some one kind of sin, another with
some other, forbears none because evil, and hateful
to God, but as he cannot travel over the whole globe
of wickedness, go the full circuit, he walks up and
down, in his accustomed way of sin. No one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick
is good at all Trades, nor any Man expert in
all Arts: but he is an evil doer that follows the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Trade of the sin he hath chosen, is active, and
diligent in that, and finds it sweet. In a word, the main
of this opposition lyeth in the bent of the affection what
way it is set. The godly Man hates the evil he possibly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104216:46"/>
by tentation hath been drawn to do, and loves the
good he is frustrate of, and having intended hath not
attain'd to do: the sinner that hath his denomination
from sin, as his course, hates the good that sometimes
he is forc'd to do, and loves that sin which many times
he does not, either wants occasion and means, and so
cannot do, or through check of an enlightened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
possibly dares not do, tho'so bound up from
the act, as a Dog in a Chain; yet the habit, the
natural inclination and desire in him, is still the same,
the strength of his affection is carried to sin: As in the
weakest godly Man, there is that predominant since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and desire of holy walking, according to which
he is call'd a righteous person, the Lord is pleas'd to
give him that Name, and account him so being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in Heart, tho' often failing. There is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of a higher strain, upon which his Salvation
hangs, that is not in him, but upon him; he is cloath'd
with it; but this other of sincerity and of true and
hearty (tho' imperfect) obedience is the righteousness
here meant oppos'd to evil doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Their opposite condition or portion is express'd
in the highest notion of it, that wherein the very being
of happiness and misery lyeth, the favour and anger
of God. As their natures differ most, by the habitude
of their affection towards God as their main distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
character, so the differences of their estate
consists in the point of his affection towards them,
spoke here in our language by the divers aspects of his
countenance, for that our love and hate usually look's
out, and shews it self that way.</p>
                  <p>Now for the other word expressing his favour to
the righteous, by the openness of his Ear, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in the other needed not, for either the wicked
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104216:46"/>
pray not, or if they do, 'tis indeed no Prayer, the Lord
doth not account nor receive it as such; and if his face
be set against them, certainly his ear is shut against
them too, and so shut that it openeth not to their loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Prayer, <hi>Tho they cry in mine ears with a loud voice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek 8. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>yet
will I not hear them, sayes the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And before we pass to the particulars of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as here we have them, this we would consider
a little, and apply it to our present business; what are
these Persons the Lord thus regards, and opens his ear
to their Prayer?</p>
                  <p>This we pretend to be seeking after, that the Lord
would look favourably upon us, and hearken to our
Suits, for our selves, and this Land, and the whole
Church of God within these Kingdomes. Indeed <hi>the
fervent Prayer of a faithful man availeth much,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>]
'tis of great strength, a mighty thing, that can
bind and loose the influences of Heaven, as there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd,
and the Prayer of a Righteous Man, be it but
of one Righteous Man, how much the combined cries
of many of them together. And that we judge not the
Righteousness there and here mention'd, a thing above
human estate, <hi>Elias,</hi> sayes the Apostle, <hi>was a man, and
a man subject to like passions as we are,</hi> and yet such a
righteous Person as the Lord had an eye and gave ear
to in so great a matter, but where are those righteous
fasters and prayers in great Congregations? How few,
if any, to be found, that are but such in the lowest
sense and measure, real Lovers and Inquirers after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness?
What are our meetings here, but Assemblies of
Evil doers, rebellious Children, ignorant and prophane

                  <p>'Tis the sin of his People that provokes him instead
of favourable looking on them to have his eyes upon
them for evil and not for good, as he threatens; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without puting way of that, prayer is lost breath,
doth no good.</p>
                  <p>They that retain still their sins, will not hearken to
his voice, how can they expect, but that justly threatned
retaliation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. and that the Lord in holy scorn in
the day of their distress should send them for help and
comfort to these things they have made their Gods,
have preferr'd before him in their trouble: <hi>They will
say arise and save us, but where are the Gods that thou hast
made thee, let them arise if they can save thee in the time
of thy trouble,</hi> Jer. 2. 28.</p>
                  <p>And not only do fouler Impieties thus disappoint
our prayers; but the lodging of any sin in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<hi>if I regard iniquity in my heart</hi> (says the
Psalmist) <hi>the Lord will not hear my voice; if I see in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity,</hi>
the word is, if mine eye look pleasantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, his will not look so upon me, nor shall I find
his ear so ready and open: Says not, if I do sin, but if
I regard it in my heart. The heart entertaining and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104216:47"/>
embracing a sin, be it a lesser sin, is more than the
simple falling into sin, and as the ungodly do for this
reason lose all their prayers, a godly man may suffer
this way, in some degree, upon some degree of guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
this way the heart seduc'd, it may be, and entangled
for a time by some sinful lust, they are sure to find a
stop in their prayers, that they neither go nor come so
quickly, and so comfortably as before. Any sinful
humor, as rheums do our voice, binds up the voice of
prayer, makes it not so clear and shrill as it was wont;
and the accusing guilt of it ascending shuts up the
Lord's ear, that he doth not so readily hear and answer as
before: and thus that sweet correspondence is prejudged,
which all the delights of the World cannot compensate.</p>
                  <p>If then you would have easie and sweet accesses
seek 1. an holy Heart, entertain a constant care and
study of Holiness, admit no parlee with sin, do not so
much as hearken to it, if you would be readily heard.</p>
                  <p>2. Seek a broken heart, the Lord is ever at hand to
that, 'tis in the same <hi>Psalm, he is nigh to them that are
of a contrite spirit,</hi> &amp;c. 'tis an excellent way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
The breaking of the heart multiplies petitioners,
every piece of it hath a Voice, and a very strong and
very moving Voice, that enters his Ear, and stirs the
Bowels and Compassions of the Lord towards it.</p>
                  <p>3. A humble heart that may present its suites al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,

Great King loves to make his Abode and Residence in

in and requires, he will not fail to accept of it,
'tis his choice, Mic 6. <hi>Wherewith shall I come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He
hath showed thee O man what is good; and what doth the

to walk with thy God,</hi> he cannot agree with a proud heart,
he hates and resists it, and two cannot walk together
unless they be agreed, as the Wise man speaks. The
humble heart only company for God, hath liberty to
walk and converse with him, he gives Grace to the
humble, he bows his ear, if thou lift not up thy neck:
proud Beggers he turns away with disdain, and the
humblest Suiters always speed best with him. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
not such in their own eyes, but in his, through
his gracious dignation and acceptance; and is there
not reason to come humbly before him, base Worms to

                     <hi>The Eyes of the Lord.</hi>] We see 1. That both are in his
sight the righteous and the wicked, all of them, and all
their ways, his eye is on the one, and his face on
the other, as the word is, but so on these as against
them, 'tis therefore render'd his Eye of Knowledge and
of Observance, marking them and their Actions equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon both. No darkness nor shadow of death where
the workers of iniquity may hide themselves, foolishly
and wretchedly done to do that, or think that, that we
would hide from the Lord, and then to think that we
can hide it;<note place="margin">Is. 29. 15.</note> the Prophet speaks w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them that dig deep to hide their counsel from the Lord,

us? and who knoweth us?</hi> And this is the grand prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of all wickedness, not (it may be) expresly
stated, but secretly lying in the Soul, an habitual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
of God and his eye, not considering that he

But as the Lord doth thus equally see both, so, as
his Eye and Countenance imports his mind concerning
them, and towards them, the manner of beholding
them is different, yea contrary. And from the other
beholding in common, knowing their ways, arises
this different beholding,<note place="margin">Verba sensus connot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and dislike the loving and hating them, and their
ways: so he peculiarly knows the righteous and their
ways, <hi>Ps.</hi> 1. And knows not, never knew the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of iniquity, even those that by their profession
would plead most acquaintance, and familiar converse,
eating and drinking in his presence, and yet <hi>I know you
not, whence are you?</hi> 'Tis not a breaking off from former
acquaintance; no, he doth not that, disavows none
ever truly acquainted with him, so the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
hath it of those that thought to have been in no
small account, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me,</hi> and
there's the convincing reason in that <hi>ye Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi>
none of his favourites and friends such.</p>
                  <p>Thus here, his Eye, his gracious Eye for good,
is on the Righteous; and his Face, his angry looks,
his just wrath against evil-doers.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>11th. Psalm</hi> we have this, much after the
same way, express'd. <hi>First,</hi> that we spoke of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and beholding in common, the righteous and
wicked, and their ways, sitting high where he may
mark, and seeing clear throughout all places and all
hearts,<note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>his Throne is in Heaven, his Eyes behold, his Eye
lids try the Children of Men.</hi> Sits in Heaven not as
in a Chair of rest, regardless of humane things, but on
a Throne for governing and judging, tho' with as little
uneasiness and disturbance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

contemplation or Knowledge; but <hi>his Eye lids try,</hi>
which signifies an intent inspection, such as Men usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
make with a kind of motion of their Eye lids.
Then upon this is added the different portion of the
righteous and wicked, in his beholding them and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them,<note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note> he <hi>tryes the righteous,</hi> approves what
is good in them, and by tryal and affliction doth purge
out what is evil, and in both these, is love; <hi>but the
wicked, and him that loveth violence his Soul<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> hateth,</hi>
and therefore, as here, his face is against them, his
Soul and face all one, but these things are express'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our manner, he looks upon them with indignation,

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the perswasion of this Truth is the main esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of a godly mind, amidst all the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions
that appear in things, and 'tis so here intended,
and in the Psalm, and throughout the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>To look upon the present flourishing and prosperity
of Evil doers, and distresses and sorrows of the Godly, is
a dark obscure matter in it self: but the way to be cleared
and comforted, is to look above them to the Lord, <hi>they
lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>k'd unto him and were lightned, Psal.</hi> 34. 5. that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104216:49"/>
all doubts to believe this undoubted provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and justice, the Eye of God that sees all, yea
rules all these things: and in the midst of all the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
happiness of Wicked Men this is enough to make
them miserable, the Lord's Face is against them, and
they shall surely find it so, he hath wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in store, and will bring it forth to light, will
execute it in due time, he is preparing for them, that
cup spoke of, and they shall drink it: so in the saddest
condition of his Church and a believing Soul, to know
this, that the Lord's eye is even then upon them, and
that he is upon thoughts of peace, and love to them, is
that which settles and composes the mind. Thus in
that <hi>Psalm</hi> before cited, it was such difficulties that did
drive <hi>David</hi>'s thoughts to that for satisfaction, <hi>if the
Foundations be destroy'd, what can the righteous do?</hi> in the
time of such great shakings and confusions, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man can do nothing to't, but the righteous Lord
can do enough, he can do all, <hi>the righteous Lord that
loveth righteousness,</hi> while all seems to go upside down,
he is on his Throne, he is trying and judging, and will
appear to be Judge. This is the thing that a faithful
Soul should learn to look to, and not lose view and
firm belief of, and desire the Lord himself to raise their
minds to it, when they are like to sink. Natural
strength and resolution will not serve turn, floods may
come that will arise above that, something above a
man's own must support him: Therefore say with
<hi>David, when my Spirit is overwhelm'd, lead me to the
Rock that is higher than I,</hi> They think sometimes
'tis so hard with them, he regards not, but he assures
them the contrary, <hi>Is. 49. I have graven thee upon the
palms of mine hands.</hi> I cannot look upon my own hands,
but I must remember thee: <hi>and thy walls are continually
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104216:50"/>
before me,</hi> this is that the Spouse seeks for, <hi>set me as a
Seal upon thine Arm,</hi> Cant. 8.</p>
                  <p>Now a little more particularly to consider the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and their Scope here, how is it made good that
the former words teach, that they that walk in the ways
of wickedness can expect no good, are certainly mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?
Thus, <hi>the face of the Lord is against them:</hi>
Prosper they may in their Affairs and Estates, may
have Riches, and Posterity, and Friends, and the World
caressing them, and smiling on them on all hands, but
there is that one thing that damps all, <hi>the Face of the
Lord is against them,</hi> this they feel not indeed for the
time, 'tis an invisible ill, out of sight and out of mind with
them: but there is a time of the appearing of this Face
of the Lord against them, <hi>the revelation of his just Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
as the Apostle speaks, sometimes precursory days
of it here, but however one great prefixed day, a day
of darkness to them indeed, wherein they shall know
what this is, that now founds so light, to have the Face
of the Lord against them, a look of it more terrible
than all present miseries combined together, what then
shall the Eternity of it be? <hi>to be punished</hi> (as the Apostle
speaks) <hi>with everlasting destruction from the presence of
the Lord, and the glory of his Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are we not then impertinent foolish Creatures, that
are so thoughtful how our poor businesses here succeed
with us, and how we are accounted of in the World,
and how the faces of men are towards us, and scarce
ever enter into a secret serious enquiry, how the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of God is to us, whether favourably shining on
us or still angrily set against us, as it is against all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
sinners.</p>
                  <p>The Face of the Soul being towards God, turn'd away
from the World and Sin, argues to it, that his Face is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104216:50"/>
not against it, but that he hath graciously look'd upon
it, and by a look of love hath drawn it towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for we act not first in that, <hi>non amatur Deus nisi de
Deo,</hi> 'tis he that prevents us, and by the beam of his,
kindles love in our hearts. Now the Soul that's thus
set towards him, it may be, doth not constantly see here
his face shining full and clear upon it: but often
clouded, it may be, hath not not yet at all seen it sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
yet this it may conclude, seeing my desires are
toward him, and my chief desire is the sweet light of
his countenance, though as yet I find not his face shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on me, yet I am perswaded it is not set against me
to destroy me. Misbelief, when the Soul is much
under, and distemper'd, may suggest this sometimes too:
but yet still there is some spark of hope that it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
and that the eye of the Lord's pity is even in
that estate upon us, and will in time manifest it self to
be so.</p>
                  <p>To the other, what assurance have the Godly, for
that seeing of good, these blessings you speak of?
This, <hi>the Eyes of the Lord are upon them, and his Ears
open to their prayer,</hi> if you think him wise enough to
know what is good for them, and rich enough to
afford it, they are sure of one thing, he loves them,
they have his good will, his heart is towards them
and therefore his Eye, and his Ear; can they then
want any good? If many Days, and outward good
things be indeed good for them, they cannot miss
of these, he hath given them already much better
things than these come to, and hath yet far better in
in store for them, and what way soever the World
go with them, this it self is happiness enough, that
they are in his love, <hi>whose loving kindness is better than
Life,</hi> sweet days have they that live in it, what better
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104216:51"/>
days would a Courtier wish, than to be still in
the eye and savour of the King, to be certain of his
good will towards them, and to know of access, and
of a gracious acceptance of all their Suits: Now thus it
is with all the Servants of the great King, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
one to another, he is ready to receive their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
and able and willing to do them all good. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
estate of a Believer, he must not account himself
poor and destitute in any condition, for he hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
at Court, he hath the Kings eye and his ear, <hi>the
eyes of the Lord are upon him, and his ears open to his
prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Eyes.</hi>] This hath in it, 1. His love, the propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his heart towards them: The Eye is the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the affection, turns readily that way most,
where the heart is: Therefore thus the Lord is pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to speak of his love to his own, he views still all
the world, but he looks upon them with a peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
his eye still on them, as it were towards them
from all the rest of the world, tho he doth not alwaies
let them see these his looks, for 'tis not said, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
are in sight of it, no, not here, yet still his Eye
is indeed upon them, by the beauty of Grace in them,
his own work indeed, the beauty that he himself hath
put upon them: And so the other of his Ear too, he is
willing to do for them what they ask, he loves even
to hear them speak, finds a sweetness in the voice
of their Prayers, that makes his ear not only open to
their Prayers, but desirous of them as sweet Musick.
Thus he speaks of both, <hi>Cant. 2. 14. My dove let me see
thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for sweet is thy
voice, and thy countenance is comely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. His good Providence and readiness to do them
good, to supply their wants, and order their affairs for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104216:51"/>
them, to answer their desires, and thus to let them
find the fruits of that love that so leads his eye and ear
towards them, his eye is upon them, he is devising
and thinking what to do for them, 'tis the thing he
thinks on most: his eyes are on all, but they are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied,
as he is pleased to express it, <hi>they run to and fro through
the earth, to shew himself strong in behalf of them, whose heart
is perfect towards him,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Chron. 16. 9. so Deut. 11. 12 <hi>his Eyes all the year on the land.</hi> And no wonder then he
answers their Suits in what is good for them, when it
is still in his thoughts before, he prevents, they cannot
be so mindful of themselves, as he is of them.</p>
                  <p>This is an unspeakable Comfort, when a poor Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is in great perplexity of any kind in his outward
or spiritual condition. Well, I see no way, I am blind
in this, but there are eyes upon me that see well what
is best, the Lord is minding me, and bringing about
all to my advantage; I am poor and needy indeed, but
the Lord thinketh on me, that casteth the ballance.
Would not a man, tho he had nothing, think himself
happy, if some great Prince were busily thinking how
to advance and inrich him; much more, if a number
of Kings were upon this thought, and devising toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet <hi>these thoughts might perish,</hi> as the Psalmist
speaks? how much solider happiness is it to have him,
whose power is greatest, and whose thoughts sail not ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee, and devising thy good, and asking us as it were,
<hi>What shall be done to the man whom the King will honour?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his Ears.</hi>] What suits thou hast, thou mayst
speak freely, he will not refuse thee any thing that is
for thy good.</p>
                  <p>O! but I am not righteous, and all this is for them only:
yet thou wouldst be such a one; wouldst thou indeed?
then in part thou art, as he modestly and wisely chang'd
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104216:52"/>
the name of Wisemen into Philosophers, art thou not
righteous, yet (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>) a Lover of Righteousness
thou art, then one of these: but if still thine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness
be in thine eye, it may and should be so
to humble thee, but if it should scare thee from coming
unto God, and offering thy suits with this perswasion
that his ear is open, make thee think that his favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eye is not toward thee, yet there is mercy, creep
in under the Robe of his Son, thou art sure he is <hi>Iesus
Christ the righteous,</hi> and that the Father's eye is on him
with delight, and then it shall be so on thee being in
him, and put thy petitions into his hand, that is Great
Master of Requests, thou canst not doubt that he
hath access, and that ear open which thou thinkest
shut to thee.</p>
                  <p>The Exercise of Prayer being so important, and
bearing so great a part in the life and comfort of a
Christian, it deserves to be very seriously considered.
We will therefore subjoyn some few Considerations
concerning it.</p>
                  <p>1. Prayer is considerable in a threefold Notion.
1. As a duty we owe to God, being he from whom
we expect and receive all; 'tis a very reasonable homage
and acknowledgement thus to testify the dependance
of our Being and Life on him, and the dependance of
our Souls upon him, for Being, and Life, and all good,
that we be daily Suiters before his Throne, and
go to him for all. 2. As the Dignity, and the delight
of a spiritual Mind, to have so near access unto God,
and such liberty to speak to him. 3. As a proper and sure
means by Divine Appointment and Promise of obtaining
at the hands of God those good things that are needful
and convenient for us. And altho some Believers
of lower Knowledge, do not (it may be) so distinctly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104216:52"/>
know, and others, not so particularly consider all these
in it, yet there is a latent Notion of all these in the
heart of every Godly Person, that stirs them and puts
them on to the constant use of prayer, and to a love of
it.</p>
                  <p>And as they are in these respects inclin'd, and bent
to the exercise of prayer, the Lord's ear is in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
inclin'd to hear their prayer in these respects. 1. He
takes it well at their hands, that they do offer it up
as due worship to him, that they desire thus, as
they can to serve him, accepts of those offerings graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
passes by the imperfections in them, and hath
regard to their sincere intention and desire. 2. It pleases
him well, that they delight in Prayer, as converse with
him, that they love to be much with him, and to speak
to him often, and still aspire by this way to more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him, that they are ambitious of this.
3. He willingly hears their prayers as the Expressions
of their Necessities and Desires, being both rich and
bountiful, loves to have blessings drawn out of his hands
that way, as full breasts delight to be drawn; the Lord's
Treasure always full, and therefore always Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative.
In the first respect, prayer is acceptable
to the Lord as Incense and Sacrifice, as <hi>David</hi> desires,
the Lord receives it as Divine Worship done to him.
In the second, prayer is as the Visits and sweet Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
and Discourse of Friends together, and so
pleasing to the Lord, the free opening of the mind,
<hi>pouring out of the heart to him,</hi> as 'tis called in the <hi>Psalm,</hi>
and so done, calls it his Words and his Meditation,
and the Word for that signifies Discourse or Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
And in the third sense he receives prayer as the
suites of petitioners that are in favour with him, and
that he readily accords to. And thus the words for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104216:53"/>
                     <hi>Supplication</hi> in the Original, and the word here for
<hi>Prayer,</hi> and that for <hi>Cry</hi> in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> do mean, and
in that sense the Lord's open ear, and hearkning hath in
it his readiness to answer, as one that doth hear, and
to answer graciously and really, as hearing favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                  <p>Some directions, 1. For Prayer, that it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
and answered. 2. For observing the answers
of it.</p>
                  <p>1. For Prayer the qualification of the Heart that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
it. 2. The way of offering it.</p>
                  <p>The Heart, 1. In some measure a holy Heart accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that here, <hi>the Righteous,</hi> no regarding iniquity,
entertaining of friendship with any sin, but a permanent
ove and desire of Holiness. Thus indeed a man prays
within himself, as in a sanctified Place, whither the
Lord's ear inclines as of old to the Temple, need not
run superstitiously to a Church, <hi>&amp;c. intra te ora, sed
vide prius an sis templum Dei.</hi> The sanctified Man's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is the <hi>Temple of the holy Ghost,</hi> as the Apostle speaks,
and his Soul the Priest in it, that offers sacrifice both
holy to the Lord, consecrated to him, a believing Heart,
no praying without this. Faith the very life of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whence springs Hope and Comfort with it, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Soul, and keep it steady under storms with
the promises, and as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> keeping
it from fainting, strengthening the hands when they
would begin to fail, that word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 17. for the
<hi>preparing of the heart</hi> which God gives as an assurance
and pledge of his inclining his ear to hear, signifies
the establishing of the Heart, that indeed is a main
point of its preparedness, and due disposition for Prayer.
Now this is done by Faith, without which the Soul, as
the Apostle St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks, is a rolling unquiet thing,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104216:53"/>
as a Wave of the Sea, of it self unstable as the Waters,
and then driven with the Wind and tossed too and
fro with every tentation; see and feel thine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness
as much as thou canst, for thou art never
bid believe in thy self, no, but countermanded that as
Faith's great Enemy, but what hath thy unworthiness
to say against free promises of Grace which are the
basis of thy Faith, so then believe that that you may
pray, this is <hi>David</hi>'s advice, <hi>Ps. 62. Trust in him at all
times ye people,</hi> and then <hi>pour out your hearts before him,</hi>
confide in him as a most faithful and powerful Friend,
and than you will open your hearts to him.</p>
                  <p>2. For the way of offering up prayer 'tis a great art,
a main part of the secret of Religion to be skill'd in it,
and of great concern for the comfort and success of it,
much here to be considered, but for the present briefly.
1. Offer not to speak to him without the heart in some
measure season'd and prepossess'd with the sense of his
Greatness and Holiness, and there is much in this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
wisely to whom we speak, the King, <hi>the Lord
of Glory,</hi> and setting the Soul before him, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and then reflecting on our selves, and seeing what
we are, how wretched, and base, and filthy, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of such access to such a Great Majesty, the want
of this preparing of the heart to speak in the Lord's
ear, by the consideration of God and our selves is that
which fills the exercise of prayer with much guiltiness,
makes the heart careless, and slight, and irreverent, and
so displeases the Lord, and disappoints our selves of
that comfort in prayer, and answers of it, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we would have more experience of. We rush in
before him with any thing, provided we can tumble
out a few words, and do not weigh these things, and
compose our hearts with serious thoughts and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104216:54"/>
of God. The Soul that studies and endeavours
this most, hath much to do to attain to any right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of him, for how little know we of him;
yet should we at least, set our selves before him as the
purest and greatest Spirit, a Being infinitely more. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
than our Minds or any Creature can conceive,
this would fill the Soul with awe and reverence, and
balast it, make it go more even through the exercise,
to consider the Lord, as that Prophet saw him, sitting
on his Throne, and all the Host of Heaven standing by
him on his right Hand, and on his left, and thy self a
defiled Sinner coming before him, <hi>as a vile Frog
creeping out of some Pool;</hi> how would this fill thee with
holy Fear.<note place="margin">Velut e pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude suÃ¢ vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ranuncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. <hi>Bern.</hi>
                     </note> Oh! His greatness, and our baseness, and
Oh! the distance.<note place="margin">Ecel. 5. 2.</note> This is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s advice, <hi>be not rash
with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any
thing before God, for God is in Heaven and thou upon
Earth, therefore let thy words be few.</hi> This would keep
us from our ordinary bablings, that heart nonsense, tho'
the words be sense, yet through the inattention of the
heart, are but as impertinent confus'd Dreams in the
Lord's ears, as there follow, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>2. When thou addressest thy self to prayer, desire
and depend upon the assistance and inspiration of the
holy Spirit of God, without which thou art not able
truly to pray, 'tis a supernatural work; and therefore
the principle of it must be supernatural. He that hath
nothing of the Spirit of God cannot pray at all, he
may howle as a Beast in his necessity or distress, or
may speak words of Prayer, as some Birds learn the
Language of Men, but pray he cannot; and they that
have that Spirit ought to seek the movings and actual
workings of it in them in Prayer, the particular help of
their infirmities, teaching both what to ask, a thing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104216:54"/>
that of our selves we know not, and then enabling
them to ask, breathing forth their desires in such sighs
and groans, as the breath not simply of their own,
but of God's Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> As those two before it, so in the exercise of
it you should learn to keep a watchful eye over your
own hearts throughout, for every step of the way,
that they start not out, by the keeping up of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
remembrance of that presence of God, which
in the entry of the work is to be set before the eye of
the Soul, and our endeavour ought to be, to six it upon
that view, that it turn not aside nor downwards, but
from beginning to end, keep sight of him, who sees
and marks whether we do so or no. They that are
most inspective, and watchful in this will still be faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in it, but certainly the less watchful the more faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and this we ought to do, to be aspiring daily to
more stability of mind in prayer, and driving out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of that roving and wandring, that is so universal
an Evil, and certainly so grievous to those that have it
most, but that observe and discover it most, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
most against it. A strange thing that the mind,
even the renewed mind, should be so ready, not only
at other times, but in the exercise of Prayer, wherein
we peculiarly come so near to God, yet even then to slip
out and leave him, and follow some poor vanity or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
instead of him. Surely the Godly Man when he
thinks on this, is exceedingly ashamed of himself, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell what to think of it: God his exceeding joy,
whom in his right thoughts he esteem's so much above
the World, and all things in it, yet to use him thus,
when he is speaking to him, to break off from that,
and hold discourse, or change a word with some base
thought that steps in, and whispers to him, or at the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104216:55"/>
best not to be stedfastly minding the Lord to whom
he speaks, and possess'd with the regard of his presence,
and of his business and errand with him.</p>
                  <p>This is no small piece of our misery here, these wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings
are evidence to us that we are not at home: but
yet for this, tho we should be humbled, and still la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
against it, yet not so discourag'd, as to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from the work. Satan would desire no better
than that, it were to help him to his wish; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Christian may be driven to think, what shall
I do still thus, abusing my Lords name, and the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he hath given me, I had better leave off; no, not
so by any means, strive against the miserable evil in
thee, but cast not away thy happiness, be doing still.
'Tis a froward childish humour, when any thing agrees
not to our mind, to throw all away, thou mayest come
off with halting from thy wrestlings, and yet obtain
the Blessing for which thou wrestled.</p>
                  <p>4. Those Graces which are the due qualities of the
heart, disposing it for prayer in the exercise of it, should
be excited and acted, as Holiness, the Love of it, the
Desire of increase and growth of it; so the humbling
and melting of the heart, and chiefly Faith, which is
mainly set on work in prayer, draw forth the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and vertues of the Promises, to desire earnestly
their performance to the Soul, and to believe that they
shall be performed; to have before our eyes his
Goodness and Faithfulness, who hath promised, and to
rest upon that, and for success in Prayer exercising
Faith in it, it is altogether necessary to interpose the
Mediator, and look through him, and to speak and
petition by him, who warns us of this, that there is
no other way to speed, <hi>no man cometh to the Father but
by me.</hi> As the Jews when they prayed, look'd toward
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104216:55"/>
the Temple were was the Mercy-Seat,<note place="margin">Schechinah.</note> and the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
presence of God; thus ought we in all our praying
to look on Christ, who is our <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> and <hi>in whom
the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily.</hi> The forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of this may be the cause of our many disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>5. Fervency, not to seek coldly, that presages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal;
fire in the Sacrifice, otherwise it ascends not, no
sacrifice without incense, and no incense without fire.
Our remiss dead hearts are not likely to do much for
the Church of God, nor for our selves, where are those
strong cries that should pierce the Heavens? his ear is
open to their cry. He hears the faintest coldest Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but not with that delight and propenseness to
grant it,<note place="margin">Ps. 55. 17.</note> his Ear is not on't, as the word here is, he
takes no pleasure in hearing on't, but cries, heart-cries.
Oh! those take his Ear, and move his Bowels, for
these are the voice, the cries of his own Children. A
strange word of encouragement to importunity, <hi>give
him no rest, Is.</hi> 62. 7. Suffer him not to be in quiet
till <hi>he make</hi> Jerusalem <hi>a praise in the Earth.</hi> A few
such Suiters in these times were worth thousands such
as we are, our prayers stick in our Breast, scarce come
forth, much less go up, and ascend with that piercing
force, that would open up the way for deliverances to
come down.</p>
                  <p>But in this must be some difference of temporal
and spiritual things, the Prayer in the right strain
cannot be too fervent in any thing, but the desire of the
thing in temporals may be too earnest, a feverish
distemper'd heat which diseases the Soul, therefore
in these things, a holy indifferency concerning the
particular, may, and should be joyn'd with the ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Prayer: but in spiritual things, there is no danger
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104216:56"/>
in vehemency of desire, covet these, hunger and thirst,
be uncessantly ardent in the suit; yet even in those
in some particulars, as for the degree and measure of
Grace, and some peculiar furtherances they should be
presented so with earnestness, as that withal it be with
a reference and resignation of it to the Wisdom and
Love of our Father.</p>
                  <p>For the other point the answer of our Prayers, which
is in this openness of the ear, it is a thing very needful
to be considered and attended to, if we think that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is indeed a thing that God takes notice of, and hath
regard to in his dealing with his Children, 'tis certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a point of Duty and Wisdom in them to observe how
he takes notice of it, and bends his ear to it, and puts to
his hand to help, and so answers it, this both furnishes
matter of praise, and stirs up the heart to render it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the <hi>Psalms</hi> so often <hi>the hearing of prayer</hi> observed,
and recorded, and made a part of the Song of Praise,
and withal it endears both God and Prayer unto the
Soul, as we have both together, <hi>Psal. 116. 1. I love
the Lord, because he hath heard my voice, and my supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
the transposition in the Original pathetical, <hi>I love,
because the Lord hath heard my voice.</hi> I am in love, and
particularly this causes it, I have sound so much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Lord, I cannot but love, <hi>he hath heard my
voice.</hi> And then it wins his esteem and affection to
Prayer, seeing I find this vertue in it, we shall never
part again, <hi>I will call upon him as long as I live,</hi> seeing
Prayer draweth help and favours from Heaven, I shall
not be to seek for a way in any want or strait that can
befall me.</p>
                  <p>In this there is need of direction: but too many
Rules may as much confuse a matter as too few,
and do many times perplex the mind, and multiply
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104216:56"/>
doubts, as many Laws do multiply pleading. Briefly
then,</p>
                  <p>1. Slothful minds do often neglect the answers of
God, even when they are most legible in the very
thing it self granted that was desired. It may be
through a total inadvertence in this kind, never think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on things as answers of our requests, or possibly
a continual eager pursuit of more, turns away the mind
from considering what it hath upon request obtain'd,
still so bent upon what further we would have, that
we never think what is already done for us, one of the
ordinary Causes of ingratitude.</p>
                  <p>2. But tho' it be not in the same thing that we desire,
yet when the Lord changes our petitions in his answers,
'tis always for the better,<note place="margin">Si non ad voluntatem ad utilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>m.</note> regards (according to that
known word of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) our well more than our
will. We beg deliverance, we are not unanswered, if
he give patience and support, be it under a spiritual
trial or tentation, <hi>my grace sufficient for thee.</hi> And where
the Lord doth thus, 'tis certainly better for the time,
than the other would be. Observe here, his cars are to
the Righteous, but his eyes are on them too, they have
not so his ear as blindly to give them, what they ask,
whether it be fit or no; but his eye is on them to see
and consider their estate, and to know better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
what is best, and accordingly to answer: This is
no prejudice, but a great Priviledge and Happiness of his
Children, that they have a Father that knows what is
fit for them, and with-holds no good from them.
And this commutation and exchange of our requests
a Christian observing, may usually find out the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
answer of their Prayers, and if sometimes they
do not, than not to subtilize and amuse themselves
so much in that, but rather to keep on to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104216:57"/>
knowing (as the Apostle speaks in another case)
this for a certain, <hi>that their labour shall not be in vain
in the Lord,</hi> and as the Prophet hath it, <hi>he hath not said
unto the House of</hi> Jacob, <hi>seek ye me in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Only this we should always remember not to set
bounds and limits to the Lord in point of time, to set
him a day, that thou wilt attend so long and no longer;
how patiently will some men bestow long attendance
on others, where they expect some very poor good, or
courtesie at their hands, but we are very brisk and
hasty with him, who never delays us but for our
good, to ripen those Mercies for us, that we as foolish
Children would pluck while they are green, and have
neither that sweetness and goodness in them which
they shall have in his time. All his works are done in
their season: were there nothing to check our impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiences
but his Greatness; and the greatness of those
things we ask for, and our own unworthiness, these
might curb them, and perswade us how reasonable it
is that we wait: He is a King well worth waiting on,
and there is in the very waiting on him an honour and
happiness far above us, and the things we seek are
great, forgiveness of Sins, evidence of Sonship and
Heirship: Heirship of a Kingdom, and we condemned
Rebels, born Heirs of the bottomless Pit, and shall such
as we be in such haste with such a Lord in so great
requests: but the attendance that this reason enforces,
is sweetned by the consideration of his Wisdom and
Love, that he hath foreseen and chosen the very hour
for each mercy fit for us, and will not slip it a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Never any yet repented their waiting, but
found it fully compens'd with the opportune answer
in such a time as then they are forc'd to confess was
the only best. <hi>I waited patiently,</hi> says the Psalmist,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104216:57"/>
                     <hi>in waiting I waited,</hi> but it was all well bestowed, <hi>he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to me, and heard my cry, brought me up,</hi> &amp;c. and
then after falls into admiration of the Lord's method,
his wonderful workings and thoughts to us-ward, while
I was waiting, and saw nothing thy thoughts were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and for me, and thou didst then work when thy
goodness was most remarkable and wonderful.</p>
                  <p>When thou art in great affliction outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
thou thinkest (it may be) he regards thee not,
yea but he doth. Thou art his Gold, he knows the
time of refining thee, and then taking thee out of the
Furnace, he is verst and skillful in that work. Thou
sayest, I have cried long for power against sin, and for
some evidence of pardon, and find no answer to either,
yet leave him not, he never yet cast away any that
sought him, and staid by him, and resolv'd whatsoever
came on't, to lie at his footstool, and to wait, were it
all their life time, for a good word, or a good look
from him. And they chuse well that make that their
great desire and expectation, for one of his good words
or looks will make them up, and make them happy for
ever, and 'tis he is Truth, they are sure not to miss of
it, <hi>blessed are all they that wait for him.</hi> And thou that
sav'st thou canst not find pardon of sin and power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; yet consider whence are those desires of both,
that thou once didst not care for, why doth thou hate
that sin which thou didst love, and art troubled and
burden'd with the guilt of it under which thou wentest
so easily and didst not feel before, are not these some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his own work, yes sure? and know he will
not leave it unfinished, nor forsake the work of his
hands, his eye may be on thee, tho thou seest him not,
and his ear open to thy cry, tho for the present he speaks
not to thee as thou desirest. 'Tis not said that his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104216:58"/>
always see and hear him sensibly: but yet when
they do not, he is beholding them, and hearing them
graciously, and will shew himself to them, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
them seasonably.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Psal. 22. 2. I cry in the day time, and thou hearest
not,</hi> &amp;c. Yet will not he entertain hard thoughts of
God, nor conclude against him, <hi>thou art holy,</hi> v. 3.
where by <hi>Holiness</hi> is meant his faithfulness (I conceive)
to his own, as follows, <hi>that he inhabites the praises of
Israel,</hi> to wit for the Favours he hath shewed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Lord's open ear perswade us to make much
use of it,<note place="margin">Clavis di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prayer, together and apart, in the sense of these three
Considerations mentioned above: The Duty, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and the Utility of Prayer. 'Tis due to the Lord
to be worship'd and acknowledg'd thus, as the Fountain
of Good. How will men crouch and bow one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon small requests, and he only neglected by the
most from whom all have all, Life, and Breath,
and all Things, as the Apostle speaks in his Sermon,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 25.</p>
                  <p>2. And then the Dignity of this, to be admitted into so
near converse with the highest Majesty, were there
nothing to follow, no answer at all, Prayer pays it self
in the Excellency of its Nature, and the sweetness that
the Soul finds in it, poor wretched Man to be admitted
into Heaven, while he is on Earth, and there to
come and speak his mind freely to the Lord of Heaven
and Earth, as his Friend, as his Father, to empty all
his Complaints into his Bosom, to refresh his Soul in
his God, wearied with the Follies and Miseries of the
World. Where any thing of his love, this is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of highest sweetness, for they that love find
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104216:58"/>
much delight to discourse together, and count all hours
short, and think the day runs too fast, that is so spent
and they that are much in this exercise the Lord doth
impart his secrets much to them.</p>
                  <p>3. And the most profitable exercise, no lost time as
prophane hearts judge it, but only gain'd, all blessings
attend this work, the richest traffick in the World, trades
with Heaven and what is most precious there. And
as Holiness fits to Prayer, so Prayer befriends Holiness, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
it much, nothing so regines and purifies the Soul as
frequent Prayer, if the often conversing with Wise Men
doth so teach and advance the Soul in Wisdom, what then
will the converse of God. This makes the Soul
to despise the things of the World and in a manner
makes it Divine, winds up the Soul from the Earth,
acquainting it with delights, that are infinitely
sweeter.</p>
                  <p>The natural heart is full stuff'd with prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the way of Holiness that disswade and detain it,
and therefore the holy Scriptures are most fitly much
in this point of asserting the true advantage of it to
the Soul. And in removing those mistakes it has of
that way.</p>
                  <p>Thus here, and to press it the more home the Apostle
used the Psalmists words, and <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. &amp;c. and now
follows it forth in his own the particular way of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But extends in the general Doctrine
to all the paths of righteousness.</p>
                  <p>The main conclusion is, that Happiness is the certain
consequent, and fruit of Holiness. All good, even
outward good, so far as it holds good and prejudges
not a higher good. If we did believe this more, we
should feel it more, and so upon feeling, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
believe it more strongly. All the heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104216:59"/>
we feel or fear, are they not the fruit of our own
ways, or prophaneness, and pride, and malice, and
abounding ungodliness, all cry out of hard times,
evil days, and yet who is taking the right way to better
them, yea, who is not still helping to make them
worse, our selves the greatest enemies of our own
peace. Who looks either rightly backward, reflects
on his former ways, or rightly forward to direct his
way better that is before him, either, says, <hi>what have
I done?</hi> or <hi>what ought I to do?</hi> and indeed the one of
these depends on the other,<note place="margin">[Consilium faturum expraeterito venit. <hi>Sen.</hi>]</note> 
                     <hi>I consider'd my ways</hi> (says
<hi>David</hi>) turn'd them over and over (as the word is)
<hi>and then I turn'd my feet unto thy testimonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are there any, for all the Judgements fallen on
us, or that threatens us, returning apace with regret
and hatred of sin, hastening unto God, and mourning
and weeping as they go, bedewing each step with
their tears, yea, where that newness of Life that the
word so long, and now the word and the rod together
are so loud calling for? Who more reforming his
Tongue from evil, and lips from guile, changing Oaths,
and Lyes, and Calumnies, into a new Language, into
Prayers, and reverend speaking of God, and joyning a
sutable consonant carriage, eschewing evil and doing
good, labouring to be fertile in Holiness, to bring
forth much fruit to God. This were the way to see
good days indeed, this is the way to the longest Life,
the only long Life, and length of Days, one eternal
Day, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> on these words, <hi>one Day in thy
Courts is better, than a thousand. Millia dierum desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derant

The reason added is above all exception, 'tis su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
<hi>the eyes of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. If he that made times
and seasons, and commands and formes them as he
will, if he can give good Days, or make Men happy
then the only way to it sure must be the way of his
obedience, to be in the constant favour of the great
King, and still in his gracious thoughts, to have his
eye and his ear if this will serve turn, (and if this do
it not, I pray you, what will?) then the righteous Man is
the only happy Man, <hi>for the eyes of the Lord are upon him.</hi>
Surer happy Days hence, than theirs that draw them
from the aspect of the Stars, the Eyes of the Father of
Lights benignity beholding them, the trine aspect of the
blessed Trinity. The love he carries to them draws his eye
still towards them, no forgetting of them, nor slipping of
the sit season to do them good, his Mind, I may say, runs
on that, he sees how 'tis with them, and receives their
suits gladly, rejoyces to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>t favours upon them. He is
their assured friend, yea he is their Father, what can
they want, they cannot miss of any good that his love
and power can help them to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But his Face,</hi> &amp;c.] So our happiness and misery are in
his Face, his looks. Nothing so comfortable as his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Face, nothing so terrible again as his Face, his anger, as
the Hebrew word is often taken, that signifies his Face.
And yet how many sleep sound under this misery, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, 'tis a dead and a deadly sleep, the Lord standing in
terms of enmity with thee, and yet thy Soul at case, piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
accursed ease. I regard not the differences of your
outward estate, that's not a thing worth the speaking
of, if thou be poor and base, and in the Worlds eye
but a wretch, and with all under the hatred of God, as
being an impenitent hardned sinner, those other things
are nothing, this is the top, yea the total sum of thy
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104216:60"/>
misery: or be thou beautiful, or rich, or noble, or
witty <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or all these together, or what thou will, but
is the Face of the Lord against thee?<note place="margin">Splendida miserla.</note> think as thou
wilt, thy estate is not to be envyed but lamented. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say, much good do it thee with all thy enjoyments,
for 'tis sure they can do thee no good, and if thou doest
not believe this now, the Day is at hand wherein thou
shalt be forc'd to believe it, finding it then irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
true. If you will, you may still follow the things
of the World, walk after the lusts of your own hearts,
neglect God, and please your selves, but as <hi>Solomons</hi>
word is of judgement, <hi>remember that the Face of the
Lord is against thee,</hi> and in that judgement it shall
unvail it and let thee see it against thee. Oh! the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
of all sights.</p>
                  <p>The Godly often do not see the Lord's favourable
looks, while he is eying them, and the wicked usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do not see nor perceive, neither will believe that
his Face is against them: but besides that the day
of full discovery is a coming; the Lord doth sometimes
let both the one and the other know somewhat how
he stands affected towards them in peculiar deliverances
and mercies. Tells his own that he forgets them not
but both sees and hears them, when they think he
does neither, after that loving and gracious manner
they desire, and is here meant; and sometimes lets
forth glances of his bright countenance, darts in a
beam upon their Souls, that is more worth than many
Worlds. And on the otherside, he is pleased sometimes
to make it known that his Face is against the wicked,
either by remarkable outward judgements, which to
them are the vent of his just enmity against them, or
to some he speaks it more home in horrours and
affrights of conscience, which to them are earnests
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104216:60"/>
and pledges of their full misery, that <hi>inheritance of

of their <hi>inheritance of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore if you have any belief of these things, be
perswaded, be entreated to forsake the way of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
do not flatter your selves and dream of escape

you, although upon very high offers made to you
of other things. You think, I know, that the very sound
of it is somewhat fearful, and on the other side have
possibly some confus'd notion of his favour, as a thing
desirable, and yet do not bestir your selves to
avoid the one and enquire after the other; which is
certainly by reason of your unbelief, for if you think
of the love of God, as his word speaks of it, as you
will say you do, whence is it, I pray you, that there is
no trifle in this World, that will not take more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

There is an imitation of men that is impious and

perswade it, that besides higher benefit, it oftentimes

cuts off the occasions of present evils and disturbances
that otherwise men are incident to <hi>Who is he?</hi> Men even
evil men will often be overcome by our blameless and
harmless behaviour.</p>
                  <p>1. In the Life of a Godly Man taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the whole body and frame of it, there is a
grave beauty or comeliness, that oftentimes forces some
kind of reverence and respect to it, even in Ungodly
minds.</p>
                  <p>2. Though a Natural man cannot love them spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
as Graces of the Spirit of God, for so only the
partakers of them are Lovers of them; yet he may
have, and usually hath a natural liking and esteem of
some kind of vertues which are in a Christian, and are
not in their right nature in any other to be found;
tho a Moralist may have somewhat like them, <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. These and other such-like Graces do make a
Christian life so inoffensive and calm, that except where
the matter of their God or Religion is made the Crime,
malice it self can scarce tell where to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or lay hold, hath nothing to pull by, though it
would, yea, oftentimes for want of work or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
'twill fall a sleep for a while, whereas Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Iniquity sometimes by breaking out into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Crimes, draws out the Sword of Civil Justice,
and where it rises not so high, yet it involves Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

how often are the lusts, and pride, and covetousness of
men paid with dangers, and troubles, and vexations, that
besides what is abiding, do even in present spring out
of them; now these the Godly pass free of by their just,
and mild, and humble carriage; <hi>whence so many jars and
strifs</hi> amongst the greatest part, but from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian

Hearts and Lives, <hi>from their lusts that war in
their members,</hi> their self-love and unmortified Passions,
he will bate nothing of his Will, nor the other of his.
Thus where Pride and Passion meets on both sides, it
cannot be, but a fire will be kindled, when hard Flints
strike together, the sparkles will fly about: but a soft
mild spirit is a great preserver of its own peace, kills
the power of contest, as Wooll packs or such like soft

do somewhat to induce your minds to love the way of

and unquietness that abounds in the lives of men,
a great part whereof the most do procure by the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and distemper of their own carnal minds, and
the disorder in their ways that arises thence.</p>
                  <p>2. You, whose hearts are set towards God, and your
Feet entred into his ways, I hope you find no reason
for a change, but many to commend and endear that
way to you every day more than another, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest even this in them you escape many
even present mischiefs, that you see the ways of the
World are full of. And if you will be careful to ply
your Rule, and study your Copy better, you shall find
it more so, the more you follow that which is good,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104216:64"/>
the more shall you avoid a number of outward evils
that are ordinarily drawn on upon men by their own
enormities and passions: keep as close as you can to
the genuine even Tract of a Christian walk, and
labour for a prudent and meek behaviour,<note place="margin">Matt. 10.</note> adorning your

                  <p>'Tis known how much the spotless Lives and patient
Sufferings of the Primitive Christians did sometimes
work upon their Beholders, yea, on their Persecutors,
and perswaded some that would not share with
them in their Religion, yet to speakand write for them.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that Reason and Experience do joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and withal the best and highest examples of these
that have walkt according to it, and then you will be

and be followers of those as they are of Christ. I know
you will espy much irregular and unsanctified carriage
in us that are set up for the Ministry, and look round
will find the World lying in wickedness, yet if there
be any that have any sparks of divine light in them
converse with those and follow them.</p>

the rule of holiness, and then with an eye to that
look on one another, and be zealous of progress in
the ways of holiness, choose to converse with such as
may excite you and advance you both by their advice
and example. Let not a corrupt Generation in which
you live, be the worse by you, nor you the worse by
it, as far as you necessarily ingage to some conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with those that are unholy, let them not pull you
into the mire, but if you can, help them out; and let

you in the most inoffensive way of Religion if you keep
streight to it. Suffering and war with the World is a

besides what is to come, are they not often

that either quickly cut the thread of Life, or make
their aged bones full of the sins of their youth. Take

                     </gap>. 1. From the favour and protection of
God. 2. From the nature of the thing it self. Now we
would consider the consistence of this supposition with
those reasons.</p>
                  <p>1. The Eyes of the Lord being on the righteous for
their good, and his Ear open to their Prayer how is
it that for all that favour and inspection they are so much
expos'd to suffering, and even for the regard and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
they bear towards him, suffering for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
these seem not to agree well, yet they
do.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not said that his Eye is so on them, as that he
will never see them afflicted, nor have them suffer
any thing, no: but this is their great priviledge and
comfort in suffering, that his gracious Eye is then upon
them, and sees their trouble, and his Ear towards
them not so as to grant them an exemption (for
that they will not seek for) but seasonable deliverance,
and in the mean while strong support, as is evident
in that <hi>34th. Psalm.</hi> If his Eye be always on them he
sees them suffer often, <hi>for their afflictions are many,</hi> ver.
19. and if his Ear be to them, he hears many sighs
and cries press'd out by sufferings, and they are content,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104216:67"/>
this is enough, yea better then not to suffer, they
suffer and often directly for him, but he sees it all,
takes perfect notice on't, therefore 'tis not lost. And
they are forc'd to cry, but none of their cries escape
his Ear, he hears, and he manifests that he sees, and
hears: for he delivers them, and till he does he keeps
them from being crush'd under the weight of the
suffering, he keeps all his bones not one of them is
broken.</p>
                  <p>He sees, yea appoints and provide these conflicts
for his choicest Servants, he sets his Champions to
encounter the malice of Satan, and the World, for his
sake, to give proof of the truth, and the strength of
their love to him for whom they suffer, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
even in suffering.</p>
                  <p>He is sure of his design'd advantages out of the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Church and Saints for his name, he loses
nothing, nor they lose nothing; but their Enemies,
when they rage most and prevail most are ever the most
losers, his own glory grows and his peoples graces grow,
yea their very number grows, and that sometimes
most, by their greatest sufferings. It was evident in
the first Ages of the Christian Churches, where were
the glory of so much invincible love and patience
if they had not been so put to it?</p>
                  <p>2. For the other, that the said following of good
would preserve from harm, it speaks truly the nature
of it, what 'tis apt to do, and what in some measure
it often doth, but the considering the nature of the
World, <hi>its enmity against God,</hi> and Religion, that strong
poyson in the Serpents Seed, it is not strange that
it often proves otherwise, that notwithstanding the
righteous carriage of Christians, yea even because of
it they suffer much: 'tis a resolv'd case, all that will
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104216:67"/>
live godly must suffer Persecution, it meets a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in his entry to the way of the Kingdome, and
goes along all the way, no sooner begin thou to seek
the way to Heaven; but the World will seek, how to
vex and molest thee, and make that way grievous;
if no other way, by scoffs and taunts, as bitter blasts to
destroy the tender blossom, or bud of Religion, or
(as <hi>Herod</hi>) to kill Christ newly born: you shall no
sooner begin to enquire after God but twenty to one,
they will begin to enquire if thou art gone mad, but
if thou knowest <hi>who 'tis whom thou hast trusted</hi>
and whom thou lovest, this is a small matter, what
though it were deeper and sharper sufferings, yet still
<hi>if you suffer for righteousness, happy are you.</hi> Which is
the Second thing was proposed, and more particularly
imports, that a Christian under the heaviest load of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for righteousness is yet still happy, notwithstanding
these suffering. <hi>2dly.</hi> That he is happier even by
these sufferings. And,</p>
                  <p>1. All the sufferings and distresses of this World
are not able to destroy the Happiness of a Christian
nor diminish it, yea, they cannot at all touch it, 'tis
out of their reach. If it were built on worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then worldly deprivements and sufferings
might shake it, yea might undo it, when those rotten
stoups fail, that which rests on them must fall, he that
hath set his heart on his riches, a few hours can make
him miserable; 'tis almost in any bodies power to
rob him of his Happiness, a little slight or disgrace
undoes him, or whatsoever the Soul fixes on of these
moving unfixed things, pluck them from it, and it
must cry after them, <hi>ye have taken away my God's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Believer's happiness is safe, out of shot, he
may be impoverished and imprison'd, and tortur'd.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104216:68"/>
and kill'd; but this one thing is out of hazard, he
cannot be miserable, still in the midst of all these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
a happy Man. If all Friends be shut out, yet the
visits of the Comforter may be frequent, bringing him
glad tydings from Heaven, and communing with him

for his Country is above; nor death, for that sets him
home into that Country.</p>
                  <p>The believing Soul having hold of Jesus Christ
can easily despise the best, and the worst of the World,
and give a defie to all that's in it, can share with the
Apostle in that which he gives, <hi>I am perswaded that
neither death nor life shall separate me from the love of
God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi> Yea what tho'
the frame of the World were a dissolving and salling a
pieces this happiness holds, and is not stir'd by it,
for 'tis in that Rock of Eternity, that stirs not, nor
changes at all.</p>
                  <p>Our main work truly if you will believe it is this,
to provide this immoveable happiness, that amidst all
changes, and losses, and sufferings, may hold firm. You
may be free, chose it rather, not to stand to the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
of any thing about you, nor of any Man, whether
enemy or friend, for the tenure of your happiness
lay it higher and surer, and if you be wise provide
such a peace as will remain untouch'd in the hottest
flame, such a light as will shine in the deepest dungeon
and such a life as is safe even in death it self, <hi>that life
that is hid with Christ in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if in other sufferings, even the worst and saddest,
the Believer is still a happy Man, then more especially
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104216:68"/>
in those that are the best kind, suffering for righteousness;
not only do they not detract from his happiness; but,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> They concur and give accession to it, he is happy
even by so suffering. As will appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
considerations.</p>
                  <p>1. 'Tis the happiness of a Christian, until he attain
perfection, to be advancing towards it, to be daily
resining from sin, and growing richer and stronger
in the graces that make up a Christian a new creature,
to attain a higher degree of patience, and meekness, and
humility, to have the heart more weaned from the
Earth and fixed on Heaven; now as other afflictions
of the Saints do help them in those their sufferings for
righteousness, the unrighteous and injurious dealing
of the World with them have a particular fitness for
this purpose, those trials that come immediately from
God's own hand seem to bind to a patient and humble
compliance with more authority, and (I may say)
necessity. There is no plea, no place for so much as
a word, unless it be directly and expresly against the
Lord's own dealing, but unjust suffering at the hands
of Men requires that respect unto God, without whose
hand they cannot move, that for his sake, and for
reverence and love to him, a Christian can go through
those with that mild evenness of Spirit, that overcomes
even in suffering.</p>
                  <p>And there is nothing outward more fit to perswade
a Man to give up with the World and its Friendship,
than to feel much of its enmity and malice, and that
directly acting it self against Religion, making that
the very quarrel which is of all things dearest to a
Christian, and in highest esteem with him.</p>
                  <p>If the World should caress them, and smile on them,
they might be ready to forget their home, or at least
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104216:69"/>
to abate in the frequent thoughts and fervent desires
of it, and turn into some familiarity with the World
and favourable thoughts of it, and thus let out somwhat
of their hearts after it, and thus grace would grow faint
by the diversion, and calling forth of the Spirits, as
in Summer in the hottest and fairest weather 'tis
with the body.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a confirm'd observation by the experience of
all Ages, that when the Church flourish'd most in
outward peace and wealth,<note place="margin">Opibus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vigour of grace; when the Moon shines brightest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                     <hi>2dly.</hi> Happy in acting and evidencing, by those suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
for God, their love to him. Love delights in
difficulties, and grows in them: the more a Christian
suffers for Christ the more he loves Christ, accounts
him the dearer, and the more he loves him, still the
more can he suffer for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> Happy as in testifying love to him, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
him, so in conformity with him, which is loves
ambition, affects likeness and harmony at any rate, a
Believer would readily take it as an affront, that the
World should be kind to him, that was so harsh and
cruel to his beloved Lord and Master. Canst thou
expect or wouldst thou wish smooth language from
that World that revil'd thy Jesus, that called him <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi>
couldst thou own and accept friendship at
its hands that buffetted him and shed his blood, or art
thou rather most willing to share with him, and of

that in those times of suffering are usual, that as suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for Christ do abound consolations in him abound
much more, as the Apostle testifies. God speaking most
peace to the Soul when the World speaks most War,
and enmity against it, and this compenses abundantly,
when the Christian lays the greatest sufferings Men
can inflict in the one ballance, and the least glances of
God's countenance in the other, it says 'tis worth all
the enduring of these to enjoy this, says with <hi>David
let them curse, but bless thou; let them frown, but smile
thou.</hi> And thus he usually doth, refreshes such as are
prisoners for him with visits, that they would buy
again with the hardest restraint and debaring of nearest
friends.<note place="margin">Vident cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces nostra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> The World cannot but misjudge the state
of suffering Christians, it sees their Crosses, but not their
anointings. Was not St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> think you, in a
happy posture even in his enemies hands, was he
afraid of the Showre of Stones coming about his ears
that saw the Heavens opened, and Jesus standing on
the Father's right hand, so little troubled with the
stoning him, that as the Text hath it, <hi>in the midst of
them, he fell a sleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. If those sufferings be so small, weigh'd down
even with present comforts, and so the Christian
happy in them in that regard, how much more doth
the weight of Glory surpass, that follows these suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
they are not worthy to come in comparison, they
are as nothing to that <hi>glory that shall be revealed</hi> in the
Apostle's Arithmetick, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> they amount to just nothing in
respect of that glory. Now these sufferings happy,
because the way to this happiness, and pledges of it,
and (if any thing do) they raise the very degree of it,
however 'tis an <hi>exceeding excellent weight of glory:</hi> the
Hebrew word that signifies glory, signifies weight;
yet the glories that are here are all too light, except in
weight of cares and sorrows that attend them, but
that hath the weight of compleat blessedness, speak not
of all the sufferings nor of all the prosperities of this
poor life, nor of any thing in it, as worthy of a thought
when that glory is named, yea let not this life be called
life, when we mention that other life, that our
Lord by his death hath purchas'd for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be not afraid of their terrour</hi>] No time, nor place
in the World so favourable to Religion, that it is not
still needful to arm a Christian mind against the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
oppositions and discouragements he shall meet
with all in his way to Heaven. This the Apostle's
scope here, and doth it. 1. By an Assertion. 2. By
an Exhortation. The Assertion, that in suffering for
righteousness they are happy. The Exhortation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Assertion, that <hi>they fear not,</hi> why should
they fear any thing that are assured of happiness, yea
that are the more happy by those very things that
seem most to be feared.</p>
                  <p>The words are in part borrow'd from the Prophet
<hi>Esay,</hi> and he relates them as the Lord's words to him,
and other godly persons with him in that time, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanding
in them that carnal distrustful fear, that
drove a prophane King and people to seek help ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any where than in God. who was their strength,
<hi>fear not their fear, but sanctify the Lord, and let him
be your fear,</hi> &amp;c. Isa. 8. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:104216:70"/>
This the Apostle extends as an universal Rule for
Christians in the midst of greatest troubles and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                  <p>The things opposed here are, a perplexing troubling
fear of sufferings, as the Souls distemper, and a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of God in the Heart, as the Sovereign Cure of
it, and the true Principle of a healthful sound Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Mind.</p>
                  <p>Natural Fear, though not evil in it self, yet in the
Natural Man, is constantly irregular and disorder'd in
the actings of it, still missing its due object, or measure,
or both; either running in a wrong Channel, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
the Banks. As there are no pure Elements to
be found here in this lower part of the World, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Philosophers Books, they define them so, but
find them no where, thus we may speak of our natural
Passions as not sinful in their Nature, yet in us that
are naturally sinful, yea, full of sin, they cannot escape
the mixture and allay of it.</p>
                  <p>Sin hath put the Soul into an universal disorder, that
it neither loves nor hates what it ought, nor as it ought,
hath neither right joy, nor sorrow, nor hope, nor fear,
a very small matter stirs and troubles it; and as waters
that are stirr'd (so the Word signifies) having dregs in
the bottom become muddy and impure,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>
                     </note> thus the Soul
by carnal Fears, is confus'd, and there is neither quiet
nor clearness in it. A troubled Sea as it cannot rest, so
in its restlessness, it <hi>casts up mire,</hi> as the Prophet speaks.
Thus it is with the unrenewed Heart of Man, the least
blasts that arise disturb it, and make it restless, and its
own impurity makes it cast up mire, yea, 'tis never
right with him, either he is asleep in carnal confidence,
or being shak'd out of that, he is hurried and tumbled
too and fro with carnal Fears, either in a Lethargy,

long as it may be, and then being surpris'd, when they
come rushing on him, his fluggish ease is pay'd with a
surcharge of perplexing and affrighting fears. And is
not this the condition of the most?</p>
                  <p>Now because those Evils are not fully cured in the
Believer, but he is subject to carnal security, as <hi>David,
I said in my Prosperity, I shall never be moved,</hi> and
with undue fears and doubts in the apprehensions or
feeling of trouble, as he likewise complaining, confesses
the dejection and disquietness of his Soul, and again that
he had almost lost his standing, <hi>his feet had well nigh
slipt,</hi> therefore 'tis very needful to caveat them often
with such words as these, <hi>fear not their fear, neither be
ye troubled.</hi> If you take it objectively their fear, be
not affraid of the World's malice, or any thing it can
effect, or it may be subjectively, as the Prophet means,
do not you fear after the manner of the World, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfully
troubled, with any affliction can befall you.
Sure it is pertinent in either sense or both together,
<hi>fear not what they can do, nor fear as they do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we look on the condition of Men, our selves and
others, are not the minds of the greatest part

                  <p>Contemplative Natures have always taken notice of
this grand Malady in our Nature, and have attempted
much the cure of it, bestow'd much pains in seeking
out Prescriptions and Rules for the attainment of a
settled tranquillity of Spirit, free from the fears and
troubles that perplex us: but they have prov'd but
<hi>Mountebanks,</hi> that give big words enow, and do little or

nothing, all Physicians of no value, or of nothing, good
for nothing, as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks. Some things they have
said well concerning the outward Causes of this inward
Evil, and of the inefficacy of inferiour outward things
to help it, but they have not descended to the bottom
and inward Cause of this our wretched unquiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

                     <hi>In your hearts</hi>] To be sanctified in our Words and
Actions, but primely in our Hearts, as the Root and
Principle of the rest. He sanctifies his own through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
makes their Language and their Lives holy, but
first and most of all their Hearts, and as he chiefly
sanctifies it, it chiefly sanctifies him, acknowledges and
worships him often when the Tongue and Body do
not, and possibly cannot well joyn with it, Fears, and
Loves, and Trusts in him which properly the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man cannot do, tho' it does follow and is acted by
these affections, and so hath share in them in its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
                  <p>Beware of an external superficial sanctifying of God,
for he takes it not so, he will interpret that a prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him and his name, be not deceived, he is not mocked,
he looks through all Visages and Appearances in upon

to him, if it be possess'd with reverence and love more
than either thy tongue or carriage can express, and if

never so Excellent, and the more thou hast seemed to
sanctifie God while thy heart hath not been chief in the
business, thou shalt not by such service have the less, but
the more fear and trouble in the day of trouble, when
it comes upon thee. No estate so far off from true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
and so full of horrors, as that of the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Hypocrite, his rotten Heart is sooner shakt to
pieces, than any other. If you would have heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peace
in God, you must have this heart sanctifying of
him. 'Tis the heart that is vex'd and troubled with fears,
the disease is there, and if the prescribed remedy reach
not thither, 'twill do no good, but let your hearts
sanctifie him, and then he shall fortifie and establish
your hearts.</p>
                  <p>This sanctifying of God in the Heart, composes the
Heart and frees it from fears.</p>
                  <p>1. In general, the turning of the Heart to consider
and regard God, takes its off from those vain, empty,
windy things that are the usual causes and matter of
its fears, it feeds on wind, and therefore the bowels are
tormented within, the Heart is subject to disturbance,
because it lets out it self to such things, and lets in such
things into it self as are ever in motion, and full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability
and restlesness, and so cannot be at quiet till
God come in and cast out these, to keep the Heart
within, that it wander out no more to them.</p>
                  <p>2. The particulars of Fear and Faith, work particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in this.</p>
                  <p>1. That Fear, as greatest, overtops and nullifies all
losser fears, the Hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> possess'd with this fear, hath no
room for the other, it resolves the Heart in point of
duty, what it should and must do, not offend God by
any means, lays that down as indisputable, and so eases it
of doubtings and debates in that kind, whether shall I
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104216:73"/>
comply with the World, and abate somewhat of the
sincerity and exact way of Religion to please Men, or to
escape persecution or reproaches; no, 'tis unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
best, and only necessary to obey him rather than
Men, to retain his favour be it with displeasing the
most respected and considerable Persons we know, yea,
rather chuse the universal and highest displeasure of all
the World for ever, than his smallest discountenance
for a moment; counts that the only indispensible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to cleave unto God and obey him. If I pray,
I shall be accused, might <hi>Daniel</hi> think, but yet pray I
must, come on't what will, so if I worship God in my
Prayer, they will mock me, I shall pass for a Fool, no
matter for that, it must be done, I must call on God
and strive to walk with him; this puts the mind to an
ease, not to be hanging betwixt two, but resolv'd what
to do,<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>we are not careful,</hi> said they, <hi>to answer thee, O
King, our God can deliver us:</hi> but however, this we
have put out of deliberation, we will not worship the
Image: As one said, <hi>non oportet vivere sed oportet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigare,</hi>
'tis not necessary to have the Favour of the
World, nor to have Riches, nor to Live; but 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to hold fast the Truth, and to walk Holily, to
sanctifie the name of our Lord, and Honour him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Life or Death.</p>
                  <p>2. Faith in God clears the mind, and dispels carnal
fears, the most sure help, <hi>what time I am afraid</hi> (says
<hi>David) I will trust in thee.</hi> It resolves the mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the event, and scatters the multitude of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
thoughts that arise about that, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of this and that? what if such an enemy prevail?
what if the place of our abode grow dangerous, and we
be not provided as others are for a removal? no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and Art cannot break in upon, or demolish, a high
Defence, <hi>my Rock in whom I trust,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 62. 5, 6.
The firm belief of, and resting on his Power, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Love, gives a clear satisfying answer to all
doubts and fears. It suffers us not to stand to jangle
with each triffling grumbling objection, but carries all
before it, makes day in the Soul, and so chases away those
fears that vex us only in the dark, as affrightful fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
do. This is indeed to sanctifie God, and give him
his own Glory, to rest on him; and it is a fruitful
homage done to him, returning us so much Peace and
Victory over Fears and Troubles, perswades us that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can separate from his Love, and that only we
fear'd, and so the things that cannot reach that, can
be easily despised.</p>
                  <p>Seek to have the Lord in your Hearts, and sanctifie
him there, he shall make them strong, and carry
them through all dangers, <hi>though I walk,</hi> says <hi>David,
through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
ill, for thou art with me,</hi> Psal. 23. so Psal. 27. 1. What
is it makes the Church so firm and stout, <hi>though the Sea
roar, and the Mountains be cast into the midst of the Sea:</hi>
yet we will not fear, that's it, <hi>God is in the midst of
her, she shall not be moved.</hi> No wonder, he immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and therefore doth establish all where he resides.
If the World in the middle of the Heart, it will be
often shaken, for all there is continual motion and
change, but God in it keeps it stable.</p>
                  <p>Labour to get God into your Hearts, residing in the
midst of them, and then in the midst of all Conditions
they shall not move.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In your hearts.</hi>] Our condition universally exposed
to search and troubles, and no man so stupid but studies
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104216:74"/>
and projects for some Fence against them, some Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
to break the incursion of Evils, and so put his
mind to some ease, ridding it of the fear of them, thus
the most vulgar Spirits in their way, for even the
Brutes from whom such do not much differ in their
actings and course of Life too, are instructed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to provide themselves and their young Ones of
Shelters, and the Birds their Nests, and the Beasts their
Holes and Dens. Thus men gape and pant after gain,
with a confus'd ill-examin'd fancy of quiet and safety in
it, once to reach such a day as to say with him in the
Gospel, <hi>Soul take thine ease, thou hast much Goods laid up
for many years,</hi> &amp;c. though warn'd by his short ease
there, and by many watch words, yea, by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that days may come, yea, one day will, where
fear and trouble shall rush in, and break over the
highest Tower of Riches, that there is a day call'd the
Day of Wrath, wherein they profit not at all, thus
Men seek Safety in Greatness, or Multitude, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Faithfulness of Friends, seek by any means to be
strongly underset this way, to have many, and powerful,
and confident Friends.</p>
                  <p>But wiser m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n perceiving the unsafety and vanity of
these, and all external things, have cast about for
some higher Course, they see a necessity of retiring, a
Man from externals that do nothing, but mock and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
most those that trust most to them, but they
cannot well tell whither to direct him, the best of
them bring him into himself, and think to quiet him
so, but the Truth is, he finds as little there, nothing
truly strong enough within him, to hold out against
the many sorrows and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ears that still from without do
assault him, so then though 'tis well done to call off a
a Man from outward things, as moving Sands, that he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104216:74"/>
build not on them, yet 'tis not enough done, for his
own spirit is as unsettled a piece as is in all the World,
and must have some higher strength than its own to
fortifie and fix it. This is the way that is here taught,
<hi>fear not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but sanctifie the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and if you
can attain this latter, the former will follow of it
self.</p>
                  <p>1. Generally, God taking the place formerly possess'd
by things full of motion and unquietness, solids and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishes
the Heart.</p>
                  <p>2. Particularly, Consider, 1. Fear of him. 2. Faith
in him.</p>
                  <p>His Fear turns other fears out of doors, no room for
them where this great Fear is, and being greater than
they all, yet disturbs not as they do, yea, brings as
great quiet as they brought trouble, 'tis an ease to have
but one thing for the heart to deal withal, for many
times the multitude of carnal fears is more troublesome
than their weight, as flies that vex most by their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>Again, This fear is not a terrible apprehension of
God as an Enemy, but a sweet composed reverence of
God as our King, yea, as our Father, very great, but no
less good than great, so highly esteeming of his favour,
as fearing most of all things to offend him in any kind,
especially if the Soul have been formerly either under
the lash of his apprehended displeasure, or on the other
side have had some sensible tastes of his love, and hath
been entertained in his Banqueting-House, where his
Banner over it was Love. Faith carries the Soul above
all doubts, that if sufferings, or sickness, or death come,
nothing can separate it from him, this suffices, yea, what
though he may hide his face for a time, the hardest of
all, yet no separation. His Children fear him for his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104216:75"/>
Goodness, are afraid to lose sight of that, or prejudge
themselves of any of its influences, desire to live in his
favour, and then for other things they are not much
thoughtful.</p>
                  <p>2. Faith sets the Soul in God, and if there be not
safety, where is it? rests on those perswasions it hath
concerning him, and that interest it hath in him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
that he sits and rules the Affairs of the World
with an all-seeing Eye, and all-moving Hand: the
greatest Affairs surcharge him not, and the very smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lost
escape him not, orders the march of all Armies, and
the events of Battels, and yet thou and thy particular
condition slips not out of his view, the very hairs of thy
head are numbred, are not all thy steps and the hazards
of them known to him? and all thy desires before him,
doth he not number thy wandrings? every weary step
thou art driven to, and put thy tears in his Bottle, thou
mayest assure thy self that however thy matters seem to
go, all is contriv'd to subserve thy Good, chiefly thy
chief and highest Good, there is a regular Motion in
them, though the Wheels do look to run cross, all those
things are against me, said old <hi>Iacob,</hi> and yet they were
all for him.</p>
                  <p>In all estates I know no hearts ease, but to believe, to
sanctifie and honour thy God in resting on his Word;
if thou art perswaded of his Love, sure that will carry
above all distrusting fears, if thou art not clear in that
point, yet depend and resolve to stay by him, yea, to
stay on him, till he shew himself unto thee, thou hast
some fear of him, thou canst not deny it without
gross injury to him and thy self, wouldst willingly
walk in all well-pleasing unto him, well then, <hi>who is
among you that feareth the Lord,</hi> though he see no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
light, <hi>yet let him trust in the name of the Lord and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104216:75"/>
stay upon his God.</hi> Press this upon thy Soul, for there
is not another charm for all its fears and unquiet, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
repeat it still with <hi>David,</hi> sing this still, till it be
stilled, chide thy distrustful heart into believing, <hi>why
art thou cast down, O my Soul! why art thou disquieted
within me? hope in God, for I shall yet praise him,</hi> though
I'm all out of tune for the present, never a right string
in my Soul, yet he will put to his hand and redress all,
and I shall yet once again praise, and therefore even now
I will hope.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, God is a safe shelter and refuge, but he
is holy, and holy Men may find admittance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
but can so vile a sinner as I look to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
and taken in under his safe guard? Go try,
knock at his Door, and take it not on our word, but
on his own, <hi>it shall be opened to thee,</hi> and once thou
shall have a happy life on't in the worst times. Faith
hath this priviledge never to be asham'd, it takes
Sanctuary in God, and sits and sings under the shadow
of his wings, as <hi>David</hi> speaks, <hi>Ps.</hi> 63.</p>
                  <p>Whence the unsettledness of minds in trouble, when
'tis near? but because they are far off from God, the heart
shak't as the leaves of the Tree with the wind, no
stability of Spirit, God not sanctified in it, and no
wonder, for not known. Strange! the ignorance of
God and the precious Promises of his word, the most
living and dying strangers to him, when trouble
comes have not him a known refuge, but are to begin
to seek after him, and to enquire the way to him,
cannot go to him as acquainted, and ingaged by his
own covenant with them, others have empty know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and can discourse of Scripture, and Sermons,
and Spiritual Comforts, and yet have none of that fear,
and trust that quiets the Soul, notions of God in their
heads, but God not sanctified in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:104216:76"/>
If you will be advised, this is the way to have a
high and strong spirit indeed, and to be above troubles
and fears, seek for a more lively and Divine Knowledge
of God than most as yet have, and rest not till you
bring him into your hearts, and then you shall rest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in him.</p>
                  <p>Sanctifie him by fearing him, <hi>let him be your fear and
your dread,</hi> not only outward gross offences, fear an
Oath, fear to prophane the Lord's Holy Day: but fear all
irregular earthly desires, the distemper'd affecting any
thing, entertaining any thing in the secret of your
hearts that may give distaste to your beloved, take
heed, respect the great Person you have in you Company
and lodges within you, the holy Spirit, grieve him
not, for it will turn to your own grief if you do: for
all your comfort is in his hand, and flows from him,
if you be but in heart dallying with sin, it will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
you for suffering, outward troubles, and make your
spirit low and base in the day of tryal, yea it will fill
you with inward trouble and disturb that peace which
I am sure you that know, esteem more of, then all
the peace and flourishing of this World. Outward
troubles do not molest nor stir inward peace, but an
unholy unsanctified affection doth, all the winds without,
cause not an earth quake, but that within its own bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
doth. Christians are much their own enemies in
unwary walking, prejudge themselves of those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
they might have in God, and so are often almost
as perplex'd and full of fears upon small occasions as
worldlings are.</p>
                  <p>Sanctifie him by believing, study the main question
your reconcilement with him, labour to bring that
to some point, and then in all other occurrences Faith
will uphold you by relying on God as now yours: for
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104216:76"/>
those three things make up the Souls peace. 1. To
have right apprehension of God, looking on him in
Christ and according to that covenant that holds in
him. And 2. A particular apprehension, that is lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold on him in that covenant as gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
as satisfied and appeased in Christ, smelling in his
sacrifice, which was himself, a savour of rest, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himself before me that I may rely on him in that
notion. 3. A perswasion that by so relying on him
my Soul is at one, yea is one with him, yet while
this is wanting, as to a Believer it may be, the other
is our duty to Sanctifie the Lord in believing the
word of Grace, and believing on him, reposing on
his Word, and this even sever'd from the other doth
deliver in a good measure from distracting fears and
troubles, and sets the Soul at safety.</p>
                  <p>Whence is it that in times of Persecution or Trouble,
Men are troubl'd within and rackt with fears, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

things that are in hazard by those troubles without,
their estates or their ease, or their lives; the Soul destitute
of God esteems so highly of such things, that it cannot
but exceedingly feel when they are in danger, and fear
their loss most, gaping after some imagin'd good, and
Oh! i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

designs, but such as are so easily blasted, and still as
any thing in Man lists up his Soul to vanity, it must
needs fall down again into vexation. There is a word
or two in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> for <hi>Idols,</hi> that signifie withal
<hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Terrors,</hi> and so 'tis certainly: All our Idols
prove so to us, fill us with nothing but anguish and
troubles, with unprofitable cares and fears that are
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104216:77"/>
good for nothing but to be fit punishments of that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
out of which they arise. The ardent love or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
desire of Prosperity, or Wealth, or Credit in the
World carries with it, as inseparably ty'd to it, a bundle
of fears and inward troubles. <hi>They that will be rich</hi>
(says the Apostle) <hi>fall into a snare and many noysome and
hurtful lusts,</hi> and as he adds in the next Verse, <hi>they
pierce themselves through with many sorrows.</hi> He that
hath set his Heart upon an Estate, or a commodious
Dwelling and Lands, or upon a healthful and long
Life, cannot but be in continued alarms of renewed fears
concerning them, especially in troublous times, the
least rumor of any thing that threatneth his deprive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those advantages strikes him to the heart; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his heart is in them, I am well seated, thinks he,
and I am of a sound strong constitution, and may have
many a good day. Oh! but beside the Arrows of
Pestilence that are flying round about, the Sword of
a cruel Enemy is not far off, this will affright and
trouble a heart void of God; but if thou wouldst rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
answer and dispel all these and such like fears,
<hi>Sanctifie the Lord God in thy Heart,</hi> the Soul that eyes
God renounces these things, looks on them at a great
distance, as things far from the Heart, and therefore
that cannot easily trouble it, but looks on God as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Heart, sanctifies <hi>him in it</hi> and rests on him.</p>
                  <p>The Word of God cures the many foolish hopes and
fears that we are naturally sick of, by representing to
us hopes and fears of a far higher Nature, which swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

hath the greatest calumnies and prejudices cast upon it,
and this engages those that love it to endeavour to
clear and disburden it of them, this they do chiefly by
the Tract of their Lives, the Saints by their blameless
Actions and patient Sufferings, do write most real and
convincing Apologies, yet sometimes 'tis expedient, yea,

were usually the fittest answer, but where the holy
Profession of Christians is likely to receive either the

                  <p>Christian Prudence goes much in the regulating of
this: for holy Things are not to be cast to Dogs,

some are not capable of rational Answers, especially in
Divine Things, they were not only lost upon them,
but Religion indignified by contesting: but every one
that enquires a reason or an account, which supposes
something receptive of it, we ought to judge our selves
engaged to give it, be it an Enemy if he will hear, if it
gain him not, it may in part convince and cool him,
much more be it one that ingenuously enquires for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and possibly inclines to receive the Truth; but
is prejudic'd against it by false misrepresentations of it,
as Satan and the prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such shapes and colours as may make Truth most odious,
drawing monstrous misconsequences out of it, and bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Practices of Christians, making their Assemblies
horrible and vile by false imputations, and thus are
they often necessitated to declare the true Tenor, both
of their Belief and Lives in Confessions of Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances
of their carriage and custom.</p>
                  <p>The very name of Christians in the Primitive Times
was made ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wickednesses committed in their Meetings, and past
credibly through with all that were not particularly
acquainted with them, thus the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and so both
were forc'd to publish Apologies, and as here, every
one bound seasonably to clear himself and his Brethren
and Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be always ready</hi>] So not always to be done to every
one, but being ready to do, 'tis to be considered, when,
and to whom, and how far.</p>
                  <p>2. But all that they are to give account of, is compris'd
here under this, <hi>the hope that is in you.</hi> Faith is the
Root of Graces; and of all Obedience and Holiness,
and Hope is so near in Nature to it, that the one is
commonly named for the other, for the things that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104216:78"/>
Faith apprehends and lays hold on as present in the
Truth of Divine Promises, Hope looks out for as to
come in their certain performance, to believe a promise
to be true before it be perform'd, is no other but to
believe that it shall be performed, and hope expects
that.</p>
                  <p>Many rich and excellent things do the Saints receive
even in this mean despised condition they have here,
but their hope is rather mention'd as the subject they
may speak and give account of with most advantage,
both because all they receive in present, is but as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to what they hope for, and because such as it is,
it cannot be made known at all to a natural Man, and
is so clouded with their afflictions and sorrows, these he
sees, but their Graces and Comforts he cannot see; and
therefore the very ground of higher hopes, somewhat
to come, though he knows not what it is, speaks more
satisfaction: To hear of another life and a happiness
hoped for, any man will confess it sayes something,
and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>erves to be considered.</p>
                  <p>So then the whole Sum of Religion goes under this
word, <hi>the hope that is in you,</hi> for two Reasons. 1. For
that it doth indeed all resolve and terminate into
things to come, and leads and carries on the Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them by all the Graces in it, and all the exercise
of them, and all through ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ices and sufferings, and
aims at this as its main scope, to keep that li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>e to come
in the Believers eye, till he get it in his hand, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the hope of it, and bring him home to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
it. Therefore the Apostle calls Faith, <hi>the substance
of things hoped for,</hi> that which makes them be before
they be, gives a solidity and su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of all other hopes but this 'tis a very true Word,<note place="margin">[Spes est no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men boni in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certi. <hi>Sen.</hi>]</note> 
                     <hi>that
'tis the name of an uncertain good;</hi> but the Gospel being
entertain'd by Faith, furnishes a hope that hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and reality in it, and all its Truths do concenter
into this, to give such a hope. There was in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
word, besides the fitness for his stratagem at that time, a
Truth suitable to this, where he assigns his whole
Cause for which he was in question by the name of his
<hi>hope of the resurrection.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts. 23.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed this Hope carries its own apology in it
for it self and for Religion. What can more pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answer all exceptions against the way of Godliness
than this, to represent what hopes the Saints have that
walk in that way. If you ask whither tends all this
your preciseness and singularity; why can't you live as
your Neighbours and the rest of the world about you?
Truly the reason is this, we have somewhat further to
look to than our present condition, and far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
than any thing here; we have a hope of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
after time, a hope to dwell in the presence of
God, where our Lord Christ is gone before us, and we
know, that <hi>as many as have this hope, must purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
even as he is pure.</hi> The City we tend to is holy,
and no unclean thing shall enter into it, the hopes we
have cannot subsist in the way of the ungodly world,
they cannot breath in that air, but are choak'd and
sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>'d with it, and therefore we must take another way,
unless we will forego our hopes and ruin our selves for
company. But all that busle of Godliness you make,
is but oftentation and hypocrisie: that may be your
judgment,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> but if it were so, we had but a poor bargain,
<hi>they have their reward,</hi> that which they desire <hi>(to be
seen, of Men)</hi> is given them, and they can look for no
more; but we wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ld be loath it were so with us, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104216:79"/>
which our eye is on, is to come, our hopes are the
thing upholds us, we know that we shall appear before
the Judge of hearts, where shews and formalities will
not pass, and we are perswaded, that <hi>the hope of the
hypocrite shall perish,</hi> no Man shall be so much disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and ashamed as he, but the hope that we have
makes not ashamed: and while we consider that so
far are we from the regard of Men's Eyes, that were
it not we are bound to profess our hope and avow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to walk like it even before Men, we would
be content to pass through altogether unseen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to pass as if it were so, as regardless either of the
approbation, or of the reproaches and mistakes of
Men, as if there were no such thing, for it is indeed
nothing.</p>
                  <p>Yea the hopes we have make all things sweet,
therefore do we go through disgraces and sufferings
with patience, yea with joy, because of that hope of
Glory, and joy laid up for us. A Christian can take
joyfully the spoylings of his Goods, knowing that
he hath in Heaven a better and an enduring substance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The hope.</hi>] All the estate of a Believer lyeth in hope,
and 'tis a Royal estate, for outward things, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God have what he thinks fit to serve them,
but those are not their portion, and therefore he gives
often more of the World to these that shall have no
more hereafter; but all their flourish and lustre is but
a base advantage, as a Lacquey's gaudy Cloaths that
usually make more shew than his that is heir of the
estate. How often under a mean outward condition and
very despicable every way, goes an heir of Glory,
born of God, and so Royal, born to a Crown that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

hopes, that the least thought of them surpasses all the

World's Possessions. Men think somwhat for present,
a bird in hand, as you say, the best on't, but the odds is
in this, that when all present things shall be past, and
swept away, as if they had not been, then shall these
Hopers be in et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Oh! how much happier to be the meanest Expectant
of the Glory to come, than alone Possessor of all this
World, these are often held short in earthly things,
and had they the greatest abundance of them yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rest in that; so all the spiritual blessings that they
do possess here, are nothing to the hopes that is in
them, but as an earnest penny to their great inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;

them of that full estate, and therefore be it never so

looking on it as simply in it self, as what it is in relation

                  <p>'Tis the grand comfort of a Christian to look often
beyond all that he can possess or attain here, and as
to answer others, when he is put to it concerning his
hope, so to answer himself concerning all his present
griefs and wants, I have a poor travellers lot here,
little friendship, and many straits, but yet I may go
cheerfully homewards, for thither I shall come, and
there I have riches, and honour enough, a Palace and

breaking in upon me, but for all that I have
assured hope of a full victory, and then of everlasting
peace. I find a law in my members rebelling against
the law of my mind, the worst of all evils, so much
strength of corruption within me, yet there is withal
a hope within me of deliverance, and I look over all
to that, I li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out into invectives, because he hath the better on't

some think themselves certainly authoriz'd to rough

side, on the contrary, so much the rather study meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the glory and advantage of the truth, it needs
not the service of passion, yea nothing so disserves it,
as passion when set to serve it; the spirit of truth is withal
the Spirit of meekness, the Dove that rested on that great
Champion of truth, who is the Truth it self, and from
him is derived to the lovers of truth, and they ought
to seek the participation of it. Imprudence makes some
kind of Christians lose much of their labour, speaking
for Religion, and drive those further off that they would

to whom he answers, but still he fears his God for
whom he answers, and whose interest is chief in
those things he speaks of. The Soul that hath the

When all is examin'd, 'twill be found to be no other,
but the <hi>mind of man under the Notion of a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to himself and his own Actions.</hi> And there is a
twofold goodness of the Conscience, <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,</hi>
and this flows from the other, so that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is the thing we ought primely to study, and the
latter will follow of it self: for a time indeed the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that is in a good measure pure, may be unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but still it is the apprehension and sense of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or former impurity that makes it so, for without
the consideration of guiltiness, there is nothing that can
trouble it, it cannot apprehend the wrath of God, but
with relation unto sin.</p>
                  <p>The Goodness of Conscience here recommended, is
<hi>the integrity and holiness of the whole inward Man in a
Christian,</hi> so the Ingredients of it are, 1. A due Light
or Knowledge of our Rule, that as the Lamps in the
Temple must be still burning within, as filthiness is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the companion of darkness; therefore if you
would have a good Conscience, you must by all means
have so much Light, so much Knowledge of the Will
of God, as may regulate you, and shew you your
way, teach you how to do, and speak, and think, as in
his presence. 2. A constant regard and using of this
Light, applying it to all, not sleeping, but working
by it, still seeking a nearer conformity with the known
will of our God, daily redressing and ordering the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
by it, not sparing to knock off whatsoever we
find irregular within, that our hearts may be polish'd,
and brought to a right Frame by that Rui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>: and this
is the daily inward Work of the Christian, his great
business to purifie himself as his Lord is pure.</p>
                  <p>And 3. For the advancing of this work is needful, a
frequent search of our Hearts and of our Actions, not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104216:85"/>
only to consider what we are to do but what we have
done, these reflex inquiries, as they are a main part of
the Conscience's proper work, they are a chief means
of making and keeping the Conscience good. 1 Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
the Soul with its own estate, with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and inclinations that are most natural to it. 2. Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it up to work out, and purge away by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
the pollution it h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>th contracted by any outward
act or inward motion of sin. 3. This search both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
and enables the conscience to be more watchful,
teaches how to avoid and prevent the like errors for
the time to come; as natural wise Men labour to
gain thus out of their former oversight in their affairs,
to be the wiser and warier by them, and lay up that
as bought wit, that they have payed dear for, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are careful to make their best advantage on't; God
makes the consideration of their falls, preservatives
to his Children from falling, makes a medicine of this
poyson. Thus that the Conscience may be good it
must be enlighten'd, and it must be watchful, both
advising before, and after censuring according to that
light.</p>

                  <p>On this follows a good Conversation, as inseparably
connexed with a good Conscience. Grace is of a lively

the inequality of some Christians ways doth
breed much discredit to Religion and discomfort to

                  <p>But observe here. 1. The order of these two.
2. The principle of both.</p>
                  <p>1. The Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ience good, and then the Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
make the tree good, and the fruit will be good,
says our Saviour, so here a good Conscience the root
of a good Conversation; most Men begin at the wrong
end of this work, would reform the outward Man
first, that will do no good, 'twil be but dead
work.</p>
                  <p>Do not rest upon external reformations, they will
not hold, there is no abiding nor no advantage in
such a work, you think when reprov'd, Oh! I will
mend and set about the redress of some outward things
but this is as good as to do nothing, the Mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
being defiled (as the Apostle speaks) doth
defile all the rest, 'tis a mire in the spring although
the pipes are cleansed, they will grow quickly fowl
again; so Christians in their progress in grace, would
eye this most, that the Conscience be growing purer,
the heart more spiritual, the affections more regular,
and heavenly, and their outward carriage will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
whereas the outward work of performing duties
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104216:86"/>
and being much exercis'd in Religion, may by the
neglect of this, be labour in vain, and amend nothing
foundly. To set the outward Actions right, though
with an honest Intention, and not so to regard and find
out the inward disorder of the Heart, whence that in
the Actions flows, is but to be still putting the Handle
of a Clock right with your Finger, while 'tis foul or out
of order within, which is a continual business and does
no good. Oh! but a purified Conscience, a Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
and refin'd in its temper and affections, will
make things go right without, in all the duties and
acts of our Callings.</p>
                  <p>2. The Principle of Good in both is Christ. <hi>Your
good Conversation in Christ.</hi> The Conversation not
good unless in him, so neither the Conscience.</p>
                  <p>1. He the Person, must be in him, and then the

Conscience that is morally good, having some kind of
vertuous Habits, yet being out of Christ, is nothing
but pollution in the fight of God, it must be washt in

cleanse it, floods of tears will not do it, 'tis blood, and

than to suffer either for doing evil, or simply to suffer in
that way as the Words run.</p>
                  <p>1. The way of the ungodly not exempt for suffering
even in present, setting aside the judgement and wrath
to come, often from the hands of men whether justly
or unjustly, and often from the immediate hand of
God always just, both in that and the other. causing
the Sinner to ear of the Fruit of his own ways: When
prophane ungodly men offer violences and wrongs one
to another; in this God is just against both, in that
wherein they themselves are both unjust; they are
both rebellious against him, and so though they intend
not his quarrel, he means it himself; sets them to
lash one another. As the wicked profess their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
enmity against the Children of God, yet they
are not always at peace amongst themselves: They
often revile and desame each other, so 'tis held up
on both sides, whereas the godly cannot hold them
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104216:88"/>
game in that, being like their Lord, <hi>who when he was
reviled, reviled not again.</hi> Besides, although the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flourish at sometimes, yet they have their days of
suffering, are subject to the common miseries of the
life of Man, and the common calamities of evil times;
the Sword and Pestilence and such like publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Now in what kind soever it be that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
they are at a great disadvantage compared with
the godly in their sufferings.</p>
                  <p>Here impure Consciences may lie sleeping while
they are at ease themselves, but when any great trouble
comes and shakes them, then readily the Conscience
begins to awake, and busle, and proves more grievous
to them than all that comes on them from without.
When they remember their despising the ways of God,
neglecting him and holy things, whence they are
convinc'd, how that comfort might be reapt in these
days of distress, this cuts and galls them most, looking
back at their licentious prophane ways, each of them
strikes to the heart. As the Apostle calls sin, <hi>the sting
of death,</hi> so is it of all sufferings, and the Sting that
strikes deepest into the very Soul:<note place="margin">Surdo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere caedit. <hi>Juv.</hi>
                     </note> no stripes like
those that are secretly given by an accusing Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>A sad condition to have from thence the greatest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
where the most comfort should be expected, to have
thickest darkness, whence they should look for most
light. Men that have evil Consciences, love not to be
with them; are not much with themselves, as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
compares them to such as have shrew'd Wives,
love not to be at home: but yet, outward distress
sets a Man inward, as foul weather drives him home,
and there where he should find comfort, he is met
with such accusations, as are like a continual dropping, as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104216:89"/>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, of a contentious Woman. It is a most
wretched estate to live under sufferings or afflictions
of any kind, and a stranger to God; then a Man hath
God, and his Conscience against him that should be
his solace in times of distress, being knocked off from
the comforts of the World whereon he rested, and
having no Provision of spiritual comfort within, nor
expectation from above. But the Children of God in
their sufferings (especially such as are for God) can
retire themselves inwards, and rejoyce in the testimony
of a good Conscience, yea the Possession of Christ dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
within them. All the trouble that befalls them,
is but as the ratling of Hail upon the Tiles of the House
to a man, that is sitting within a warm Room at a rich
Banquet; such is a good Conscience, a Feast, yea, a
continual Feast. The Believer looks on his Christ, and
in him reads his deliverance from condemnation, and
that is a strong Comfort, a Cordial that keeps him
from fainting in the greatest distresses. The Conscience
gives this testimony that sin is forgiven, raises the
Soul above inward sufferings. Tell the Christian of
loss of Goods, or Liberty, or Friends, or Life, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
all with this, Christ is mine, and my sin is
pardoned. That's enough for me. What would I not
have suffered to have been delivered from the wrath of
God; if any suffering of mine in this World could have
done that, now that is done to my hand. All other
sufferings are light, they are light, and but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
one thought of Eternity drowns the whole time,
the World's endurance, which is but as one instant or
twinkling of an eye betwixt eternity before, and eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
after, how much less is any short life, and a small
part that is spent in sufferings though it were all
sufferings without interruption, which yet it is not:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104216:89"/>
when I look forward to the Crown, all vanishes, and
I think it less than nothing. Now these things the good
Conscience speaks to the Christian in his sufferings;
therefore certainly his choice is best that provides it for
his Companion against evil and troubleous times: if
moral Integrity went so far, as truly it did much in
some men that had much of it, that they scorn'd all
hard Encounters, and esteemed this a sufficient Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,
a strength impregnable, <hi>Hic murus Aheneus esto,
nil conscire sibi,</hi> how much more the Christians good
Conscience, which alone is truly such.</p>
                  <p>2. As the Christian may thus look inward and rejoyce
in tribulation, so there is another look upward that is
here likewise mention'd, that allays very much all
the sufferings of the Saints. <hi>If such be the will of
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Christian mind hath still one eye to this above
the hand of men, and all inferiour causes, in suffering
whether for the name of God or otherwise: Looks on
the Sovereign will of God, and sweetly complies with
that in all. Neither is there any thing that doth more
powerfully compose and quiet the mind, than this,
makes it invincibly firm and content, when it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this resignment of it self to the will of God, to
agree to that in every thing. This is the very thing
wherein tranquility of spirit lies; it is no riddle, nor
hard to understand, yet few attain it. And I pray
you, what is thus gained by our reluctancies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinings,
but pain to our selves? he doth what he will,
whether we consent or no, our disagreeing doth not
prejudge his Purposes but our own Peace, if we will not
be led, we are drawn, we must suffer if he will, but if
we will what he wills, even in suffering that makes it
sweet and easie, when our mind goes along with his,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104216:90"/>
and we willingly move with that stream of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which will carry us with it, though we row
against it; and we still have nothing but toyl and
weariness for our pains.</p>
                  <p>But this hard Argument of Necessity is needless,
to the Child of God, perswaded of the Wisdom and Love
of his Father, knows that to be truly best for him that
his hand reaches. Sufferings are unpleasant to the flesh,
and it will grumble, but the Voice of the Spirit of God
in his Children, is that of that good King, good is the
Will of the Lord, let him do with me as seems good in
his eyes. My foolish heart would think these things
I suffer might be abated, but my wise and heavenly
Father thinks otherwise; he hath his design of honour
to himself, and good to me in these, which I would be
loath to cross if I might: I may do God more service
by these advantages, but doth not he know best what
fits, cannot he advance his Grace more by the want of
these things I desire, than I could do my self by
having them? cannot he make me a gainer by Sickness,
and Poverty, and Disgraces, and loss of Friends and
Children, by making up all in himself, and teaching
me more of his all-sufficiency? yea, even concerning
the Affairs of my Soul I am to give up all to his good
pleasure, though desiring the light of his countenance
above all things in this World, yet if he see it fit to hide
it sometimes, if that be his will, let me not murmur,
there is nothing lost by this obedient temper, yea what
way soever he deals with us there is much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in it. No Soul shall enjoy so much in all estates
as that which hath devested and renounced it self, and
hath no will but Gods.</p>

                  <p>Though the Doctrine of Christian suffering is the
occasion of speaking of Christ's suffering, yet he insists
on it beyond the simple necessity of that Argument,

poreing on our own suffering, and when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

absurd thought to dream of an exemption: would
any one have a new untroden way cut out for him free
of Thorns, and strewed with Flowers all along, no
contradictions nor hard measure from the World; or
imagine that there may be such a dexterity necessary as
to keep its good will, and the friendship of God too,
this will not be, and its an universal conclusion, all that
will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution;
this is the Path to the Kingdom, that which all the
Sons of God, the Heirs of it have gone in, even Christ, as

                  <p>The example and company of the Saints in suffering

laid in wait and sought for. Art thou mean in thy
birth, and life, despised, misjudged, and reviled on all

his sufferings rose in the end, that most remarkable

                     <hi>he was numbred amongst

Christian is subject to grievous tentations and sad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that are heavier by far than the sufferings
which indeed the Apostle speaks of here; yet even in
these this same Argument of his holds: for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
is not unacquainted with, nor ignorant of either
of those, though still without sin, and if any of that
had been in any of his sufferings it had not further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but undone all our Comfort in him. But tempted
he was, he suffered that way too, and the tentations
were terrible as you know; and was there not some
strong conflict when he fell down and prayed in the
Garden, and sweat drops of blood, and an Ecclipse when
he cried out on the Cross, <hi>my God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me,</hi> so that even in these we may apply
this comfort, and stay our selves or Souls on him, and
go to him as a compassionate high Priest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15,

Example of those that they have near relation to; they

                  <p>3.<note place="margin">The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> There is from these sufferings such a result of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and comfort to a Christian that makes them a most

he suffered once, and that was for sin, now that heavy
intollerable suffering for sin once taken out of a Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
way, it makes all other sufferings light, exceeding light,
as nothing in their account. He suffered once for sin, so
that to them that lay hold on him this holds sure, that sin
is never to be suffered for in the way of strict Justice
again, as not by him, so not by them that are in sin;
for he suffered for sins once and it was for their sins,
every poor Believer's? So now the Soul finding it

a Man sure of these, yet if his Conscience be working and
stirred about the matter of his sin, and the wrath of God,

in that you speak so far from the purpose; say what

I feel even an impress of somewhat of that hot Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
some flashes of it flying and lighting upon
the face of my Soul, and how can I take pleasure in
these things you speak of. And though I should be
sensless and feel nothing of this all my life, yet how soon
shall I have done with it, and the delights that reach no
further, and then to have Everlasting burnings, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of wrath to enter to, how can I be satisfyed with
that estate. All you offer a Man in this posture is as
if ye should set dainty fair and bring musick with it to
a Man lying almost pressed to death under great weights,
and ye bid him eat and be merry, but lift not off his
pressure, you do but mock the Man and add to his
misery. On the other side he that hath got but a view
of his Christ and reads his own pardon in Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
he can rejoyce in this in the midst of all other
sufferings, and look on death without apprehension,
yea with gladness, the sting is out: Christ hath made
all pleasant to him by this one thing, that he suffered
once for sins. Christ hath perfum'd the Cross, and
the Grave, and made all sweet. The pardoned Man
finds himself light, skips and leaps, and through Christ
strengthning him he can encounter with any trouble. If
you think to shut in his Spirit within outward sufferings,
it is now as <hi>Sampson</hi> in his strength, able to carry away
the Gates on his back that you would shut one withal,
yea can submit patiently to the Lords hands in any
correction. Thou hast forgiven my sin, therefore
deal with me as thou wilt, all is well.</p>
                  <p>1. Learn to consider more deeply, and esteem more
highly of Christ and his suffering, to silence our grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at our petty light crosses, for so they are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison

will not the sense of that Redemption of our Souls
from death by his death, will none of these, nor all of
them argue us into more thankfulness, and love to him,
and patience in our tryals; Why will we then be called
Christians?<note place="margin">[Enimvero non sentient sua qui illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us vulnera intuetur <hi>Bern. in Cant. Serm.</hi> 61.]</note> it is impossible to be fretful and malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the Lord's dealing with us in any kind till first
we have forgot how he dealt with his dearest Son for
our sakes. But these things are not weigh'd by the
most, we hear and speak of them, but our hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not the impressions of them: therefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
against our Lord and Father, and drown a hundred
great blessings in any little touch of trouble that befalls
us.</p>
                  <p>2. Seek surer interest in Christ and his suffering than
the most either have attained or are aspiring to, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all that is here suffered will not ease or comfort
thee any thing, in any kind of suffering, no though
thou suffer for a good cause, even for his cause, still
this will be an extraneous foraign thing to thee, to
tell thee of his sufferings will work no otherwise with
thee than some other common story. And as in the
day of peace thou regardest it no more, so in the day
of thy trouble thou shalt receive no more comfort from
it. Other things you esteemed shall have no comfort
to speak to you, <hi>though you persue them with words</hi>
(as <hi>Solomon</hi> says of the poor Man's friends) <hi>yet they
shall be wanting to you.</hi> And then you would sure find
how happy it were to have this to turn you to, that
the Lord Jesus suffered for sins, and for yours, and
therefore hath made it a light and comfortable business
to you to undergo momentary passing sufferings.</p>
                  <p>Days of tryal will come, do you not see they are on
us already. Be perswaded to turn your eyes and desires
more towards Christ. This is the thing we would
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104216:94"/>
still press, the support and happiness of your Souls
lyes on it. But you will not believe it. Oh! that ye
knew the comforts and sweetness of Christ. Oh that
one would speak that knew more of them! were you
once but entered into this knowledge of him and the
virtue of his sufferings, you would account all your
days but lost wherein you have not known him; and
in all times your hearts would find no refreshment
like to the remembrance of his love.</p>
                  <p>Having somewhat considered these sufferings, as the
Apostles Argument for his present purpose. Now to
take nearer notice of the particulars, by which he il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrates
them, as the main point of our Faith and
Comfort: Of them here two things,</p>
                  <p>1. Their Cause. 2. Their Kind. Their Cause both
their meriting cause and their final cause. 1. What
in us procured these sufferings unto Christ. 2. What
those his suffering procured unto us. Our guiltiness
brought suffering upon him; and his suffering brings
us unto God.</p>
                  <p>1. The evil of sin hath the evil of punishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably
ty'd to it: We have a natural obligation of
obedience unto God, and he justly urges it, so that
where the command of his Law is broke, the Curse of
it presently followeth. And though it was simply in
the Power of the supream Lawgiver to have dispensed
the infliction, yet having in his Wisdom purposed to be
known a just God in that way, following forth the
tenor of his Law, of necessity there must be a suffering
for sin.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Angels that kept not their Station, falling
from it, fell into a Dungeon where they are, <hi>under
chains of darkness, reserved to the Iudgement of the
Great day;</hi> and Man fell under the sentence of Death:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104216:95"/>
But in this is the difference betwixt Man and them;
they were not of one, as parent or common root of the
rest, but each one fell or stood for himself alone;
so a part of them only perisht, but Man fell altogether,
so that not one of all the Race could escape condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
unless some other way of satisfaction be found
out. And here it is, <hi>Christ suffered for sins, the just for
the unjust: Father,</hi> says he, <hi>I have glorified thee on
Earth.</hi> In this Plot indeed do all the Divine Attributes
shine in their full; infinite Mercy, and immense Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Power, and Wisdom: Looking on Christ
as ordained for that purpose, I have found a Ransom,
<hi>says the Father,</hi> one fit to redeem Man, a Kinsman, one
of that very same Stock, the Son of Man, one able to
redeem Man by satisfying me, and fullfilling all I lay
upon him; my Son, my only begotten Son in whom
my Soul delights: And he is willing, undertakes all,
says, <hi>loe I come,</hi> &amp;c. We are agreed upon the way of
this Redemption; yea, upon the Persons to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed;
it is not a roving blind Bargain, a price paid,
for, we know not to whom. Hear his own words;
<hi>Thou hast given the Son</hi> (says the Son to the Father)
<hi>power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as
many as thou hast given him:</hi> and after all, <hi>mine are
thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the sins of those he suffered standing in their
room, and what he did and suffered according to the
Law of that Covenant, as done and suffer'd by them.
All the sins of all the Elect were made up into an huge
bundle and bound upon his Shoulders, so the Prophet
speaks in their name; <hi>surely he hath born our griefs and
carried our sorrows: And the Lord laid [or made to meet] on
him the iniquity of us all;</hi> where he spoke of many
ways of sin, every one to his own way: he binds up all
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104216:95"/>
in the word of <hi>iniquity</hi> as all one sin, as if it were that
one transgression of the first <hi>Adam</hi> that brought on the
Curse of his Seed; born by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> to take it
away from all that are his Seed, that are in him as
their Root.</p>
                  <p>He the great high Priest appearing before God with
the Names of the Elect upon his Shoulders; and in
his Heart bearing them and all their burdens, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for them not any other Sacrifice but himself,
charging all their Sin on himself, as the Priest did the
Sins of the People on the Head of the Sacrifice. <hi>He
by the eternal Spirit,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>offered up himself
without spot unto God, spotless and sinless,</hi> and so only
fit to take away our sin, being a satisfactory oblation for
it. He suffered, in him was our ransome, and thus it
was paid, in the Man Christ was the Deity, and so his
blood was as the Apostle calls it, the Blood of God, and
being pierced it came forth, and was told down as the
rich price of our Redemption, <hi>not silver, nor gold, nor
corruptible things,</hi> as our Apostle hath it before, <hi>but the
precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obs. 1. Shall any Man offer to bear the Name of a
Christian, that pleases himself in the way of Sin, can
delight and sport himself with it, when he considers
this, that Christ suffered for sin; do not think it, you
that still account sin, sweet, which he found so bitter,
and light, which was so heavy to him, and made his
Soul heavy to the death; you are yet far off from him,
if you were in him, and one with him, there would be
some harmony of your hearts with his, and some sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>se sufferings, as endured by your Lord,
your Head, and for you. They that with a right view
see him as pierced by their sins, that sight pierces them,
and makes them mourn, brings forth tears, beholding
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104216:96"/>
the gushing forth of his blood. This makes the real
Christian an avowed enemy to sin; shall I ever be
Friends with it <hi>(says he)</hi> that killed my Lord, no, but
I will ever kill it, and do it by applying his death. The
true Penitent is sworn to be the death of sin: may
be surprized by it, but no possibility of reconcilement
betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>Thou that livest kindly and familiarly with sin;
either openly declarest thy self for it, or hast a secret
love for it; where canst thou reap any comfort? not
from these sufferings to thee continuing in that Posture.
It is all one, as if Christ had not suffer'd for sins; yea,
worse than if no such thing had been, that there is salvation
and terms of mercy unto thee, and yet perishes: That
there is Balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> and yet thou art not healed. And
if thou hast not comfort from Jesus crucified, I know not
whence thou canst have any that will hold out; look
about thee, tell me what thou seest either in thy Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
or in thy hopes, that thou esteemest most off,
and layest thy confidence on it; or to deal more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
with thee, see what estate thou wouldest chuse
for thy wish; stretch thy fancy to devise an earthly
happiness, these times are full of unquietness; but
give thee a time of the calmest peace, not an air of
trouble stirring, put thee where thou wilt, far off from
fear of Sword and Pestilence, and encompass thee with
Children, Friends, and Possessions, and Honours, and
Comfort, and Health to enjoy all those, yet one thing
thou must admit in the midst of all these, within a
while thou must die, and having no real portion in
Christ, but a deluding dream of it, thou sinkest through
possibly that death into another death, far more
terrible: of all thou enjoyest; nothing goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with thee but unpardoned sin, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104216:96"/>
thee up to endless sorrow. Oh! that you were
wise and would consider your latter end, do not still
gaze about you upon trifles, but yet be intreated to
take notice of your Saviour, and receive him, that he
may be yours, fasten your Belief and your Love on
him; give him all your Heart, that stuck not to give
himself an offering for your sins.</p>
                  <p>2. To you that have fled into him for Refuge; if
sensible of the Churches distress, be upheld with this
thought, that he that suffered for it, will not suffer it
to be undone, all the rage of enemies, yea, the Gates
of Hell shall not prevail against it, he may for a time
suffer them to be brought low for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

repair our breaches and establish his Throne in these
Kingdoms. 2. For your selves, what can affright you

theirs, and they would believe, which cannot be,
before he becomes ours by believing. It is that gives
title and propriety to him; he is set before Sinners as

Nature of this good, nearness unto God. (2.) Our
deprivement of it, by our own sin. (3.) Our restore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to it, by Christs sufferings.</p>
                  <p>1. God hath suited every Creature he hath made
with a convenient good to which it tends; and in the
obtainment of which it rests and is satisfied. Natural
bodies have each their own natural place, whether, if
not hindred, they move uncessantly till they be in it;
and there declare by resting there, that they are (as
I may say) where they would be. Sensitive Creatures
are carried to seek a sensitive good as agreeable to their
rank and being, and attaining that, aim no further.
Now in this is the Excellency of Man; he is made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a Communion with his Maker, and because
capable of it, is unsatisfied without it. The Soul a
Being cut out (so to speak) to that largeness, cannot be
fill'd with less, though he is fallen from his right to that
good, and from all right desire of it, yet not from a
capacity of it, no, nor from a necessity of it, for the
answering and filling of his capacity.</p>
                  <p>Though the Heart once gone from God, turns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
further away from him, and moves not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him till it be renewed: yet ever in that wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it retains that natural relation to God as its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that it hath no true rest elsewhere, nor cannot by
any means find it: It is made for him, and is there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ore
still restless till it meet with him.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the Natural Man takes much pains to quiet
his Heart by other things, and digests many vexations
with hopes of contentment in the end, and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of some design he hath, but still they misgive.
Many times he attains not the thing he seeks, but if he
do, yet never attains the satisfaction he seeks and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
in it, only learns from that to desire something
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104216:98"/>
farther, and still hunts on after a fancy, drives his own
shadow before him, and never overtakes it, and if he
did, yet its but a shadow; and so in running from God,
besides the sad end, he carries an interwoven punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with his sin, the natural disquiet and vexation
of his Spirit, fluttering too and fro, no rest for the
sole of his foot: The matters of unconstancy and
vanity covering the whole Face of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>We study to abase our souls, and to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with less than they are made for; yea, we strive to
make them carnal; that they may be pleased with
sensible things; and in this men attain a brutish content
for a time; forgetting their higher good; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we cannot think it sufficient, and that no more were
to be desired beyond Ease, and Plenty, and Pleasures of
Sense, for then a Beast in good Case and a good Pasture,
might contest with us in point of Happiness, and carry
it away for that sensitive good he enjoys without sin,
and without the vexation that is mixt with us all. These
things are too gross and heavy.</p>
                  <p>The Soul, the immortal Soul descended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
must either be more happy, or remain miserable.
The highest increated Spirit is the proper Good, the
Father of Spirits that pure and full good, raises the Soul
above it self; whereas all other things draw it down
below it self. So then its never well with the Soul, but
when it is near unto God, yea, in its union with him,
married to him, and mismatching it self elsewhere, it
hath never any thing but shame and sorrow. <hi>All that
forsake thee shall be ashamed,</hi> Jer. 17. says the Prophet:
and the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. 73. <hi>They that are far off from
thee shall perish.</hi> And this is indeed our natural misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition, and is often exprest this way, or estrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
and distance from God, <hi>Eph. 2. Gentiles,</hi> far off
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104216:98"/>
by their profession and Nation, but both Jews and Gentiles
far off by their natural Foundation, and both brought near
by the blood of the new Covenant; and that is the
other thing here implied, that we are far off by reason
of sin; otherways there were no need of Christ, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in this way of suffering for sin, to bring us unto God.</p>
                  <p>The first, because of Gods command, sin broke off
Man and separated him from God, and ever since the
Soul remains naturally remote from God. (1.) Under
a sentence of Exile pronounced by the Justice of God,
condemned to banishment from God, who is the life
and light of the Soul as it is of the Body. (2.) It's
under a flat impossibility of returning by it self. And
that in two respects. (1.) Because of the guiltiness of
sin standing betwixt, as an unpassable Mountain or
Wall of separation. (2.) Because of the Dominion of
sin keeping the Soul captive, still drawing it further
off from God, increasing the distance and the enmity
every day. Nor in Heaven, nor under Heaven, no
way to remove this enmity, and make up this distance,
and return Man to the Possession of God, but this one,
by Christ and him suffering for sins.</p>
                  <p>He endured the Sentence pronounced against man;
yea, even in this particular Notion of it, one main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
in his suffering was a forsaking to sense, that
he cried out of. And by suffering the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
he took away the guiltiness of sin: he himself
being spotless and undefiled, for such an High Priest
became us; the more defiled we were, the more
need of an undefiled Priest, and Sacrifice, and he was
both: Therefore the Apostle here very fitly mentions
this qualification of our Saviour as necessary for redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
us unto God, <hi>the Iust for the Vnjust,</hi> so taking on
him, and taking away the guilt of sin, setting his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104216:99"/>
strong shoulder to remove that Mountain, he made way,
or access for Man unto God.</p>
                  <p>This the Apostle hath excellently, <hi>Eph. 2. He hath
reconciled us by his cross, having slain the enmity;</hi> he
kill'd the quarrel betwixt God and us, killed it by his
death, brings the Parties together, and hath laid a
sure Foundation of Agreement in his own Sufferings,
appeases his Fathers wrath by them, and by the same
appeases the Sinners Conscience. All that God hath
to say in point of Justice is answered there; all that the
poor humbled sinner hath to say, is answered too. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up such an Attonement as satisfies the Father;
so he is content that sinners come in and be reconciled:
and then Christ gives notice of this to the Soul to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all Jealousies: it is full of fear, though it would,
dare not approach unto God, apprehending him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
Fire. They that have done the offence, are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the hardest to reconcile, because they are still
in doubt of their pardon, but Christ assures of a full
and hearty forgiveness, quenching the flame and wrath
of God by his blood. No, says Christ, upon my
Warrant come in, you will now find my Father otherwise
than you imagin, he hath declared himself satisfied at
my hands, and is willing to receive you, to be hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and throughly Friends, never to hear a word more
of the quarrel that was betwixt you, a full Oblivion.
And if the Soul bear back still through distrust, he takes
it by the hand and draws it forward, leads it into his
Father, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap> imports, presents it
to him, and leaves not the matter till it be made a full
and sure agreement.</p>
                  <p>But for this purpose that the Soul may be able and
willing to come unto God, the sufferings of Christ
take away that other Impediment: as they satisfie the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104216:99"/>
sentence, and so remove the guiltiness of sin, so he hath
by them purchased a deliverance from the tyrannous
power of sin, that detains the Soul from God after all
the way made for it. And he hath a power of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Sufferings to the Souls deliverance in that kind
too, he opens the Prison Doors to them that are led
Captive; and because the great chain is upon the heart
willingly enthralled in sin, he by his Sovereign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
takes off that, frees the heart from the love of sin,
shews what a base slavish condition it is in, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
in his effectual way the goodness of God, his
readiness to entertain a returning sinner, the sweetness
and happiness of Communion with him; powerfully
perswades the heart to shake off all, and without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay to return unto God, as to be received into
favour and friendship, so to walk in the way of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with God, to give up it self to his Obedience, to
disdain the vile service of sin, and live sutable to the
dignity of fellowship and Union with God.</p>
                  <p>And there is no other but the power of Christ alone
that is able to effect this, to perswade a sinner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
to bring home a heart unto God: Common mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, though they have a leading faculty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. yet the rebellious heart will not
be led by them. The J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

personal, though they should drive us to God, yet the
heart unchanged runs the farther from God? do we not
see it by our selves and other sinners about us, look
not at all towards him that smiles, much less return,
or if any sadder thoughts arise that way upon the
surprize of an affliction, how soon vanish they, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104216:100"/>
sanctified influence according to their quality to stir up
a Christian to seek after nearer Communion, closer
walk, and more access to God: But leave Christ out,
I say, all other means work not this way, neither the
works, nor word of God sounded daily in his ear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
return. Let the noise of the rod speak it too,
and both joyn together to make the cry the louder,
yet the wicked will do wickedly, will not hearken to
the voice of God, will not see the hand of God lifted
up, will not be perswaded to go in and seek peace
and reconcilement with God, though declaring himself
provoked to punish, and to behave himself as an enemy
against his own people. How many are there that
in their own particular have been very sharply lasht
with divers scourges on their bodies, or families, and
yet are never a whit the nearer God for it all, hearts as
proud, and earthly, and vain, as ever, and lay on as
much and they will still be the same. Only a Divine
Vertue going forth from Christ lifted up, draws Men
unto him, and being come to him he brings them unto
the Father.</p>

declare your selves to be so, live as Strangers far off
from him; do not still continue to abuse your selves
so grosly. Can you think there is any consolation
yours, that is in the sufferings of Christ, while it is so
evident they have not gained their end upon you, have
not brought you to God? Truly most of you seem
to think that our Lord Jesus suffered rather to the end
we might neglect God and disobey him securely than
to reduce us to him. Hath he purchas'd you a liberty
to sin, or is not deliverance from sin, which alone is
true liberty, the thing he aimed at, and agreed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

He hath by it opened up our way to God, and yet we
refuse to make use of it<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Oh! how few come in.
They that are brought unto God and received into
friendship with him, they entertain that friendship, they
delight in his company, love to be much with him:
is it so with us? 2. By being so they become like him,
know his will daily better and grow more sutable to it;
in the most nothing of this.</p>
                  <p>3. But even they that are brought unto God may be faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this, in part not applying so sweet a Priviledge, can
comply and be too friendly with the vain World, can pass
many days without a lively Communion with God, not
aspiring to the increase of that as the thing our Lord hath
purchas'd for us, and that wherein all our happiness and
welfare lyes here and hereafter: your hearts cleaving
to folly and not delighting your selves in the Lord, not
refresht with this nearness to him and Union with him,
your thoughts not often on it, and your study to walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to it: Certainly it ought to be this and you would
be perswaded to endeavour it may be thus with you.</p>
                  <p>4. Remember this for your Comfort that you,
as are brought unto God by Jesus Christ, you are
kept in that Union by him, its a firmer knot than the
first was, there is no power of hell can dissolve it. He
suffered once to bring us once unto God, never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
again, as he suffered once for all so we are brought
once for all: We may be sensibly nearer at one time
than another, but yet we can never be separate nor cut
off, being once knit by Christ as the bond of our
Union. <hi>Neither Principalities, nor Powers,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>shall be able to separate us from the love of God,</hi>
because it holds in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

The true life of a Christian is to eye Christ, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
step of his life, both as his rule, and as his strength,
looking to him as his pattern, both in doing, and
suffering, and drawing power from him for going
through both; for the look of Faith doth that, fetches
life from Jesus to enable it for all, being without him
able for nothing. Therefore the Apostle doth still
set this before his Brethren, and here having mentioned
his suffering in general, the condition and end of it,
he specifies the particular kind of it, that which was the
utmost, <hi>put to death in the flesh,</hi> and then adds this issue
out of it, <hi>Quickned by the Spirit.</hi>

which Men are most startled at, <hi>to die,</hi> and a violent
death, <hi>put to death,</hi> and yet he hath led in this way,
who is the Captain of our Salvation. <hi>In the flesh.</hi>] Under
this second, his humane Nature, and Divine Nature and
power are differenced. <hi>Put to death in the flesh,</hi> a
very fit expression, not only (as is usual) taking the flesh
for the whole Manhood, but because death is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
spoken of that very person, or his flesh, the whole
Man suffers death, a dissolution or taking a pieces; and
the Soul suffers a separation or dislodging; but death,
or the privation of life and sense, particularly to the
flesh or body: but the <hi>Spirit</hi> here opposed to the <hi>flesh</hi>
or body, is certainly of a higher Nature and Power than
is the Humane Soul, which cannot of it self return and
reinhabit and quicken the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Put to Death.</hi>] His death was both voluntary and
violent, that same power that restored his life, could
have kept it exempted from death; but the design was
for death: he therefore took our flesh, to put it off
thus, and offered it up as a Sacrifice; which to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
must of necessity be free and voluntary; and
in that sense he is said to have died even by that same
Spirit, that here, in opposition to death, is said to quicken
him, Heb. 9. 14. <hi>Through the eternal Spirit, he offered
himself without spot unto God.</hi> They accounted it an
ill boding sign when the Sacrifices came constrainedly
to the Altar, and drew back; and on the contrary
were glad in the hopes of success when they came chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully-forward;
but never Sacrifice came so willingly all
the way, and from the first step knew whether he was
going. Yet because no other Sacrifice would serve, he
was most content. <hi>Sacrifices and burnt Offerings thou
didst not desire: Then said I, loe I come,</hi> &amp;c. Was not only
a willing Sacrifice as <hi>Isaac,</hi> bound peaceably and laid
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104216:102"/>
on the Altar, but his own Sacrificer: the Beasts if
they came willingly, yet offered not themselves, but
he offered up himself, and thus not only by a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
far above all those Sacrifices of Bullocks and
Goats, but by the eternal Spirit offered up himself.
Therefore he says in this regard, <hi>I lay down my life
for my sheep,</hi> it is not pull'd from me, but I lay it
down, and so it is often exprest, by <gap reason="foreign">

yea, it was also expedient to be thus, that his death
should be violent, and so the more penal, carry the more
clear expression of a punishment, and such a violent
death as had both ignominy and a Curse tyed to it,
and this inflicted in a judicial way (though as from the
hands of Men most unjustly) that he should stand, and
be Judged, and Condemned to Death as a guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

guilty, <hi>he was numbred with transgressors</hi> (as the Prophet

                  <p>Thus then there was in his Death, external violence
joyned with internal willingness: But what is there to

the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Thus a believing Soul at the lowest, when to its

up of it, as it were in the Belly of Hell, yet look up to
this Divine Power, him whose Soul was not left there,
will not leave thine there. Yea, when thou art most

as living, and Life-giving Bread to Belivers, adds I
will raise them up at the last day. This comfort we
have even for the house of Clay we lay down, and for
our more considerable part, our immortal Souls; this
his death and rising hath provided for them at their
dislodging, entring into that Glory where he is. Now

                  <p>THere is nothing that so much concerns a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to know as the excellency of Jesus Christ, his
Person and Works, so that it is always pertinent to insist
much on that Subject. The Apostle having spoken of
this Spirit, or Divine Nature, and the power of it,
raising him from the Dead, takes occasion to speak of
another work of that Spirit, to wit, the emission and
publishing of his Divine Doctrine, and that, not as
a new thing following his Death, and Rising; but as
the same in substance, by the same Spirit promulgate
long before, even to the first Inhabitants of the World.
Quickned by the Spirit, that is in our days, says the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:104216:105"/>
Apostle: but then long before that, by the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
he went and preached to the Spirits that were in
Prison.</p>
                  <p>This place is somewhat obscure in it self, as it usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
falls, but made more so, by the various fancies
and contests of Interpreters, aiming or pretending to
clear it, these I like never to make a noise of. That
dream of the descent of Christs Soul into Hell, though
they that are in it, think this place founds somewhat
that way, yet it proves, being examined, no way suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
cannot by the strongest wresting be drawn to
fit their purpose: For (1.) That it was to preach that
he went thither they are not willing to avow; though
the end they give it, is as groundless and imaginary as
this is. (2.) They would have his business to be with the
Spirits of the Faithful deceased before his coming, here
we see its with the disobedient. (3.) And his Spirit here is
the same with the sense of the foregoing words, which
means not his Soul, but his eternal Deity. (4.) nor is
it the Spirits that were in Prison, as they read it, but
the Spirits in Prison, which by the opposition of their
former condition sometimes, or formerly disobedient,
doth clearly speak their present condition, as the just
consequent and fruit of their disobedience.</p>
                  <p>Other misinterpretations I mention not, taking it
as agreeable to the whole strain of the Apostles words,
<note n="*" place="margin">Thus I then thought, But do now apprehend another sense as probable, if not more, even that so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by most Interpreters.

in the Flesh speak by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in his Servants to those of the
foregoing Ages; yea the Antientest of
them; declaring to them the way of
life though rejected by the unbelief of
the most part. This is interjected in
the mentioning of Christs sufferings,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104216:105"/>
and exaltment after them. And after
all, the Apostle returns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>to that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and to exhortation, which he
strengthens by it: But so as this
discourse taken in, is pertinently
adapted to the present Subject. The
Apostles aim in it, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be this, (his main scope
being to encourage his Brethren in
the faith of Christ, and way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
against all opposition and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
so to instruct his Brethren in
Christ's perpetual influence into his
Church in all Ages, even before
his Incarnation, as that they see
withal, the great unbelief of the
World; yea their opposing of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Truth and the small number of those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, and so not be discouraged by the fewness of
their number, and the hatred of the World, finding
that Salvation in Jesus Christ dead and risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
which the rest miss off by their own wilful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal.
And this very point he insists on clearly in
the following Chap. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 4. And those very ways
of ungodliness there specified, which Believers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
was those that the World was guilty of
in these days, and in which they were surprised by
the flood, <hi>they Eat and Drank till the flood came upon
them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the words of these three Verses we have three things
1. An assertion concerning the preaching of Christ,
and the persons he preacht to. 2. The designment and
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>scription of the time or age wherein that was, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104216:106"/>
the particular way of God's dealing with them. 3. The
adapting or applying of the example to Christians.
The first in these words which I take together, <hi>By
thee which Spirit he went and preached to the Spirits in
Prison, which sometime were disobedient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these words we have a Preacher and his hearers.
Of the Preacher we shall find here; 1. His ability. 2.
His activity in the use of it. His ability altogether
singular and matchless; the very Spring of all abilities,
the Spirit of wisdome himself being the co-eternal Son
of God: That Spirit he preacht by, was it by which
he raised himself from the dead, and without this
Spirit there is no preaching; Now he was as our
Apostle calls him, <hi>a Preacher of righteousness,</hi> but it
was the power of this Spirit; for in him did this Spirit
Preach. The Son is the wisdom of the Father, his Name
is the Word: not only for that by him all things
were created, as <hi>Iohn</hi> hath it, the Son that power,
by which, as by the word of his mouth, all things were
made, but the Word likewise as revealing him; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to us the counsel and will of God, therefore by
the same Evangelist, in the same place, called that
light that illuminates the World, without which Man
called the lesser World, the intellectual World, were
as the greater World without the Sun: and all that
bring aright the Doctrine of saving wisdom, derive it
necessarily from him; all Preachers draw from this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Preacher, as the Fountain of Divine light,
as all the Stars receive their light from the Sun, and
by that diffusing amongst them, it is not diminisht in
the Sun, but only communicated to them, remaining
still full and entire in it, as its source: so doth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
flow from Christ in a particular degree unto those
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104216:106"/>
he sends forth in his name, and its in them that he
preaches by the power and light of his Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                  <p>Hither then must they all come that would be
rightly supplyed and enabled for that work. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to speak duly of him in any measure, but by
his Spirit; there must be particular access, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of instructions from him, and a transfusion of
his Spirit into ours. Oh! were it thus with us, how
sweet were it to speak of him. To be much in prayer,
much dependance on him, and drawing from him would
do much more in this, than reading and studying,
seeking after arts and Tongues, and Common Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
These not to be despised nor neglected.
<hi>Reading good,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vtilis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio, utilis eruditio, sed magis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, quippe quae sola do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet de omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. <hi>Bern</hi>]</note> 
                     <hi>and learning good, but above all anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
necessary, that anoynting that teacheth all things.</hi>
And you that are for your own interest be earnest with
this Lord, this Fountain of Spirit, to let forth more
of it upon his messengers in these times; you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
back the fruit of it, were ye busie this way, you
should find more life and refreshing sweetness in the
word of life, how weak and worthless so ever they were
that brought it, it should descend as sweet showers
upon the Valleys and make them fruitful.</p>
                  <p>2. By this Spirit, its said here, <hi>he preacht,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did he so in the Days of his abode on Earth, but
in all times both before, and after, never left his Church
altogether destitute of saving light, which he dispenced
himself, and conveyed by the hands of his Servants
therefore its said, <hi>he preacht,</hi> that this be no excuse for
times after he is ascended into Heaven, no nor for times
before he descended to the Earth in humane flesh,
though he preached not then, nor does now in his flesh,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104216:107"/>
yet by his Spirit he then preacht, and still doth, so
according to what was chief in him, he was still present
with his Church, and preaching in it, and is so to the
end of the World. This his infinite Spirit being every
where, yet 'tis said here by it he went and preached,
signifying the remarkable clearness of his Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that way, as when he appears eminently in any
work of his own, or taking notice of our works, God
is said to come down, so to those Cities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. Let
us go down. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 8. Thus here, so clearly
did he admonish them by <hi>Noah,</hi> coming as it were
himself on purpose to declare his Mind to them. And
this word, I conceive, is the rather used to shew what
equality there is in this; He came indeed visibly
and dwelt amongst Men, when he became flesh, yet
before that, he visited by his Spirit, he went by that
and preached. And so in after times himself being
ascended, and not having come visibly in his flesh to
all, but to the Jews only: yet in the preaching of the
Apostles to the Gentiles, as the great Apostle says of
him, in this expression. <hi>Eph. 2. 17. He came and
preached to you which were asar off;</hi> and this he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
to do in the ministry of his word: and therefore
says he, <hi>he that despiseth you, despiseth me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Were this considered, it could not but procure far
more respect to the word and more acceptance of it;
Would you think that in his word Christ speaks by his
eternal Spirit? yea, he comes, and preaches, addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
himself particularly to you in it, could you slight
him thus and turn him off with daily refusals or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
at least? Think it is too long, you have so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
used so great a Lord, that brings unto you so great
Salvation; that came once in so wonderful a way to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104216:107"/>
work that Salvation for us in his flesh, and is still com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to offer it unto us by his Spirit, does himself preach
to us, tells us what he undertook on our behalf, and
how he hath performed all; and now nothing rests
but that we receive him, and believe on him, and all
is ours. But alas! from the most, the return is, that
we have here, <hi>disobedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sometimes disobedient.</hi>] Two things in the hearers
by which they are charactared, their present condition,
in the time the Apostle was speaking of them, and this
by-past disposition when the Spirit of Christ was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them; this latter went first in time, and was
the cause of the other, Therefore of it first.</p>
                  <p>If you look to their visible subordinate Preacher a
holy Man, and an able and diligent Preacher of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
both in his Doctrine and in the tract of his
life, which is the powerfullest preaching, it seems
strange that he prevailed so little: But much more,
if we look higher, this hight. as the Apostle points
to us to look to, that Almighty Spirit of Christ that
preacht to them; and yet they were disobedient.
The word is, they were not perswaded, and it signifies
both unbelief, and disobedience, and that very fitly: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
being in it self the grand disobedience, the mind not
yielding to Divine Truth, and so the spring of all disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in affection and action. And this root of bitterness,

and Repentance, yet perswades any Man to return,
or so much to turn inward, and question himself, to say,
what have I done? But thus it will be, till the Spirit
be poured from on high, to open and soften hearts. It
is to be desired as much wanting in the Ministery of
the Word, but were it there, that would not serve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it were by a concurrent work within the Heart
meeting the Word, and making the impressions of it
there, for here we find the Spirit went and preacht, and
yet the Spirits of the Hearers still unbelieving and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
its a combined work of this Spirit in the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

and because he speaks of them as in that Posture, he
calls them Spirits, for its their Spirits that are in that
Prison. As likewise calls them Spirits, that the Spirit
of Christ preacht to, because it is indeed that, that the
preaching of the Word aims at, it hath to do with the
Spirits of Men, is not content to be at their ear with a
sound, but works on their Minds and Spirits some way,
either to believe and receive, or to be hardened and sealed
up to Judgement by it, which is for Rebels: If disobedience

                  <p>
                     <hi>When once the long suffering of God waited in the days
of Noah.</hi>] There are two main continuing wonders in the
World, the bounty of God, and disloyalty of Man: and
the succession of times is no other, but new additions of
these two. One grand example is here set before us, an
Oecumenical Example, as large as the whole World:
much patience, and yet invincible disobedience. Here
two things in the instance. The Lord's general dealing
with the World of the Ungodly at that time. 2. His
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104216:109"/>
peculiar way with his own chosen; <hi>Noah</hi> and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
He waited patiently for all the rest; but he effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
saved them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The time designed thus, <hi>in the days of Noah.</hi>
Many great and powerful Persons in these days that
overtopt <hi>Noah</hi> (no doubt) in outward respects, as in
their stature, the proud Giants, and they begot Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note>
mighty men of old, <hi>men of renown,</hi> as the Text
hath it: And yet as themselves perisht in the Flood, their
Names are drown'd. They had their big Thoughts cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
that their Houses, and their Names should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. And yet they are
sunk in perpetual Oblivion. And <hi>Noah</hi>'s Name, who
walkt in humble obedience you see in these most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Records of God's own Book, still looks fresh, and
smells sweet, and hath this honour, that the very Age
of the World is markt with this Name, to be known
by it, <hi>in the days of Noah.</hi> That which prophane am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Persons do idolatrously seek after, they are often
remarkably disappointed of, would have their names
memorable and famous, yet they rot, they are either
buried with them, or remembred with disgrace, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
above Ground as Carcases un-innterr'd, and so are
the more noisom, as little credit to them to be mentioned,
as for <hi>Pilate</hi> that his name is in the Confession of Faith.
But the name and remembrance of the righteous is still
sweet and delightful: as the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Faithful, and of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> their
names is embalmed indeed, that they cannot rot, embalm'd
with God's own Name, <hi>[Eternal]</hi> that name wrapt
about theirs, <hi>the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Noah</hi> here mentioned, as preferr'd of God, and
so in the Second Epistle, as a Preacher of Righteousness,
and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. among these worthies whose honour is that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104216:109"/>
they believed; this is only a name, a small thing, not be
mentioned in comparison of their other Priviledges, and
especially of that venerable Life and Glory which they
are Heirs to; and indeed it is a thing they regard very
little, yet this we see, that even this advantage follows
them, and flies from the vain ungodly that hunt and
persue it.</p>
                  <p>The Lord's dealing with the wicked in those times
before he swept them away by the Deluge, is in these
two. 1. Long suffering, and withal clear warning;
long suffering, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. long forbearing to be angry,
as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word is in his Name; which supposes
a great provocation, and the continuance of it, and yet
patience continuing, and in this appears the goodness of
God, considering how hateful sin is to him, and how
powerful he is to punish it, were it, if it pleased him,
in one moment to cut off all the Ungodly, high and
low, throughout the whole World; yet he bears, and
forbears to punish. Oh! what a World of sin every day
in Nations, in Cities and Villages; yea, in Families that
he doth not strike with present Judgement, and not
only forbears to punish, but multiplies his common
mercies on them, Sun, and Rain, and fruitful Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p>Yea, there is so much of this that it falls under a gross
misconstruction, yet he bears that too,<note place="margin">Eccles. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Because sentence
against an evil work is not speedily executed; therefore the
hearts of the Sons of Men is fully set in them to do evil.</hi>
Because there is not so much as a word of it for the
time (so the word is) this greatens, and fills the heart
of Man, and makes it big to do evil. And not only is
the Lord's long suffering mistaken by the Ungodly, but
even by his own, that should understand him better, and
know the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>

are mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ed in this point, beholding his forbearance of
punishing the workers of iniquity, instead of magnifying
his patience, they fall very near into questioning his
Justice and Providence, <hi>Psal. 13. Ier. 12. Iob.</hi> 21. &amp;c.
Our narrow hasty spirits left to their own measures, take
not in these larger views that would satisfie us in the
ways of God, and forget the immense largeness of his
wise designs, his deep reach from one Age to another,
yea, from eternity to eternity; consider not how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
he can right himself in point of Justice, when he
will,<note place="margin">Nemo deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit huic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>reditori.</note> that none can make escape from him, how loose
soever their guard seem, and how great liberty soever
appears in their present condition. 2. That as he can
most easily, so he will most seasonably be known in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
Judgement, and that his Justice shall shine the
brighter, by all that patience he hath used, by the Sun
of Prosperity. 3. We think not how little that time is
to him, that seems long to us, to whom a thousand
years, are as one day; a long time of the Churches di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
and their Enemies Triumph, in these seventy
years of the Babylonish Captivity, and yet in God's Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
a moment, a small moment. However in the
closure the Lord always clears himself, he is indeed
long suffering and patient, but the impenitent abusers
of his patience, pay interest for all the time of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
in the weight of Judgement when it comes
upon them. But thus we see the Lord deals; thus he
dealt with the World in the beginning, <hi>when all flesh had

they continue to abuse the long suffering of God, and

yet that he continues ever abused by suffering them;
zeal is good, but as it springs from love if it be right,
so its requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that love to God, and so a complacency in his way;
liking it because it's his, and love to men, so as to be
pleased with that waiting for them in possibility at least
of their being reclaimed, knowing that however, if they
return not, yet the Lord will not lose his own at their
hands. <hi>Wilt thou,</hi> said these two fiery Disciples, <hi>that
we call for fire, as Elias!</hi> Oh! but the Spirit of the Dove
rested on him, that told them, <hi>they knew not what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                     </gap>stice without you, look inward,
and see whence that is; examine and correct within
you.</p>
                  <p>When you are tempted to take ill that goodness and
patience of God to sinners. Consider, 1. Can this be
right, to differ from his mind in any thing; is it not
our only Wisdom, and ever safe Rule to think as he thinks,
and will as he wills? And, I pray you, does he not hate
sin more than you do? is not his interest in punishing
it deeper than yours? And if you be zealous for his
interest, as you pretend, then be so with him, and in his
way, for starting from that, sure you are wrong.
2. Consider, did he not wait for thee? what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of thee, if long suffering had not subserv'd his
purpose, of further mercy of free pardon to thee? and
why will thou not always allow that to which thou art
so much obliged? would'st thou have the Bridge cut
because thou art so over? Sure thou wilt not own so
gross a thought. Therefore esteem thy God still the
more thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

learn for him, and with him, to bear and wait.</p>
                  <p>But this was not a dumb forbearance, such as may
serve for a surprize? but continual teaching, and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joyned with it, as before. We see they wanted not
preaching of the choicest kind, he the Son of God by his
Eternal Spirit, went and preached to them; it was his
Truth in <hi>Noah</hi>'s mouth, and with that we have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
real Sermon, exprest in this Verse, <hi>while the Ark
was preparing;</hi> that spoke God's mind, and every
knock (as the usual Observation is) of the Hammers
and Tools used in Building preach'd to them, threatning
aloud designed Judgement, and Exhorting to prevent
it; and therefore that word is added, that the long
suffering of God waited or expected,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> expected a
believing of his Word, and returning from their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but we see no such thing followed; they took
their own Course still, and therefore the Lord took
his; they had polluted the Earth with their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
now the Lord would have the cleansing by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
that being denied, it must be another way
by flood, and because they and their sins remained one,
they would not part with them: therefore was one
work made of both, they and their sins as inseparable
must be cleansed away together.</p>
                  <p>Thus impenitency under much long suffering makes
Judgement full and compleat. I attest you, hath not
the Lord used much forbearance towards us? hath he
not patiently spared us? and clearly warned us, and
waited long for the Fruit of all? hath any thing been
wanting? have not Temporal Mercies been multiplied
on us? have not the Spiritual Riches of the Gospel been
opened up to us?</p>
                  <p>And each of you for your selves, consider how its
with you after so much long suffering of God, that none
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104216:111"/>
of you can deny, he hath used towards you, and so
many gracious Invitations with that patience, have
they gained your hearts? or do you still remain Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to sin? still Strangers to him, and formal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipers?
I beseech you think on it, what will be the
issue of that course? Is it a light matter to you to die
in your sins, and to have the wrath of God abiding
on you, to have refused Christ so often; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you have been so often requested to receive Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after the Lord hath followed you with intreaties,
hath called to you so often, <hi>why will ye die?</hi> yet wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to perish, and withal to have all these come in
and accuse you, and make your burden heavier, would
you willingly die in this estate? if not, then think that
yet he is waiting, if at length you will return, this
one day more of his waiting you have, and of his speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you: and some that were here with you the
last day are taken away since. Oh! that we were
wise and would consider our latter end, tho' there were
neither Sword or Pestilence near you, you must die, and
for any thing you know, quickly: why wear you
out the day of Grace, and those precious Seasons still;
as uncertain of Christ, yea, as indiligent after him as
you were long ago: as you love your Souls be more
serious in their business, this was their undoing; they
were all for present things, they eat and drank,<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 27.</note> they
married in a continued course without ceasing, and
without minding their after-estate, they were drowned
in these things, and that drowned them in a Flood:
<hi>Noah</hi> did eat and drink, but his main Work was in that
time the preparing of the Ark. The necessities of this
Life the Children of God are tied to, and fore't to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
some time and pains on them; but the thing that
takes up their Hearts, that which the bent of their
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104216:112"/>
Souls is set on, is their interest in Jesus Christ; and all
your wise designs are but a pleasing madness, till this
be chief with you. Others have had as much of God's
patience, and as fair opportunity as you, whose Souls
and Christ have never met, and now know, that they
never shall; they had their time of worldly projects
and enjoyment, as you now have, and followed them,
as if they had been immortally to abide with them;
but they are past away as a Shadow, and we are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
after them, and within a while shall lie down
in the dust. Oh! how happy they whose hearts are
not here trading with vanity and gathering vexation,
but whose thoughts are on that blessed life above trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
Certainly they that pass for fools within the World
are the only Children of wisdom, that have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
their lusts and their own wills, have yielded up
themselves to Jesus, taken him for their King, and have
their minds resting on him as their Salvation.</p>

of the Lords determined Judgement on the ungodly,
was indeed long-suffering towards them, but here was
more in it to <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Family, the providing for

them, the rest were spared. Thus the very forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
that the ungodly do enjoy, is usually involv'd
with the interest of the godly, somthing of that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
goes into it, and so it is in a great part for their
sakes, that the rest are both spared, and are furnisht with
common mercies. The Saints are usually the scorn
and contempt of others, yet are by that love the
Lords carries towards them, the very Arches, Pillars
of States,<note place="margin">[Semen sanctum sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

continued in regard to them. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 13. But they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:104216:112"/>
that are ungrateful to the great Maker and Upholder
of it, and regardless of him. What wonder they take
no notice of the advantage they receive by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of his Children in the World.</p>
                  <p>Here. 1. The Work. 2. The End of it. In the
Work, preparing of the Ark, observe. 1. Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
2. <hi>Noahs</hi> obedience.</p>
                  <p>The power of God was not tied to this, yet his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
choosed it, he that steered the course of this Ark safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all that time, could have preserved those he designed
it for, without it; But thus it pleases the Lord usually
to mix his wonderfullest deliverances, with some
selected means, exercising that way our obedience in
their use, yet so as the singular power of his hand in
them, whereon faith rests, doth clearly appear, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by them what in a more natural way they could
not possibly effect.</p>
                  <p>2. For the obedience of <hi>Noah,</hi> if we should insist
on the difficulties both in this work, and in the way
of their preservation by it, it would look the clearer
and be found very remarkable; the length of the work,
the great pains in providing materials; and consider
we the opposition that likely he met with in it from
the prophane about him, the mightier of them at
least, the hatred and continual scoffs of all sorts, it
required principles of an invincible resolution to go
through with it. What (would they say) means this
old dottard to do, whether this monstruous Voyage, and
for that it spoke, as no doubt he told them their ruin
and his safety, this would incense them so much the
more; you look far before you, and what, shall we
all perish and you alone escape? But through all the
soveraign Command, and gracious promise of his God
carried him; regarding their scoffs and threats as little
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:104216:113"/>
in making the Ark, as he did afterwards the noise of
the waters about it, when he was sitting safe within
it. This his obedience, having indeed so boistrous
winds to encounter, had need of a well fastened root,
that it might stand and hold out against them all, and
so it had. The Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that the root
of it was,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>by Faith being warned, he prepared an Ark;</hi> and
there's no living, and lasting obedience, but what
springs from that root: he believed what the Lord
spake of his determin'd Judgement on the ungodly
World, and from the belief of that arose that holy
fear, which is expresly mention'd, as exciting him to
this work. And he believed the Word of Promise, that
the Lord spoke concerning his preservation by the Ark;
and the belief of these two, carried him strongly on to the
work, and through it, against all counter blasts and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
overcame his own doubtings and the wicked's
mockings, still looking to him that was the Master,
and Contriver of the Work.</p>
                  <p>Till we attain such a fixed view of our God, and
firm perswasions of his Truth, and Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it will never be right with us, there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but wavering and unsettledness in our Spirits, and
in our ways; every little discouragement from within
or without, that meets us, will be like to turn us over;
we shall not walk in an even course, but still reeling and
staggering, till Faith be set whole upon its own basis
the proper Foundation of it; not set betwixt two,
upon one strong prop and another that's rotten, that's
the way to fall off; partly on God, and partly on
creature helps and encouragements, or our own
strength. Our only safe and happy way is, in humble
obedience in his own strength to follow his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
without standing and questioning the matter,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104216:113"/>
and to resign the conduct of all to his wisdom and
love, to put the rudder of our life into his hand, to
steer the course of it as seems him good, resting quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on his Word of Promise for our safety. Lord whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou wilt and which way thou wilt, be my guid
and it sufficeth.</p>
                  <p>This absolute following of God, and trusting him
with all, is markt as the true Character of Faith in
<hi>Abraham,</hi> going after God from his Country not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor not asking, whither he went, secure upon his
guid: and so in that other greater point of offering
his Son, silenced all disputes about it, by that mighty
conclusion of Faith, accounting that he was able to
raise him from the dead. Thus here <hi>Noah,</hi> by Faith
prepared the Ark, did not argue and question, how
shall this be done, and if it were, how shall I get all
the kinds of beasts gathered together to put into it, and
how shall it be ended when we are shut in? No, but
believed firmly that it should be finisht by him, and he
saved by it, and he was not disappointed.</p>
                  <p>2. The end of this work was the saving of <hi>Noah,</hi> and
his Family from the general Deluge, wherein all the
rest perished.</p>
                  <p>Here it will be fit to consider the point of the
preservation of the Godly in ordinary and common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
briefly in these Positions.</p>
                  <p>1. It is certain that the Children of God, as they are
not exempted from the common universal Calamities,
and Evils of this life that befal the rest of Men, so not
from any particular kind of them, as it is appointed for
them with all others once to dye: so we find them
not priviledged from any kind of disease, or other way
of death, not from falling by Sword, or by Pestilence,
or in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>renzie of a Feaver, or any kind of sudden
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104216:114"/>
death: yea, when these or such like are on a Land
by way of publick Judgement, the godly are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
exempt from them, but may fall in them with
others; as we find <hi>Moses</hi> dying in the Wilderness
with those he brought out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now though it
was for a particular failing in the Wilderness, yet it
evinces, that there is in this nothing prejudging their
priviledges, nor contrary to the love of God towards
them, and his Covenant with them.</p>
                  <p>2. The Promises made to the Godly of preservation
from Common Judgments have their truth, and are
made good in many of them so preserv'd, though they do
hold not absolutely and universally, for they are ever
to be understood in subordination to their highest good.
But when they are preserved they ought to take it as
a gracious accomplishment even of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to them, which the wicked, many of which do
likewise escape, have no right to, but are preserved
for after Judgment.</p>
                  <p>3. It is certain that the Curse and Sting is out of all
those evils, incident to the godly with others in life
and death, which makes the main difference though
to the eye of the World invisible. And it may be
observed that in these Common Judgements of Sword
or Pestilence or other epidemick diseases a great part
of those that are cut off are most of the wickedest,
tho the Lord may send of those Arrows to some few of
his own to call them home.</p>
                  <p>The full and clear distinction of the godly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
being reserved for their after Estate in Eternity,
it needs not seem strange that in many things it
appear not here: one thing above all others most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to the Child of God may take away the wonder
of other things they suffer in common, that is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104216:114"/>
of sin in them while they are in the flesh<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
though there is a Spirit in them above it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it, which makes the difference: yet sometimes
the too much likeness, especially in the prevailings of
corruption, doth confuse the matter, not only to others
eyes but their own.</p>
                  <p>4. Though the great distinction and severing be
reserved to that great and solemn day, that shall clear
all; yet the Lord is pleased in part more remarkably
at sometimes to difference his own from the ungodly,
in the execution of temporal Judgments, and to give
these as preludes of that final and full Judgment.
And this of <hi>Noah</hi> was one of the most eminent in that
kind, being the most general Judgment that ever befel
the World: or that shall till the last, and so the liveliest
figure of it, it was by water, as the second shall be by fire,
it was most congruous that it should resemble in this as
the chief point, saving of righteous <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family
from it, prefiguring the eternal Salvation of Believers,
as our Apostle teacheth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherein few, that is, eight persons were saved by water.</hi>]
This great point of the fewness of those that are
saved in the other greater Salvation as in this, I shall
not now prosecute; only,</p>
                  <p>1. If so few, then the inquiry into our selves, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we be of these few, would be more diligent, and
followed more home than it is yet with the most of
us: we are wary in our trifles, and only in this easily
deceived, yea our own deceivers in this great point.
Is not this folly far beyond what you usually say of some,
penny wise and pound fool, to be wise for a moment
and fools for eternity?</p>
                  <p>2. You that are indeed seeking the way of life, be
not discouraged by your fewness, it hath always been
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:104216:115"/>
so, you see here how few of the whole World, and
is it not better to be of the few in the Ark than of
the multitude in the waters? let them fret, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
they do, to see so few more diligent for Heaven,
as no doubt they did of <hi>Noah,</hi> and this is it that galls
them, that any should have higher names and surer
hopes this way; what? are none but such as you
going to Heaven, think you us all damned? what
can we say, but there is a flood of wrath wasting many
so, and certainly all that are out of the Ark shall perish
in it.</p>
                  <p>3. This is that main truth that I would leave with
you; look on Jesus Christ as the Ark, of whom this
was a figure, and believe it, out of him there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but certain destruction, a deluge of wrath all
the World over out of Christ. Oh! it is our life, our
only safety to be in him: But these things are not
believed. Men think they believe them, and do not.
Were it believed that we are under the Sentence of
eternal death in our natural estate, and no escape but
by removing out of our selves unto Christ, Oh! what
thronging would there be to him, whereas, now he
invites and calls, and how few are perswaded to come
to him. <hi>Noah</hi> believes the Lord's word of Judgment
against the World, believed his Promise made to him,
and prepared an Ark; is it not a high sign of unbelief
that there being an Ark of everlasting Salvation ready
prepared to our hand, we will not so much as come
to it? Will you be perswaded certainly that the Ark
Door stands open; his offers are free, do but come
and try if he will turn you away; no, he will not,
<hi>him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.</hi> And as
there is such acceptance and sure preservation in him,
there is as sure perishing without him, trust on what you,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:104216:115"/>
will, be you of a Giants stature as many were of them,
to help you to climb up, as they would sure do when
the Flood came on, to the highest Mountains and tallest
Trees, yet it shall overtake you, make your best of your
worldly advantages, or good parts, or civil righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
all shall prove poor shifts from the flood of
wrath, which rises above all those, and drowns them;
only the Ark of our Salvation is safe, think how glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they would have been within the Ark, when they
found Death without it, and now it was too late, how
would many that now despise Christ, wish to honour
him one Day. Men so long as they thought to be safe on
the Earth, would never betake them to the Ark, would
think it a Prison, and could Men find Salvation any
where else, they would never come to Christ for it:
this is, because they know not. But yet be it necessity
let that drive thee in, and then being in him thou shalt
find reason to love him for himself, besides the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thou hast in him.</p>
                  <p>2. You that have fled into him for refuge, wrong
him not so far as to question your safety, what
though the floods of thy former guiltiness rise high,
thine Ark shall still be above them, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they rise the higher he shall rise, shall have the
more glory in free justifying and saving thee, though
thou find the remaining power of sin still within
thee, yet it shall not sink thine Ark; there was in
this Ark sin, yet they were saved from the flood;
if thou doest believe, that puts thee in Christ,
and he will bring thee safe through, without splitting
or sinking.</p>
                  <p>3. As thou art bound to account thy self safe in
him, so to admire that love that set thee there. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
was a holy Man; but whence was both his
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104216:116"/>
holiness and preservation while the World perisht<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
but because he found favour, or free grace, as the
word is, in the eyes of the Lord. And no doubt
he did much contemplate this, being secure within,
when the cries of the rest, drowning, were about
him; thus think thou, seeing so few saved in this
blessed Ark, wherein I am, in comparison of the
multitudes that perish in the deluge, whence is this,
why I chosen and so many about me left?
why, but because it pleased him. But all is streight
here, we have no hearts nor no time for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thoughts of this love, till we be beyond time, then
shall we admire, and praise without ceasing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wearying.</p>

saw them meeting and concentring in Salvation as
their end. Thus likewise the Sacraments considered
indeed as Seals of this Inheritance, annexed to the great
Charter of it, Seals of Salvation; this would power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
beget a sit appetite for the Lord's Supper, when
we are invited to it, and would beget a due esteem
of Baptism, would teach you more frequent and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

they are set apart and differenced, as is evident by
external circumstances, from their common use, but

under them; and Oh! what another thing are they to it,
than to a formal user of them. We aspire to know the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

the Second death; the stretching of a moment to the
concernment of Eternity. How would any of you
welcome a full and sure protection from common
dangers, if such were to be had, that you should be
ascertained of safety from Sword and Pestilence, that
what ever others suffered about you, you and your
Family should be free; (And they that have escaped
a near danger of this kind resting there, as if no more
were to be feared, whereas this common favour may
be shew'd to these that are far off from God;) and what
though you be not only thus far safe, but, I say, if you
were secured for afterwards, which none of you abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
are, yet when you are put out of danger of
Sword and plague, still death remains, and sin and
wrath may be remaining with it, and shall it not be
all one to dye under these in a time of publick peace
and welfare as if it were now. Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unhappy by the increase of the heap of sin, and wrath,
guiltiness augmented by life prolong'd, and more
grievous to be pulled away from the World in the
middle of peacable enjoyment, and Everlasting dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to succeed to that short Sun-shine of thy day of
ease; happiness of a short date, and misery for ever.
What availed it wicked <hi>Cham,</hi> to outlive the flood
to Inherit a Curse after it, to be kept undrown'd in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:104216:117"/>
the waters, to see himself and his posterity blasted
with his Fathers Curse. Think seriously, what will
be the end of all thy temporary safety and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
if thou share not in this Salvation, and find not
thy self sealed and marked for it, to flatter thy self
with a dream of happiness, and walk in the light of
a few sparkles, that will soon dye out, and then lie down
in sorrow, a sad bed that the most have to go to after
they have wearied themselves all the day, all their
life, being in a chase of Vanity.</p>
                  <p>The next thing is, the power and vertue of this
means, for its end. That it hath a Power, is clear in
that it is so expresly said, <hi>it doth save us,</hi> which kind of
power, is as clear, in the way of it here exprest,
not by a natural force of the Element, though adapted
and sacramentally used; it only can wash away the
silth of the Body, its Physical Efficacy, or power rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
no further: but it is in the hand of the Spirit of
God as other Sacraments, and as the Word it self is,
to purifie the Conscience, and convey Grace, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Soul by the reference it hath to, and union
with that which it represents. It saves <hi>by answer of a
good Conscience unto God,</hi> and it affords that, <hi>by the
Resurrection of Iesus from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then we have a true Accompt of the Power
of this, and so of other Sacraments, and a discovery of
the error of two extreams. (1.) Of those that ascribe
too much to them, as if they wrought by a Natural
inherent Vertue, and carried Grace in them insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
2. Of those that ascribe too little to them, making
them only signs and badges of our Profession, signs they
are, but more than signs, meerly representing, they are
means exhibiting, and seals confirming Grace to the
Faithful. But the working of Faith, and the conveying
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:104216:118"/>
of Christ into the Soul to be received by Faith, is not a
thing put into them to do of themselves, but still in the
Supream hand, that appointed them: and he indeed
both causes the Souls of his own to receive these his
Seals with faith, and makes them effectually to confirm
that Faith, which receives them so. They are then in
a word neither empty signs to them that believe, nor
effectual Causes of Grace to them that believe not.</p>
                  <p>The mistake on both sides arises from the inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the relative Nature of these Seals, and that kind
of Union that is betwixt them, and the Grace they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,
which is real, though not Natural or Physical,
as they speak. So that, though they do not save all
that partake of them, yet they do really and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
save Believers, for whose Salvation they are means,
as the other external Ordinances of God do. Though
they have not that Power which is peculiar to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of them, yet a Power they have, such as befits
their Nature, and by reason of which, they are truely
said to Sanctifie, and Justifie, and so to save, as the
Apostle here avers of Baptism.</p>
                  <p>Now that which is intended for our help, our carnal
minds are ready to turn into a hinderance and disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
The Lord representing invisible things to the eye,
and confirming his Promises even by visible seals: we are
apt by the grossness of our unspiritual hearts, instead of
steping up by that which is earthly to the Divine Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things represented, to stay on the outward Element,
and go no further: therefore the Apostle to lead us into
the inside of this Seal of Baptism, is very clear in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
the effect and fruit of it. <hi>Not</hi> (says he) <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away the silth of the flesh,</hi> and water, if you look no
further can do no more. There is an invisible impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon our Nature, chiefly on our invisible Part, our

Soul; this washing means the taking away of that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the most professing Christianity, and partaking of the
outward Seals of it, and yet knowing not what they
mean, know not the spiritual dignity and vertue of
them; blind in the Mysteries of the Kingdom, and not
so much as sensible of that blindness. And being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the Nature of these holy things, cannot have
a due esteem of them, which arises out of the view of
their inward worth and efficacy. A confused fancy
of some good in them, and this rising to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
to a superstitious confidence in the simple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
and participance of them, as if that carried
some inseparable Vertue with it, which none could miss of,
that are sprinkled with the Waters of Baptism, and share
in the Elements of Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper.</p>

for the Truth, and the growth of that Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

(when he is about to appear before the Lord's
Table, and so looks something more narrowly within)
to find as little Faith, as little Divine Affection, a
Heart as unmortified to the World, as cold towards
Christ, as before his last Address to the same Table,
after the intervening possibly of many Months; in
which time had he been careful often to reflect inwards
on his Heart, and look back upon that new sealing in
his last Participation, he might likely have been more
suitable. And truly as there is much guiltiness cleaves
to us in this, so readily much more in reference to this
other Sacrament that is here the Apostles Subject, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
because but once administred, and that in Infancy,
very seldom and slightly considered by many, even
real Christians. And so we are at a loss in that Profit
and Comfort, that increase of both Holiness and Faith,
that the frequent recollecting of it after a Spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
would no doubt advance us to. And not only
neglect to put our selves upon the thoughts of it in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,

in publick; let it pass unregarded, are idle inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,

                     </gap>lighting
of them grows so common with us, as the thing. Yea,
when the Engagement is more special and personal,
when Parents are to present their Infants to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and then might, and certainly ought to have a
more particular and fixed eye upon it, and themselves as
being sealed with it, to ask within after the Fruit and

                     </gap> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
used in Law for the trial and executing of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses;
and this the great business of Conscience, to sit,
and examine, and judge within, to hold Courts in
the Soul, and it is of continual necessity, that it be so:
no vacancy of this Judicature without great damage to
the Estate of the Soul; yea, not a day ought to pass
without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>a Session of Conscience within; for there are
daily disorders arise in the Soul, which if they pass on
will grow and gather more, and so breed more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in their trial and redress. Yet men do readily
turn from this work as hard and unpleasant, and make
many a long vacancy in the year, and protract it from
one day to another; in the Morning they must go
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104216:121"/>
about their business, and at night they are weary and
sleepy, and all the day long one Affair steps in after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in case of that failing, some triffling company
or other, and so their days pass on, the Soul overgrows
with impurities and disorders.</p>
                  <p>You know what confusions, and disorders, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
will abound amongst a rude people, where there
is no kind of Court nor Judicature held, thus is it with
that unruly rable, the lusts and passions of our Souls,
when there is no discipline nor Judgement within,
or where there is but a neglect and intermission of it
for a short time. And the most of Souls are in the
posture of ruin, their vile affections, as a head-strong
tumultuous multitude, that will not suffer a deputed
Judge to sit amongst them, cry down their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and make a continual noise that the voice
of it may not be heard, and so force it to desist and leave
them to their own ways.</p>
                  <p>But you that take this course, know, you are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the severest Judgement for your selves by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing
of Judgement, as when a people rise against
an inferiour Judge, the Prince or Supreme Magistrate
that sent him hearing of it, doth not fail to vindicate
his honour and Justice in their exemplary punishment.</p>
                  <p>Will you not answer unto Conscience, but when it
begins to speak, turn to business, or Company, that
you may not hear it? know, that it and you must
answer unto God, and when he shall make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
it must report, and report as the truth is,
knowing that there is no hiding the matter from him.
Lord, there are to my knowledge a World of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
within the circuit I had to judge, and I would
have judged them, but was violented, and interrupted,
and was not strong enough to resist the tumultuous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104216:121"/>
that rose against me. Now the matter comes into
thine own hand to judge it thy self; What shall the
Soul say in that day, when Conscience shall make such
an answer unto God, and it shall come under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of his justice for all. Whereas if it had given
way to the Conscience to find out and judge and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
matters, it could have answered concerning its proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
that way, God would accept this as the answer of
a Good Conscience, and what he had done, he would
not do over again; it is judged, then I acquit, <hi>for if
we would judge our selves,</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>we should
not be judged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The questioning or inquiry of Conscience, and so
its report or answer unto God, extends to all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Soul, all the affections and motions of it,
and all the actions, and carriage of the whole Man.
The open wickedness of the most testifies against them,
that though sprinkled with water in Baptism, yet they
are Strangers to the power and Gracious Efficacy
of it, not <hi>Baptised with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</hi>
still their dross and filth remaining to them; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else appearing in their ways, so that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
cannot so much as make a good answer for
them unto Men, much less unto God. What shall
it answer for them being judged? but that they are
Swearers, and Cursers, and Drunkards, or unclean,
or that they are slanderers, delighting to pass their
hours in descanting on the actions and ways of others,
and looking through the miscoloured-glass of their own
malice, and pride, that they are neglecters of God,
and holy things, lovers of themselves, and their own
pleasures more than lovers of God, and have such as
these impudence enough to call themselves Christians?
and to pretend themselves to be such as are washed, in the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104216:122"/>
blood of Christ? yes they do this. But be ashamed
and confounded in your selves, you that remain in
this condition; yea although thou art blameless in
Men's Eyes, and possibly in thy own Eyes too, yet
thou mayst be filthy still in the sight of God. There
is such a Generation, a Multitude of them that is pure
in their own Eyes, and yet are not washed from their
filthiness. Moral evil persons that are most satisfied
with their own estate, or such as have further a form
of Godliness, but their lusts not mortified by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of it; secret pride, and earthliness of Mind, and
vain glory, and carnal wisdom still pleasingly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
within; these are foul Pollutions, filthy and
hateful in the sight of God, so that where it is thus,
that the heart is peaceably possest with such guests,
there the blood and Spirit of Christ are not yet come,
neither can there be this answer of a Good Conscience
unto God.</p>
                  <p>This answer of a Good Conscience unto God, as
likewise its questioning, to enable it self for that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
is touching two great points that are of chief
concern to their Soul, its <hi>Iustification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi>
for Baptism is the Seal of both, and purges the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in both respects, that water as the figure both of
the blood and water, the justifying blood of Christ,
and the pure water of the sanctifying Spirit of Christ;
takes away the condemning guiltiness of sin by
the one, and the polluting filthiness by the other.</p>
                  <p>Now the Conscience of a real Believer enquiring
within, upon right discovery will make this answer
unto God, Lord, I have found that there is no stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before thee, for the Soul in it self is overwhelmed
with a World of guiltiness, but I find a blood sprinkled
upon it, that hath, I am sure, vertue enough to purge
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104216:122"/>
it all away, and to present it pure unto thee, and I
know that wheresoever thou findest that blood sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
thine anger is quench'd and appealed presently upon
the sight of it; That hand cannot smite where that blood
is before thine eye. And this the Lord does agree to,
and authorises the Conscience, upon this account to
return back an answer of safety and peace to the
Soul.</p>
                  <p>So for the other, Lord, I find a living Work of holiness
on this Soul, though there is yet corruption there, yet
it is as a continual grief and vexation, its an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hatred, there is no peace betwixt them, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
enmity, and hostility, and if I cannot say much
of the high degrees of Grace, and faith in Christ, and
love to him, and heavenliness of Mind, yet I may say,
there is a beginning of those; at least this I most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
affirm, that there are real and earnest desires
of the Soul in these things.</p>
                  <p>It would know and conform to thy will, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from it self, and its own will, and though it
were to the highest displeasure of all the World, it
would gladly walk in all well pleasing unto thee.</p>
                  <p>And he that sees the truth of these things, knowing
it to be thus, owns it as his own work, and engages
himself to advance it on, and bring it to perfection.</p>
                  <p>This is a taste of that intercourse the purified Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
hath with God, as the saving fruit of Baptism.</p>
                  <p>And all this it doth, not of it self, but by vertue of
the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which refers both to
the utmost effect, <hi>Salvation;</hi> and the nearer effect
as a means and pledge of that, <hi>the purging of the Conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this, his Death and the effusion of his Blood in
his sufferings, are not excluded; but are included in
it: His Resurrection being the evidence of all that work
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104216:123"/>
of Expiation, both compleated and accepted; full Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made by our Surety, and so he set free, and his
Freedom the Cause and the Assurance of ours. Therefore
the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it so, <hi>That he died for our
sins, and rose for our righteousness,</hi> and our Apostle shews
us the worth of our living hope in this same resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
Chap. 1. v. 3. <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Iesus Christ, which according to his abundant
mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the
Resurrection of Iesus Christ from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that Baptism doth apply and seal to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
his Interest in the death and resurrection
of Christ, the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches to the full,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. The dipping into the waters, our dying
with him; and the return thence, our rising with
him.</p>
                  <p>The last thing is, the resemblance of Baptism in
these things, with the saving of <hi>Noah</hi> in the Flood, and
it holds in that we spoke last of, for he seemed to have
rather entred into a Grave as dead than into a safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
of Life, in going into the Ark, yet there being
buried, he rose again, as it were, in his coming forth to
begin a new World. The Waters of the Flood drown'd
the Ungodly, as a heap of filthiness washt them away,
they and their sin together as one, being inseparable;
and upon the same Waters, the Ark floating preserved
<hi>Noah.</hi> Thus the Waters of Baptism are intended as a
deludge to drown Sin, and to save the Believer, that by
Faith is separated both from the World and from his
Sin; so it sinks, and he is saved.</p>
                  <p>And there is further, one thing specified by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
wherein though it be a little hard, yet chiefly
intends the paralel. The fewness of these that are sav'd
by both, for though many are sprinkled with the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104216:123"/>
Water of Baptism, yet few, so as to attain by it the
Answer of a good Conscience towards God, and to
live by participance of the Resurrection and Life of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thou that seest the World perishing in a deluge of
Wrath, and art now most thoughtful for this, how thou
shalt escape it, fly into Christ, as thy safety, and rest
secure there; thou shalt find life in his death, and that
life further ascertained to you in his rising again: so
full and clear a Title to Life in these two, that thou
canst challenge all Adversaries upon this very Ground
as unconquerable, whilest thou standest on it, and speak
thy challenge in the Apostles stile, <hi>It is God that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth,
who shall condemn?</hi> But how know you that he
justifies? <hi>it is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen,
who sitteth at the right hand of God, who also maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for us,</hi> It alludes to that place, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. where
Christ speaks of himself, but in the name of all that
adhere to him; <hi>he is near that justifies me, who is he that
will contend with me:</hi> so that what Christ speaks there,
the Apostle with good reason imparts to each Believer
as in him. If no more to be laid to Christ's charge,
being now acquitted, as is clear by his rising again,
then neither to thine, who art cloathed with him, and
one with him.</p>
                  <p>This the grand Answer of a good Conscience, and
in point of justifying them before God, no answer but
this: What have any to say to thee, thy debt is paid by
him that undertook it, he is free? answer all accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with this, <hi>Christ is risen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then for the mortifying of sin, and strengthing
of thy Graces, look daily on that death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
study them, set thine eye upon them, till thy
Heart take in the Impression of them by much Spiritual
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104216:124"/>
and affectionate looking on them, beholding the Glory
of thy Lord Christ, then be transformed unto it, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 3.
It is not only a moral Patern or Copy, but an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Cause of thy sanctification, having real influence into
thy Soul; dead with him, and again alive with him.
Oh Happiness and Dignity unspeakable, to have this
Life known and cleared to your Souls! If it were, how
would it make you live above the World, and all the
vain hopes and fears of this wretched Life, and the
fears of Death it self, yea, it would make it most
lovely to them, that is the most affrightful Visage to
the World.</p>
                  <p>It is the Apostles Maxime, that <hi>the carnal mind is
enmity against God,</hi> as it is universally true of every
carnal mind, so of all the motions and thoughts of it,
even where it seems to agree with God, yet its still
contrary, if it acknowledge and conform to his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
yet even in so doing, its in direct opposite terms
to him, particularly in this, that which he esteems most
in them, the carnal mind makes least account of. He
chiefly eyes and values the inside, the Natural Man
dwells and rests in the shell and superfice of them. God
according to his Spiritual Nature looks most on the
more Spiritual part of his worship and Worshippers. The
carnal mind's in this, just like it selfe altogether for the
sensible external part, and cannot look beyond it.
Therefore the Apostle here having taken occasion to
speak of Baptism by terms of Paralel, and resemblance
with the Flood, is express in correcting this mistake. It
is not (says he) <hi>in putting away the filth of the flesh, but
the answer of a good conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were it possible to perswade you, I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
one thing to you, learn to look on the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God suitably to their Natures, spiritually,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104216:124"/>
and enquire after the spiritual effect and working of
them upon your Consciences. We would willingly

another thing; to thrust that upon him that he cares not

remain uncleansed from the old ways, not purified from
the Pollutions of the World? do thy beloved sins still
lodge with thee, and keep possession of thy heart, then
art thou still a stranger to Christ, and an enemy to
God, the word and seals of Life are dead to thee, and
thou still dead in the use of them all. Know you not,
that many have made shipwrack upon the very rock
of Salvation; that many which were baptised as well
as you, and as constant attendants on all the Worship
and Ordinances of God as you, yet remained without
Christ, and died in their sins, and are now past reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
Oh! that you would be warned; there are
still multitudes running headlong that same course
tending to destruction through the midst of all the
means of Salvation; the saddest way of all to it, through
Word and Sacraments, and all heavenly Ordinances to
be walking hellwards. Christians, and yet no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
baptised and yet unbaptised; as the Prophet
takes in the prophane multitude of God's own People
with the Nations, Jer. 9. 26. <hi>Egypt, and Iudah, and
Edom; all these Nations are uncircumcised,</hi> and the worst
came last, <hi>and all the House of Israel are uncircumcised in
the Heart.</hi> Thus, thus the most of us unbaptised in the
heart, and as this is the way of personal destruction,
so it is that, as the Prophet there declares, that brings
upon the Church so many publick Judgments; and as
the Apostle tells, that for the abuse of the Lord's Table,
<hi>many were sick and many slept.</hi> Certainly our abuse of
the holy things of God, and want of their proper Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

                  <p>What mean you, is not this the end of all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
to make all clean, and to renew and make

into a happy amity and a good correspondence, that
it may not only be in speaking terms, but often speak

and demanding, as this Word hath both. That it
may speak the language of faith and humble obedience
unto God, and he may speak the language of peace
to it, and both, the language of the Lord each to
other.</p>
                  <p>That Conscience alone is good, that is much busied
in this work, in demanding, and answering: that
speaks much with it self, and with God; this is both
the sign that it is good and the means to make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
That Soul will (doubtless) be very wary in
its walk, that takes daily account of it self, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
up that account unto God; it will not live by
guess, but readily examin each step before hand, because
it is resolved to examin all after, will consider well
what it should do, because it means to ask over again
what it hath done, and not only to answer it self, but
to make a faithful report of all unto God, to lay all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, continually upon tryal made, tell him what
is in any measure well done, as his own work, and
bless him for that: and tell him too all the slips and
miscarriages of the day, as our own, complaining of
our selves in his presence, and still intreating free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and more wisdom to walk more holily and
exactly; and gaining even by our failings more humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and more watchfulness.</p>
                  <p>If you would have your Consciences answer well,
they must enquire and question much, both before

have I prayed? was my heart humbled by the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of sin, from the Word? was it refresht with the
promises of grace, did it lye level under the word to
receive the stamp of it, was it in prayer set and kept
in a holy bent towards God? did it breath forth real
and earnest desires into his ear, or was it remiss and
roving and dead in the service? So in my Society with
others, in such and such Company, what was my time,
and how did I follow it, did I seek to honour my Lord,
and to edifie my Brethren by my carriage and speeches,
or did the time run out in trifling vain discourse?
when alone, what's the carriage and walk of my heart,
where it hath most liberty to move its own pace, is
it delighted in converse with God? are the thoughts
of heavenly things frequent, and sweet to it, or does
it run after the earth and the delights of it, spinning out
it self in impertinent vain Contrivances?</p>
                  <p>The neglect of such inquiries is that, which entertains
and increases the impurity of the Soul, so that Men
are afraid to look into themselves, and to look up to
God. But Oh! what a foolish course is this to shift off
that which cannot be avoided; in the end answer must
be made to that all-seeing Judge, with whom we have
to do, and to whom we owe our accompts.</p>
                  <p>And truly it would be seriously considered what

purifying of the Conscience that makes it good, pure
and peaceable. In the purifying it may be troubled,
which is but the stirring in cleansing of it, which makes
more quiet in the end, as Physick, or the launcing of a
sore, and after it is in some measure cleansed, it may
have fits of trouble, which yet still add further purity
and further peace: so there is no hazard in that work;

it cannot be: for he is holy, and iniquity cannot
dwell with him; what Communion betwixt light
and darkness; so then the Conscience must be cleansed
e're it can look upon God with assurance and peace.
This cleansing is sacramentally performed by Baptism,
effectually by the Spirit of Christ, and the blood of
Christ; and he lives to impart both. Therefore
here is mention'd his resurrection from the dead, as
that, by virtue whereof we are assured of this purging
and peace. Then can it in some measure with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
answer, Lord, though polluted by former sins,
and by sin still dwelling in me, yet thou seest that my
desires are daily more like my Christ; I would have
more love and zeal for thee, more hatred of sin, that
can answer with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that was posed, <hi>lovest thou me?</hi>
Lord I appeal to thine own eye, who seest my heart,
<hi>Lord thou knowest that I love thee,</hi> at least I desire to love
thee, and to desire thee and that is love. Willingly
would I do thee more sutable service, and honour thy
name more, and do desire more Grace for this, that
thou maist have more Glory, and intreat the light of
thy Countenance for this end, that by seeing it my
heart may be more weaned from the World, and knit
unto thy self, thus it answers touching its inward frame,
and the work of holiness by the Spirit of holiness
dwelling in it: But to answer Justice touching the
point of guilt, it flies to the blood, fetches all its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
thence, turns over the matter upon it, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
for it; for it doth speak, and speaks better things
than the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> speaks full payment of all that
can be exacted from the sinner, and that's a sufficient
answer.</p>
                  <p>The Conscience is then in this point once made speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,

to say. Lord there is indeed in me nothing but guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I have deserved death, but I have fled into the
City of refuge, thou hast appointed, there I resolve
to abide, to live and die there, if Justice pursue me
it shall send me there, I take sanctuary in Jesus, my

wherewithal to answer it.</p>
                  <p>He can straightway declare, he hath pay'd all,
and can make it good; hath the acquittance to shew,
yea, his own liberty is a real sign of it, he was in

Hand of God, you are not ignorant that it is a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Expression drawn from Earth to Heaven, to bring
down some Notion of Heaven to us, to signifie to us
in our Language, suitably to our Customs, the Supream
Dignity of Jesus Christ, God and Man, the Mediator
of the New Covenant, his matchless nearness unto
his Father, and the Sovereignty given him over Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth. And that of the subjection of Angels,
is but a more particular specifying of that his Dignity
and Power; as enthron'd at the Father's right Hand;
they being the most elevated and glorious Creatures;
so his Authority over all the World implyed in that
subjection of the highest and noblest part of it: His
Victory and Triumph over the Angels of Darkness is
an evidence of his Invincible Power and Greatness,
and matter of Comfort to his Saints, but this here is
his Supremacy over the glorious Elect Angels.</p>

That there is amongst them Priority we find, that
there is a comely order in their differences cannot be
doubted: but to marshal their Degrees and Stations
above, is a point, not only of vain fruitless Curiosity,
but of presumptuous intrusion, whether these are names
of their different particular Dignities, or only different
names of their general Excellency and Power, as I
think it cannot be certainly well determin'd, so it
imports us not to determine; only this we know, and
are particularly taught from this place, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is their common Dignity both in names
and differences, they are all subject to our glorious
Head, Christ.</p>
                  <p>What Confirmation they have in their Estate by him
(though piously asserted by Divines) is not so infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
clear from the alledged Scriptures, which may
bear another sense: But this is certain, that he is their
King, and they acknowledge him so, and do incessantly
admire and adore him; they rejoyce in his glory, and
in the glory and happiness of Mankind through him,
they yield him most cheerful obedience, and serve him
readily in the good of his Church, and each particular
Believer, as he deputes and imploys them.</p>
                  <p>Which is the thing here intended, having in it these
two. (1) His Dignity above them. 2. His Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them. (1.) Dignity, that even that Nature,
which he stoopt below them to take on, he hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up and raised it above them, the very Earth, the
flesh of Man exalted in his Person above all those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Spirits, who are of so excellent and pure a Being
in their Nature, and from the beginning of the World
cloathed with so transcendent Glory; that a parcel of
Clay is made so bright, and set so high to outshine these
bright flaming Spirits, these Stars of the Morning, that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:104216:129"/>
flesh being united to the Fountain of Light, the blessed
Deity in the Person of the Son.</p>
                  <p>In coming to fetch and put on this Garment he made
himself lower than the Angels; but carrying it with
him at his return to his eternal Throne, and sitting
down with it there, it is high above them, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
teaches excellently and amply, <hi>Heb. 1. 2. To

not with envy nor repining, no, amongst all their eyes,
no such eye to be found; yea, they rejoyce in the
infinite Wisdom of God in this Design, and his infinite
Love to poor lost Mankind; its wonderful indeed to
to see him filling the room of their fallen Brethren, with
new guests from Earth; yea, such as are born Heirs
of Hell; not only thus sinful Man raised to a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pance

they are intent in looking and prying into, and cannot,
nor never shall see the bottom of it, for it hath none.</p>
                  <p>2. Jesus Christ is not only exalted above the Angels
in absolute Dignity, but in relative Authority over
them, he is made Captain over those Heavenly Bands,
they are all under his Command, for all Services where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it pleases him to employ them; and the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
he hath, is the attending on his Church, and
particular Elect Ones; <hi>are they not all ministring Spirits
sent forth,</hi> &amp;c. They are the Servants of Christ, and in
him, and at his appointment the Servants of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
and are many ways serviceable and useful for
their good, which truely we do not duly consider.
There is no danger of overvaluing them, and inclining
to Worship them upon this Consideration, yea, if we take
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104216:130"/>
it right, it will rather take off from that. The Angel
judg'd his Argument strong enough to St. <hi>Iohn</hi> against
that, that he was but his fellow Servant: but this is
more, that they are Servants to us, although not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
inferiour, it being a honorary service, yet certainly
inferiour to our Head, and so to his mystical body,
taken in that Nation as a part of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. The hight of this our Saviour's Glory will
appear the more, if we reflect on the descent by which
he ascended to it; Oh! how low did we bring down
so high a Majesty into the pit wherein we had fallen
by climbing to be higher than he had set us; it was
high by reason we fell so low, and yet he against whom
it was committed came down to help us up again, and
to take hold of us, <hi>took us on;</hi> so the Word is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. he
took not hold of the Angels; let them go, hath left
them to die for ever: But he took hold of the
Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and took on him indeed their
flesh dwelling amongst us, and in a mean part; emptied
himself and became of no repute, and further after he
descended into the Earth, and into our flesh, in it
he became obedient to death upon the Cross, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
into the Grave. And by these steps was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards that Glory wherein now he is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. he
abased himself wherefore says the Apostle, <hi>God hath
highly exalted him,</hi> so he himself, Luk. 24. <hi>Ought not
Christ first to suffer these things, and so enter into his Glory.</hi>
Now this indeed it is pertinent to consider, and the
Apostle is here upon point of suffering, that's his
theam, and therefore he is so particular in the ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ to his Glory; who of those that would
come thither will refuse to follow him in the way
where he led <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the leader of our Faith,</hi> Heb. 12. and
who of those that follow him, will not love and delight
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104216:130"/>
to follow him through any way, the lowest and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
its excellent and safe, and then it ends you see
where.</p>
                  <p>2. Think not strange of the Lord's method with his
Church, bringing her to so low and desperate a Posture
many times; can she be in a more seeming desperate
condition than was her head, not only in ignominous
sufferings, but dead and laid in the Grave, and the
Stone roll'd to it and sealed, and made all sure, and yet
arose and ascended, and now sits in Glory, and shall sit
till all his Enemies become his Footstool; do not fear
for him, that they shall overtop, yea, or be able to
reach him, who is exalted higher than the Heavens;
be not affraid neither for his Church, which is his Body,
and if his Head be safe and live, cannot but partake of
safety and life with him; though she were to sight
dead and laid in the Grave,<note place="margin">Isa. 26. 19.</note> yet shall she rise thence and
be more glorious than before, and still the lower
brought in distress, shall rise the higher in the day
of deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Thus in his dealing with a Soul, observe the Lord's
method; think it not strange, that he brings a Soul
low, very low, which he means to comfort and exalt
very high in Grace and Glory; leads it by Hell-gates
to Heaven, that it be at that point, <hi>my God, my God
why hast thou forsaken me;</hi> was not the Head put to use
that Word, and so to speak it, as the Head speaks for
the Body, seasoning it for his Members, and sweetning
that bitter cup by his own drinking of it. Oh! what
a hard condition may a soul be brought unto, and put
to think, <hi>can he love me, and intend mercy for me? that
leaves me to this:</hi> And yet in all, the Lord preparing
it thus for comfort and blessedness.</p>
                  <p>3. Turn your thoughts more frequently to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

do not draw that comfort and that instruction from it
which it would plentifully afford, if it were drawn.
It comforts us against all troubles and fears, is he not on

us but it is past first in Heaven, and shall any thing
pass there to our prejudice or damage, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and is upon the Counsel of all, who hath loved us,
and given himself for us: yea, who, as he descended
thence for us, did likewise ascend thither again for us,
hath made our Inheritance, he purchas'd, there sure to us,
taking Possession for us, and in our name, since he is
there, not only as the Son of God, but as our Surety,
and as our Head, and so the Believer may think himself
even already possest of this Right, in as much as his
Christ is there. The Saints are glorified already in their
head, where he reigns. <hi>Where he reigns, there I believe
my self to reign,</hi>

contemplation rightly, ever to look on thy exalted head,
consider his glory: see not only thy Nature raised in him
above the Angels: but thy person interested by Faith
in that his Glory; and then think thy self too good to
serve any base lust, look down on Sin and the World
with a holy disdain, being united to him who is so
exalted and so glorious. And let not thy mind creep
here, engage not thy Heart to any thing that Time
and this Earth can afford; Oh! why are we so little

ought it not to be thus? should not our hearts be

sin, <gap reason="foreign">

influence each into the other; altho affliction sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
doth not, yet affliction sweetly and humbly carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
doth purifie and disingage the heart from sin, weans
it from the world and the common wayes of it. And
again, holy and exact walking keeps the Soul in a sound
healthful temper, and so enables it to patient suffering,
to bear things more easily; as a strong body endures
fatigue, heat, and cold, and hardship with ease, a small
part whereof would surcharge a sickly constitution.
The conscience of Sin, and careless unholy courses, do
wonderfully weaken a Soul and distemper it: so that
it is not able to endure much, every little thing disturbs
it. Therefore the Apostle hath reason, as to insist on
these two points so much in this Epistle, so to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weave
so often the one with the other, pressing joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
throughout, the chearful bearing of all kind of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:104216:133"/>
and the careful forbearing all kind of Sin; and
out of the one discourse slides into the other: so here.</p>
                  <p>And as the things agree in their nature, so in their

hath suffered for us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The chief study of a Christian, and the very thing
that makes him to be a Christian, is conformity with
Christ.<note place="margin">[Summa religionis i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitari quem colis.] <hi>Pyth.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>This is the Sum of Religion</hi> (said that wise Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then)
<hi>to be like him whom thou worshippest.</hi> But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
being in it self too sublime, is brought down to
our view in Christ, the brightness of God veil'd, and
veil'd in our own flesh, that we may look on it. The
inaccessible Light of the Deity is so attempered in the
humanity of Christ, that we may read our Lesson by
it in him, and may direct our walk by it, and that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is our only way; nothing but wandring and perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all other wayes, darkness and misery out of
him, but <hi>he that follows me,</hi> says he, <hi>shall not walk in
darkness.</hi> And therefore is he set before us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
in so clear und lively colours, that we may make
this our whole endeavour to be like him.</p>
                  <p>Consider here, 1. The high ingagement to this
conformity. 2. The nature of it. 3. The actual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of it. The ingagement lies in this, that
he suffered for us. Of this before, only in reference to
this, had he come down, as some have mis-imagined
it, only to set us this perfect way of obedience, and
give us an example of it in our own nature: this had
been very much, that the Son of God would descend to
teach wretched man, and the great King to descend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
man, and dwell in a Tabernacle of Clay, to set up a
School in it, for such ignorant accursed creatures, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:104216:133"/>
did in his own person act the hardest lessons, both in
doing and suffering to lead us in both. But the matter
goes yet higher than this. Oh! how much higher hath
he suffered, not simply as our rule, but as our Surety,
and in our stead. <hi>He suffered for us in the flesh.</hi> We the
more obliged to make his suffering our example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was to us more than an example, it was our
ransom.</p>
                  <p>This makes the conformity reasonable in a double
respect 1. It is due that we follow him, who led thus
as the Captain of our Salvation, that we follow in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
and in doing, seeing both were so for us; its
strange how some Armies have addicted themselves to
their head, to be at his call night and day, in Summer
and Winter, to refuse no travel or endurance of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for him, and all only to pleasure him, and serve
his inclination and ambition, as <hi>Caesar's</hi> trained bands
especially the eldest of them, a wonder what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
in countermarches and tracing from one Country
to another: But besides that, our Lord and Leader is
so great and excellent, and so well deserves following
for his own worth; this lays upon us an obligation
beyond all conceiving, that he first suffered for us,
that he endured such hatred of Men, and such wrath of
God the Father, and went through death, so vile a
death, to procure our life: what can be too bitter to
endure? or too sweet to forsake to follow him? Were
this duly considered would we cleave to our lusts, or
to our ease, would we not through fire and water, yea
through death it self, yea were it through many
deaths to go after him?</p>
                  <p>2. Consider as its due, so it is made easie by that his
suffering for us; our burden that pressed us to hell,
taken off, is not all as nothing that is left to suffer or
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:104216:134"/>
do? our Chains that bounds us over to eternal Death
being knock'd off, shall we not walk? shall we not
run in his ways? Oh! think what that Burden and
Yoke was he hath eased us of, how heavy, how unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
it was, and then we shall think what he so truly
says, that all he lays on, is sweet, <hi>his yoke easie, and
his burden light.</hi> Oh! the happy change, rescued
from the vilest slavery, and called to conformity and
Fellowship with the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>2. The Nature of this Conformity (to shew the
nearness of it) is exprest in the very same terms as
in the pattern, it is not a remote resemblance, but the
same thing, even <hi>suffering in the flesh.</hi> But that we may
take it right, what suffering is here meant, it is plainly
this, ceasing from sin; so suffering in the flesh here, is
not the enduring of afflictions, which is a part of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
Conformity with his head, Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. But
this is a more inward and spiritual suffering, it is the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and the dying of our Corruption, the taking away
the life of sin by the death of Christ, and that death of
his sinless flesh works in the Believer the death of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
flesh, that is the Corruption of his Nature, which
is so usually in Scripture called <hi>flesh.</hi> Sin makes Man
base, drowns him in flesh, and the lusts of it, makes
the very Soul become gross and earthly, turns it as it
were to flesh: so the Apostle calls the very Mind that
is unrenewed, <hi>a carnal mind. Rom.</hi> 8. And what doth
the mind of a Natural Man hunt after and run out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
from one day and year to another; is it not on
things of this base World and the concernment of his
flesh?<note place="margin">Corporis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotium.</note> What would he have, but be accommodated to
eat, and drink, and dress, and live at ease; he minds
earthly things, savours and relishes them and cares
for them; examin the most of your pains, and time,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:104216:134"/>
and your strongest desires, and most serious thoughts,
if they go not this way to raise your selves and yours
in your Worldly condition: yea the highest projects of
the greatest natural Spirits are but earth still, in respect
of things truly spiritual; all their State Designs go
not beyond this poor life that perishes in the flesh, and
is daily perishing, even while we are busiest, upholding
it and providing for it: present things, and this lodge
of clay, this flesh and its interest, take up most of our
time and pains, the most, yea all, till that change
be wrought the Apostle speaks of, till Christ be put on,
<hi>Rom. 13. put ye on the Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and then the
other will easily follow, that follows in the Words,
<hi>make no provision for the flesh to fullfil it in the lusts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
Once in Christ, and then your necessary general
care for this natural life will be regulated and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the Spirit. And for all unlawful and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
desires of the flesh, you shall be rid of providing
for these; instead of all provision for the life of the
flesh in that sense, there is another guest and another
life for you now to wait on, and furnish for: in

he that hath suffered in the flesh and is dead to it, dies
indeed in the Lord; rests from the base turmoil of sin,
it is no longer his Master. As our sin was the cause of
Christs death; his death is the death of sin in us, and
that not simply, as he bear a moral pattern of it, but
the real working cause of it, hath an effectual influence
on the Soul, kills it to sin; <hi>I am crucified with Christ,</hi>
says S. <hi>Paul:</hi> Faith so looks on the death of Christ, that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:104216:135"/>
it takes the impression of it, sets it on the heart, kills
it unto sin: Christ and the Believer do not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one in law, so as his death stands for theirs, but
are in nature, so as his death for sin causes theirs to it.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
                  <p>This suffering in the flesh being unto death, and
such a death <hi>[Crucifying]</hi> hath indeed pain in it,
but what then, it must be so like his, and the believer
like him, in willingly enduring it; all the pain of his
suffering in the flesh, his love to us digested, and went
through it, so all the pain to our nature in severing
and pulling us from our beloved sins, and our dying
to them, if his love be planted in our hearts, that will
sweeten it, and make us delight in it, love desires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than likeness, and shares willingly in all with
the party loved; and above all love, this Divine Love
is purest and highest, and works strongliest that way,
takes pleasure in that pain, and is a voluntary death:
as <hi>Plato</hi> calls love, it is strong as death, makes the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

of Christ make the activest and liveliest sinner dead to
his sin. And as death fevers a Man from his dearest
and most familiar friends, thus doth the love of Christ
and his death flowing from it, fever the heart from its
most beloved sins.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you seek to have your hearts set against sin,
to hate it, to wound it and be dying daily to it. Be
not satisfy'd, unless ye feel an abatement of it, and a
life within you; disdain that base service, and being
bought at so high a rate, think your selves too good to be
slaves to any base lust, you are called to a more excellent
and more honourable service. And of this suffering
in the flesh we may safely say what the Apostle speaks
of the sufferings with and for Christ, that the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104216:135"/>
of these sufferings are co-heirs of glory with Christ,
<hi>if we suffer thus with him, we shall also be glorified with
him; if we die with him, we shall live with him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The actual improvement of this Conformity.
<hi>Arm your selves with the same Mind,</hi> or thoughts of this
Mortification. Death taken Naturally in its proper
sense, being an intire privation of life, admits not of
degrees: but this figurative death, this Mortification
of the flesh in a Christian, is gradual, in so far as he is
renewed, and is animated, and acted by the Spirit of
Christ, he is throughly mortified; (for this death, and
that new life joyned with it, and here added, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.
go together and grow together) but because he is not
totally renewed, and there is in him of that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
still that is here called flesh, therefore is this great
task to be gaining further upon it, and overcoming
and mortifying it every Day, and to this tend the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Exhortations of this Nature. <hi>Mortifie your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that are on the earth.</hi> So Rom. 6. <hi>Likewise
reekon your selves dead to sin,</hi> and <hi>let it not reign in your
mortal bodies.</hi> Thus here. <hi>Arm your selves with the
same Mind,</hi> or with this very thought. Consider and
apply that suffering of Christ in the flesh to the end,
that you with him suffering in the flesh, may cease from
sin. Think it ought to be thus, and seek that it may

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arm your selves.</hi>] There is still fighting, and sin will
be molesting you, though wounded to death, yet will
it struggle for life, and seek to wound its enemy; will
assault the graces that are in you. Do not think if it
be once struck, and you have a hit near to the heart by
the Sword of the Spirit, that therefore it will stir no
more. No, so long as you live in the flesh in these bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:104216:136"/>
there will be remainders of the life of this flesh, your
natural corruption. Therefore ye must be Armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. Sin will not give you rest so long as there is
a drop of blood in its vein, one spark of life in it, and
that will be so long as you have life here. This old
Man is stout and will fight himself to death; and at the
weakest it will rouze up it felt and act its dying Spirits,
as Men will do sometimes more eagerly, then when they
were not so weak, nor so near death.</p>
                  <p>This the Children of God often find to their grief,
that corruptions, which they thought had been cold dead,
stir and rise up again, and set upon them. A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>assion or
Lust, that after some great stroke lay along while as
dead, stirred not, and therefore they thought to have
heard no more of it, though it shall never recoverfully
again to be lively as before, yet will revive in such a
measure as to molest, and possibly to foyl them yet again.
Therefore is it continually necessary that they live in
Arms and put them not off to their dying day; till
they put off the body and be altogether free of the flesh:
you may take the Lord's promise for victory in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>nd that shall not fail, but do not promise your self
ease in the way, for that will not hold: if at somtimes
you be at under, give not all for lost, he hath often
won the Day that hath been foiled and wounded in the
fight, but likwise take not all for won, so as to have no
more conflict, when sometimes you have the better, as
in particular battels: be not desperate when you loose,
nor secure when you gain them; when it is worst with
you do not throw away your Arms, nor lay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
when you are at best.</p>
                  <p>Now the way to be armed is this, <hi>the same mind,</hi> how
would my Lord Christ carry himself in this case, and
what was his business in all places and Companies?
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:104216:136"/>
was it not to do the will and advance the glory of his
Father? If I be injured and reviled, consider how would
he do in this, would he repay one injury with another,
one reproach with another reproach? No <hi>being reviled he
reviled not again;</hi> Well through his strength this shall
be my way too. Thus ought it to be with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
framing all his ways, and words, and very thoughts
upon that model, the mind of Christ, and to study
in all things to walk even as he walked. 1. Studying,
it much, as the reason and rule of Mortification.
2. Drawing from it, as the real Cause and Spring of
mortification.</p>
                  <p>The pious Contemplation of his Death will most
powerfully kill the love of sin in the Soul, and kindle
an ardent hatred of it. The Believer looking on his
Jesus crucified for him, and wounded for his transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and taking in deep thoughts of his spotless Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
that deserved no such thing, and of his matchless
love that yet endured it all for him, then will he think,
shall I be a friend to that which was his deadly enemy?
shall sin be sweet to me, that was so bitter to him, and
that for my sake? shall I ever have a favourable thought
or lend it a good look, that shed my Lord's blood?
shall I live in that for which he died, and died to kill it
in me. Oh! let it not be.</p>
                  <p>To the end it may not be, let such really apply
that Death to work this on the Soul, for this is always
to be added, and is the main indeed, by holding and
fastning that Death close to the Soul effectually to kill
the effects of sin in it, to sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>e and crush them dead by
pressing that death on the heart, looking on it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a most compleat model, but as having a most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
vertue for this effect, and desiring him, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Lord himself, who communicates himself and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:104216:137"/>
the vertue of his death to the Believer, that he would
powerfully cause it to flow to us; and let us feel the
vertue of it.</p>
                  <p>Its then the only thriving and growing life to be
much in the lively Contemplation and Application of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, to be continually studying him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with him, and drawing from him, receiving of
his fullness grace for grace. Wouldest thou have much
power against sin, and much increase of holiness? let
thine eye be much on Christ, set thine heart on him;
let it dwell in him, and be still with him. When sin is
like to prevail in any kind, go to him, tell him of the
insurrection of his enemies, and thy inability to resist,
and desire him to suppress them, and to help thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, that they may gain nothing by their stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
but some new wound. If thy heart begin to be taken
with and move towards sin, lay it before him, the beams
of his love shall eat out that fire of these sinful lusts.
Wouldest thou have thy Pride, and Passions, and love of
the World, and self love kill'd? go suit for the vertue of
his death and that shall do it: seek his Spirit, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Meekness, and Humility, and Divine Love. Look
on him, and he shall draw thy heart heavenwards, and
unite it to himself, and make it like himself. And is
not that the thing thou desirest?</p>

leave out Christ in the work, and so remain in their
Captivity, yea it grows upon them, and while we press
them to free themselves and shew not Christ to
them, we put them upon an impossiblity, but a look
to him makes it feisable and easie. Faith in him, and
that love to him, which faith begets, breaks through
and surmounts all; its the powerful love of Christ that

he is one throughout in Death and Life, as Christ
rose, so he that is dead to sin with him through the
power of his Death, rises to that new life with him
through the power of his Resurrection. And those
two are our Sanctification, which, whosoever do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

from him. Thus are they joyned, <hi>Rom. 6. 11. Likewise

                  <p>All they that do really come to Jesus Christ, as they
come to him as their Saviour to be cloathed with him
and made righteous by him; they come likewise to
him as their Sanctifier, to be made new and holy by
him, to die and live with him, to follow the Lamb
wheresoever he goes, through the hardest sufferings, and
Death it self, and this spiritual suffering and dying
with him is the universal way of all his followers;

flesh, and so dying for him, and with him; and they
may well go cheerfully through, though it bear the
unpleasant name of Death; yet as the other Death is
(which makes it so little terrible, yea often appears so
much desirable to them) so is this the way to a far
more excellent and happy life, so that they may pass
through it gladly both for the company and end of it;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:104216:138"/>
its with Christ they go into his death, as unto life in
his life: Though a Believer might be free upon these
terms he would not, no sure: could he be content with
that easie life of sin, instead of the Divine Life of Christ?
no, he will do thus and not accept of deliverance, that he
may obtain (as the Apostle speaks of the Martyrs)
a better resurrection. Think on it again, you to whom
your sins are dear still, and this life sweet, you are yet
far from Christ, and his life.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle with intent to press this more home,
expresses more at large, the nature of the oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

estates and lives that he speaks of, so sets before his
Christian Brethren. 1. The Dignity of that new life.
2. By a particular reflex upon the former life presses the
change. The former life he calls a living, <hi>to the
lusts of Men;</hi> this new spiritual life <hi>to the will of
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The lusts of Men.</hi>] Such as are common to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Nature of Man, such as every Man may find in
himself, and perceive in others. The Apostle in the
third verse more particularly for further clearness spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies
these kind of Men that were most notorious in
these lusts, and those kind of lusts that are most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in Men. Writing to the dispersed Jews he calls
sinful lusts, <hi>the will of the Gentiles,</hi> as having least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
of contrary light in them; and yet the Jews
walked in the same, though they had the Law as a light
and rule for the avoiding of them, and implies, that
these lusts were unbeseeming even their former conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as Jews; but much more unsuitable to them as now
Christians. Some of the grossest of these Lusts he
names, meaning all the rest, all the ways of sin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
their vileness the more lively, not as some
take it, when they hear of such hainous sins, that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104216:139"/>
lessen the evil of more civil nature by the Comparison,
as if freedom from these were a blameless condition, and
a change of it needless. No, the Holy Ghost means
it just contrary. That we may judge of all sin and of
our sinful nature, by our estimate of these sins, that are
most dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in degree, yet is of one nature and originally
springing from one root, arising from the same unholy
nature of Man, and contrary to the same holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and will of God.</p>
                  <p>So then. 1. These that walk in these high ways of
impiety and yet will have the name of Christians, they
are the shame of Christians, and the profest enemies of
Jesus Christ, and of all others most hateful to him,
that seem to have taken on his name for no other end,
but to shame and disgrace it, but he shall vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and the blot shall rest upon these impudent persons
that dare hold up their faces in the Church of God as
parts of it, and are indeed nothing but the dishonour of
it, spots and blots; that dare own to Worship God
as his people and remain unclean, riotous and prophane
persons. How suits thy sitting here before the Lord,

How agrees the Word, sounds it well, there
goes a drunken Christian, unclean, basely covetous,
earthly minded Christian, and the naming of these is
not besides the text, but the very words of it, for the
Apostle warrants us to take it under the name of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and in that name he reckons it to be mortified by
a Christian. <hi>Col. 3. 5. Mortifie therefore your members

Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. But yet men that are some way exempted from
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104216:139"/>
the blot of these foul impieties, may still remain slaves
to sin, alive to it, and dead to God, living to the
Lusts of Men, and not to the Will of God, pleasing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and themselves, displeasing him. And the smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
best bred, and most moralized Natural is in this
base thraldom. And the more miserable that he dreams
of liberty in the midst of his chains, thinks himself
gay by looking on those that wallow in gross pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,
takes measure of himself, by the most
crooked lives of ungodly men about him, and so thinks
himself very streight; but lays not the streight Rule
of the Will of God to his Ways and Heart, which if
he did, he would then discover much crookedness in
his ways, and much more in his heart, that now he
sees not, but takes it for square and even.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I advise and desire you to look more
narrowly to your selves in this, and see whether you
be not still living to your own Lusts and Wills instead
of God, seeking in all your ways to advance and please
your selves and not him: is not the bent of your
hearts set that way, do not your whole Desires and
Endeavours run in that Channel, how you and yours
may be some body, and you may have where withal to
serve the flesh, and to be accounted of, and respected
amongst men? and if we trace it home, all a man's
honouring and pleasing of others tends to, and ends in
pleasing of himself, it resolves in that, and is it not so
meant by him, he pleases men either that he may gain
by them, or be respected by them, or something that is
still pleasing to himself may be the return of it: So Self
is the grand Idol for which all other heart-idolatries are
committed. And indeed in the unrenewed Heart there

The Natural Motion and Way of the Natural Heart is
no other, but still secking out new inventions, a forge
of new Gods, still either forming them to it self, or
worshipping these it hath already framed, committing
Spiritual Fornication from God with the Creature, and
multiplying Lovers every where as it is tempted: As
the Lord complains of his People, <hi>upon every Hill, and
under every green Tree.</hi>

                  <p>You will not believe thus much ill of your selves,
will not be convinc'd of this unpleasant but necessary
Truth, and this is a part of our self-pleasing, that we
please our selves in this, that we will not see it, not in
our callings and ordinary ways, not in our religious
Exercises, for in these we naturally aim at nothing,
but our selves, either our Reputation, or at best our
own Safety and Peace, either to stop the cry of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in present, or escape the Wrath that is to come,
but not in a Spiritual regard of the Will of God, and out
of pure love to himself, for himself, yet thus it should
be, and that love the divine Fire in all our Sacrifices.
The carnal mind is in the dark, and sees not its vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in living to it self, will not confess it to be so;
but when God comes into the Soul, he lets it see it self,
and all its idols and idolatries, and forces it to abhor and
loath it self for all its abominations; and having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
its filthiness to it self, then purges and cleanses
it for himself from all its filthiness, and from all its
idols according to his promise, and comes in and takes
possession of it for himself, enthrones himself in the

that except they be adapted and suited together in the
change, it availes not: yea, it sometimes proves the
worse in the whole, though a few things in particular
seem to be bettered. Thus half Reformations in a
Christian, turn to his prejudice, its only best to be
throughout, and to give up with all Idols, and not to
live one half to himself and the World, and as it were,
another half to God; for that is but falsely so,
in reality it cannot be: but the way is to make an

to no lust, but altogether, and only to God. Thus

others? wilt thou provoke him to Jealousie; yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how thou givest a thought or look of thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
any other way, for he will spy it, and will not
endure it. The Title of a Husband is as strict and tender,
as the other of a King.</p>
                  <p>Its only best to be thus, thy great advantage, and
happiness to be thus entirely freed from so many tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
base Lord's and now subject only to one, and he so
great and withal so gracious and sweet a King, the
Prince of Peace; thou wast hurried before and rack't
with the very multitude of them, thy Lusts so many
cruel task masters over thee, they gave thee no
rest, and the work they set thee to, was base
and slavish; more than the burdens, and pots, and toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the Clay of <hi>Egypt,</hi> held to work in the Earth,
to pain and to soyl and soul thy self with their drudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Now thou hast but one to serve, and that's a great
ease, and its no slavery, but true honour to serve so
excellent a Lord and in so high services: for he puts thee
upon nothing, but what is neat and what is honourable,
thou art as a Vessel of honour in his House for his best
employments, now thou art not at pain to please this
person and others, to vex thy self to gain Men,
to study their approbation and honours, nor to keep to
thine own lusts and observe their mind. None but
thy God to please in all, and so he be pleased, maist disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
who be displeased; his will is not fickle and changing
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104216:141"/>
as mens are, and thine own; he hath told thee what
he likes and desires, and alters not: so now thou
knowest whom thou hast to do withal, and what to
do, whom to please, and what will please him, and
this cannot but much settle thy mind, and put thee to
ease, and thou maist say heartily, as rejoycing in the
change of so many for one, and such, for such a one,
as the Church says, Isa. 26 13. <hi>O Lord our God, other
Lords beside thee have had dominion over me, but now
by thee only will I make mention of thy name,</hi> now none
but thy self, not so much as the name of them any
more, away with them, through thy Grace thou only
shalt be my God. It cannot endure any thing be nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with thee.</p>
                  <p>Now that it may be thus, that we may wholly
live to the will of God, we must know his will what
it is: Persons grosly ignorant of God and of his will, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live to him; we cannot have fellowship with
him, and walk in darkness, for he is light. This
takes off a great many amongst us that have not so
much as a common Notion of the Will of God; but
besides, that Knowledge, which is a part, and (I may
say) the first part, of the renewed Image of God, is
not a Natural Knowledge of Spiritual Things, meerly
attained by human teaching or industry; but its a
beam of God's own, issuing from himself, both enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and enlivening the whole Soul, gains the affection
and stirs to action: and so indeed it acts, and increases by
acting: for the more we walk according to that of the
Will of God which we know, the more we shall be
advanced to know more: that is the real <hi>proving what
is his good, and holy, and acceptable will.</hi> Rom 12. 2. so
says Christ, <hi>if any will do the Will of my Father, he shall
know of the Doctrine;</hi> our lying off from the lively
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:104216:142"/>
use of known Truth, keeps us low in the Knowledge
of God and Communion with him.</p>
                  <p>2. So then upon that Knowledge of God's, Will where
it is Spiritual and from himself, follows the suiting of
the Heart with it, the affections taking the stamp of it,
and agreeing with it, receiving the Truth in the love
of it, the Heart transformed into it, and now not dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to obedience violently, but sweetly moving to it,
by love within the Heart framed to the love of God, and
so of his Will.</p>
                  <p>3. As Divine Knowledge begets this affection, so
this affection will bring forth action, real obedience.
For these three are inseparably linkt and dependant on
the product of another in this way, the affection is not
blind but flowing from knowledge, nor actual obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
constrained, but flowing from affection; and
the affection is not idle, seeing it brings forth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
nor the knowledge dead, seeing it begets af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>Thus the renewed, the living Christian is all for God,
a sacrifice entirely offer'd up to God, and a living sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
lives to God. Takes no more notice of his own
carnal will, hath renounc't that to embrace the holy
will of God, and therefore, though there is a contrary
Law and will in him, yet he does not acknowledge
it, but only the Law of Christ as now establisht in
him, that Law of Love, by which he is sweetly and
willingly led. Real Obedience consults not now in his
ways with Flesh and Blood what will please them, but
only enquires what will please his God, and knowing
his mind, thus resolves to demur no more, nor to ask
consent of any other, that he will do, and its reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to him, my Lord will's it, therefore in his
strength I will do it, for now I live to his will; it is
my Life to study and obey it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:104216:142"/>
Now we know what is the true Character of the
redeemed of Christ, that they are freed from the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of themselves and of the World, yea dead
to it, and have no Life but for God, as all his.</p>
                  <p>Let this then be our study and ambition to attain
this, and to grow in it, to be daily further freed from
all other ways, and desires, and more wholly addicted
to the will of our God, displeased when we find
any thing else stir or move within us, but that, that
he Spring of our Motion in every work.</p>
                  <p>1. Because we know his Soveraign Will, and most
justly so, is the Glory of his Name, therefore not to
rest till this be set up in our view as our end in all, and
to count all our plausible doings as hateful (as indeed
they are) that are not aimed at this end, yea endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to have it as much frequent and express
before us as we can attain, still our eye on the
mark, throwing away, yea undoing our own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
not seeking our selves in any thing but him in all.</p>
                  <p>2. As living to his will in the end of all; so in all
the way to every step of it. For we cannot attain his
end but in his way, nor can we intend it without a
resignation of the way to his prescript, taking all our
directions from him, how we shall honour him in all.
The Soul that lives to him hath enough not only to
make any thing warrantable but amiable, to seek his
will, and not only does it, but delights to do it, that's to
live to him, to find it our life; as we speak of a work
wherein Men do most, and with most deligh employ
themselves. In that such a lust be Crucified, is it thy
will Lord? then no more advising, no more delay,
how dear soever that was when I lived to it, it is now
as hateful: seeing I live to thee, who it thou hatest.
Wilt thou have me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>orget an injury though a great one,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:104216:143"/>
and love the person that hath wronged me? While I
lived to my self and my passions this had been hard. But
now how sweet is it, seeing I live to thee, and am glad to be
put upon things most opposite to my corrupt heart, glad
to trample upon my own will, to follow thine; and this I
daily aspire to and aim at, to have no will of my own, but
that thine be in me, that I may live to thee, as one
with thee, and thou my rule and delight. Yea not to
use the very natural comforts of my Life but for thee,
to eat, and drink, and sleep for thee, and not to please
my self but to be enabled to serve and please thee, to
make one offering of my self and all my actions to thee
my Lord.</p>
                  <p>Oh! its the only sweet life to be living thus, and daily
learning to live more fully thus, it is Heaven this, a
little scantling of it here, and a pledge of whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
this is indeed the life of Christ, not only like
his, but one with his; it is his Spirit, his Life derived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Soul. And therefore both the most excellent
and certainly most permanent, for he dieth no more,
and therefore this his Life cannot be extinguisht, hence
is the perseverance of the Saints: Because being
one Life with Christ, alive unto God, one for all
for ever.</p>
                  <p>True the former custome of sin would plead old pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
with grace, and this the Apostle implies here
that because formerly we lived to our Lusts, they will
urge that, but he teaches us to beat it directly back
on them, and turn the edge of it as most strong reason
against them, true you had so long time of us, the
more is our sorrow and shame, and the more reason that
it be no longer so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The rest of this time in the flesh,</hi>] That is, in this body,
not to be spent as the foregoing, <hi>in living to the flesh</hi>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:104216:143"/>
that is the corrupt Lusts of it, and the common ways
of the World: But as often as he looks back on that to
find it as a spur in his side, to be the more earnest and
more wholly busied in living much to God, having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so long contrary to him, in living to the flesh,
<hi>the past may suffice.</hi> there is a <hi>Lyptote</hi> in that, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much more than he expresses: it's enough,
Oh! too much to have lived so long so miserable a
Life.</p>
                  <p>Now says the Christian, Oh! corrupt Lusts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
World! look for no more, I have served you
too long, the rest whatsoever it is, must be to my
Lord, to live to him by whom I live: and ashamed and
grieved I am, I was so long in beginning; so much past,
it may be the most of my short race past before I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of God or looked towards him. Oh! how have I lost,
and worse than lost all my by past Days? Now had I
the advantages and abilities of many Men, and were I
to live many Ages, all should be to live to my God,
and honour him; and what strength I have, and what
time I shall have, through his grace, shall be wholly
his. And when any Christian hath thus resolved, that
his intended Life being so imperfect, and the time so
short, the poorness of the offer would break his heart;
were there not an Eternity before him, wherein he
shall live to his God and in him without blemish and
without end.</p>
                  <p>Spiritual things once being discerned by a spiritual
light, the whole Soul is carried after tem, and the
ways of holiness are never truly sweet, till they be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
embrac't, and a full renouncement of all that
is contrary to them.</p>
                  <p>All their former ways of wandring from God, are
very hateful to a Christian, that is indee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

A sight of Christ gains the Heart, makes it break from
all intanglements of its own lusts, and of the prophane
World about it. And these are the two things the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
here aims at, exhorting Christians to the study
of newness of life, and shewing the necessity of it.
That they cannot be Christians without it; he opposes
their new estate and engagement to the old customs of
their former condition, and to the continuing custom
and conceit of the ungodly World, that against both
they maintain that rank and dignity to which now
they are called, and in a holy disdain of both, walk
as the redeemed of the Lord. Their own former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
he speaks to, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. and to the custom and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the World, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and both these will set strong
upon a Man, especially while he is yet weak and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entered into that new estate.</p>
                  <p>1. His old acquaintance, his wonted lusts will not
sail to bestir themselves to accuse him in their most
obliging familiar way, and represent their long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
friendship; but the Christian following the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of his new being, will not entertain any long
discourse with them, but cut them short, tell them
that the change he hath made, he avows and finds, it
so happy, that these former delights may put off hopes
of regaining him. No, though they dress themselves
in their best array, and put on all their Ornaments, and
say as that known word of that Cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>isan, <hi>I am the same
I was,</hi> The Christian will answer as he did, <hi>I am not the
same I was.</hi> And not only thus will he turn off the
Plea of former acquaintance that sin makes, but turn
it back upon it, as in his present thoughts making much
against it; the longer I was so deluded, the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:104216:144"/>
now that I be wiser, the more time so mispent;
the more pressing necessity of redeeming it. Oh! I
have too long lived in that vile slavery, all was but
husks I fed on; <hi>I was laying out my money for that which
was no bread, and my labour for that which satisfied not.</hi>
Now I am on the pursuit of a good that I am sure
will satisfie, will fill t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>e largest desires of my Soul, and
shall I be sparing and slack, or shall any thing call
me off from it. Let it not be, I that took so much
pains early and late to serve and sacrifice to so base a

                     </gap>d; shall I not now live more to my new Lord, the
living God, and sacrifice my time and strength, and my
whole self to him?</p>
                  <p>And this is still the regret of the sensible Christian,
that he cannot attain to that unwearied diligence, and
that strong bent of affection in seeking communion
with God, and living to him, that sometimes he had
for the service of sin, wonders that it should be thus
with him, not to equal, that which it were, so reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that he should so far exceed.</p>
                  <p>It is beyond expression, a thing to be lamented, that
so small a number of Men regard God the Author of
their Being, and live not to him in whom they live;
returning that being and life they have, and all their
enjoyments as is due to him, from whom they all
flow; and then how pittiful is it, that the small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that is thus minded, minds it so remisly and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and is so far outstript by the Children of this
World, that they follow painted follies and lies with
more eagerness and industry, than the Children of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
do that certain and solid blessedness that they seek
after.<note place="margin">Plus illi ad vanita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem quam nos ad ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem.</note> Strange that men should do so much violence
one to another, and to themselves in body and mind
for trifles and chaff: and so little to be found of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:104216:145"/>
that allowed and commanded violence for a Kingdom,
and such a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, a word too
high for all the Monarchies on this side of the Sun.</p>
                  <p>And should not our diligence and violence in this so
worthy a design be so much the greater, the later we
begin to it. They tell it of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that when he
past into <hi>Spain,</hi> meeting there with <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Statue
it occasioned that he wept, considering that he was up
so much more early, having performed so many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
in those years, wherein he thought he had done
nothing, and was but yet a beginning. Truly it will
be a sad thought to a really renewed mind to look back
on the flower of youth and strength as lost in vanity,
if not in gross prophaneness, yet in self-serving and
self-pleasing, and in ignorance and neglect of God.
And perceiving their short day so far spent ere they set
out, will account years precious, and make the more

the way of God's commandments;</hi> will study to live much
in a little time; having lived all the past time to no
purpose, none now to spare upon the lusts and ways
of the flesh, and vain societies and visits; yea, will be
rescuing all they can from their very necessary Affairs,
for that which is more necessary than all other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
that one thing needful, to learn the Will of our
God, and live to it; this is our Business, our
high Calling, the main and excellent of all our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
                  <p>Not that we are to cast off our particular Callings,
our due diligence in them: for that will prove a
snare, and involve a Person in things more opposite to
godliness. But certainly this living to God requires,
1. A fit measuring of thy own ability for affairs, and
as far as thou canst chuse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>itting thy load to thy shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:104216:145"/>
not surcharging thy self with it; overburden of
businesses either by the greatness or multitude of them,
will not fail to entangle thee and depress thy
mind, and will hold it so down that thou shalt not find it
possible to walk upright and look upwards with that
freedom and frequency that becomes Heirs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>2. The measure of thy affairs being adapted, look
to thy affection in them, that it be regulated too;
thy heart may be engaged in thy little business as
much, if thou watch it not, a Man may drown in a
little brook or pool as well as in a great river, if he be
down and plunge himself into it, and put his head un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water. Some care thou must have<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> that thou maist
not care, these things that are thorns indeed, thou must
make a hedge of them, to keep out those tentations
that accompany floth, and extream want that waits
on it: but let them be the hedge; suffer them not to
grow within the Garden: though they increase set
not thy heart on them, nor them in thy heart. That
place is due to another; is made to be the Garden of thy
beloved Lord, made for the best plants and flowers:
and there they ought to grow; The love of God, and
Faith, and Meekness, and the other fragrant Graces
of the Spirit: and know that this is no common nor
easie matter to keep the heart disingaged in the midst of
affairs, that still it be reserved for him whose right it
is.</p>
                  <p>3. Not only labour to keep thy mind Spiritual in it
self, but by it, put a spiritual stamp even upon thy
temporal employments: And so thou shalt live to God
not only without prejudice of thy Calling, but even in it,
and shall converse with him in thy Shop, or in the
Field, or in thy Journey, doing all in obedience to him
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:104216:146"/>
and offering all, and thy self withal as a sacrifice to
him: thou st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ll with him, and he still with thee in all.
This is to live to the will of God indeed, to follow his
direction, and intend his glory in all: thus the wife in
the very exercise of her house, and the husband in his
aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>irs abroad, may be living to God: raising their
low employments to a high quality this way, Lord,
even this mean work I do for thee, complying with
thy will who hast put me in this Station, and given
me this task: thy will be done. Lord I offer up even
this work to thee, accept of me and of my desire to
obey thee: in all, and as in their work, so in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments,
and rest, all for him, <hi>whether you eat or drink</hi>
doing all for this reason, because it is his will and for
this end, that he may have glory, bending the use of all
our strength and all his mercies that way, setting this
mark on all our designs and ways, this for the glory
of my God, and this further for his glory, so from one
thing to another throughout our life. This is the art
of keeping the heart spiritual in all affairs, yea of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualizing
the affairs themselves in their use, that in
themselves are earthly. This the <hi>Elixir</hi> that turns
lower mettal into gold, the mean actions of this life in
a Christians hands into obedience and holy offering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God.</p>
                  <p>And were we acquainted with the way of intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
holy thoughts, ejaculatory eyings of God, in our
ordinary ways, it would keep the heart in a sweet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
all the day long, and have an excellent influence
into all our ordinary actions and holy performances,
at those times when we apply our selves solemnly to
them; our hearts would be near them, not so far off
to seek, and call in, as usually they are through
the neglect of this. This were to walk with God
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:104216:146"/>
indeed, to go all the day long as in our Fathers hand,
whereas without this our praying morning and evening
looks but as a formal visit, not delighting in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
converse which yet is our happiness, and honour,
and makes all estates sweet. This would refresh us in
the hardest Labour, as they that carry the spices from
<hi>Arabia</hi> are refresht with the smell of them in their
Journey, and some observe, that it keeps their strength
and frees them from fainting.</p>
                  <p>If you would then live to God indeed, be not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
without the constant regard of him, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hath attained most of it, study it yet more to
set the Lord always before you, as <hi>David</hi> professeth
and then shall you have that comfort that he adds;
<hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>e shall be still at your right hand that you shall not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And you that are yet to begin to this, think what
his patience is, that after you have fitten so many calls,
you may yet begin to seek him, and live to him;
and then consider if you still despise all this goodness,
how soon it may be otherwise, you may be past the
reach of this Call, and may not begin, but be cut off
for ever from the hopes of it. Oh, how sad an Estate!
and the more, by the remembrance of these flighted
offers and invitations? will you then yet return,
you that would share in Christ? let go these lusts to
which you have hitherto lived, and embrace him, and
in him there is Spirit and Life for you, he shall enable
you to live this heavenly life to the will of God, <hi>his
God, and your God, and his Father,</hi> and <hi>your Father</hi>
Oh! delay no longer this happy change, how soon may
that puff of breath that is in thy Nostrils, that hearest
this, be extinguisht? and art thou willing to dye in thy
sins, rather than that they dye before thee, thinkest
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:104216:147"/>
thou it a pain to live to the will of God? sure it will
be more pain to lie under his eternal wrath. Oh!
thou knowest not how sweet they find it, that have
tryed it; or thinkest thou I will afterwards? who
can make thee sure either of that afterwards, or of that

without further advisement, hast thou not served sin
long enough, may not the time past in that service serve,
is it not too much? wouldest thou only live unto God,
as little time as may be, and think the dregs of thy life
good enough for him? what ingratitude and gross
folly is this; yea though thou wert sure of coming in
to him, and being accepted, yet if thou knowest him
in any measure, thou wouldest not think it a priviledge
to defer it, but willingly chuse to be free from the
World and thy Lusts to be forthwithal his, and
wouldest with <hi>David, make hast and not delay to keep
his righteous Iudgments:</hi> all the time thou livest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, what a filthy wretched life is it, if life it can
be called that is without him: to live to sin is to live
still in a dungeon, but to live to the will of God, is
to walk in liberty and light, to walk by light unto
light, by the beginnings of it to the fullness of it, that

a King, that will least endure any other controulment.</p>
                  <p>Now as the ungodly World naturally moves to
this profusion, with a strong and swift motion
runs to it, so it runs together to it, and
that makes the current both the stronger and swif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

Channel make a mighty stream; and every man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally

Brook, that of it self is carried to that stream of sin
that is in the World, and then falling into it, is carried
rapidly along with it. And if every sinner, taken a
part, be so inconvertible by all created Power, how
much more harder a task is a publick Reformation, and
turning a Land from its course of wickedness; all that
is set to dam up their way, doth at the best but stay
them a little, and they swell, and rise, and run over
with a noise more violently than if they had not been
stopt; thus we find outward restraints prove, and the
very publick Judgements of God on us may have made
a little interruption, but upon the abatement of them,
the course of sin in all kinds seems to be now more
fierce, as it were to regain the time lost in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
forbearance: so that we see the need of much
prayer to intreat his powerful hand, that can turn the
course of <hi>Iordan,</hi> that he would work not a temporary,
but an abiding change of the course of this Land, and
cause many Souls to look upon Jesus Christ, and flow into

to all the World's examples, the Saints were so, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.
and <hi>chap.</hi> 12. but he more than they all. But further,
<hi>he is the Author and Finisher of our Faith,</hi> and so we eye
him as <hi>having endured the cross, and despised the shame,
and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God.</hi>
Not only that in doing so, we may follow him in that
way, unto that end as our pattern, but as head from
whom we borrow our strength to follow so, <hi>the Author
and Finisher of our Faith.</hi> And so 1 Joh. 5. <hi>This is our
victory whereby we overcome the World, even our
Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spirit of God shews the Believer clearly both
the baseness of the ways of sin, and the wretched
measure of their end. That Divine Light discovers the
fading and false blush of the pleasures of sin, that there
is nothing under them but true deformity and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which the deluded gross World does not see, but
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:104216:149"/>
takes the first appearance of it for true and solid beauty,
and is so enamoured with a painted strumpet. And
as he sees the vileness of that love of sin, he sees the
final unhappiness of it, that <hi>her ways lead down to the
Chambers of Death.</hi> Methinks a Believer is as one
standing upon a high Tower, that sees the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the World runs in a Valley, in an unavoidable Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice,
a steep edge hanging over the bottomless pit where
all that are not reclaimed fall over before they be aware;
this they in their low way perceive not, and therefore
walk and run on in the smooth pleasures, and ease
of it towards their perdition: but he that sees the end
will not run with them.</p>
                  <p>And as he hath by that light of the Spirit this clear
reason of thinking on and taking another course; so
by that Spirit he hath a very natural bent to a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
motion, that he cannot be one with them; that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
moves him upwards whence it came, and makes
that, in so far as he is renewed, his natural motion;
though he hath a clog of flesh that cleaves to him, and
so breeds him some difficulty, yet in the strength of
that new Nature he overcomes it and goes on, till he
attain his end, where all the difficulty in the way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
is over rewarded and forgotten; that makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for every weary step; that every one of these
that walk in that way, does appear in <hi>Zion</hi> before God.</p>
                  <p>The Christian and the carnal Men are each most
wonderful to another. The one wonders to see the

they hear not, nor understand not this Language, or

go, and with such ease, and some of them with their
Train, and Horses, and Coaches, and all their Pomp:
and he and a few straggling poor Creatures like him

knowing or not believing that at the top of that Hill
he climbs is that happy glorious City, <hi>the new Ierusalem,</hi>

                  <p>We have first here, the preaching of the Gospel,
or suitable means to a certain end. 2. The express Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that end.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>For this Cause</hi>] There is a particular end, and
that very important, which the preaching of the Gospel
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:104216:152"/>
is aimed at; this end many consider not, hearing it, as
if it were to no end, not propounding a fixed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
end in our hearing. This therefore is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
by those that preach this Gospel, that they aim
right in it at this end and no other, no self end: The
legal Priests not to be squint eyed, nor evangelical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
thus squinting to base gain, vain applause; and
also that they make it their study to find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
this work, <hi>this living to God;</hi> otherwise they
cannot skillfully nor faithfully apply their gifts to this
effect on their hearers, and therefore acquaintance with
God most necessary.</p>
                  <p>How sounds it to many of us at the least, but as a
well couched story, whose use is to amuse us, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
delight us a little, and there is an end, and indeed
no end, and turns the most serious and most glorious
of all Messages unto an empty sound; and if we
awake and give it hearing it is much, but for any
thing further, how few deeply before hand consider,
I have a dead heart, therefore will I go unto the
word of Life, that it may be quickened; it is frozen,
I will go and lay it before the warm Beams of that
Sun that shines in the Gospel; my corruptions mighty
and strong, and grace (if any) exceeding weak, there
is in the Gospel a power to weaken and to kill sin, and
to strengthen grace, and this being the intent of my
wise God in appointing it, it shall be my desire and
purpose in resorting to it, to find it to me according
to his gracious intendment, to have faith in my Christ,
the Fountain of my Life, more enabled, and more
active in drawing from him; to have my heart more
refined and spiritualized, and to have the Sluse of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
opened, and my Affections to Divine things
enlarged, more hatred of sin, and more love of God,
and communion with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:104216:152"/>
Ask your selves concerning former times, and to
take your selves even now, enquire within, why came
I hither this day? what had I in mine eye and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
this morning ere I came forth, and in my way as
I was coming? did I seriously propound an end or no,
and what was my end? Nor doth the meer custome of
mentioning this in prayer satisfie the question; for this,
as other such things usually do in our hand, may turn to a
lifeless form and have no heat of spiritual affection;
none of <hi>David</hi>'s panting and breathing after God in his
ordinances: such desires as will not be still'd without
a measure of attainment, as the Childs desire of the
breast; as our Apostle resembles it, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>And then again, being returned home, reflect on your
hearts, much hath been heard, but is there any thing done
by it, have I gained my point? it was not to pass a little
time simply that I went, or to pass it with delight in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
rejoycing in that light as they did in S. <hi>Iohn Baptists,</hi>
for a season [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>] as long as the hour lasts, it was not
to have my earpleased, but my heart changed, not to learn
some new notions, and carry them cold in my head, but to
be quickened and purified and renewed in the Spirit of
my mind? is this done? think I now more esteemingly of
Christ, and the life of faith, and the happiness of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?
and are such thoughts solid and abiding with me?
what sin have I left behind? what Grace of the Spirit
have I brought home? or what new degree or at least
new desire of it, a living desire that will follow its
point? Oh! this were good repetition.</p>
                  <p>A strange folly of multitudes of us to set our selves
no mark, to propound no end in the hearing of the
Gospel. The Merchant sails not only that he may
sail, but for traffick, and trafficks that he may be rich.
The Husband Man plows not only to keep himself bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:104216:153"/>
with no further end, but plows that he may sow, and
sows that he may reap with advantage, and shall we do
the most excellent and fruitful work fruitlesly, hear
only to hear, and look no further. This is indeed a
a great vanity, and a great misery, to lose that labour,
and gain nothing by it, which duly used would be of
all others most advantageous and gainful, and yet all
meetings are full of this.</p>
                  <p>Now when you come, this is not simply to hear
a discourse and relish or dislike it in hearing: But a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of life and death, of eternal death and eternal life,
and the spiritual life, begot and nourisht by the word,
is the beginning of that eternal life. Follows,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To them that are dead.</hi>] By which, I conceive, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
such as had heard and believed the Gospel, when
it came to them, and now were dead. And this, I think,
he doth to strengthen these brethren to whom he
writes, to commend the Gospel to this intent, and not
to think the condition and end of it hard. As our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
mollifies the matter of outward sufferings thus,
<hi>so persecuted they the Prophets that were before you.</hi> And
the Apostle afterwards in this Chapter uses the same
reason in that same subject: so here, that they might
not judge the point of mortification he presses, so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
as naturally Men will do, he tells, them it is the
constant end of the Gospel, and they that have been sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by it, went that same way he points out to them.
They that are dead before you, died this way that I
press on you, before they died, and the Gospel was
preached to them for that very end.</p>
                  <p>Men pass away and others succeed, but the Gospel
is still the same, hath the same tenour, and substance,
and the same ends. As <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of the Heaven's,
and Earth, that remain the same while one Generation
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:104216:153"/>
passes and another cometh; the Gospel surpasses both
in its stability, as our Saviour testifies, <hi>they shall pass away
but not one Iot of this Word.</hi> And indeed they wear and
wax old, as the Apostle teaches us; but the Gospel is from
one Age to another of most unalterable integrity, hath still
the same vigour and powerful influence, as at the first.</p>
                  <p>They that formerly received the Gospel, it was upon
these terms; therefore think them not hard: and they
are now dead, all the difficulty of that work of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to sin is now over with them; if they had not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their sins by the Gospel, they had died in them,
after a while, and so died eternally; it is therefore a
wise prevention, to have sin judged and put to death in
us before we die, if we die in them and with them,
we and our sin perish together, if we will not
part, but if it die first before us then we live for ever.</p>
                  <p>And what think you, of thy carnal will and all
the delights of sin? What is the longest term of its life?
uncertain it is, but most certainly very short: thou
and these pleasures must be severed and parted within a
little time, however thou must dye and then they
dye, and you never meet again. Now were it not
the wisest course to part a little sooner with them,
and let them dye before thee, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
inherit eternal life and eternal delights in it, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for evermore. Its the only bargain and let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
it no longer.</p>
                  <p>This is our season of enjoying the sweetness of the
Gospel, others heard it before us in our rooms that
now we fill, and now they are removed, and remove
we must shortly, and leave this same room to others, to
speak and hear in. It is high time we were considering
what we do here, to what end we speak and hear, and
to lay hold on that Salvation that is held forth unto us;
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:104216:154"/>
and that we lay hold on it, let go our hold of sin, and
those perishing things that we hold so firm and cleave
so fast to, do they that are dead who heard and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Gospel now repent their repentance, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
the flesh, or do they not think ten thousand
times more pains, were it for many Ages, all to little
for a moment of that which now they enjoy and shall
enjoy to eternity. And they that are dead who heard
the Gospel and slighted it, if such a thing might be,
what would they give for one of these opportunities
that now we daily have, and daily lose, and have no
fruit nor esteem of them. You have lately seen many
of you, and you that shifted the sight, have heard
of numbers cut off in a little time, whole families
swept away by the late stroke of God's hand;
many of which did think no other but that they
might have still been with you here in this place, and
exercise at this time and many years after this; and yet
who hath laid to heart the lengthning out of their day,
and considered it more as an opportunity of that higher
and happier life, than as a little protracting of this wretched
life which is hastening to an end. Oh! <hi>therefore be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to day, while it is day, not to harden your hearts:</hi> though
the Pestilence doth not now affright you so, yet that stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mortality, and the decay of these earthen lodges,
tells us that shortly we shall cease to preach and hear
this Gospel. Did we consider, it would excite us to
more earnest search after our evidences of that eternal
life that is set before us in the Gospel, and we would
seek it in the characters of that spiritual life, which is
the beginning of it within us, and is wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ght by the
Gospel in all the heirs of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Think therefore wisely of these things. (1.) What's the
proper end of the Gospel. (2.) Of the approaching end
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:104216:154"/>
of thy days, and let thy certainty of this drive thee
to seek more certainty of the other, that thou maist
partake of it, and then this again will make the
thoughts of the other sweet to thee; that visage of
death, that is so terrible to unchanged sinners, shall be
amiable to thine eye, having found a Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
as happy and lasting as this is miserable and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
and seeing the perfection of that life on
the other side of death, will long for the passage.</p>
                  <p>Be more serious in this matter of daily hearing the
Gospel, why it is sent to thee, and what it brings, and
think, it is too long I have flighted its Message, and
many that have done so, are cut off, and shall hear it
no more, I have it once more inviting me, and it may be
this may be the last to me, and in these thoughts ere you
come, bow your knee to the Father of Spirits, that
this one thing may be granted you, that your Souls may
find at length the lively and mighty power of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
upon yours, in the hearing of this Gospel, that
<hi>you may be judged according to men in the flesh, but live
according to God in the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is the particular nature of that end exprest and
without the noise of various senses, intends, I conceive, no
other, but the dying to the World and sin, and living
unto God, which is the Apostle's main subject, and
scope in the foregoing Discourse, that death was before
called a suffering in the flesh, which is in effect the
same: and therefore though the words may be drawn
another way, yet its strange that Interpreters have
been so far wide of this their genuine and agreeable
sense, and almost all of them taken in some other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be judged in the flesh</hi>] In the present sense is to die
to sin, or that sin die in us, and its thus exprest. 1. Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:104216:155"/>
tably to the nature of it, it is to the flesh, a violent
death, and it is according to a Sentence judicially put
against it, that guilty and miserable life of sin is in the
Gospel adjudged to death, there that arrest and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is clear and full, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6, &amp;c. 8. 13. That sin
must die, that the Soul may live, it must be crucified
in us, and we to it, that we may partake of the Life
of Christ and Happiness in him. And this is called
to be judged in the flesh, to have this sentence executed,
2. The thing is the rather spoke here under the term
of being judged, in counter-ballance of that Judgment
mentioned immediately before, <hi>v.</hi> 5. The last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of quick and dead, wherein they that would not be
thus judged, but mockt and despised those that were,
shall fall under a far more terrible Judgment, and the
sentence of a heavy death, indeed everlasting death:
though they think they shall escape and enjoy liberty
in living in sin. And that, <hi>to be judged according to men;</hi>
is, I conceive, added, to signifie the connaturalness of
the life of sin to man's now corrupt nature. That men
do judge it a death indeed to be severed and pulled from
their sins, and that a cruel death; and the Sentence of
it in the Gospel a heavy Sentence, a hard Saying to a
carnal Heart, that he must give up with all his sinful
delights, must die indeed in self-denial, must be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from himself, which is to die, if he will be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Christ, and live in him. Thus men judge that
they are judged to a painful death by the Sentence of
the Gospel, although it is, that they may truely and
happily live, yet they understand it not so. They see
the death, the parting with sin, and all its pleasures:
but the life they see not, nor can any know it till par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of it; it is known to him in whom it is, it <hi>is hid
with Christ in God:</hi> And therefore the opposition here
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:104216:155"/>
is very fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ly thus represented, that the death is <hi>according
to men in the flesh;</hi> but the life is <hi>according to God in
the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Christian is adjudged to this death in the flesh by
the Gospel, so he is lookt on and accounted by carnal men
as dead: for that he enjoyes not with them what they
esteem their life, and think they could not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, one that cannot carrouse and swear with prophane
Men, is a silly dead Creature, good for nothing; and
he that can bear wrongs, and love him that injured him,
is a poor spiritless fool, hath no mettal nor life in him
in the World's account, thus is he <hi>judged according to
men in the flesh,</hi> he is as a dead man, <hi>but lives according
to God in the Spirit,</hi> dead to men and alive to God, as
<hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Now if this life be in thee, it will act: all life is in
motion, and is called an act; but most of all active is
this most excellent, and, as I may call it, most lively
life, it will be moving towards God; often seeking
to him, making still towards him as its principle and
fountain, holy and affectionate thoughts of him: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
on one of his sweet attributes, sometimes on
another, as the <hi>Bee</hi> amongst the Flowers. And
as it will thus act within, so outwardly laying hold on
all occasions: yea, seeking out ways and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be serviceable to thy Lord, employing all for
him, commending and extolling his goodness, doing
and suffering chearfully for him, laying out the strength
of desires, and parts, and means in thy station to gain
him Glory. If thou be alone, then not alone, but with
him; seeking to know more of him, and be made more
like him; if in company, then casting about how to
bring his name in esteem, and to draw others to a love
of Religion and Holiness by Speeches as it may be

                     </gap>it, and most by the true behaviour of thy carriage.
Tender over the Souls of others to do them good to
thy utmost, thinking each day an hour lost when thou
art not busie for the honour and advantage of him to
whom thou now livest: thinking in the Morning, now
what may I do this day for my God? How may I
most please and glorifie him, and use my strength and
wit, and my whole self as not mine but his? and then
in the evening, reflecting, O Lord, have I seconded
these thoughts in reality? what glory hath he had by
me this day? whither went my thoughts and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours?
what busied them most? have I been much
with God? have I adorned the Gospel in my converse
with others? And if finding any thing done this way,
to bless and acknowledge him the spring and worker of
it. If any step aside, were it but to an appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
or if any fit season of good hath escapt thee unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably,
to check thy self, and to be grieved for thy
sloth and coldness, and see if more love would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
more diligence.</p>
                  <p>Try it by sympathy and antipathy, which follows
the nature of things, as we see in some Plants and
Creatures that cannot grow, cannot agree together,
and others that do favour and benefit mutually. If thy
Soul hath an aversion and reluctancy against holiness,
this is an evidence of this new Nature and Life. Thy
heart rises against wicked ways and speeches, oaths and
cursings, and rotten communication; yea, thou canst
not endure unworthy discourses wherein most spend
their time, findest no relish in the unsavory societies
of such as know not God, canst not sit with vain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
but findest a delight in those that have the
image of God upon them, such as partake of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Life, and carry the evidences of it in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:104216:156"/>
                     <hi>David</hi> did not disdain the fellowship of the Saints,
and that was no disparagement to him, he implies in the
name he gives them, <hi>Psal. 16. The excellent ones,</hi> the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
or Noble; and that word is taken from one that signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a robe or noble Garment, so he thought them Nobles
and Kings as well as he, and had robes royal, and therefore
Companions of Kings. A spiritual eye looks on spiritual
dignity, and esteems and loves them that are born of God,
how low soever be their natural birth and breeding. The
Sons of God have of his Spirit in them, and are born to
the same inheritance where all shall have enough; and
they are tending homewards by the conduct of the same
Spirit that is in them, so that there must be amongst
them a real complacency and delight in one another.</p>
                  <p>And then consider the temper of thy heart towards
spiritual things, the Word and ordinances of God, if thou
dost esteem highly of them and delight in them; that
there is a compliance of thy heart with Divine Truths;
somthing in thee that suits and sides with them against thy
corruptions. That in thy affliction thou seekest not to the
puddles of earthly comforts, but hast thy recourse to
the sweee Christal Streams of the Divine Promises, and
findest refreshment in them. It may be at sometimes
in a spiritual distemper, holy exercises and ordinances
will not have that present sensible sweetness to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that he desires, and some will for a long time lie
under dryness and deadness this way, yet there is
here an evidence of this spiritual life, that thou stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
by thy Lord and reliest on him; and will not leave
these holy means how sapless soever to thy sense for the
present: thou findest for a long time little sweetness
in prayer, yet thou prayest still; and when thou canst
say nothing yet offerest to it, and lookest towards
Christ thy life; thou doest not turn away from these
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:104216:157"/>
things to seek consolation else where, knowest life
is in Christ, and will stay till he refresh thee with new
and lively influence, its not any where but in him.
As St. <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>Lord whether should we go, thou hast
the words of eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider thy self, if thou hast any knowledge of
the growth or deficiences of this spiritual life, for it is
here but begun and breaths in an air contrary to it, and
lodges in an house that often smoaks and darknes it.
Canst thou go on in formal performances from one
year to another, and no advancement in the inwards
of Grace, and restest content with that? it is no good
sign. But art thou either gaining victories over sin,
and further strength of faith, and love, and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or at least art earnest seeking these, and bewailing
thy wants, and disappointments of this kind, then thou
livest. At the worst wouldest thou rather grow this way,
be further off from sin and nearer God, than grow in thy
estate or credit or honours? esteemest thou more of grace
than of the whole World? There is life at the root; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thou findest not that flourishing thou desirest,
yet the desire of it is life in thee: and if growing this
way, art thou content, whatsoever is thy outward estate?
Canst thou solace thy self in the love and goodness
of thy God, though the World frowns on thee? art
thou not able to take comfort in the smiles of the
World when his face is hid? this tells thee thou livest,
and he is thy life.</p>
                  <p>Although many Christians have not so much sensible
joy, yet they account spiritual joy and the light of God's
countenance the only true joy, and all other without it
madness, and they cry, and sigh, and attend for it;
mean while not only duty, and hopes of better, but
even love to God, makes them to be so, to serve and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:104216:157"/>
please and glorifie him to their utmost. And this is
not a dead resting without God, but it is a stable
compliance with his will in the highest point, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him and living by faith, which is most accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him; in a word, whether in sensible comfort
or without it, still this is the fixed thought of a believing
Soul, its good for me to draw nigh to God, only good;
and will not live in a willing estrangedness from
him, what way soever he is pleased to deal with

                  <p>Now for the entertaining and strengthning this life,
which is the great business, and care of all that have
it, beware of omitting and interrupting these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
means, that do provide it and nourish it. Little
neglects of that kind will draw one greater, and great
neglects will make great abatements of vigour and
liveliness. Take heed of using holy things coldly, and
lazily without affection; that will make them fruitless
and our life will not be advantaged by them, unless
used in a lively way. Be active in all good within thy
reach, as this is a sign, so its a helper and friend to it.
A slothful unstirring life will make a sickly unhealthful
life. Motion purifies and sharpens the Spirits, and
makes Men robust and vigorous.</p>
                  <p>2. Beware of admitting a correspondence with any
sin, yea do not so much as discourse familiarly with it,
or look kindly toward it, for that will undoubtedly
cast a damp upon thy Spirit, and diminish thy Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at least, and will obstruct thy Communion with
God; thou knowest (that hast any knowledge of this
life) that thou canst not go to him with that sweet
freedom thou wert wont, after thou hast been but tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
or parlying with any of thy old loves. Oh! do
not make so foolish a bargain as to prejudge the least of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:104216:158"/>
thy spiritual comfort, for the greatest and longest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
enjoyments of sin, that are base, and but for
a season.</p>
                  <p>But wouldest thou grow upwards in this life? have
much recourse to Jesus Christ thy head, the spring from
whom flow the animal Spirits, that quicken thy Soul.
Wouldest thou know more of God? he it is that reveals
the Father, and reveals him as his Father, and in him
thy Father, and that's the sweet notion of God. Would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou overcome thy lusts further? our victory is in

                  <p>THE heart of a real Christian, is really taken off
from the World and set heavenwards: yet
there is still in this flesh, so much of the flesh hanging
to it, as will readily poise all downwards, unless it be
often wound up, and remembred of these things, that will
raise it still to further spiritualness. This the Apostle
doth in this Epistle, and particularly in these words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:104216:158"/>
In them three things to be considered. 1. A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
duty recomended. 2. Their mutual Relation,
that binds them to one another. 3. The reason here
used to bind them upon a Christian.</p>
                  <p>And of the three the last is evidently the chief, and
here so meant, the other being recommended as suiting
it, and subserving to it, <hi>prayer:</hi> Therefore I shall speak
first of it.</p>
                  <p>And truly, to speak, and to hear of it often, were
our hearts truly and entirely acquainted with it, would
have still new sweetness and usefulness in it. Oh! how
great were the advantage of that lively Knowledge of
it, beyond the exactest defining of it, and a discoursing
Knowledge, and of the heads of Doctrine that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
it.</p>
                  <p>Prayer is not a smooth expression, or a well-contrived
form of words, not the product of a ready memory,
nor rich invention, acting it self in the performance;
these may draw a neat picture of it, but still the life is
wanting. The motion of the Heart Godwards, holy
and divine affection, makes prayer real, and lively, and
acceptable to the Living God, to whom it is presented; the
pouring out of thy heart to him that made it, and
therefore hears it, and understands what it speaks, and
how its moved and affected in calling on him. It is not
the guilded Paper, and good writing of a Petition that
prevailes with a Man: but the moving Sense of it, and
to the King that discerns the heart, heart sense is the
sense of all, and that which he alone regards, listens what
that speaks, and takes all as nothing where that is silent,
all other excellence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> prayer, is but the outside and
fashion of it, that is the life of it.</p>
                  <p>Though Prayer precisely taken, is only petition;
yet in its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>uller and usual sense, it comprises the vent
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:104216:159"/>
of our humble sense of vileness and sin, in the sincere
confession, and the extolling withal, and praising the
holy name of our God; his excellency and goodness,
and thankful acknowledgment of received mercies.
Of these sweet ingredient perfumes is the incense of
prayer composed, and by the divine fire of love ascends
unto God; the Heart, and all with it: and when the
Hearts of the Saints unite in joynt prayer, the Pillar
of sweet smoke goes up the greater and fuller. Thus
says that Song of the Spouse, <hi>going up from the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as Pillars of smoak perfumed with Myrrh and Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incense,
and all the Powders of the Merchant:</hi> and as the
word there signifies, streight Pillars like the tallest
streightest kind of trees. Indeed the sincerity and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of prayer makes it go up as a streight Pillar, no
crookedness in it, tending streight towards Heaven, and
bowing to no side by the way. Oh! the single and
fixed viewing of God, as in other ways it is the thing
makes all holy and sweet, so particularly in this Divine
Work of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>It is true we have to deal with a God, who of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
needs not this our pains either to inform, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
him; he fully knows our thoughts before we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them, and our wants before we feel them, or
think of them. Nor doth his affection and gracious
bent to do his Children good, wax remiss, or admit
the least abate and forgetfulness of them.</p>
                  <p>But instead of necessity on God's part which cannot
be imagined, we shall find that Equity, and that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Dignity, and Utility of it on our part which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Equity,</hi> that thus the Creaturesignifie his homage to,
and dependance on his Creator, for his being, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being;
takes all the good he enjoys, or expects from that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:104216:159"/>
Sovereign Good, declaring himself unworthy, waiting
for all upon the terms of free goodness, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all from that Spring.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Dignity,</hi> Man was made for communion with
God his Maker, 'tis the Excellency of his Nature to be
capable of this end, the happiness of it to be raised to
enjoy it. Now in nothing more in this Life, is this
communion actually and highly enjoyed, than in the
exercise of prayer; that he may freely impart his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and estate, and wants to God as the faithfullest
and powerfullest Friend, the richest and lovingest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
may use the liberty of a Child, telling his Father
what he stands in need of, and desires; and communing,
with him with humble confidence, admitted to so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
presence with so great a King.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Vtility</hi> of it. 1. Easing the Soul in times of
strait, when it is prest with griefs and fears, giving the
vent, and that in so advantageous a way, emptying
them into the bosom of God. The very vent, were
it but into the Air, gives ease; or speak it to a Statue
rather than smother it, much more ease, poured forth
into the lap of a Confident, and sympathising Friend,
though unable to help; yet much more of one that
can, and of all Friends our God the surest, and most
affectionate, and most powerful, so, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 9. both
compassion and effectual salvation exprest; <hi>In all their
affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence
saved them in his love, and in his pity he redeemed them,
and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</hi>
And so resting on his Love, Power, and gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
quiets it self in God upon this assurance, that
its not vain to seek him, and that he despiseth not the
sighing of the poor.</p>
                  <p>2. The Soul is more spiritually affected with its own
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:104216:160"/>
condition by opening it up before the Lord, more
deeply sensible of sin; and ashamed in his sight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
it before him; more dilated and enlarged to
receive the mercies suited for; as the opening wide of
the mouth of the soul that it may be filled; more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to observe the Lord in answering, and to bless
him and trust on him upon the renewed experiences
of his regard to their distresses and desires.</p>
                  <p>3. All the Graces of the Spirit in Prayer are stirr'd
and acted, and by acting, strengthned and increased.
Faith in applying the Divine Promises, which are
the very Ground that the Soul goes upon to God, and
Hope looking out to their performance, and Love par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
expressing it self, in that sweet converse and
delighting in it, as love doth in the company of the Person
loved, thinks all hours too short in speaking with him:
Oh how the Soul is refresht with freedom of Speech with
its beloved Lord; and as it delights in that, so it is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
advanced and grows by each meeting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
beholding the excellency of God, and relishing the
pure and sublime pleasures that is in near communion
with him: looking upon the Father in the face of Christ,
and using him as a mediator in prayer, as still it must,
is drawn to further admiration of that bottomless love,
that found that way of agreement, that <hi>new and living
way</hi> of our access, when all was shut up, and we to have
been shut out for ever. And then the affectionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of that reflex love to find that vent in prayer,
do kindle higher, as it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ann'd and blown up, rise to
a greater, and higher, and purer flame, and so tend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the more strongly. <hi>David</hi> as he doth profess
his love to God in Prayer in his <hi>Psalms,</hi> so no doubt
it grew in the expressing. <hi>I will love thee, O Lord, my
strength, Psal</hi> 18. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. doth raise an incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:104216:160"/>
of love out of this very consideration of the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
of prayers; <hi>I love the Lord, because he hath
heard,</hi> and resolves thereafter upon persistence in that
course; <hi>therefore will I call upon him, as long as I live.</hi>
And as the Graces of the Spirit are advanced in prayer,
by their actings; so for this reason further, because
prayer sets the soul particularly near unto God in Jesus
Christ, 'tis then in his presence; and being much with
God in this way, it is powerfully assimilated to him
by converse with him; as we readily contract their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes
with whom we resort much, especially of such
as we singularly love and respect; thus the Soul is
moulded further to the likeness of God, is stampt with
fuller Characters of him, by being much with him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
liker God, more holy and spiritual, and brings
back a bright shining from the Mount, as <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly.</hi> And not only thus by a natural influence doth
prayer work this advantage, but even by a federal
efficacy; suiting, and upon suit obtaining supplies of
Grace, as the chief good, and besides all other needful
mercies, it is a real means of receiving, <hi>whatsoever you
shall ask, that will I do,</hi> says our Saviour. God having
establisht this intercourse, and engag'd his Truth and
Goodness in it, that if they call on him, they shall be
heard and answered. If they prepare the Heart to call,
he will incline his ear to hear; and our Saviour hath
assur'd us, that we may build upon his Goodness, and
the affection of a Father in him; that <hi>he will give good
things to them that ask,</hi> says one Evangelist, and <hi>the
holy Spirit to them that ask it,</hi> says another; as being
the good indeed, the highest of Gifts, and the sum of
all good Things, and that which his Children are most
earnest supplicants for. Prayer for Grace doth, as it
were, set the Mouth of the Soul to the Spring, draws
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:104216:161"/>
from Jesus Christ, and is replenisht out of his fullness,
thirsting after it, and drawing from it that way.</p>
                  <p>And for this reason is it, that our Saviour, and from
him, and according to his example, the Apostles recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Prayer so much. <hi>Watch and pray,</hi> says our Saviour,
and St. <hi>Paul, pray continually.</hi> And our Apostle here
particularly specifies this, as the grand means of attaining
that conformity with Christ, which he presses, this is
the high-way to it, <hi>be sober, and watch unto prayer.</hi> He
that is much in prayer, shall grow rich in grace; he
shall thrive and increase most, that is busiest in this,
which is our very traffick with Heaven, and fetches
the most precious commodities thence, he that sets of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenest
out these Ships of <hi>desire,</hi> makes the most Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
to that Land of Spices and Pearls, shall be sure to
improve his stock most, and have most of Heaven
upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>But the true art of this trading is very rare; every
trade hath something wherein the skill of them lies;
but this is deep and supernatural, is not reacht by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
industry; industry is to be used in it, but we
must know it comes from above, the faculty of it, that
Spirit of Prayer; without which Learning, and
Wit, and religious Breeding can do nothing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this to be our prayer often, our great suit for the
Spirit of Prayer, that we may speak the Language of
the Sons of God by the Spirit of God, which alone
teaches the Heart to pronounce aright those things, that
the Tongue of many Hypocrites can articulate well to
mans ear; and only the Children in that right strain,
that takes him, call God their Father, and cry unto
him as their Father; and therefore many a poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettered
Christian, so far outstrips your School-Rabbies
in this faculty, because it is not effectually taught in
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:104216:161"/>
these lower Academies; they must be in God's own
School, Children of his House, that speak this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
Men may give Spiritual Rules and Directions
in this, and such as may be useful, drawn from the
word, that furnishes us with all needful Precepts, but you
are still to bring these into the seat of this faculty of
prayer, the Heart, and stamp them upon it, and so to
teach it to pray, without which there is no prayer;
this is the prerogative Royal of him, that framed the
Heart of Man within him.</p>
                  <p>But for advancing in this, growing more skillful in
it, it is, with continual dependence on the Spirit, to be
much used; praying much thou shalt be blest with
much faculty for it, so then askest thou, what shall I
do that I may learn to pray? there be things here to be
considered, that are exprest as serving this end, but for
present this and chiefly this, by praying thou shalt
learn to pray, thou shalt both obtain more of the
Spirit, and find more the chearful working of it in
Prayer, when thou puttest it often to that work,
for which it is received, and wherein it is delighted; and
as both advantaging all Graces, and the Grace of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it self, this frequency and abounding in Prayer is
here very clearly intended, in that the Apostle makes
it as the main of our work that we have to do, and
would keep our hearts in a constant aptness for it;
<hi>be sober and watch;</hi> to what end? <hi>unto prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be sober and watch.</hi>] They that have no better, must
make the best they can of carnal delights: it is no
wonder they take as large a share of them as they can
bear, and sometimes more: But the Christian is called
to a more excellent estate, and higher pleasures; so
that he may behold men glutting themselves with these
base things, and be as little moved to share with them,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:104216:162"/>
as men are taken with the pleasure a Swine hath in
weltring in the Mire.</p>
                  <p>It becomes the Heirs of Heaven to be far above the
love of the Earth, and in the necessary use of any
thing in it, still to keep both within the due measure of
their use, and their heart wholly disingag'd from
the affection of them. This is the Sobriety here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted.</p>
                  <p>Its true, that in the commonest sense of the word, it is
very commendable, and it is sit to be so considered by
a Christian, that he flie gross intemperance, as a thing
most contrary to his condition, and holy calling, and
wholly inconsistent with the spiritual temper of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
mind, and those exercises to which it is called,
and its progress in its way homewards. It is a most
unseemly sight to behold one, simply by outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
a Christian, overtaken with surfeitting and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness,
much more, to be given to the vile custom of
it: all sensual delights, the filthy lust of uncleanness go
under the common name of Insobriety,<note place="margin">

and they all degrade and destroy the noble Soul; are
unworthy of Man, much more of a Christian, and the
contempt of them preserves the Soul, and elevates
it.</p>
                  <p>But the Sobriety here recommended, though it takes
in that too, yet reaches further than temperance in
meat and drink. It is the spiritual temperance of a
Christian mind in all earthly things; as our Saviour
joyns these together, Luk. 21. 34. <hi>surfeiting and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness,
and cares of this life:</hi> and under the cares are
all the excessive desires and delights of this life, which

carefullness.</p>
                  <p>Many that are sober men, and of temperate diet, yet
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:104216:162"/>
are spiritually intemperate, drunk with pride, or
covetousness, or passion, drunk with self-love, and
love of their pleasures and ease, with love of the
world, and the things of it, which cannot consist
with the love of God, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us: drunk with
the inordinate unlawful love even of their lawful cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and the lawful gain they pursue by it, their
hearts going after it, and so reeling to and fro, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fixed on God and heavenly Things; but either
hurried up and down with uncessant business, or if
sometimes at ease, it is, as the ease of a drunken
man, not compos'd to better and wiser thoughts, but
falling into a dead sleep, contrary to the watching here
joyned with sobriety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Watch.</hi>] There is a Christian Rule to be observed
in the very moderating of bodily sleep, and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
for the interest of Prayer; but Watching, as
Sobriety here, is chiefly the spiritual circumspectness
and vigilancy of the mind, in a wary walking posture,
that it be not surprized by the assaults or slights of
Satan, by the World, nor its nearest and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
enemy, the corruption that dwells within,
that being so near, doth most readily watch unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

for its own safety, and live in a military vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
continually, keeping constant watch and senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
and suffering nothing to pass that may carry
the least suspicion of danger; to be distrustful
and jealous of all the motions of his own Heart,
and the smilings of the World, and in relation to
these, it will be a wise course to take that word as a
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:104216:163"/>
good caveat, <hi>be watchful,</hi>

the Garment of some harmless pleasure, or some
lawful liberties, may be conveyed into thy Soul some
thief or traytor, that will either betray thee to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or at least pilser, and steal of the preciousest
things thou hast. Do we not by experience find, how
easily our foolish hearts are seduc'd and deceived, and so
apt to deceive themselves? and by things that seem to
have no evil in them, yet are drawn from the height
of affection to our highest good; and from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, and study to please him, which
should not be intermitted, for then it will abate, but
ought still be growing.</p>
                  <p>2. Now the Relation of these is clear, they are insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
link't together, each of them assistant and helpful to
the other in their nature, as they are here in the words,
<hi>Sobriety</hi> the friend of <hi>watchfulness,</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> of both.
Intemperance doth of necessity draw on sleep; exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
eating or drinking sending up too many, and so
gross vapours, surcharge the brain; and when the body
is thus deaded, how unfit is it for any active imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Thus the mind by a surcharge of delights, or
desires, or cares of earth, is made so heavy, and dull,
that it cannot awake, hath not spiritual activeness, and
clearness, that spiritual exercises, particularly Prayer,
do require. Yea as bodily insobriety, full feeding, and
drinking, not only for the time, indisposes to action,
but by custome of it, brings the body to so gross and
heavy a temper, that the very natural spirits cannot
stir to and fro in it with freedom: but are clog'd, and
stick as the Wheels of a Coach in a deep miry way.
Thus is it with the Soul glutted with earthly things,
the affections bemir'd with them, make it resist and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
in spiritual things, and the motions of the spirit
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:104216:163"/>
heavy, and obscured in it, grows carnally secure, and slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
prayer comes heavily off. But when the affections
are soberly acted, and even in lawful things, that they have
not liberty, with the reins laid on their Necks, to follow
the World and carnal projects and delight, when the
unavoidable affairs of this life are done with a spiritual
mind, a heart kept free and disingaged; Then is the
Soul more nimble for spiritual things, for Divine Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Prayer, it can watch and continue in these
things, and spend it self in that excellent way with more
alacrity.</p>
                  <p>Again, as the Sobriety, and the watchful temper
attending it, enables for Prayer, so Prayer preserves
these, it winds up the Soul from the Earth, raises it
above these things that intemperance feeds on, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
it with the transcending sweetness of Divine
Comforts, the love and the loveliness of Jesus Christ,
and these most powerfully wean the Soul from these
low creeping pleasures, that the World gapes after, and
swallows with such greediness. He that is admitted
to nearest intimacy with the King, and is called daily
to his presence, not only in the view and company of
others, but likewse in secret, will he be so mad, as to
sit down and drink with the kitchin boys, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
guards, so far below what he may enjoy? surely
no.</p>
                  <p>Prayer being our near Communion with the great
God, certainly it sublimates the Soul, and makes it
look down upon the base ways of the World with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
and despise the truly besotting pleasures of it.
Yea the Lord doth sometime fill these Souls, that con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verse
much with him, with such beautiful delights, such
inebriating sweetness, as I may call it, that 'tis in a
happy manner drunk with those; and the more of this,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:104216:164"/>
the more is the Soul above base intemper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r, and you shall find the loss
when your Soul is heavy and drowsie, and falls off from
delighting in God, and your Communion with him.
Will such things, as those you follow, be able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail
your damage? can they speak you peace, and
uphold you in a day of darkness and distress, or may
it not be such now, as will make them all a burden and
vexation to you? But on the otherside, the more you
abate and let go of these, and come empty and hungry
to God in prayer, the more room shall you have for his
consolations, and therefore the more plentifully will
he pour in of them, and enrich your Soul with them
the more, the less you take in of the other.</p>
                  <p>2. Would you have your selves raised to, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
and advanced in a spiritual heavenly temper,
free from the surfeits of earth, and awake, and active
for heaven, be uncessant in prayer?</p>
                  <p>But thou wilt say, I find nothing but heavy indispo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sedness
in it, nothing but roving, and vanity of heart:
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:104216:164"/>
and so, though I have used it sometime, its still unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and uncomfortable to me? although it be so,
yet hold on, give it not over; or need I say this to thee,
though it were referr'd to thy self? wouldest thou forsake
it, and leave off? then what wouldest thou do next, for
if no comfort in it, far less any for thee, in any other way.
If tentation should so far prevail with thee, as to try
intermission; either thou wouldest be forced to return
to it presently, or certainly wouldest fall into a more
grievous condition, and after horrours and lashings,
must at length come back to it again, or perish for
ever. Therefore however it go, continue praying,
strive to believe that love thou canst not see: for
where sight is abridg'd, there it is proper for faith to
work: if thou canst do no more, lie before thy Lord and
look to him. Lord here I am, thou maist quicken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
me, if thou wilt, and I trust thou wilt, but if I must do
it, I will lie at thy feet; my life is in thy hand, and thou
art goodness and mercy; while I have breath I will cry,
or if I cannot cry, yet I will wait on and look to thee.</p>
                  <p>One thing forget not, that the ready way to rise out
of this sad, yet safe estate, is to be much in viewing
the Mediator, and interposing him betwixt the fathers
view, and thy Soul. Some that do orthodoxly believe
this to be right, yet, as often befals us in other things of
this kind, they do not so consider, and use it in their
necessity, as becomes, and therefore fall short of comfort:
he hath declared it, <hi>no Man comes to the Father but by me.</hi>
How vile soever, put thy self under his robe, and into
his hand, and he will lead thee in to the Father, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thee acceptable and blameless: The Father shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thee, and declare himself well pleased with thee in his
well beloved Son, who hath covered thee with his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and brought thee so Cloathed, and set thee
before him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:104216:165"/>
3. The third thing is the reason binding on these,
<hi>The end of all things is at hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is needful often to be remembred, for even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
too readily forget it, and its very sutable to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
foregoing discourse of Judgement, and to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
exhortation to sobriety, and watchfulness unto pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
even the general end of all at hand, though since the
Apostle writ this many Ages are past. For (1.) The
Apostles usually speak of the whole time after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Jesus Christ in the flesh as the last time, for that
two double Chiliads of years past before it, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the other under the Law, and in this third, it is
conceived, shall be the end of all things. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
seem by divers expressions to have apprehended
it in their days not far off. So St. <hi>Paul 1. Thess. 4.
17. We which are alive, and remain, shall be caught up
together with them in the Clouds.</hi> As not impossible,
that it might come in their time, which put him upon
some explication of that correction of their mistakes,
in his next Epistle to them, wherein notwithstanding he
seems not to assert any great tract of time to interveen,
but in that time great things were first to come.
(2.) However this might always have been said in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of succeeding Eternity, the whole duration of the
World is not considerable, and to the eternal Lord that
made it, and hath appointed its period, a thousand years
are as one day. We think a thousand years a great matter
in respect of our short life, and more through our short
sightedness, that look not through to eternal life: but
what is the utmost length of time, were it millions of
years to a thought of eternity. We find much room
in this earth, but to the vast heavens, it is but as a
point. Thus that which is but small to us, a field or
little inclosure: a Fly, had it skill, would divide it into
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:104216:165"/>
vinces, in proportion to it self. (3.) To each man the
end of all things, is even after our measure, at hand;
for when he dies, the World ends for him. Now this
consideration fits the Subject, and presses it strongly,
seeing all things shall be quickly at an end, even the
frame of Heaven and Earth, why should we, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, and having higher hopes, lay so much out
of our desires and endeavours upon these things, that
are posting to ruine; its no hard notion to be sober,
and watchful to prayer, to be trading that way, and
seeking higher things, very moderate in these, seeing
they are of so short a date: and as in themselves and
their utmost term, so more to each of us particularly
who are so soon cut off, and flee away; why should
our hearts cleave to those things from which we shall
so quickly part, and if we will not freely part and let
go, we shall be pulled away, and pull'd with the
more pain, the closer we cleave, and faster we are
glued to them.</p>
                  <p>This the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> casts in seasonably, though
many think it not seasonable at such times, when he is
discoursing of a great point of our life, marriage, to
work Christian minds to a holy freedom both ways,
whether they use it or no, not to view it, nor any
thing here with the World's Spectacles, that make it
look so big and so fixed, but to see in the stream of
time as passing by, and no so great matter, the fashion
of this World passeth away, as a pageant or shew in a
Street, going through and quickly out of sight: what
became of all the marriage Solemnities of Kings and
Princes of former Ages, that they were so taken up
with in their time? when we read of them described
in History, they are as a night dream, or a day fancy,
that passes through the wind, and vanishes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:104216:166"/>
Oh! foolish man that hunts such poor things, and
will not be called off, till death benight him, and his
great work not done, yea, not begun; no nor seriously
thought of, your Buildings, your Trading, your Lands,
your Matches, and Friendships, and Projects when they
take with you, and your hearts are after them, say,
but, for how long all these? <hi>their end is at hand;
therefore be sober, and watch unto prayer,</hi> learn to divide
better, more hours for it, and fewer for them; your
whole heart for it, and none of it for them; seeing
they will fail you so quickly, prevent them, come
free, lean not on them till they break, and you fall
into the pit.</p>
                  <p>'Tis reported of one that hearing that <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Genesis</hi>
read, so <hi>long lives,</hi> and yet the burden still, <hi>they died,
Enoch lived 905, and he died; Seth 912, and he died; Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selah
969, and he died;</hi> took so deep the thought of
death and eternity, that it changed his whole frame,
and set him from a voluptuous to a most strict and
pious course of life, how small a word will do much,
when God sets it into the heart. But sure this one
thing would make the Soul more calm, and sober in the
pursuit of present things; if their term were truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
and considered. How soon shall youth, and
health, and carnal delights be at an end? how soon
shall State craft, and King-craft, and all the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the highest Wits and Spirits be laid in the
dust? This casts a damp upon all those fine things;
but to a Soul acquainted with God, and in affection
removed hence already, no thought so sweet as this;
helps much to carry it chearfully through wrestlings
and difficulties; through better and worse, they see
Land near, and shall quickly be at home, that's the
way. <hi>The end of all things is at hand:</hi> an end of a
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:104216:166"/>
few poor delights, and the many vexations of this
wretched life; an end of tentations and sins, the worst
of all evils; yea, an end of the imperfect fashion of
our best things here, an end of prayer it self, to which
succeeds that new Song of endless praises.</p>

                  <p>THE Graces of the Spirit are an entire frame
making up the new Creature, and none of them
can be wanting, therefore the Doctrine and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Apostles, speak of them usually, not
only as inseparable, but as one. But there is amongst
them all, none more cemprehensive, than this of
<hi>Love:</hi> insomuch that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it the <hi>fullfilling of
the Law;</hi> love to God the sum of all relative to him,
and so likewise is it towards our Brethren. Love to
God is that, which makes us live to him, and
be wholly his, that which most powerfully weans
us from this World, and causeth us delight in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him, in holy Meditation and Prayer. Now
the Apostle adding here of the duty of Christians to one
another, gives this the prime, yea, the sum of all:
<hi>Above all have fervent love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning this, Consider, (1.) The Nature of it.
(2.) The Eminent Degree of it. (3) The Excellent
Fruit of it.</p>
                  <p>1. It is an union, therefore called a bond or chain
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:104216:167"/>
that links things together. 2. 'Tis not a meer external
union that holds in customs, or words, or outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
but an union of hearts. 3. 'Tis here not a natural,
but a spiritual supernatural union; it is that mutual
love of Christians as Brethren. There is a common
benevolence and good-will due to all; but a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
uniting affection interchangeably one, amongst
Christians.</p>
                  <p>The Devil being an Apostate Spirit, revolted and
separated from God, doth naturally project and work
division. This was his first exploit, and still his grand
design and business in the World: he first divided Man
from God, put them at an enmity by the first Sin of
our first Parents, and the next we read of in their first
Child, was enmity against his Brother, so Satan is
called by our Saviour justly, a <hi>liar, and a murderer from
the beginning;</hi> murdered man by lying, and made him
a murderer.</p>
                  <p>And as the Devil's work is Division, Christ's work
is Union; he came to dissolve the works of Satan by
a contrary work, he came to make all Friends, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
and reunite all Men to God, and Man to Man;
and both those unions hold in him by vertue of that
marvellous union of Natures in his Person; and that
Mysterious Union of the Persons of Believers with him
as their Head, so the word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>.
To unite all in one head.</p>
                  <p>Thus his great project in all: this he died and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for, and this he prayed for, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. and this is
strong above all ties, natural or civil, union in Christ;
this they have that are indeed Christians, this they
pretend to have, if they understood it, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves Christians. If natural friendship be
capable of that expression <hi>one spirit in two bodies,</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:104216:167"/>
union hath it much more really and properly: for
there is indeed one Spirit more extensive in all the
Faithful; yea, so one Spirit that it makes them up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one body more intensive: they are not so much as
divers bodies, only divers members of one body.</p>
                  <p>Now this love of our Brethren, is not another from
the love of God, 'tis but the streaming forth of it, or
the reflex of it: Jesus Christ sending in his Spirit
into the heart, unites it to God in himself by love, which
is all indeed; that loving of God supreamly and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with all the mind and soul, all the combined strength
of the heart, and then that same love, first wholly
carried to him<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> is not divided or impared by the love
of our Brethren; 'tis but dilated and derived from the
other: he allows, yea, commands, yea, causes, that it
stream forth, and act it self toward them, remaining
still in him, as in its source and center, beginning at
him, and returning to him, as the Beams that diffuse
themselves from the Sun, and the Light and Heat, yet
are not divided, or cut off from it, but remain in
it; and by emanation issue from it. Loving our
Brethren in God, and for him, not only because he
commands us to love them, and so the Law of Love to
him ties us to it, as his Will; but because that love of
God doth naturally extend it self thus, and acts thus, in
loving our Brethren after a Spiritual Christian manner,
we do even in that love our God.</p>
                  <p>Loving of God makes us one with God, and so
gives us an impression of his divine bounty in his Spirit,
and his love, the proper work of his Spirit dwelling in
the Heart, enlarges and dilates it, as self-love contracts
and streightens it, so that as self-love is the perfect op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the love of God, it is likewise so to brotherly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,
shuts out and undoes both; and where the love
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:104216:168"/>
of God is rekindled, and enters the Heart, it destroys
and burns up self love, and so carries the affection up
to himself, and in him forth to our Brethren.</p>
                  <p>This is that bitter root of all enmity in man against
God and amongst Men, against one another, <hi>Self,</hi> Man's
Heart turned from God towards himself; and the very
work of renewing Grace is, to annual and destroy Self,
to replace God in his Right, that the Heart and all its
Affections and Motions be at his dispose: so that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of self-will and self-love that rul'd before, now
the Will of God, and the Love of God commands
all.</p>
                  <p>And where it is thus, there this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>, this love
of our Brethren, will be sincere. Whence is it that
Wars, and Contests, and mutual Disgracings and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisings
abound so; but that men love themselves, and
nothing but themselves, or in relation to themselves,
as it pleases or is advantageous to them; that's the
Standard and Rule, all is carried by interest, so thence
are stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>es and defamings, and bitterness against one
another; but the Spirit of Christ coming in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>es
all selfishness. And now according to God,
what he wills and loves, that's Law, and a powerful
Law, so written on the Heart, this Law of Love, that
it obeys not unpleasantly; but with delight, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
but the sweet constraint of love; to forgive
a wrong, to love even thine enemy for him, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feisible now, but de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ectable, that ere while thou
thoughtest impossible.</p>
                  <p>That Spirit of Christ is all sweetness and love, so
calms and composes the Heart, that peace with God,
and that unspeakably blessed correspondence of love
with him, doth so fill the Soul with lovingness and
sweetness, that it can breath nothing else, hates nothing
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:104216:168"/>
but sin, pities the sinner, and carries to the worst that
love of good-will, desiring their return and salvation:
but to those, in whom appears the Image of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
those their heart cleaves to, as Brethren indeed.
No advantages natural, no birth, no beauty, nor wit
draws a Christian's love so much, as the resemblance of
Christ, wherever that is found, it is comely, and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to a Soul that loves him.</p>
                  <p>Much communion with God sweetens and calms the
mind, cures the distempers of passion and pride, that
are the avowed enemies of love, particularly Prayer
and Love suit well. (1.) Prayer disposes to this love;
<hi>he that loveth not, knoweth not God,</hi> saith the beloved
Apostle, <hi>for God is love;</hi> he that is most conversant
with love, the spring of where 'tis purest and
fullest, cannot but have the fullest measure of it, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in from thence into his heart, and flowing forth
from thence, unto his Brethren; if they, that use the
society of mild and good men, are insensibly assimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, grow like them, and contract somewhat
of their temper; much more doth familiar walking
with God powerfully transform the Soul into his
likeness; makes it merciful and loving, and ready to
forgive, as he is.</p>
                  <p>2. This love disposes to prayer, to pray together,
hearts must be consorted and tun'd together: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
how can they sound the same Suits harmoniously.
How unpleasant in the exquisite ear of God, that made
the ear, are the jarring disunited hearts, that often
seem to joyn in the same prayer, and yet are not set
together in love: and when thou prayest alone, thy
heart imbitter'd and disaffected to thy Brother, altho'
upon an offence done to thee, 'tis as a mistuned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
the Strings are not accorded, so are not in
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:104216:169"/>
tune amongst themselves, and so the sound is harsh,
and offensive; try it well thy self, and thou wilt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it; how much more he, to whom thou pray'st when
thou art stirr'd, and in passion against thy Brother, or
not on the contrary, lovingly affected towards him;
what broken disordered unfastened stuff are thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
therefore the Lord will have this done first, the
Heart tun'd, <hi>go thy way,</hi> (says he,) <hi>leave thy Gift, and
be reconcil'd to thy Brother,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Why is this so much recommended by Christ, and
so little received by Christians, given by him as the
cognisance and badge of his Followers, and of them
that pretend to be so, so few that wear it. Oh! lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
real Christianity were more worth than all that
empty profession and discourse, that we think so much
of. Hearts receiving the mould and stamp of this
Rule; these were living Copies of the Gospel; <hi>ye are
our Epistle,</hi> says the Apostle. We come together, and
hear, and speak sometimes of one Grace, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of another; and the most never seek to have
their hearts enricht with the possession of any of them.
We search not to the bottom the perversness of our
Nature, and the guiltiness that is upon us in these;
or we shift off the Conviction, and find a way to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it when the hour's done.</p>
                  <p>That accursed root, self-love, that makes man an enemy
to God, and Men enemies and devourers one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who sets to the discovery and the displanting of
it, bends the force of holy Endeavours and Prayer, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates
the hand of God for the plucking of it up?
Some Natures are quieter and make less noise, but till
the heart be possest with the love of God, it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
truely love either men, in that way due to all, or
the Children of God in their peculiar relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:104216:169"/>
                     <hi>Among your selves,</hi> &amp;c.] That is here the point, the
peculiar love of the Saints as thy Brethren, glorying
and rejoycing in the same Father, the Sons of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
again to that lively hope of glory: now these as
they owe a bountiful disposition to all, they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to love one another as Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Thou, that hatest and reproachest the godly, and
the more they study to walk as the Children of their
holy Father, the more thou hatest them, art glad to
find a spot to point at on them, or wilt dash mire on
them where thou findest none; know, that thou art in
this, the enemy of God, that the indignity done to
them, Jesus Christ will take it, as done to himself:
truely <hi>we know that we have passed from death unto life,
because we love the Brethren: he that loveth not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abideth in death.</hi> So then renounce this Word,
or else believe that thou art yet far from the Life of
Christ, that so hatest it in others. Oh! but they are
but a number of Hypocrites, wilt thou say. Brethren,
if they be so, this declares so much the more thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
hatred of holiness, that canst not endure so much
as the Picture of it, canst not see any thing like it,
but thou must let fly at it, and this argues thy deep
hatred of God, holiness in a Christian as the Image of
God, and the Hyprocrite in the resemblance of it, is
the Image of a Christian, so thou hatest the very
Image of the Image of God: for deceive not thy
self, it is not the latent evil in hypocrisie, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
good in it that thou hatest. The prophane
Man thinks himself a great Zealot against Hypocrisie,
he is still crying out of it, but its only this he is angry
at, that all should not be ungodly, wicked enemies of
Religion, as he is, either dissolute, or meerly civil; and
the civil man is readily the bitterest enemy of all
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:104216:170"/>
strictness beyond his own size, as condemning him, and
therefore he cries it down, as all of it false and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
wares.</p>
                  <p>Let me intreat you, if you would not be found
fighters against God, let no revilings be heard amongst
you, against any that are or seem to be Followers of
Holiness: if ye will not reverence it your selves, yet
reverence it in others, at least do not reproach it. It
should be your ambition, else why are you willing to
be called Christians: but if you will not <hi>pursue holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
yet persecute it not: if you will not <hi>have fervent
love to the Saints,</hi> yet burn not with infernal heat of
fervent hatred against them; for truly that is one of
the likliest pledge of these flames, and society with
damned Spirits; as love to the Children of God is, of
that inheritance and society with them in glory.</p>
                  <p>2. You that are Brethren and united by that purest
and strongest tie; as you are one in your head, in
your life derived from him, in your hopes of glory
with him; seek to be more one in heart, in fervent
love one to another in him. Consider the combine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and concurrences of the wicked against him,
and his little flock; and let this provoke you to more
united affections. Shall the Scales of Leviathan (as
one alludes) stick so close together, and shall not the
Members of Christ be more one and undivided: you
that can resent it, stir up your selves, to bewail the
present divisions and fears of more, suit earnestly for
that one Spirit to act and work more powerfully in the
hearts of his people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> The eminent degree of this love. 1. Its emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
amongst Graces above all. 2. The high mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it required fervent love [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>,] a high bent, or
strain of it, that which acts strongly, and carries far.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:104216:170"/>
1. 'Tis eminent, that which indeed among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
preserves all, and knits all together; therefore
called, <hi>Col. 3. the bond of perfection,</hi> all bound up by it.
How can they pray together, advance the name of
their God, keep in and stir up all Grace in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
unless they be united in love? how can they
have access to God, or fellowship with him, <hi>who is love,</hi>
as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks: if instead of this sweet temper
there be rancours and bitterness amongst them? so
then uncharity and divisions amongst Christians, doth
not only hinder their civil good, but their spiritual
much more: and that not only <hi>lucro cessante</hi> (as they
speak) interrupting the ways of mutual profiting, but
<hi>damno emergente,</hi> it doth really damage them, and
brings them to losses; preys upon their Graces, as hot
withering winds on Herbs and Plants: where the Heart
entertains either bitter malice, or but uncharitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
there will be a certain decay of spiritualness in
the whole Soul.</p>
                  <p>2. Again, for the degree of this love required, it
is not a cold indifferency, a negative love, as I may
call it, or not willing of evil, nor a lukewarm wishing
of good, but fervent and active love: for if fervent,
it will be active, a fire will not be smother'd, it will
find way to extend it self.</p>
                  <p>3. The Fruits of this Love follow. 1. <hi>Covering of
evil,</hi> in this verse. 2. <hi>Doing of good,</hi> verse 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Covers<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                     </hi>] This from <hi>Solomon,</hi> and here as its repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to be thus done, as a main act of love: so love is
commended by it, as a most useful, and laudible act of
it, <hi>covers sins,</hi> and <hi>a multitude of sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, as the Opposition clears the Sense,
<hi>hatred stirs strife,</hi> aggravates and makes the worst of
all, <hi>but love covers a multitude of sins;</hi> delights not in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:104216:171"/>
undue disclosing of Brethrens failings, doth not eye
them rigidly, nor expose them willingly to the eyes of
others.</p>
                  <p>Now this commends charity, in regard of its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
usefullness and necessity this way, considering
human frailty; and <hi>that in many things</hi> (as St. <hi>Iames</hi>
speaks) <hi>we all offend;</hi> so that this is still needful on all
hands: what do they think that are still picking at
every appearing infirmity of their Brethren; know
they not that the frailties that cleave to the Saints of
God while they are here, doth stand in need of, and call
for this mutual office of love to cover and pass by;
who is there that stands not in need of this? if none,
why are there any that deny it to others? there can be
no society nor entertaining of Christian converse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, giving as we speak the allowance, reckoning to
meet with defects, and weaknesses on all hands, covering
the failings one of another, seeing its needful from
each to another.</p>
                  <p>Again, as the necessity of this commends it, and the
love whence it flows; so there is that laudible ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
in it, that should draw us to the liking of it; 'tis the
bent of the basest and worthlessest Spirits to be busie in
the search and discovery of others failings, passing by
all that is commendable and imitable, as base Flies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
sitting on any little sore they can find, rather than
upon the sound parts: but the more Excellent Mind
of a real Christian, loves not unnecessarily to touch,
no nor to look upon them, rather turns away, never
uncover their Brothers sore, but to cure it; and no more
than of necessity must be for that end, would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have them hid, that neither they nor others might
see them.</p>
                  <p>This bars not the judicial trial of scandalous offences,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104216:171"/>
nor the delation of them, and bringing them under
due censure: the forbearing of this is not charity, but
both iniquity, and cruelty, and this cleaves too much
to many of us; they that cannot pass the least touch
of a wrong done to themselves, can digest twenty high
injuries done to God by prophane persons about them,
and resent it not, and such may be assured, they are
yet destitute of love to God, and of Christian love to
their Brethren which springs from it.</p>
                  <p>The uncovering of sin necessary to the curing of it
is not only no breach of charity, but is indeed a main
point of charity, and the neglect of it the highest kind
of cruelty. But further then that goes, certainly this
rule teaches the veiling of our Brethrens infirmities
from the eyes of others, and even from our own, that
we look not on them with rigour; no, nor without
compassion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First.</hi> Love is witty in finding out the fairest
constructions of things doubtful, and this is a great point
Take me the best action that can be named, pride, and
malice shall find a way to disgrace it, and put a hard
visage on't. Again, what is not undeniably evil, love
will turn all the ways of viewing it, till it find the best
and most favourable.</p>
                  <p>2. Where the thing is so a sin, that this way of cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> can have no place, yet then will love consider what
may lessen it most, whether a surprize or strength of
tentation, or ignorance, as our Saviour, <hi>Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do,</hi> or natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
or at least will still take in humane frailty, to
turn all the bitterness of passion into sweet compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>3. All private reproofs, and where conscience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
publick delation and censure, even these will
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:104216:172"/>
be sweetned in that compassion that slows from love, if
such a sore as must not be let lie covered up, least it
prove deadly: so that it must be uncovered to be
lanc't, and cut, that it may be cur'd this to be done
as loving the Soul of the Brother. Where the rule
of consciences urges it not, then thou must bury it;
and be so far from delighting to divulge such things,
that as far as without partaking in it thou mayest, thou
must veil it from all eyes, and try the way of private
admonition, and if the party appear to be humble and
willing to be reclaimed, then forget it, cast it quite
out of thy thoughts, that as much as may thou mayest
learn to forget it more. But this, I say, to be done with
the tenderest bowels of pity, feeling the cuts thou art
forc't to give in that necessary incision, and use mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and patience. Thus the Apostle instructs his <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
Reprove, rebuke, exhort,</hi> but do it with <hi>long suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with all long suffering.</hi> 2. Tim. 4. 2. And even
<hi>they that oppose, instruct,</hi> says he, <hi>with meekness: if God
peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging
of the truth.</hi> chap. 2. verse. 25,</p>
                  <p>4. If thou be interessed in the offence, even by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
free forgiveness, so far as thy concern goes,
let it be, as if it had not been. And though thou meet
with many of these; Charity will gain, and grow by such
occasions. And the more it hath covered, the more it
can cover, <hi>cover a multitude,</hi> says our Apostle, <hi>Covers
all sins,</hi> says <hi>Solomon:</hi> yea though thou be often put to't
by the same party, what made thee forgive once, well
improved, will stretch our Saviours rule to seventy
times seven times in one day.</p>
                  <p>And truly even this, Men mistake grosly, that think
it is greatness of Spirit to resent wrongs, and baseness
to forgive them; on the contrary, it is the only excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:104216:172"/>
Spirit scarce to feel a wrong, or feeling, straight to
forgive it; 'tis the greatest, and the best of Spirits that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to this, the Spirit of God, that Dove like Spirit, that
rested on our Lord Jesus, and from him derived to all
that are in him. I pray you think, is it not a token of a
tender sickly body, to be altered with every touch from
every blast it meets with? and thus is it of a poor weak
sickly Spirit, to endure nothing, to be distemper'd at the
least air of an injury; yea with the very fancy of it,
where there is none.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inf.</hi> 1. Learn then to beware of these evils, that are
contrary to this Charity, do not dispute with your selves
in rigid remarks and censures, when the matter will
bear any better sense.</p>
                  <p>2. Do not delight in tearing a wound wider, and
stretching a real failing to the utmost.</p>
                  <p>3. In handling of it, study gentleness, and pity, and
meekness: these will advance the cure, whereas thy
flying out into passion against thy fallen Brother, will
prove nothing, but as the putting of thy nail into the
sore, that will readily rankle it, and make it worse:
even sin, may be sinfully reproved, and how think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou, that sin shall redress sin, and reduce the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>There is a great deal of spiritual art, and skill in
dealing with another's sin, and requires much spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of mind, and much prudence, and much love, a mind
clear from passion, for that blinds the eye, and makes
the hand rough, that a Man neither rightly sees, nor
handles the sore he goes about to cure, and many are
lost through the ignorance, and neglect of that due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be brought to this work. Men think otherwise,
that their rigours are much spiritualness, but they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
it, <hi>Gal. 6. 1. Brethren, if a Man be overtaken in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:104216:173"/>
a fault, yea which are spiritual, restore such an one in the
spirit of meekness, considering thy self, least thou be also
tempted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. For thy self; as an offence touches thee, learn
to delight as much in that Divine way of forgiveness,
as carnal minds do in that base and inhumane way of
revenge. 'tis not, as they Judge, a glory to ruffle and
swagger for every thing, but the <hi>glory of Man to pass
by a transgression,</hi> makes him God like. And consider
thou often, that love that covers all thine, that blood
that was shed to wash off thy guilt; needs any more be
said to gain all in this, that can be required of thee.</p>

that is the main, 'tis all indeed, even with Men so far
as they can perceive it, much more with thy Lord,
who always perceives it to be full. He delights in the
good he does his creatures: he would have them so
to one another, especially his Children to have this tract
of his likeness. See then, when thou givest alms or
entertainest a stranger, that there be nothing either of
under grumbling, or crooked self seeking in it. Let the
left hand have no hand in it, not so much as know of

cheerful, and pleasant to thy self, and well pleasing
to him, for whom thou dost it. We lose much in
actions of themselves good, both of piety and charity,
through disregard of our hearts in them: and nothing
will prevail with us, to be more intent this way, to
look more on our hearts, but this, to look more on
him, that looks on them, and Judges, and accepts all
according to them.</p>

to know, that all is <hi>received,</hi> and received of <hi>gift,</hi> of
most <hi>free gift,</hi> so the words do carry. Now this would
most reasonably check all murmuring in those, that
receive least; and insulting in those, that receive most:
whatever 'tis, do not repine, but praise; how little so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is, for its a free gift. Again, how much soever
it is, be not high minded, but fear, boast not thy self,
but humbly bless thy Lord: <hi>for if thou hast received it,
how canst thou boast?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Every man hath received some gift, no man all

lowest rank in most respects: yet something he hath
received, that is not only a good to himself, but right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

will curb the loftiness of the most advantaged, and

this, it will put them upon the use of what is in low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
persons, not only to stoop to the acknowledgment;
but even withal the participation and benefit of it, not
to trample upon all that is below them, but to take up,

gladly to be a good Steward, that is, both faithful and
prudent in thy intrusted gifts, using all thou hast to
the good of the Houshold, and so to the advantage of
thy Lord and Master. Hast thou abilities of estate, or
body, or mind, let all be thus employed? thinkest thou
that thy wealth, or power, or wit, is thine, to do with
them as thou wilt, to ingross to thy self, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
useless, or to use to hoord and wrap up, or to
lavish out according as thy humour leads thee? no, all
is given, as to a Steward, wisely and faithfully to lay
up and lay out, not only thy outward and common
mind gifts, but even saving grace, that seems most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
and appropriated for thy private good: yet is
not wholly for that, even thy graces are for the good
of thy Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Oh! That we would consider this in all, and look
back and mourn on the fruitlessness of, all that hath been
in our hand all our life hitherto. If not wholly fruitless,
yet far short of that fruit we might have brought forth;
any little thing done by us, looks big in our eye, we
view it in a multiplying glass; but who may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that their means, and health, and opportunities
of several kinds of doing for God, and for our Brethren,
have lain dead upon their hands in a great part. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
as defective in other duties of love, so most in that
most important, of advancing the spiritual good of each
other. Even they that have grace, do not duly use it
to mutual edification. I desire none to leap over the
bounds of their calling, or rules of Christian prudence
in their converse, yea, this were much to be blam'd,
but, I fear, lest unwary hands, throwing on water
to quench that evil, let some of it fall by upon
these sparkles, that should be stirr'd and blown
up.</p>

                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:104216:177"/>
Neither should the disproportion of Gifts and Graces
hinder, nor move the weaker to envy the stronger;
nor the stronger to despise the weaker; but each in his
place to be serviceable to another, as the Apostle excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
presses it by that most fit resemblance of the parts
of the body, 1 <hi>Cor. 12 As the foot says not, why am I not the
eye, or the head; the head cannot say of the foot I have no
need of thee.</hi> No envy, no despising in the natural;
Oh! the pity that so much should be in the mystical;
were we more spiritual, this would less be found. In the
mean time, Oh! that we were more agreeable to that
happy estate we look for, in our present aspect, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
one to another. Though all graces are in some
measure where there is one, yet all not in a like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
One Christian more eminent in meekness, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in humility, a third in zeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now by their
spiritual converse one with another each may be a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and many ways may a private Christian promote
the good of others, with whom he lives, by seasonable
admonitions, and advice, and reproof sweetned with
meekness; but most by holy example, which is the
most lively, and most effectual speech.</p>
                  <p>Thou that hast greater Gifts, more is entrusted
in thy hand, therefore the more engagement to fidelity
and diligence. Men in great place and publick services
to stir themselves up by this thought to singular watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
and Zeal; and in private converse on with
another, to be doing, and receiving spiritual good:
are we not strangers here, and is it not strange, that we
so often meet, and part without a word of our home,
or the way to it, or our advance towards it? Christians
should be trading one with another in spiritual things,
and he sure that faithfully uses most, receives most,
that's under that word; <hi>to him that hath shall be given,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:104216:177"/>
and from him that hath not,</hi> &amp;c. that uses not. Its he
that hath actively and usefully. Merchants can feel
in their trading a dead time, and complain seriously of
it, and Christians in theirs either can suffer it and not
see it, or see it and not complain, or possibly complain
and yet not be deeply sensible of it.</p>
                  <p>Certainly it cannot be duly regreted that we are so
fruitless in the Lords work in this kind, that alone we
study it not more, and seek it more by prayer, to know
the true use of all we receive, and in society to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
accordingly. But we triffle out our time and instead
of the commerse of grace to our mutual enriching, we
trade in vanity, and as it were Children exchanging
shells and toys together.</p>
                  <p>This sure will lie heavy when we reflect on it, and shall
come near the utter brink of time, looking forwards on
eternity, and then looking back to our days, so vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wasted and worn out to no purpose. Oh! let us
awake, awake our selves and one another, to more
fruitfulness and faithfulness, whatsoever be our received
measure, less or more.</p>
                  <p>Be not discouraged, to have little in the account shall
be no prejudice. The approbation runs not, <hi>thou hadst
much,</hi> but in the contrary, <hi>thou hast been faithful in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:</hi>
great faithfulness in the use of small gifts hath great
acceptance, and a great and sure reward. Great receits
engage to greater returns, and therefore require the
greater diligence; and that not only for the increase
of grace within; but the assistance of it in others. Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Contemplation may be more pleasing, but due active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for God and his Church is more profitable. <hi>Rachel,</hi>

                  <p>EVery, part of the body of Christ, as it partakes life

there be some more eminent, and as I may say, <hi>organick</hi>
parts of this body, and these are more emine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the whole body. Therefore the Apostle having
enlarg'd himself into a general precept, adds a word
in special to these special parts, the Preachers of the
Word, and (which here I conceive is meant by Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
or Ministers) the other assistent Officers of the
Church of God.</p>
                  <p>These are coordained by Jesus Christ, as Lord of his
own house to be serviceable to him in it, he fits and
sanctifies for this great work, all that are called unto it
by himself. And they are directed for the acquitting of
their great Work. (1.) By a clear rule of the due
manner. (2.) The main end of it.</p>
                  <p>Particular rules for the preaching of the Word may
be many, but this is one most comprehensive, that
the Apostle gives, <hi>if any speak, let him speak as
the Oracles of God. If any speak,</hi> that is clear from
the rule what speaking is regulated, and for brevity
once exprest. If any speak the Oracles of God,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:104216:178"/>
let him speak them like themselves, <hi>as the Oracles of
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a chief thing in all serious actions to take the
nature of them aright, for this mainly regulates them,
and directs in their performance. And this especially
would be regarded in those things, that are of highest
worth, and greatest weight in spiritual imployments,
wherein it is most dangerous, and yet with us most
ordinary, to mistake and miscarry. Were prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
as presence and speech with the great God,
the King of Glory, Oh! how would this mould the
mind? what a watchful, holy, and humble deportment
would it teach? so that truly all directions for prayer
might be summed up after this same model in this one,
if any Man pray, let him speak as speaking with God,
just as here for preaching, if any Man speak in that way
let him do it as speaking from God, that is, <hi>as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of God.</hi> Under this all the due qualifications of this
holy work are comprised; I shall name but these three
which are prime, and others may be easily reduced
to these. 1. <hi>Faithfully. 2. Holily. 3. Wisely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the first its supposed that a Man have competent
insight and Knowledge in these Divine Oracles, that first
he learn before he teach, which many of us do not,
though we pass through the Schools and Classes, and
through the books too, wherein these things are taught,
and bring with us some provision, such as may be had
there. He that would faithfully teach of God must be
taught of God, be God-learned and this will help to all the
rest, to be faithful in delivering the message, as he receives
it, not detracting or adding, nor altering; and as in
setting forth that in general truths, so in the particular
setting them home, declaring to his people their sins,
and his judgements following sin, especially in his
own people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:104216:179"/>
2. <hi>Holily.</hi> With that high esteem, that reverence of
the great majesty, whose message he carries, and the
Divinness of the Message it self, those deep mysteries
that no created Spirits are able to fathom. Oh! this
would make us tremble in the dispensing of these O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
considering our impurities, and weaknesses,
and unspeakable disproportion, to so high a task. He
had reason that said <hi>I am seiz'd with amazement and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
or often as I begin to speak of God.</hi> And with this
humble reverence, is to joyn ardent love to our Lord,
to his truth, to his glory, and his peoples Souls. These
holy affections stand opposite to our blind boldness in
rushing on this sublime exercise, as a common work,
our dead coldness in speaking things, that our hearts are
not warm'd with, and so no wonder what we say doth
seldom reach further than the ear, or at furthest than
the understanding, and memory of our hearers; There
is a correspondence, it is the heart speaks to the heart;
and the understanding and memory the same; and the
tongue speaks, but to the ear: further this holy temper
shuts out all private passion in delivering Divine
Truths; it is high prophaning of his name, and holy
things, to make them speak our private pleas and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
yea to reprove sin after this manner is a heinous
sin, to fly out into invectives that though not exprest
so, yet are aimed as blows of self revenge for injuries
done to us, or fancied by us; this is to wind and draw
the Holy Word of God to serve our unholy distempers,
and make it speak not his meaning, but our own, sure
this is not to speak <hi>as the Oracles of God,</hi> but basely to
abuse the Word, as impostors in Religion of old did their
Images, speaking behind them, and through them, what
might make for their advantage. True, that the Word
is to be particularly applyed, to reprove most the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:104216:179"/>
sins, that most abound amongst a people: but
this to be done, not in anger, but in love.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Wisely.</hi> By this I mean in the way of delivering
it, that it be done gravely and decently; that light
expressions, and affected flourishes, and unseemly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
be avoided; and that there be a sweet contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
of authority and mildness? But <hi>who is sufficient
for these things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you that hear would certainly meet and suit
in this too. If any hear, let him hear <hi>as the Oracles of
God,</hi> not as a well tuned sound, to help you to sleep
an hour, not as a humane Speech or Oration, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splease,
or please you an hour, according to the suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of its strain, and your palate: Not as a School
lesson, to add somewhat to your stock of Knowledge,
to tell you somewhat you knew not before, or as a
feast of new notions. Thus the most relish a preacher,
while till they try his gift, and its new with them, but
a little time disgusts them. But hear <hi>as the Oracles of
God,</hi> the discovery of sin, and death lying on us, and
the discovery of a Saviour, that takes these off; the
sweet word of reconciliation, God wooing Man; the
great King intreating for peace with a company of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
not that are too strong for him, Oh! no, but
on the contrary he could utterly destroy in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
These are the things brought you in this word:
Therefore come to it with sutable reverence, with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
desires, and hearts open, to receive it, <hi>with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as the engrafted word, that is able to save your Souls:</hi>
it were well worth one days pains of speaking and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that we could learn somewhat, at least how to
speak, and hear henceforward; to speak and hear
<hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The other of <hi>ministring as of the ability that God giveth:</hi>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:104216:180"/>
In this. (1.) Ability, and that received from God, for
other there is none for any good work, least for the
peculiar ministration of his spiritual affairs in this
House. (2.) The using of this ability received from
him for them.</p>
                  <p>And this truly is a chief thing for Ministers and for
each Christian, still to depend on the influence and
strength of God, to do all his works in that strength;
the humblest Christian how weak soever is the strongest.
There is a natural wretched independency in us, that we
would be the Authors of our own works, and do all
without him; without whom indeed we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Learn we to go more out of our selves, and
we shall find more strength for our duties, and against
our tentations: Faith's great work is, to renounce self
power, and to bring in the power of God to be ours.
Happy they, that are weakest in themselves, sensibly
so. That word of the Apostle is theirs, they know
what it means, though a riddle to the World, <hi>when I
am weak, then am I strong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the end of all is, <hi>that in all God may be glorify'd,</hi>
&amp;c. All meet in this, if they move in their straight line,
here they concenter, not only these two sorts specify'd
in this verse, but all sorts of persons that use aright any
gift of God as they are generally comprehended in the
former verse, for this end relates to all, as it is exprest
universally, <hi>That in all,</hi> in all persons, and all things,
the word bears both, and the thing it self extends to
both.</p>
                  <p>Here we have, like that of the heaven's, a circular
motion of all sanctified good; it comes forth from God,
through Christ unto Christians, and moving in them to
the mutual good of each other, returns through
Christ unto God again, and takes them along with
it, in whom it was and had its motion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:104216:180"/>
All persons and things shall pay this tribute, even
they that most wickedly seek to withold it, but this
the happiness of the Saints, that they move willingly
thus, are sweetly drawn not forced or driven. They
are gained to seek and desire this, to set in with God
in the intention of the same end, to have the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
with him, his Glory in all. And to prosecute
his end by his direction, the means and ways he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
them.</p>
                  <p>This is his due, as God; and the declining from this,
squinting from this view to self ends, especially in God's
own peculiar work, is high treason; yet the base heart
of Man leads naturally this way, to intend himself in
all, to raise his own esteem or advantage in some
way.</p>
                  <p>And thus the heart is so subtle in conveying, that it will
deceive the most discerning, if they be not constant in
suspecting and watching it. This the great task to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in this point. To have self under our feet, and
God only in our eye and purpose in all.</p>
                  <p>It is most reasonable, his due, as God, the being of
all, not only of all supervenient good, but even of being
it self, seeing all is from him, that all be for him, <hi>Rom.
11. ult. For of him, and through him, and to him are all
things: to whom be glory for ever Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is most just, so its most sweet, to aim all at this,
<hi>that God be glorified:</hi> the alone worthy and happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
that fills the heart with heavenliness and with a
heavenly calmness, sets it above the Clouds and Storms
of these passions that disquiet low-self-seeking minds. He
is a miserable unsettled wretch that cleaves to himself

his estate, or designs, or any comforts fail, how can he

not the Lord say; <hi>Go to the gods whom thou hast serv'd,
and let them deliver, and comfort thee.</hi> Seek comfort
from thy self, as thou didst all for thy self? What an
appalement will this be? But he that hath resigned
himself, and is all for God, may say confidently, that
the Lord is his portion. This is the Christians aim, to
have nothing in himself, nor in any thing, but in this
tenure, all for the Glory of my God, my estate, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
abilities, my whole self, all I have and am. And
as the love of God grows in the heart, this purpose
grows; the higher the flame rises, the purer it is, the
eye daily the more upon it, it is oftner in mind in all
actions, than before, in common things, the very works
of our callings, our very refreshments to eat, and drink,
and sleep, are all for this end, and with a particular aim
at it as much as may be, even the thought of it often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
throughout the day, and at times generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to all our ways and employments. Its that <hi>Elixir</hi>
that turns thy ordinary works into gold, into sacrifices
by touch of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Through Iesus Christ.</hi>] The Christian in Covenant
with God receives all this way, and returns all this way,
and he possesses and hath equal right with the Father
to this glory, as he is equally the spring of it with him,
as God: but its conveyed through him as Mediator,
that obtains all grace we receive, and all glory we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and all our praise, as our spiritual sacrifice, is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hand, as our high Priest, to offer up for us, that
they may be accepted.</p>
                  <p>Now the holy ardour of the Apostles affections taken
with the mention of this Glory of God, carries him to a
<hi>dexology,</hi> as we term it, a rendring of glory in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:104216:181"/>
of his discourse. Thus often we find in St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewise.
Poor and short liv'd the glory and grandeur of Men
like themselves, a shaddow, and nothing: but this
solid and lasting, Supream it is, and abideth forever.
And the Apostles full of Divine affections, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
nothing but God, do delight in this, and cannot
contain from this at any time in their discourse; it
is always sweet, and seasonable, and they find it so.
And thus are spiritual minds, a word of this nature falls
on them as a sparkle on some matter, that readily takes
fire, they are straight enflamed with it. But alas!
to us how much is it otherwise, the mention of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and glory of our God is to our hearts as a sparkle
falling either into a puddle of water, and foul water too,
or at least as upon green timber, that much fire will
not kindle: so much moisture of our humours, and
corruptions, that all dies out with us, and we remain
cold and dead.</p>
                  <p>But were not this a high and blessed condition to be
in all estates in some willing readiness to bear a part in this
song, to acknowledge the greatness and goodness of our
God, and to wish him glory in all? What are the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
doing? this is their business, and that endless: and
seeing we hope to partake, we would even here, though
in a lower key, and not so tunebly neither, yet as we may,
begin it; and upon all occasions our hearts be often
following in this sweet Note, or offering at it. <hi>To him
be Glory, and Dominion for ever.</hi>

we need not be desired not to love it, but have
need to be strengthned with patience to go through, and
to fight on with courage and assurance of victory, still
combating in a higher strength than our own, against sin
within, and troubles without. This is the great Scope
of this Epistle, and the Apostle often interchanges his
advices, and comforts in reference to these two. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sin he instructs us in the beginning of this Chapter,
and here again, against suffering, and both in a like
way; and us to be armed, armed with <hi>the same mind,</hi>
that was in Christ, against trouble here, after the same
manner: in the mortifying of sin, we suffer with him,

The words to the end of the chapter contain grounds
of encouragement, and consolation for the Children
of God in sufferings, especially in suffering for
God.</p>
                  <p>These two verses have these two things. (1.) The clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>s
conjuncture of sufferings with the estate of a Christian.
(2.) The due composure of a Christian towards suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
                  <p>1. Its no new, and therefore no strange thing, that
sufferings, hot sufferings, fiery ones, be the Companions of
Religion, besides the common miseries of humane life;
there is an accession of troubles and hatreds for that
holiness of life, to which the Children of God are called.</p>
                  <p>It was the Lot of the Church from her wicked Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and in the Church, the lot of the most
holy and peculiar Servants of God from the prophane
multitude. <hi>Woe's me, my Mother,</hi> (says <hi>Ieremy) thou
hast born me a Man of contentions.</hi> And of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
says not our Saviour handling this same argument
in his Sermon; <hi>So persecuted they the prophets that were
before? you</hi> and after tells them what they might look
for, <hi>Behold,</hi> says he, <hi>I send you forth as sheep in the midst
of Wolves.</hi> And generally no following of Christ, but
with his badge and burden, somthing to be left, our
selves left; <hi>whosoever will be my disciple let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
and what to take; <hi>take up his Cross and follow me.</hi>
And doth not the Apostle give his Schollars this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
lesson, as an infallible truth, <hi>all that will live Godly
in Christ Iesus shall suffer persecution;</hi> and look in the
close of that roll of Believers conquering in suffering,
what a cluster of sufferings and torture, you have
<hi>Heb. 11. ver.</hi> 36, 37. &amp;c. Thus in the Primitive
times the tryal and fiery tryal, even literally so, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
long: these wicked Emperours hating the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:104216:183"/>
of Christians; and the people though they knew
their blameless carriage, yet, when any evil came, would
pick this quarrel and still cry, <hi>Christianos ad Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this, if we look to inferiour causes, is not strange,
the malignant ungodly World hating holiness, the
light, yea the very shadow of it, and the more the
Children of God walk like their Father, and their
home, the more unlike must they of necessity become
to the World about them; and therefore become the
very mark of all their enmities and malice.</p>
                  <p>And thus indeed the Godly, though the <hi>Sons of peace,</hi>
are the improper causes, the occasion of much noise and
disturbance in the World, as their Lord the <hi>Prince of
peace</hi> avows it openly of himself in that sense, <hi>I came
not to send peace, but a sword, to set a Man at variance
with his Father, and the Daughter against the Mother,</hi>
&amp;c. If a Son in a Family begin to enquire after God,
and withdraw from their prophane, or dead way, Oh!
what a clamour rises presently, Oh! my Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or Wife, is become a plain fool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then
all done, that may be, to quel and vex them, and make
their life grievous to them.</p>
                  <p>The exact holy walking of a Christian condemns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the World about him, shews the disorder and
foulness of their prophane ways; and the Life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
set beside dead formality, discovers it to be but a
carcase and lifeless appearance; and for this neither
grosly wicked, civil, nor formal persons can well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
it. There is in the life of a Christian a convincing
light, that shews the deformity of the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a piercing heat, that scorches the ungodly,
which stirs and troubles their consciences, and this they
cannot endure, and hence rises in them a contrary fire
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:104216:183"/>
of wicked hatred, and hence the trials, the fiery trials
of the godly. If they could get those precise persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
out of their way think they, then they might
have more room and live at more liberty, as 'tis <hi>Revel.</hi>
11. 10. a <hi>carousing</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] What a dance there about
the dead bodies of the two witnesses; <hi>the people and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
rejoyced and made merry, and send gifts one to another,
because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the
earth.</hi> And from the same hearth, I mean the same
wickedness of heart in the World, are the fires of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
kindled against the Saints in the World, and the
bonefires of joy when they are rid of them.</p>
                  <p>And as this is an infernal fire of enmity against God, tis
blown by that Spirit whose Element it is: Satan stirs
up and blows the coal, and raises the hatred of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
against Christians.</p>
                  <p>But while he and they, in whom he powerfully
works, are thus working for their vile ends in the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of the Saints; he that soveraignly orders all
is working in the same, his wise and gracious ends, and
attains them, and makes the malice of his enemies serve
his ends, and undo their own. It is true that by the
heat of persecution, many are fear'd from embracing
it, such as love themselves and their pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ent ease; and
others that seem'd to have embrac't it, are driven to let
it go and fall from it, but yet all well computed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is still upon the gaining hand, those that reject
it or revolt from it, are such as have no true Knowledge,
of it, nor share in it, nor in that happiness in which
it ends; but they, that are indeed united to Jesus Christ,
do cleave the closer to him, and seek to have their
hearts more fastened, because of these trials, that they
are, or likely may be put to. And in their victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
patience appears the invincible power of Religion
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:104216:184"/>
where it hath once gained the heart, that it cannot be
beaten, nor burnt out, it self is a fire more mighty
than all fires kindled against it. The love of Christ
conquers and triumphs in the hardest sufferings of life,
and in death it self.</p>
                  <p>And this hath been the means of kindling it in other
hearts, that were strangers to it, when they beheld
the victorious patience of the Saints, who conquer'd
dying, as their head did, that wearied their tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and triumpht over their cruelty by a constancy
far above it.</p>
                  <p>Thus these fiery trials, made the lustre of faith appear
most, as gold shines brightest in the furnace, and if any
dross is mixt with it, its refined and purged from it by
these trials, and so it remains by the fire purer than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And both these are in the resemblance here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that the fire of sufferings is the advantage of
Believers, both trying the excellency of faith, giving e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of it, what it is; purifying it from earth and
drossie mixtures, and making it more excellently what
it is raising it to a higher pitch of refinedness, and worth.
In these fires, as faith is tryed, the word on which
faith relies, is tried and is found all gold, most precious,
no refuse in it, the truth and sweeetness of the promises
much confirmed in the Christians heart, upon his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
of them in his sufferings; his God as good
as his word, being with him when he goes through
the fire, preserving him that he loses nothing except
dross, which is a gainful loss, leaves of his corruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him.</p>
                  <p>Oh! how much worth is it, and how doth it endear
the heart to God, to have found him sensibly present
in the times of trouble, him refreshing the Soul with
dews of spiritual comfort in the midst of the flames of
fiery trial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:104216:184"/>
One special advantage of these fires, is the purging
of a Christians heart from the love of the World, and
present things; its true, at best it is base and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
in respect of the high estate and hopes of a
Believer, yet still there is somewhat within him, that
would bend him downwards and draw him to too much
complacency in outward things, if they were much to
his mind: too kind usage might sometimes make him
forget himself, and think himself at home, at least so
much, as not to entertain those longings after home,
and that ardent progress homewards, that became him;
It is good for us certainly to find hardship, and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and contempts here, and to find them frequent,
that we may not think them strange, but our selves
strangers, and think it were strange for us to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
entertained. This keeps the affections more clear
and disingaged, sets it upward. Thus the Lord makes
the World displeasing to his own, that they may
turn in to him, and seek all their consolations in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
Oh! unspeakable advantage.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The composure of a Christian in reference to sufferings,</hi>
is prescrib'd in these two following, <hi>Resolving</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</hi>
(1.) Resolving for them, reckoning so, <hi>think
it not strange,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>, (2.) Rejoycing in them,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Be glad in as much,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be not strangers in it.</hi>] Which yet naturally we would
be, are willing to hear of peace and ease, and would
gladly believe what we extreamly desire. It is a thing
of prime concern to take at first a right notion
of Christianity which many do not, and so either
fall off quickly, or walk on slowly and heavily, do not
reckon right the charges, take not the duties of doing
and suffering; but think to perform some duties, if they
may with ease, and have no other foresight; do not
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:104216:185"/>
consider that self denial, that fighting against a Mans
self, and vehemently with the World, these trials,
fiery trials, which a Christian must encounter with.
As they observe of other points, Popery in this, is very
compliant with nature, which is a very bad sign in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
we would be content it were true, that the
true Church of Christ had rather Prosperity and Pomp
for her badge than the Cross, much ease and riches, and
few or no crosses, except they were painted and guilded
crosses, such as that Church hath chosen instead of real
ones.</p>
                  <p>Most Men would give religion a fair countenance,
if it gave them fair weather, and they that do indeed
acknowledge Christ the Son of God, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 16. Yet are naturally as unwilling, as he was, to
hear the hard news of suffering; and if their advice
might have place would readily be of his mind, <hi>Be it
far from thee Lord.</hi> His good confession was not, but
this kind advice was from flesh and blood, and
from an evil Spirit, as the sharp answer tells;
<hi>get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto
me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You know what kind of Messiah the Jews generally
dreamt of, and therefore took scandal at the meanness
and sufferings of Christ, expecting an earthly King of
him, and an outward flourishing State; and the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
themselves, after they had been long with him,
were still in that same dream, when they were conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
about imaginary places; yea they were scarce
well out of it, even after his suffering and death; all
the noise and trouble of that had not well awakt them,
<hi>Luk. 24. we trusted it had been he, which should have
restored Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after all that we have read, and heard of antient
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:104216:185"/>
times, and of Jesus Christ himself, his sufferings in the
flesh, and of his Apostles and his Saints from one Age
to another, yet still we have our inclinations to this,
of driving troubles far off from our thoughts, till they
come upon our backs, and fancying nothing, but rest and
ease, till we be shaken rudely out of it.</p>
                  <p>How have we of late flatter'd our selves, many of
us one year after another, upon slight appearances.
Oh! now it will be peace, and behold still trouble
hath increased, and these thoughts proved the lying
visions of our own hearts, while the Lord hath not
spoken it. And thus of late, have we thought it at
hand. And taken ways of our own to hasten it; that
I fear will prove fools hast, as you say.</p>
                  <p>You that know the Lord seek him earnestly for the
averting of further troubles and combustions; which
if you look aright, you will find threaten us as much
as ever. And withal seek hearts prepar'd, and fixed
for days of trial, fiery trial, yea though we did obtain
some breathing of our outward peace, yet shall not the
followers of Christ want their trials from the hatred of
the ungodly World, <hi>if it persecuted me</hi> (says he,) <hi>it
will also persecute you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Acquaint therefore your thoughts and hearts with
sufferings, that when they come, thou and they not
being strangers, may agree and comply the better. Do
not afflict your selves with vain fears before hand, of
troubles to come, and so make uncertain evils a certain
vexation by advance. But thus, fore think the hardest
things you may readily be put to, for the name and
cause of Christ, and labour for a holy stability of mind
for encountering it, if it should come upon you: things
certainly fall the lighter on us, when they fall first upon
our thoughts. This way indeed of an imagined suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:104216:186"/>
the conquest before hand may be but imaginary,
and fail in the trial: therefore be still humble, and
dependent on the strength of Christ, and seek to be
prefurnisht with much distrust of thy self, and much
trust in him, with much denial of thy self, and love to
him. And thus the preparing and training of the heart
may prove useful, and make it more dexterous, when
brought to conflicting: in all, both before hand, and
in time of the trial, make thy Lord Jesus all thy strength;
That is our only way in all, <hi>to be conquerours, to
be more than conqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>rors, through him that loved
us</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Think it not strngae,</hi> for it is not; sure your thoughts
to the experience, and verdict of all times, and to the
warnings that the Spirit of God in the Scriptures, and
our Saviour himself hath given us from his own mouth,
and example shewed in his own person. But the
other point goes higher, <hi>rejoyce,</hi> though we think
not the sufferings strange, yet may we not well think
that rule somewhat strange, to rejoyce in them? No,
it will be found as reasonable as the other, being duly
considered. And upon the same ground 'twil bear both,
<hi>in as much as you are partakers of the sufferings of
Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Children of God consider not their trials in
their natural bitterness, but in the sweet love from
whence they spring, and the sweet fruits that spring
from them, that we are our Lords gold, and he tries
us in the furnace to purifie us (as in the former verse;)
this may beget not only patience, but gladness even in
the sufferings. But add we this, and truly it compleats
the reason of this way in our saddest sufferings,
that <hi>in them we are partakers of the sufferings of
Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:104216:186"/>
So then 1. Consider this twofold connexed partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pance
of the Sufferings of Christ, and of the after Glory.
2. The present joy even in sufferings springing from
that participance,</p>
                  <p>I need not tell you, that this Communion in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
is not in point of expiation, or satisfaction to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice, which was the peculiar end of the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Christ <hi>personal,</hi> not of the common sufferings of
Christ <hi>mystical,</hi> he bare our sin on his own body on the
Tree, and in bearing them, took them away; we bear
his sufferings, as his body united to him by his Spirit.
Those sufferings that were his personal burden, we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the sweet fruits of, they are accounted ours, and
we acquitted by them, but the endurance of them
was his high and incommunicable task, in which none
at all were with him, our Communion in these, as fully
compleated by himself in his natural body, is the ground
of our comfort, and joy in these sufferings that are
compleated in his mystical body, the Church.</p>
                  <p>This is indeed our joy, that we have so light a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
so sweet an exchange, the weight of sin quite
taken off our backs, and only all bound on his cross,
and our crosses badges of our conformity, laid on our
shoulders, and the great weight of them likewise held

These fires of our trial may be corrective, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of the remaining power of sin, and they are
so intended; but Jesus Christ alone in the sufferings of
his own Cross, was the burnt offering, <hi>the propitiation
for our sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now although he hath perfectly satisfied for us and
saved us by his sufferings; yet this conformity with
him in way of suffering, is most reasonable. As our
holiness doth not stand in point of law, nor come in at
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:104216:187"/>
all in the matter of justifying us, yet we are called and
appointed to holiness in Christ, as suiting us with him
our glorious head, and we do really receive it from him,
that we may be like him, so these our sufferings bear
a very congruous likeness with him; though no way
as accession to his in expiation, yet as a part of his:
and therefore the Apostle says, even in this respect,
that we are <hi>predestinate to be conformed to the Image of
his Son;</hi> were it fit that we should not follow, where
our Captain led, and went first, but that he should lead
through ragged thorny ways, and we pass about to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
through flow'ry meadows: as his natural body sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with his head in his sufferings, so ought his mystical
with him, as its head. The buffetings and spitings on
his face, and thorny crown on his head, a pierced
side, nailed hands and feet, and if we be parts of
him, think we that a body finding nothing but ease and
bathing in delights were agreeable to a head so torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">[Nolo aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ubi Christus spineam]</note>

more they are seen and lookt on by the Worlds eye,
the more meanness appears; true, that as in the days of
humiliation some rays were breaking forth through the

thus is it with his followers sometimes a glance
of his Image strikes the very eye of the World, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
some acknowledgment and a kind of reverence in
the ungodly: But commonly Christ and his followers
are covered with all the disgraces and ignominies the
World can put on them. But there is a day wherein

                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> says the Apostle, <hi>ye shall rejoyce with</hi> exceeding
<hi>joy,</hi> and to the end you may not fall short of that Joy
in the participance of Glory, fall not back from a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
progress in the Communion of these sufferings,
that are so close linked with it, and will so sure lead
unto it and end it. For in this the Apostles expression;
this Glory and Joy is set before them as the great matter
of their desires, and hopes, and the certain end of their
present sufferings.</p>
                  <p>Now upon these grounds the motion will appear
reasonable, and not too great a demand, <hi>to rejoyce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the sufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true that passage in the Epistle to the <hi>Heb.</hi>
opposes present Affliction to Joy. But 1. If you mark,
it is but in the appearance or outward visage, <hi>it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to be matter of joy but of grief</hi> To look to it, it
hath not a smiling countenance, yet joy may be under
it.</p>
                  <p>(2.) And though to the flesh, it is, what it seems,
grief, and not joy, yet there may be under it spiritual joy,
yea the affliction it self may help and advance that joy.
(3.) Through the natural sense of it there will be some
allay or mixture of grief, so that the joy cannot be
pure and compleat, but yet there may be joy even in it.
Thus the Apostle here clearly gives, rejoyce now in
suffering that you may rejoyce exceedingly after it,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>leaping for joy:</hi> doubtles this joy at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:104216:188"/>
'tis joy, but more reserved, then <hi>they shall leap.</hi> Yet</p>
                  <p>In present rejoyce even in <hi>trial,</hi> yea in <hi>fiery trial.</hi> This
may be; the Children of God are not called to so sad a life
as the World imagines, besides what is laid up, they have
even here their rejoycings and Songs in their distresses, as
those Prisoners had their Psalms even at midnight after
their stripes in their chains, before they knew of a sudden
deliverance, true there may be a darkness within, clouding
all the matter of their joy; but even that darkness is the
feed time of after joy, and light is sown in that darkness,
and shall spring up, and not only shall they have a rich
crop at full harvest, but even some first fruits of it here,
in pledge of the harvest.</p>
                  <p>And this they ought to expect, and seek after with
humble submissive minds, for the measure and time of
it, that they may be partakers of spiritual joy, and may
by it be enabled to go patiently, yea cheerfully through
the tribulations and tentations that be in their way
homeward; and for this, endeavour after a more clear
discerning of their interest in Christ, that they may
know they partake of him, and so in suffering, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his sufferings, and shall be partakers of his
Glory.</p>
                  <p>Many afflictions will not cloud and obstruct this so
much, as one sin, therefore if ye would walk cheerfully
be most careful to walk holily. All the winds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
make not an earthquake, but that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                  <p>Now this joy is grounded on this Communion.
(1.) Sufferings; then 2. In Glory 1. In suffering even
in themselves, it is a sweet joyful thing to be a sharer
with Christ in any thing, all enjoyments wherein he is

his afflictions sweeter than their pleasures, his reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

rich than their treasures, as <hi>Moses</hi> accompted them,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Love delights in likeness and Communion,
not only in things otherwise pleasant, but in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and harshest things, that have not any thing in
them desireable but only that likeness; so that this is
very sweet to a heart possest with this love; what
does the World in hatreds, and persecutions, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
for Christ, but make me more like him, give
me a greater share with him, in that which he did so
willingly undergo for me. <hi>When he was sought to be a King,
he escaped; but when he was sought to the Cross, he freely
yielded himself.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bern.</note> And shall I shrink and creep back from
what he calls me to for his sake; yea even all my other
troubles and sufferings I will desire to have stampt thus,
with this conformity to the sufferings of Christ, in the

up my will to my fathers.</p>
                  <p>The following of Christ makes any way pleasant,
his faithful followers refuse no march after him, be it
through deserts, and Mountains, and Storms, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards

kindled and acted with the Spirit of Christ will follow
him wheresoever he goeth.</p>
                  <p>As he speaks it for warnings, <hi>if they persecuted me, they
will persecute you,</hi> so he speaks it for comforting them,
and it is sufficiently so, <hi>if they hate you, they hated me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Then add the other, see whether it tends, <hi>he

Therefore rejoyce now in the midst of all your suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;

what zeal for God? what invincible courage against
all encounters? How soon will this pageant of the World
vanish, that Men are gazing on, these pictures and
fancies of false stiled pleasures, and honours, and give
place to the real glory of the Sons of God, this

all his Brethren in glory with him; all cloathed in their

and encouragements for <hi>doing, or
suffering,</hi> and this Epistle is rich in both: here
what the Apostle said in suffering, he specifies in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
suffering of <hi>reproaches,</hi> but this seems not to
come up to the height of that expression he hath used;
he spoke of <hi>fiery trial,</hi> but that of <hi>reproach</hi> seems rather
fit to be called an airy trial, the blast of vanishing words.
Yet upon trial, it will be found to be, as here it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,
a very sharp, <hi>a fiery trial,</hi> first then of this
particular kind of suffering. 2. Of the comfort and
advice furnisht against it.</p>
                  <p>If we consider both the nature of the thing, and
the strain of the Scriptures we will find, that reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:104216:190"/>
are amongst the sharpest sort of sufferings, and
are indeed <hi>fiery trials, the tongue is a fire,</hi> says St. <hi>Iames,</hi>
and reproaches are the flashes of that fire, they are a
a subtile kind of flame, like that lightening, that they
say crusheth the bones, and yet breaks not the flesh,
they wound not the body, as tortures and whips:
but through a whole skin, they reach the spirit of a
Man, and cut it. so <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 10. The fire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
preys upon, and dryes up the <hi>precious oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of a good name, as <hi>Solomon</hi> compares it. A good
name is in it self a good, a prime outward good, and
take us according to our natural temper and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
(according to which we feel things) most Men
are, and some more excessively, too tender and delicate
in it. Although truly I take this rather to be a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
than true greatness of spirit, as they fancy it,
to depend much on the opinion of others, and feel it
deep, yet I say, considering it to be commonly thus
with Men, and the rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Children of God, it cannot well be, but reproaches
will ordinarily much afflict Men, and to some kind of
Spirits possibly, be more grievous than some bodily
pain or suffering.</p>
                  <p>And as they are thus, the Scripture accounts them so,
and very usually reckons them amongst sufferings, and
readily names them more than any other kind of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and multitude, and some things we suffer, do (as flies)
more trouble by their number than by their

                  <p>Now there is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ãâã</desc>
                     </gap> kind of suffering of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
and commonness, and abundance as reproaches
are. When other periecutions cease, yet those continue
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:104216:191"/>
when all other Martyr fires are put out, these burn
still; in all times and places the malignant World
ready to revile Religion, not only avowed enemies of
it, but the greatest part even of those that make a
vulgar profession of it, they that outwardly receive the
form of Religion, yet are many of them inwardly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the power of it; and Christians so called will
scorn and reproach these that are so indeed.</p>
                  <p>And this is done with such ease by every one, that
these arrows fly thick; every one that hath a tongue
can shoot them, even base <hi>Abjects, Psal.</hi> 35. And the
<hi>drunkards make songs,</hi> as <hi>Ieremy</hi> complains, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
sort can reach this point of persecution, and be
active in it against the Children of God; they that
cannot, or dare not offer them any other injury, will
not fear, nor spare to let fly a taunt, or bitter word,
so that whereas other sufferings are rarer, these meet
them daily, <hi>Psalm. 42 10. While they say daily unto
me where is thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We see how justly reproaches are often mentioned
amongst, and beyond other trials; and accounted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
<hi>Matth. 5. 10, 11. Blessed are ye when Men shall
revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of
evil against you falsly, for my sake,</hi> Gal. 4. 29. <hi>But as
then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
was born after the Spirit, even so is it now.</hi> And in the
History all we find is, he mockt him. And thus are
they amongst the sufferings of Christ in the Gospel,
and not as the least, the raylings and mockings darted
at him, fixed to the cross, more than the very nails
that fixed him. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. The <hi>shame</hi> of
the cross though he was above it and despised it, yet
that shame of it, was much of the burden, so <hi>ver. 3.
Contradiction of sinners.</hi>

Now the other thing is, that this is the lot of
Christians, as it was of Christ, and why should they
they look for more kindness, and better usage, and
think to find acclamations, and applauses from the
World, that so vilisy'd their Lord. Oh no; The vain
heart must be weaned from these to follow Christ, if
we will indeed follow him; it must be tamed to share
with him in this point of suffering, not only mistakes
and misconstructions, but bitter scoffings, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Why should not our minds ply and fold to this
upon that very reason, he so reasonably presses again
and again, on his Disciples. <hi>The servant is not greater
than his master,</hi> and in this very thing, <hi>if they called the

                     <hi>Ins.</hi> 1. Seeing its thus, I shall first press upon the
followers of Christ, the Apostles rule here, to keep
their sufferings spotless, that it may not be comfortless,

wickedness are most unsuiting our holy calling, look to
the enmity about you, and gain even out of that evil

your own weakness, and the Worlds wickedness.
This our Saviour represents, and upon it gives that

as Doves.</hi> Know you not what exact eyes of others
are upon you; will you not thence learn exactly to eye
your selves, and all your ways, and seek of God with
<hi>David, to be led in righteousness, because of your enemies,
your observers.</hi>

holily, and blamelessly, that the enemy may not know
where to fasten his hold; as the wrestlers anointed
their bodies, that the hands of their party might not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten

                  <p>I recommend therefore to you that love the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
this especially, to be careful, that all your reproaches
may be indeed for Christ, and not for any thing in
you unlike to Christ, that there be nothing save the
matter of your rod; keep the quarrel as clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt

both within, and without, in the peace and firmness

Think this is blameworthy, yet let me not turn it to the

                  <p>My Brethren, beware of sharing with the ungodly
in this tongue persecution of Christians. There is a
Day at hand wherein the Lord will make enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those things, if we shall be made accountable for
<hi>idle words</hi> (as we are warned) how much more
for bitter malicious words uttered against any, especially
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:104216:193"/>
against the Saints of God, whom however the World
reckon, he esteems his precious ones, his treasure.
You that now can look on them with a scornful eye,
which way shall you look when they shall be beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and glorious, and all the ungodly cloathed with
shame? Oh! do not reproach them, but rather come in
and share with them in the way of holiness, and in all
the sufferings and reproaches that follow it: for if you
partake of their disgraces with them, you shall share
of glory with them, in the Day of their Lords appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The words have two things. The <hi>evil</hi> of these reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
suppos'd, and the <hi>good</hi> exprest. The <hi>evil</hi> suppos'd,
that they are trials and hot trials: of this already. The
<hi>good</hi> exprest: ye are happy, even in present, in the
very midst of them; they do not trouble your happy
estate; yea they advance it.</p>
                  <p>Thus solid indeed is the happiness of the Saints that
in the lowest condition, it remains the same: disgraces
caves, prisons, and chains, cast them where you will,
still happy: a Diamond in the mire foyled and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
on yet still retains its own worth.</p>
                  <p>But this is more, that the very things that seem to
make them miserable, do not only not do that, but
on the contrary do make them the more happy
they are gainers by their losses, and attain more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
by their thraldomes, and more honour by their
disgraces, and more peace by their troubles: the World
and all their enemies are exceedingly befool'd in stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with them, not only can they not undo them,
but by all their enmity and practises, they do them
pleasure, and raise them higher; with what weapons
shall they fight? How shall they set upon a Christian,
that are his enemy? where shall they hit them,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:104216:193"/>
seeing all the wrongs they do him, do indeed enrich
and ennoble him; and the more he is deprest, he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
the more: certainly the blessedness of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is matchless and invincible.</p>
                  <p>But how holds this, <hi>Happy in reproaches and by them,</hi>
'tis not through their nature and vertue, for they are
evil, so <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20. But (1.) By reason of the Cause.
(2.) Of the accompanying and consequent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p>First the Cause. <hi>Negatively,</hi> we have it <hi>verse 15.

                  <p>But for <hi>the name of Christ,</hi> and what is there so
rough, that that will not make pleasant, to suffer with
Christ and for Christ, who suffered so much and so
willingly for thee? hath he not gone through all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

sweetned poverty, and persecutions, and hatred, and
disgraces, and death it self? per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and turn'd it from a pit of horrour into a sweet resting

that is for him, is glad to meet with difficulties, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of suffering for him: scorn and contempt a thing
of hard digestion; but much inward heat of love di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
it easily, reproaches bitter, but the reproaches of
Christ sweet. Take their true value, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. The
reproaches of Christ greater riches than the treasures
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> his very worst things, better than the best
of the World. A touch of Christ turns all into gold;
his reproaches <hi>riches,</hi> as there, and <hi>honour,</hi> as here:
Happy not only afterwards, ye shall be happy, but
happy in present, and that not only in apprehension
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:104216:194"/>
of that after happiness, as sure and as already present,
which Faith doth; but even for that they possess
the presence and comforts of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Spirit of Glory.</hi>] This accompanies disgraces
for him; his Spirit, <hi>the Spirit of Glory and of God;</hi>
with your suffering goes the name of Christ, and the
Spirit of Christ: take them thus, when reproaches are
cast upon you for his name, and you bear them by
his Spirit, and his Spirit most fit to support you under
them, yea to raise you above them; they are ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
and inglorious, he is the Spirit of glory; they are
humane reproaches, he the Divine Spirit, <hi>the Spirit
of Glory and of God,</hi> that is, the glorious Spirit of
God.</p>
                  <p>And this is the advantage, the less the Christian finds
esteem and acceptance in the World, the more he
turns inward to see what's there, and there he finds
a down weight counterpoise of excellency and glory,
even in this present condition, as the pledge of the
glory before him. The reproaches be fiery, but the
<hi>Spirit of glory resteth upon you,</hi> doth not give you a
passing visit, but stays within you, and is indeed
yours. And in this he can take comfort, and let the
foul weather blow over, let all the scoffs, and contempts
abroad pass as they come, having a glorious Spirit
within, such a guest honouring him with his presence,
and abode, and sweet fellowship, and is indeed one
with him. So that rich Miser could say; when they
scorned him in the streets,<note place="margin">[Papulus me sib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and huggs himself there at that sight, say they what
they would. How much more reasonably may the
Christian say, <hi>let them revile and bark, I have riches,
and honour enough, that they see not.</hi> And this is it makes
the World, as they are a malicious party, so to be an
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:104216:194"/>
incompetent Judge of the Christians estate; they see
the rugged unpleasant outside only, the right inside,
their eye cannot reach. We were miserable indeed,
were our comforts such as they could see.</p>
                  <p>And as this is the constant estate of a Christian, it is
usually most manifested to him in the time of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
sufferings, then (as we said) he readily turns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and sees it most, and accordingly finds it most.
God making this happy supplement and compensation,
that when they have least of the World, they have
most of himself, when they are most covered with the
World's disfavour, this favour shines brightest to them,
as <hi>Moses</hi> in the Cloud, in nearest access and speech with
God; when the Christian is most clouded with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
and disgraces, then doth the Lord often shew
himself most clearly to him.</p>
                  <p>If you be indeed Christians, you will not be so much
thinking at any time, how you may be free from all
sufferings and despisings; but rather how you may go
strongly and cheerfully through them; so here is the
way, seek real and firm interest in Christ, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipance
of Christ's Spirit, and then a look to him will
make all easie and delightful. Thou wilt be ashamed
within thy self to start back, or give one foot at the
encounter of a taunt, or reproach for him; thou wilt
think for whom is it, is it not for him who for my sake
hid not his face from shame and spitting? and further
he died; now how would I meet death for him, that
shrink at the blast of a scornful word?</p>
                  <p>If you would know whether this his Spirit is and
resteth in you, it cannot be better known than by that
very love, ardent love to him, and high esteem of
him; and from thence a willingness, yea a gladness
to suffer any thing for him. 2. This <hi>Spirit of Glory</hi>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:104216:195"/>
sets the heart on glory; true glory makes heavenly
things excellent in our thoughts, and sets the World,
the better and worse, the honour and dishonour of it,
at a low rate.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of the World is a base ignoble Spirit, even
the highest pitch of it, those that are projecting for
Kingdoms, these are poor designs to that of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
which ascend above all things under the Sun,
and above the Sun it self, and therefore he is not shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
with threats, nor taken with offers in these things.
Excellent is that answer St. <hi>Basil</hi> gives in the person
of those Martyrs to that Emperour, as making them
(as he thought) great profers to draw them off, why,
say they, <hi>doest thou bid us so low as pieces of the World,
we have learnt to despise it all.</hi> This is not stupid, nor
an affected stoutness of Spirit, but a humble sublime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that the natural Spirit of a Man cannot reach
unto.</p>
                  <p>But wilt thou say still, this stops me, I do not find
this Spirit in me, if I did, then I think I could be willing
to suffer any thing. To this for present no more but

holds in them that profess his name, and are of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:104216:197"/>
Church, compared with them that are without the
pale of it, and are its avowed enemies. (2.) Those that
profess a desire of more religious, and holy course of
life within the Church compared with the profane
multitude. (3.) They that are indeed more Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and holy, and come nearer unto God, compared
with others that fall short of that measure, in all it
holds that the Lord doth more readily exercise them
with afflictions, and correct their wandrings than any
other.</p>
                  <p>And this truly is most reasonable, and the reason
lies in the very name given the Church, <hi>The House of
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The sins of the Church have their peculiar aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
that fall not upon others, that, which is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a sin in strangers to God, is in his people the breach
of a known and received law, and a law daily unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and set before them, yea its against their Oath of
Allegiance, 'tis perfidie and breach of Covenant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
both against the clearest light, and strictest bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ds,
and highest mercies, and still the more particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his name, and testimonies of his love, make
sin the more sinful, and the punishment of it the more
reasonable. The sins of the Church are all twice dipt
<hi>Dibapha, Isa.</hi> 1. Have a double die, they are once
breach of the law, and they are again, ungrate and disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
breach of promise.</p>
                  <p>2. As there is unquestionable equity, so there is
an evident congruity in it. God is ruler of all the
World, but particularly of his Church, therefore here
called <hi>his House,</hi> wherein he hath a special residence
and presence. And therefore most suitable, that there
he be specially observed and obey'd, and if disobey'd
that he take notice of it and punish it, that he suffer
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:104216:198"/>
not himself to be dishonour'd to his face by those of
his own House; and therefore whosoever escape, his
own shall not Amos 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the
Families of the Earth: therefore will I punish you for all
your iniquities.</hi> He that righteously judges and rules
all Nations, it is fit he make his Justice most evident
and exemplary in his own House, where it may best
be remarkt, and where it will best appear how impartial
he is in punishing sin; so a King, as the Psalmist,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 101. that he may rule the Land well, makes his
own House exemplary. It is you know one special
qualification of a Bishop and Pastor, 1 Tim. 3. 4. <hi>One
that ruleth well his own House, having his Children in
subjection. For if a Man know not how to rule his own
House, how shall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> Now
this therefore more eminently appears in the Supream
Lord of the Church, as his own House; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he finds disobedience there, he will first
punish that: so he clears himself; and the wicked
World being afterward punisht, their mouths are stopt
with the preceding punishment of the Church;
he will not spare his own; yea, they shall be first
scourged? <hi>what then shall be the end,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the purity of his Nature, if it be every
where contrary to all sinful impurity, it cannot but
most appear in his peculiar dwelling House, that he
will have neat and clean. If he hate sin all the
World over, where its nearest him he hates it most,
and testifies his hatred of it; will not endure it in
his presence: as cleanly neat persons, cannot well look
upon any thing that is nasty, much less will they
suffer it come near them, or touch them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in their presence in the House where they dwell;
the Lord <hi>that is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</hi> will
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:104216:198"/>
not abide it within his own doors; and the nearer any
comes to him, the less can he endure any unholiness
or sinful pollution in them, <hi>he will be sanctified in all
that come nigh him,</hi> Lev. 10. so in his Ministers; Oh!
how pure ought they to be, and how provoking and
hateful to him are their impurities: therefore in that
commission to the Destroyers, <hi>Ezek</hi> 9. 20. to which
place the Apostle may here have some eye; <hi>Go,</hi> says he,
<hi>slay the old and young, and begin at my sanctuary.</hi> They
were they that had polluted his worship, and there the
first stroke lighted. And in a Spiritual Sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all his People are his only elect Priesthood, and
should be <hi>holiness to the Lord;</hi> and when they are not
really so; do not sanctifie him in their walking; he
sanctifies himself, declares his holiness in his Judgments
on them.</p>
                  <p>3. Mercy, in this, even under the habit of Judgment,
love walks secretly and works; so loving and so wise
a Father will not undo his Children by sparing the
rod; but <hi>because he loves, rebukes and chastens, Heb. 12.
Prov. 3. 11. Apoc.</hi> 3. His Church, his House, therefore that
he may delight in it, and take pleasure to dwell in it,
and make it happy with his presence, he will have
it often washed, and made clean, and the filth and
rubbish scoured and purged out of it: this argues his
gracious purpose of abiding in it.</p>
                  <p>And as he doth it, that he may delight in his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
so that they may delight in him, and in him alone,
imbiters the World's Breast to wean them; makes
the World hate them, that they may the more easily
hate it; suffers them not to settle upon it, and fall
into a complacency with it; makes it unpleasant to
them by many and sharp afflictions, that they with
the more willingness may come off, and be united;
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:104216:199"/>
and that they may remember home the more, and
seek their comforts above, finding so little below, may
turn in to him, and delight themselves in communion
with him. That their prayers may ascend the more
thick, that sweet incense, he kindles these fires of trial to
them; for though it should not be so, yet so it is,
that in times of ease they would grow readily remiss
and formal that way.</p>
                  <p>He is gracious and wise, knows what he does with
them, and the thoughts he thinks towards them is all
for their advantage, purging their iniquities, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.
purges out impatience, and earthliness, and self-will,
and carnal security, and thus refines them for Vessels
of Honour; we see in a Jewellers Shop, that as there
are Pearls and Diamonds, and other precious Stones;
there are Files, cutting Instruments, and many sharp
Tools for their polishing: and while they are in the
Work-house they are continual Neighbours to them,
and come often under them. The Church is God's
Jewelry, his Work house, where his Jewels are a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
for his Palace, and House, and those he especially
esteems and means to make most resplendent, he hath
oftenest his Tools upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thus observe it, as the Church to other Societies, so
in it a Congregation or Family, one more diligently
seeking after God than the rest, they shall readily meet
with more trials, and be oftener under affliction than
any of the Company; either under contempt and
scorn, or poverty and sickness, or some one pressure or
other, outward or inward, and those inward trials are
the nearest and sharpest that the World sees least, and
yet the Soul feels most: And yet all these both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and inward have love, unspeakable love in them
all, to purge and polish them by increasing of Grace to
fit them for Glory.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Inf.</hi> 1. We will not be so foolish as to promise our
selves impunity by our relation to God, as his Church in
covenant with him; if once we thought so, sure our
experience hath undeceived us, and let not what we
have suffered harden us, as if the worst were past, we
may rather fear its but a pledge and beginning of sharper
Judgment? why do we not consider our unhumbled
and unpurged condition, and tremble before the Lord?
would we save him a labour, he would take it well,
purge our Souls, that he may not be put to further
purging by new Judgments; were we busie reading
our present condition, we would see very legible
foresigns of further Judgments, the Lord taking away
his eminent and worthy Servants, that are as the very
Pillars of the Publick Peace and Welfare, and taking
away Counsel, and Courage, and Union from the rest;
forsaking us in our meetings, and leaving us in the
dark to grop and to rush one upon another.</p>
                  <p>2. The dissentions and jarrings in the State and
Church are likely upon imagination to bring it to a
reality; these unnatural burnings threaten new fires of
publick Judgments to be kindled amongst us.</p>
                  <p>3. That general despising of the Gospel, and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of prophaneness throughout the Land, not yet
purged, but our great sin remaining in us, calls for more
fire and more boiling.</p>
                  <p>4. The general coldness and deadness of Spirit, want
of that zeal for God, that communion of Saints; that
mutual stirring up one another to Holiness, and which is
to all, the restoring of Prayer, that frozen benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medness
in that so necessary Work; that preventer of
Judgments; that binder of the hands of God from
punishments, and opener of them unto them, pouring
forth of mercies; Oh! this is a sad condition in it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:104216:200"/>
though it portended no further Judgment, the
Lord hiding himself, and the Spirit of Zeal and Prayer
withdrawn, and scarce any lamenting it, or so much as
perceiving it: where our days either of solemn Prayer
or Praises, as if cause of neither, and yet clear cause of
both. Truly <hi>M. B.</hi> we have need if ever to bestir our
selves; are not the Kingdoms at this present brought
to the extream point of their highest hazard, and yet
who lays it to heart.</p>

                     <hi>Inf.</hi> 2. Learn to give God right construction in all
his dealings with his Church, and with thy Soul; for
his Church, there may be a time wherein thou shall
see it not only tossed; but, to thy thinking, covered
and swallowed up with tears; but wait a little it
shall arrive safe. This common stumbling stone,
walk by the light of the Word, and the eye of Faith
looking on it, and thou shalt pass by, and not stumble
at it, the Church mourns, and <hi>Babylon</hi> sings, sits as
a Queen, but for how long; she shall come down
and sit in the dust, and <hi>Zion</hi> shall be glorious, and
put on her beautiful Garments, and <hi>Babylon</hi> shall not
look for another revelation to raise her again, no,
she shall never rise. The Angel took up a Stone like
a great Milstone, and cast it into the Sea, saying,
<hi>Thus with violence shall the great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown
down, and shall be found no more at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be not sudden, take God's work together, do not
judge of it by parcels; it is indeed all Wisdom and
Righteousness; but we shall best discern the beauty of
it when we look on it in the frame, and when it shall
be fully compleated and finisht, and our eyes enlightned
to take a fuller and clearer view of it, than we can
have here; Oh! what wonder? what endless wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will it command?</p>

We read of <hi>Ioseph</hi> hated, and sold, and imprison'd,
and all most unjustly; but because within a leaf or
two, we find him freed and exalted, and his Brethren
coming Supplicants to him, we are satisfied: but the
things that are for the present cloudy and dark, our
short hasty Spirits cannot learn to wait a little till we
see the other side, and what end the Lord makes; we
see <hi>Iudgment beginning at the House of God,</hi> and this
perplexes us, while we consider not the rest, what <hi>shall
be the end of them that obey not the Gospel?</hi> God begins
the Judgment on his Church for a little time, that it
may end and rest upon his enemies for ever. And
indeed he leaves the wicked last in the punishment;
so as he makes use of them for the punishing of his
Church, they are <hi>his rod, Isa.</hi> 10. But then when he
hath done that work with them, they are <hi>broken and
burnt,</hi> v. 16. and that when they are at the height of
insolency and boasting, not knowing what hand moves
them, and smites his People with them for a while, <hi>till
the da, of their consuming come,</hi> v. 24, 25. let the vile
enemy that hath shed our blood, and insulted over us
rejoyce in their present sparing, and in mens procuring
of it, and pleading for it; there is another hand
whence we may look for Justice, and though it may
be the Judgment begun at us, is not yet ended, and
that we may yet further (and that justly) find them
our scourge, yet certainly we may, and ought to look
beyond that unto the end of the Lord's work, which
shall be the ruin of his Enemies, and the peace of his
People, and the glory of his Name</p>

                     <hi>Of them that obey not the Gospel</hi>] The end of all the
Ungodly is terrible; but especially of such as heard the
Gospel, and have not received and obey'd it.</p>
                  <p>The Word hath in it both Unbelief and Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:104216:201"/>
and these are inseparable, Unbelief is the grand
point of Disobedience in it self, and the spring of all
other disobedience: and the pity is, men will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it to be thus.</p>
                  <p>They think it an easie, and a common thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
who doth not believe? Oh! but rather, who
does? <hi>who hath believed our report?</hi> were our own mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and the happiness that is in Christ believed, were the
riches of Christ, and the love of Christ believed, would
not this perswade men to forsake their sins, and the
World to embrace him?</p>
                  <p>But men run away with an extraordinary fancy of
believing, and do not deeply consider what news the
Gospel brings, and how much it concerns them: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it may be they have a sudden thought of it,
and they think, I will think on it better at some other
time; but when comes that time; one business steps in
after another and shuffles it out: Men are not at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to be saved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Gospel of God.</hi>] His embassy of Peace of Men,
the riches of his mercy and free love opened up and set
forth, not simply to be lookt on, but laid hold on.
The glorious holy God declaring his mind of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Man in his own Son; his blood streaming
forth in it to wash away uncleanness, and yet this
Gospel not obeyed. Sure the conditions of it very hard,
and the commands must be grievous, that they are not
hearkened to; why, judge you if they be. The great
command is that, to receive that Salvation; and the
other is this, to love that Saviour, and there is no
more; perfect obedience is not now the thing, and
the obedience that is required, that love makes it
sweet and easie to us, and acceptable to him. This is
proclaimed to all that hear the Gospel, and the greatest
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:104216:201"/>
part refuse it, they love themselves, and their lusts, and
this present World, and will not change, and so they perish.</p>
                  <p>They perish? what's that? what is their end? I will
answer that but as the Apostle doth, and that is even
asking the question over again, <hi>what shall be their end?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no speaking of it<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> a Curtain drawn; silent
wonder expresses it best, telling it cannot be exprest;
how then shall it be endured? It is true, that there be
resemblances used in Scripture, giving us some glance
of it; we hear of a burning Lake, a Fire that goes not
out, and a Worm that dies not; but these are but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
to the real misery of them that obey not the
Gospel; Oh! to be filled with the wrath of God, the
ever living God for ever. What words or thoughts
can reach it? Oh! Eternity, Eternity; Oh! that we
did believe it.</p>

the ungodly and sinner appear?</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IT is true then, that they are scarce saved, even
they that endeavour to walk uprightly in the ways
of God, that's the Righteous; here they are scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saved. That imports not any uncertainty or hazard
in the thing it self to the end, in respect of the purpose,
and performance of God: but only the great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and hard encounters in the way, that they go
through so many tribulations and tentations, so many
fightings without, and fears within: the Christian so
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:104216:202"/>
simple and weak, and his enemies so crafty, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>The Oppositions of the wicked World, their hatreds,
and scorns, and molestations, the flights and violence
of Satan, and the worst of all, the strength of their own
corruptions. And by reason of abounding corruption,
such frequent, almost continual need of purging by
afflictions and trials; to be still under Physick; to be
of necessity at sometimes drained and brought so low,
till there is scarce strength or life remaining in
them.</p>
                  <p>And truely all outward difficulties would be but
matter of ease, would be as nothing, were it not
the incumberance of lusts, and corruptions within;
were a man to meet disgraces and sufferings for Christ,
how easily would he go through them, yea, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in them, were he rid of the fretting impatience,
the pride, and self-love of his own carnal heart; these
clog and trouble worst, and he cannot shake them off,
nor prevail against them without much pains, many
prayers and tears; and many times after much wrestling,
scarce finds that he hath gained any ground; yea,
sometimes is foiled and thrown by them.</p>
                  <p>And so in all other duties such a fighting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
combate with a revolting backsliding heart;
the flesh pulling, and dragging downwards, when he
would mount up, finds himself as a Bird with a stone
tied to its foot, hath Wings that flutter to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but is pressed down with the weight fastened
to him; what struggling with wandrings and deadness
in hearing, and reading, and prayer: and that which
is most grievous, that by their unwary walking, and
the prevailing of some corruption, they sadden the
Spirit of God and provoke him to hide his face,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:104216:202"/>
and withdraw his comforts. How much pain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any thing, any particular grace of humility, or
meekness, or self-denial; and if any thing attained, how
hard to keep and maintain it against the contrary party;
how often driven back to their old point? if they do
but cease from striving a little, they are carried back
by the stream: and what returns of doubtings and
misbelief, after they thought they were got somewhat
above them; in so much that sometimes they are at
the point of giving over, and thinking it will never be
for them: and yet through all those are they brought
safe home, there is another strength that bears them
up, and brings them through: but yet these things,
and many more of this nature argue the difficulty of
their course, and that it is not so easie a thing to come
to Heaven as most imagine it.</p>

                  <p>And if the way of the Righteous be so hard, then
how hard shall be the end of the ungodly and sinner
that walks in sin with delight; it were strange if they

of your Soul, and that he accept of it, and take it off

ways; walk so as you discredit not your protector and
move him to be ashamed of you, and disclaim you.
Shall it be said you live under his shelter and walk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately?
as this cannot well be, you cannot well
believe it to be: loose ways will loosen your hold of
him and confidence in him; you will be driven to
question your interest, and to think, sure I do but delude
my self; can I be under his safeguard, and yet follow
the course of the World, and my corrupt heart, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be it who will, he will not be a guardian and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:104216:204"/>
of wickedness. No, <hi>he is not a God that hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in iniquity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ps. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>nor shall evil dwell with him.</hi> If thou
give thy Soul to him to keep upon terms of liberty to
sin, he will turn it out of his Doors, and remit it back
to thee to look to, as thou wilt thy self; yea, in the
ways of sin, thou dost indeed steel it back and carriest
it out from him; thou puttest thy self; out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of his defence; goest without the trenches, and
art at thine own hazard, expos'd to armies of mischiefs
and miseries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inf.</hi> This then is primely to be lookt to, you that
would have safety in God in evil times, beware of evil
ways: for in these it cannot be: if you will be safe in
him, you must stay with him, and in all your ways
keep within him, as your fortress; now in the wayes of
sin you run out from him.</p>
                  <p>Hence 'tis we have so little establisht confidence in God
in times of trial, we take ways of our own, and will
be gadding, and so we are surprized and taken, as they
that are often venturing out into the enemies reach,
and cannot stay within the walls; 'tis no idle repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Psal. 91. 1. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the
most high, shall abide under the shaddow of the Almighty.
He</hi> that wanders not out but stays there, shall find
himself there hid from danger. They that rove out
from God in their ways, are disquieted and tossed with
fears; this is the fruit of their own ways; but the
Soul that is indeed given to him<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to keep, keeps near
him.</p>
                  <p>Study pure and holy walking, if you would have
your confidence firm, and have boldness and joy in
God: you will find it, that a little sin will shake your
trust, and disturb your peace more than the greatest
sufferings, yea in those your assurance and joy in God
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:104216:204"/>
will grow and abound most, if sin be kept out, that's
the trouble feast, that unquiets the Conscience, which
while it continues good, is a continual feast, so much
sin as gets in, so much peace will go out; afflictions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
break in upon it to break it, but sin doth. All the
winds that blow about the Earth from all points stir it
not; only that within the bowels of it makes the
Earthquake.</p>
                  <p>I do not mean that for infirmities a Christian ought to
be discouraged; but take heed of walking in any way
of sin: for that will unsettle thy confidence: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
and holy walking makes the Soul of a
sound constitution, that the counter blasts of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wear not out, nor alter it not; sin makes it
sickly, and crazy, that it can endure nothing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
study to keep your Consciences pure, and they shall
be peacable, yea in the worst times readily most peacable
and best furnisht with spiritual confidence and comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commit the keeping of their Souls.</hi>] The Lord is an
entire protectot, he keeps the bodies, yea all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the believer, and as much as is good for him;
makes all safe, keeps all his bones, not one of them is
broken; yea says our Saviour <hi>the very hairs of your
head are numbered</hi> But that which is in the Believers
account, and in Gods account, so certainly in it self
most precious, is principally committed and received
into keeping, <hi>their Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They would gladliest be secured in that here, that
shall be safe in the midst of all hazards. That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
be lost, that may not, that's the Jewel, therefore
the prime care of that, if it be safe all is well, 'tis riches
enough? <hi>What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole
World,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>and lose his Soul?</hi> and so what
shall it disprofit a Man, though he lose the whole World,
if he gain his Soul. Nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:104216:205"/>
When times of trial come, Oh! what a bustle to
hide this and that, to fly, and carry away, and make safe
that which is but trash and rubbish to the precious
Soul, but how few thoughts of that? were we in our
wits, that would be all at all times, not only in
trouble, but in days of peace. Oh! how shall I make
sure about my Soul; let all go as it may, can I be
secured and perswaded in that point, I desire no more,</p>
                  <p>Now the way is this, commit them to God, this many
say, but few do, give them into his hand, lay them
up there; so the word is, and they are safe and may be
quiet and composed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In patience possess your Souls,</hi> says our Saviour; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
freting Souls are out of themselves, their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
do not possess them. Now the way to possess them
our selves in patience, is thus, to commit them to him
in confidence, then we only possess them, when he
keeps them. They are easily disquieted and shakt in
peices while they are in our hands; but in his hand
they are above the reach of dangers and fears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inf.</hi> Now this is the proper act of Faith, rolls the
Soul over on God, ventures it in his hand, and rests
satisfied concerning it, being there. And there is no
way but this, to be quiet within, to be impregnable,
and unmoveable in all assaults and changes fixed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
on free love; therefore be perswaded to resolve
in that, not doubting and disputing, whether shall I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
or no; shall I think he will suffer me to lay my
soul upon him to keep? so unworthy, so guilty a
Soul, were it not presumption; Oh! what saist thou?
why doest thou thus dishonour him, and disquiet thy
self; if thou hast a purpose to walk in any way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
indeed thou art not for him; yea, thou comest not
near him<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to give him thy Soul; but wouldest thou have
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:104216:205"/>
it delivered from sin, rather then from trouble, yea rather
than from hell; is that the chief safety thou seekest, to be
kept from iniquity, from thine iniquity, thy beloved sins;
doest thou desire to dwell in him and walk with
him, then whatsoever is thy guiltiness, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
come forward, and give him thy Soul to
keep; if he should seem to refuse it press it on him; if
he stretch not forth his hand lay it down at his foot, and
leave it there, and resolve not to take it back;
say, Lord thou hast made us those Souls, thou cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
for them again to be committed to thee, here
is one, it is unworthy, but what Soul is not so? is
most unworthy, but therein will the riches of thy
grace appear most in receiving it, and leave it with
him; and know he will make thee a good accompt of
it. Now lose goods, or credit, or friends, or life it
self, it imports not; the main is sure if so be thy Soul
be out of hazard; <hi>I suffer these things for the Gospel,</hi>
says the Apostle,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>nevertheless I am not ashamed; why?
for I know whom I have trusted, and am perswaded that
he is able to keep that which I have committed to him
against that Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the ground of this confidence is in these two,
in him whom we trust, <hi>ability,</hi> and <hi>fidelity.</hi> There is
much in perswasion of the power of God, though few
think they question that, there is in us secret undiscove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unbelief, even in that point. Therefore the Lord
so often makes mention of it in the Prophets, <hi>Isa. 50.
3. &amp;c.</hi> And in this point the Apostle particulary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses,
<hi>I am perswaded that he is able to keep,</hi> &amp;c. So
this Apostle, <hi>chap. 1. 5. Kept by the power of God through
faith unto Salvation<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> ready to be revealed in the last time.</hi>
This very needful to be considered in regard of the many
and great oppositions and dangers, the powerful enemies
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:104216:206"/>
that seek after our Souls; <hi>He is able to keep them, for
he is stronger than all, and none can pluck them out of his
hand,</hi> says our Saviour. This the Apostle here hath in
that word (<hi>Creator,</hi>) if he was able to give them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
sure he is able to keep them from perishing. This
relation of a Creator implies likewise a benign propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and good will to the works of his hands; if he gave
them us at first, when once they were not, forming
them of nothing, will he not give us them again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put into his hand for safety.</p>
                  <p>And as he is powerful, he is no less faithful, <hi>a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Creator<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                     </hi> Truth it self. They that believe on him
he never deceives nor disappoints. Well might St. <hi>Paul</hi>
say, <hi>I know whom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap> I have trusted;</hi> Oh! the advantage
of faith. It engages the truth and power of God, his
royal Word and honour lies upon it to preserve the
Soul, that faith gives him in keeping, if he remain able
and faithful to perform his Word, that Soul shall not
perish.</p>
                  <p>There be in the words other two grounds of quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spirit in sufferings. (1.) It is according to
the will of God. The believing Soul subjected and
levelled to that complying with his good pleasure in all,
cannot have a more powerful perswasive than this, that
all is ordered by his will. This settled in the heart would
settle it much, and make it even in all things not only
to know, but wisely and deeply to consider, that it is
thus; That all is measured in Heaven; every dram of
thy troubles weighed by that skilful hand, that doth
all in weight, number, and measure.</p>
                  <p>And then consider him as thy God, and father, who
hath taken special charge of thee, and thy Soul
thou hast given it to him, and he hath received
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:104216:206"/>
And upon this consideration study to follow his will
in all, to have no will but his. This is thy duty and
thy wisdom, nothing gained by spurning and struggling
but to hurt and vex thy self; but by complying
all is gained, sweet peace; it is the very secret, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of solid peace within, to resign to his will, to
be disposed of at his pleasure without the least contrary
thought. And thus as two faced pictures, those
sufferings, and troubles, and whatsoever else to look to
it on the one side as painful to the flesh, hath an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
visage, yet go about a little, and look upon it as thy
fathers will, and then it is smiling, and beautiful, and
lovely. This I would recommend to you not only
for temporals as easier there, but in spiritual things,
your comforts and sensible enlargements, to love all he
does; its the sum of Christianity, thy will crucify'd
and the will of thy Lord thy alone desire, joy or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
sickness or health, life or death, in all, in all <hi>thy will
be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other ground is in the first word, reflecting on the
foregoing discourse <hi>Wherefore;</hi> what? seeing your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and sufferings are not endless; yea they are
short, they shall end, and quickly end, and end in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
be not troubled about them, overlook them, the
eye of faith will do it, a moment, what are they? this
is the great cause of our disquietness in present troubles
and griefs, we forget their end, we are affected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
condition of this present life, as if it were all, and
it is nothing. Oh! how quickly shall all the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and all the sufferings of this life pass away, and
be, as if they had not been.</p>

                  <p>THE Church of Christ being one body, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed
in the condition and carriage of each
particular Christian, as a part of it; but more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
in those, that are more eminent, and organick
parts of it. Therefore the Apostle, after many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
directions given to all his Christian Brethren to
whom he writes, doth most reasonably and fitly add
this express Exhortation to these, that had oversight
and charge of the rest, <hi>The Elders that are amongst

should be noted with that Wisdom and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

mind and carriage, which may give that authority, and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:104216:208"/>
command that respect, that is requisite for their calling;
not <hi>Novices,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, not as a light bladder
being easily blown up, as young unstable minds are, but
such as young <hi>Timothy</hi> was in humility and diligence, as
the Apostle testifies of him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 20. and further exhorts
him to be, 1 Tim. 4. 12. <hi>Let no man despise thy youth:
but be an example of believers in word, in conversation, in
charity, in faith, in purity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The name of Elders indifferently signifies either their
age, or their calling, and of ruling, sometimes civil
Rulers, sometimes Pastors of the Church, as amongst
the Jews both. Here it appears that Pastors are meant,
as the Exhortation of feeding the flock evidences;
which though it sometimes signifie ruling, and here
may comprise it, yet is chiefly by Doctrine; and then
the stile given to Christ in the encouragement added,
<hi>the chief Shepherd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A due frame of spirit and carriage in the Elders, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Apostles of the Church, is a thing of
prime concern for the good of it. It is one of the
heaviest threatnings, when the Lord declares that he
will give a rebellious People such Teachers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
as they deserved, and indeed desired: <hi>If there
be a man to prophecy of wine and strong drink, such a one
shall be a prophet,</hi> says he to that People. And on the
other side amongst the sweetest promises of mercy, this
is not the least, to be furnisht with plenty of faithful
Teachers. Though prophane men make no reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, yet were it in the hardest times, they that
know the Lord will account of it as he doth, a sweet
allay of all sufferings and hardship; <hi>though the Lord give
you the bread of adversity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 30. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>and the water of affliction, yet

would find it, and so people themselves receive back
their Prayers with much gain into their own bosom,

have power would be more careful of those due means,
that in Schools of learning or otherways are needful

on each Christian to another, little known amongst the

duties, so in this eminent, and exemplary in their
intercourses and converse, saying often one to another<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
Oh! let us remember to what we are called; to how
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:104216:209"/>
high and heavy a charge? to what holiness and diligence?
How great the hazard of our miscarriage, and how
great the reward of our fidelity is, whetting and
sharpening one another by those weighty and holy
considerations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And as a Witness of the suffering of Christ.</hi>] He did
indeed give witness to Christ by suffering for him the
hatred and persecutions of the World in the publishing
of the Gospel, and so was a witness and Martyr before
the time that he was put to death: and this I exclude
not, but that which is more particularly here intended
is, his certain knowledge of the sufferings of Christ,
in his own person, as an eye witness of them, and upon
that knowledge a publisher of them<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 24. 48.
And thus these two suit with the two motives, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home the exhortation. The one couch't in that,
<hi>the flock of God,</hi> v. 2. His purchase with those his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
whereof I was an eye witness. And the other
of <hi>a Crown,</hi> v. 4. I may speak the more confidently
of that, for I am one of those that have real interest in
it, and firm belief of it, <hi>a partaker of the glory that shall
be revealed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And these indeed are the things that give weight
to a Man's words, make them powerful, and pressing.

witnesses,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> that wanted that, had it supplyed

a spiritual view of Christ crucified is generally
(I will not say absolutely) necessary to make a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of Christ, but certainly very requisite for the
due witnessing of him, and opening up the excellency
and vertue of his sufferings, so to preach the Gospel
that there needs no other crucifix after so clear and
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:104216:209"/>

                  <p>Men commonly read, and hear, and may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
preach of the sufferings of Christ as a common
story, and that way it may a little move a Man, and
wring tears from his eyes; but faith hath another
kind of sight of them, and so works other kind of
affections, and without that, the very eye sight of
them, availed the Apostles nothing: for how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
saw him suffer as they did, that reviled, or at least
despised him. But by the eye of faith to see the
only begotten Son of God, as stricken, and smitten
of God, bearing our sorrows, and wounded for our
transgression, Jesus Christ the righteous reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the unrighteous and malefactors, to see him
stript naked, and scourged, and buffetted, and nailed<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
and dying, and all for us; this is the thing that will
bind upon us most strongly all the duties of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and of our Callings, and best enables us, according
to our Callings, to bind them upon others. But our
slender view of these things makes light sense, and that
cold incitements to answerable duty; certainly, deep
impression would cause lively expression.</p>
                  <p>Would we willingly stir up our own hearts, and
one another to holy diligence in our Station, study
Christ as suffering, and dying, more thoroughly,
that is the very life of the Gospel and of our Souls,
'tis all we have to learn, and all we have to teach and
press on you, <hi>I determined to know nothing among you save
Iesus Christ and him crucified.</hi> To make Christ's Cross
the sum of all my learning.</p>

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:104216:210"/>
of those sufferings, so a partaker of the
glory purchast by these sufferings, and therefore as one
insighted and interessed in what he speaks, the
Apostle might fitly speak of that peculiar duty
which these sufferings and glory do peculiarly perswade.
This the only way of speaking of those things, not as
a Discourser or contemplative Student, but a partaker,
there is another force of a Pastors exhortation either
to his people or his brethren, that brings his message
written upon his own heart, speaks of the guilt of sin
and sufferings of Christ for it, as particularly feeling
his own guilt, and looking on these sufferings as taking
it away, speaks of free grace, as one that either
hath drunken of the refreshing streams of it, or at least,
is earnestly thirsting after it, of the love of Christ
from a heart kindled with it, of the glory to come
as one that looks to be sharer in it, and longs earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for it, that hath all his joy and content laid up in
the hopes of it.</p>
                  <p>And thus Christians one with another in their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
exhortings and comfortings, all is cold and
dead that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lows not from some inward perswasion and
experimental knowledge of divine things; that gives
edge, and sweetness to Christian conference. To be
speaking of Jesus Christ, not only as a King and as
Redeemer, but their King, and their Redeemer,
<hi>Davids</hi> stile, <hi>my King, and my God:</hi> and of his
sufferings as theirs,<note place="margin">Peregrinus in terris nulla est ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordatio quam suae civitatis <hi>Aug in Psal.</hi> 145.</note> applyed by saith, and acquitting

they are partakers of it, their home, as strangers
meeting together abroad, in some foreign Country,
delighting to speak of their own Land, and their
parentage, friends, and their rich patrimony there
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:104216:210"/>
abiding them. And this ought to be the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christians when they meet. Away with
triffling vain discourses, cause all to give place to
these refreshing remembrances of our home. Were
our hearts much on that rich Inheritance above, it
would be impossible to refrain our tongues, and to
pass on so silent of it, to find matter of empty prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and be pleased with them, and no relishing this;
whither go your hearts, they are out of their way,
and abase themselves, that turn so much downwards,
and are not more above the Sun, eying still that
blessed Land, where our purchast Inheritance
lies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inf.</hi> Oh! seek after more clear knowledge of this
glory, and of your interest in it, that your hearts
may rejoyce in the remembrance of it, that it be
not to you as the description of a pleasant Land,
such as Men read in History, and have no portion
in, they like it well, and are pleased with it while
they read, be it but some imagined Country or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
finely fancied. But know it to be real,
no device, and seek to know your selves partakers of
it.</p>
                  <p>This confidence hangs not upon a singular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
but on the power of faith, and the light
of the Spirit of God which clears to his Children
the things that he hath freely given them, though
some of them, at sometimes, it may be all or
most of their time do want it, God so disposing
it they scarce clearly see their right, till they be
in possession; see not their Heaven and home
till after they be at it, or hard upon it; yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this we may, and ought to seek after in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and submission, that we may have the pledge
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:104216:211"/>
and earnest of our Inheritance, not so much for the
comfort within us, though that is allowed, as that
it may wean our hearts from things below, may
raise us to higher and closer Communion with
God, and enable us more for his service, and excite
us more to his praises even here. What were a
Christian without the hope of this glory, as one
said, <hi>tolle Religionem &amp; nullus eris.</hi> And having this
hope, what are all things here to him? how
poor and despiseable the better and worse of this
life, and this life it self, how glad is he that it
will quickly end, and what were the length of it
to him, but by the long continuance of his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
holden long from home, and how sweet
is the message that is sent for him to come home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The glory to be revealed.</hi>] It is hid for present, wholly
unknown to the Children of this World, and even but
little known to the Children of God that are heirs of it,
yea they that know themselves partakers of it, yet
know not much what it is, only this, that it is
above all they know, or can imagine; they may see
things that make a great shew here, they may
hear of more than they see, they may think or imagine
more than either they hear, or see, or can conceive
of; still they must think of this glory as beyond it:
see I pompous shews, or read I, or hear of them;
yet this I say of them, these are not as my Inheritance
it is far beyond them; yea does my mind imagine
things far beyond them, golden mountains and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Palaces, yet those fall short of my Inheritance,
for it is such <hi>as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor
hath it entred into the heart of Man to conceive.</hi> Oh! the
brightness of that glory when it shall be revealed.
How shall they be astonisht that shall see it, and not

Jesus Christ he descended to purchase a Church, he

of subordinate Pastors, their care and diligence in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the main is by doctrine, the wholsom and
green pastures of saving Truths revealed in the Gospel,
accommodating of the way teaching to their condition
and capacity, and to be as much as may be particularly
acquainted with it, and suit diligently and prudently
their doctrine to it; to feed the Sheep, those more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced;

the inward work of grace is as in the conception, and

would not faint and give over in it, were not our Lord
the chief Shepherd: all our sufficiency laid up in his
rich fulness, and all our insufficiency covered in his

                  <p>And to consider this, wherein lies a very pressing
motive, it is <hi>the flock of God,</hi> not our own to use as we

in the same argument, <hi>Acts. 20. 28. The
flock of God that he hath bought with his own blood.</hi>
How reasonable is it that we bestow our strength and

that we be most ready to draw out our Spirits for

holy Man,<note place="margin">Bern. Advent. Serm. 3.</note>

                  <p>And indeed there is nothing moves us aright, nor
shall we ever find comfort in this service, unless it be
from a cheerful inward readiness of mind, and that from
the love of Christ, thus said he to his Apostle, <hi>lovest
thou me, then feed my Sheep<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and feed my Lambs,</hi> love
to Christ begets love to his peoples Souls, that are
so precious to him, and a care of feeding them; he
devolves the working of love towards him upon his
flock for their good, puts them in his room, to receive
the benefit of our services, which cannot reach him in
himself, he can receive no other profit from it. It is
love, much love gives much unwearied care, and much
skill in this charge. How sweet is it to him that loves,
to bestow himself, to spend and be spent upon his service
whom he loves. <hi>Iacob</hi> in the same kind of service
endured all, and found it light by reason of love, the
cold of the nights, and the heat of the days, seven
years for his <hi>Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few
days, because he loved her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Love is the great endowment of a Shepherd of Christs
flock. He says not to <hi>Peter,</hi> art thou wise or learned
or eloquent, but <hi>lovest thou me, then feed my Sheep.</hi>

only, that all due respect, according to their Station,
be given by each Christian to another, and though
there cannot be such a subjection of Masters or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to their Servants and Children, as is due
to them from these, yet a lowly meek carrying of
of their authority, a tender respect of their youth,
receiving of an admonition from them duly qualify'd,
is that which suits with the rule. And generally not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in the trampling on, or abusing of any, but
rather seeking the credit and good esteem of all as our
own. Taking notice of that good in them, wherein
they are beyond us:<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> for all hath some advantage and

it seeks not to appear: it is seen as a modest Man or

that Charity and Piety do both forbid it, would not

take up a kind of Profession, and think all consists in
some religious performances, and do not study the

Temple purged; for so it should be, and stand in much
need of a sweeping out of filthiness, and puting out
of idols. Some there be that are much busied about
the matter of their assurance, still upon that point,
which is lawful indeed, and laudible to enquire after,
yet not so, as to neglect things more needful. It were
certainly better for many, when they find no issue that
way, to turn somewhat of their diligence to the
study of Christian Graces and Duties in their Station,

Graces, yet when they do appear under it, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they will, a little glance of them, so makes
them much more esteemed. <hi>Rebekah</hi>'s Beauty and her

                  <p>2. In all, so particularly in this Grace, take heed
of a disguise or counterfeit of it; Oh! sincerity in
all, and particularly in this, only low in thine own

that is the very upright nature of this heart-humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

that is not in thee, or discerning that which is. Is
not the day at hand when men will be taken off their
false hights they stand on, and set on their own feet,
and when all the esteem of others shall vanish and
pass like smoak, and thou shall be just what God
finds and accounts thee, and neither more or less. Oh!
the remembrance of that day of true estimate of
all; this would make men hing less upon the unstable
conceits and opinions of one another; knowing
our Judgment and Day shall shortly end, a short day.

Now to work the heart to a humble posture. (1.) Look
into thy self in earnest, and truly, whosoever thou be
that hast the highest conceit and the highest causes of it;
that will do it, a real sight of thy self, it will lay thy
crest. Men look on any good, or fancy of it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with both eyes, and skip over as unpleasant
their real defects and deformities; every man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
his own flatterer, otherwise flatteries and false
cryings up from others would take little impression,
but that they meet with the same conceit within.
But will any man see his ignorance, and lay what he
knows not over against what he knows; the disorders
in his heart and affections over against any right moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them, his secret follies and sins against his outwardly
blameless carriage; and this man shall not readily love
and embrace himself, yea it shall be impossible for him not
to abase and abhors himself? (2.) Look on the
good in others, and the evil in thy self, make that the
parallel, and then thou wilt walk humbly. Most men
do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ãâã</desc>
                     </gap> the contrary, and that foolish and unjust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
pusses them up. (3.) Thou art not required
to be ignorant of that good which really is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
but beware of imagining what is not; yea,
rather let something that is pass thy view, and see
it within, rather than beyond its true size, and then
whatsoever it is, see it not as thine own but Gods, his
free gift, and so the more thou hast, looking on it in
that view, thou wilt certainly be the more humble,
as having the more engagement; the weight of them
will press thee, down and low, still the lower, as you
see it in <hi>Abraham,</hi> the clear Visions and Promises he
had, made him fall down flat to the Ground.
(4.) Pray much for the Spirit of Humility, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ, for that is it; otherwise all thy vileness
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:104216:221"/>
will not humble thee when men hear of this or other
Graces, and how reasonable they are, they think
presently to have it, and do not consider the natural
enmity and rebellion of their own hearts, and the
necessity of receiving those from Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the use of all other means, to be most depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
on that influence, and most in that means, which
opens the heart most to that influence, and draws it
down upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> and that is Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Of all the evils of our corrupt nature there is none
more connatural and universal than Pride; the grand
wickedness, self-exalting in our own and others opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Though I will not contest what was the first
step in that complicated first sin, yet certainly, this
of pride was one, a main ingredient in it, that which
the unbelief conceived going before, and the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
following after were both servants to; and
ever since it sticks still deep in our nature. And
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> says truly, <hi>That, that first overcame man, is
the last he overcomes.</hi> Some sins comparatively may
die before us, but this hath life in it sensibly as long
as we; is as the heart of all, the first living, and the
last dying, and hath this advantage that whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sins are fomented by one another, this feeds even
on Vertues and Graces, as a Moth that breeds in
them, and consumes them even in the finest of them,
if it be not carefully lookt to. This <hi>Hydra,</hi> as one
head of it is cut off, another rises up: It will secretly
cleave to the best actions, and prey upon them: and
therefore so much need that we continually watch,
and fight, and pray against it, and be restless in the
pursuit, daily seeking to gain further in real and
deep humiliation; to be nothing, and desire to be
nothing, not only bear, but to love our own abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:104216:221"/>
and the things that procure and help it, to take
pleasure in them so far as may be without s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>n, yea,
even of our sinful failings when they are discovered,
to love the bringing low of our selves by them,
while we hate and grieve for the sin of them.</p>
                  <p>And above all to watch our selves in our best things,
that self get not in, or if it break in, or steal in at
any time, that it be presently found out and cast out
again; to have that establisht within us to do all for
God, to intend him and his glory in all, and to be
willing to advance his glory were it by our own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;
not to make raising or pleasing thy self the
rule of exercising thy parts and graces, when to use
and bring them forth; but the good of thy Brethren,
and in that the glory of thy Lord: Now this is
indeed to be severed from self, and united to him, to
have self-love turned into the love of God; and this
is his own work, it is above all other hands, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the main combat against pride and conquest of it,
and gaining of humility is certainly by prayer. God
bestows himself most to them that are most abundant
in prayer, and to whom he shews himself most, they
are certainly the most humble.</p>
                  <p>Now to stir us up to diligence for this grace, take
briefly a consideration or two.</p>
                  <p>1. Look on that above pointed at. The high
example of lowliness set before us, Jesus Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
our particular care to take this lesson from
him: and is it not most reasonable? he the most fair,
the most excellent and compleat of all men, and yet
the most humble; he more than a man, and yet willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
became in some sort less than a man, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
a Worm and no Man; and when Majesty it
self emptied it self and descended so low, shall a Worm
swell and be high conceited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="436" facs="tcp:104216:222"/>
Then consider, it was for us, all his humbling to
expiate our pride, and therefore the more just that
we follow a pattern which is both so great in it self,
and so nearly concerning us. <hi>O humility! the vertue
of Christ,</hi> that which he so peculiarly espoused, <hi>how
dost thou confound the vanity of our pride?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Consider the safety of Grace under this cloathing,
it is that which keeps it unexposed to a thousand
hazards. Humility doth Grace no prejudice in cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, but indeed shelters it from violence and wrong.
Therefore they do justly call it <hi>conservatrix virtutum,</hi>
the preserver of Grace, and one says well, <hi>That he that
carries other graces without humility, carries a precious
powder in the wind without a cover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Consider, The increase of Grace by it, and that
is here exprest; the perfect enmity against pride, and
bounty toward humility, <hi>he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

make his party good, pride shall not escape ruin, he
will break it and bring it low; for he is set upon that
purpose, and will not be diverted.</p>
                  <p>

humble hearts; his sweet dews and showers slide off
the Mountains and fall on the low Valley of humble
hearts, and make them pleasant and fertile. The
swelling heart puft up with a fancy of fullness hath no
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:104216:222"/>
room for Grace, is lift up, is not hollow'd and sitted
to receive and contain the graces that descend from
above; and again as the humble heart is most capable,
as emptied and hollowed, can hold most, so it is most
thankful, acknowledges all as received, but the proud
cries all his own; the return of Glory that is due
from Grace, comes most freely and plentifully from
an humble heart, and he delights to enrich it with
Grace, and it delights to return him Glory, the more
he bestows on it, the more it desires to honour him
withal, and the more it doth so, the more readily he
bestows still more upon it, and this is the sweet intercourse
betwixt God and the humble Soul; this is the noble
ambition of humility, in respect whereof all the aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of pride are low and base: when all is reckoned,
the lowliest mind is truly the highest; and these two
agree so well, that the more lowly it is, 'tis thus the
higher, and the higher thus, it is still the more lowly.</p>
                  <p>Oh! my Brethren, want of this is a great cause of
all our wants; why should our God bestow on us,
what we would bestow on our idol-self, or if not to
idolize thy self, yet to idolize the thing, the gift that
grace bestowed; to fetch thy believing, and comforts
from that, which is to put it in his place that gave, and
to make <hi>Baal</hi> of it, as may be read, <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 8. Now
he will not furnish thee thus to his own prejudice
therein; seek to have thine heart on a high design,
seeking Grace still not to rest in any gift, nor to grow
vain and regardless of him upon it. If we had but
this fixed with us; what gift or grace I seek, what
comfort I seek, it shall no sooner be mine, but it shall
all be thine again, and my self with it; I desire nothing
from thee but that it may come back to thee, and
draw me with it unto thee, this is all my end, and
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:104216:223"/>
all my desire: The thing thus presented would not
come back so often unanswered.</p>
                  <p>This is the only way to grow quickly rich, come
still poor to him that hath enough, ever to enrich thee,
and desire of his riches not for thy self, but for him,
mind entirely his Glory in all thou hast and seekest to
have; what thou hast use so, and what thou wantest
vow it so, let it be his in thy purpose, even before
it be thine in possession, as <hi>Hanna</hi> did in her suit,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 11. for a Son, and thou shalt obtain as she
did, and then as she was, be thou faithful in the
performance: <hi>Him wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I have returned to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no question, the secret pride and selfness of our
hearts that prejudges much of the bounty of his hand
in the measure of our Graces, and the sweet embraces
of his love, which we should otherwise find. The
more we let go of our selves, still the more should we
receive of himself. Oh foolish we, that refuse so
blessed an exchange.</p>
                  <p>To this humility, as in these words 'tis taken in
the notion of our inward thoughts touching our selves,
and carriage in relation to others, the Apostle
joyns the other Humility in relation to God, being
indeed the different actings, one and the same Grace,
and inseparably connexed each with the other.</p>

things, but in our spiritual condition, as the thing the
Lord is much taken with in his Children; there is a
stubbornness, and freting of Heart concerning our

nature; and yet some take a pleasure in it, touching the
matter of comfort and assurance, if it be with held,
or which they take more liberty in, be it sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and victory over sin; they seek, and yet find

take displeasure and make no account of the daily
provision made for them, and all the other benefits they
have by the care and love of their Parents: This is
a folly very unbeseeming the Children that are the
Children of Wisdom, and should walk as such: And
till they learn more humble respect of their Father's
Will, they are still the further off from their purpose;
were they once brought to submit the matter, and
give him heartily his Will, he would readily give
them theirs, as far as were for their good, as you
say to your Children of any thing they are too stiff
and earnest in, and keep a noise for, <hi>cry not for it, and
you shall have it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is the thing we observe not, that the Lord
often by his delays is aiming at this, and were this
done, we cannot think how graciously he would deal
with us, his gracious design is to make much room
for grace by much humbling, especially some Spirits
that need much trying, or that he means much enabling
to, for a singular service, and thus the time is not lost
as we think it, it furthers our end, while we think
contrary; 'tis necessary spent time and pains that is
given to the unballasting of a Ship, casting out the
Earth and Sand, when it is to be loaden with Spices:
we must be emptied more, if we would have of
that fullness and riches that we are longing for.</p>
                  <p>So long as we some and chafe against his way, though
it be in our best suits; we are not in a posture for a
favourable answer: would we wring things out of his
hand by fretfullness? that is not the way, no, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

am sinking if he help not, now 'twill be too late,
yet he sees it otherways, he can let thee sink yet
lower, and yet bring thee up again; he doth but stay
till the most fit time, thou canst not see it yet, but
thou shalt see it, that his chosen time is absolutely best;
<hi>he waiteth to be gracious;</hi> doth he wait, and will not
thou? Oh! the firm belief of his Wisdom, Power,
and Goodness, what difficulty will it not surmount?
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:104216:225"/>
So then be humble under his hand; submit, not only
thy goods, thy health, thy life, but thy soul. Seek
and wait for thy pardon as a condemned Rebel,
with thy rope about thy neck; lay thy self low before
him at his feet, stoop and crave leave to look up and
speak, and say; <hi>Lord, once I am justly under the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death; if I fall under it, thou art righteous, and
I do here acknowledge it; but there is deliverance in
Christ, thither I would have recourse: yet if I be beaten
back, and held out, and faith with held from me, and I
perish as it were in view of salvation, see the rock, and
yet cannot come at it but drown: what have I to say; in
this likewise thou art righteous, only if it seem good unto
thee to save the vilest, most wretched of sinners, and shew
great mercy in pardoning so great debts; the higher will
be the glory of that mercy: however here I am resolved to
wait till either thou graciously receive me, or absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
me, if thou do this I have not a word to say against
it, because thou art gracious, I hope; I hope yet thou wilt have
mercy on me.</hi> I dare say that this promise belongs to a
Soul, and <hi>it shall be raised up in due time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what though most or all our life should pass
without much sensible taste even of spiritual comforts; a
poor all it is: let us not over esteem this moment,
and so think too much of our better or worse condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in it either in Temporals, yea, or in Spirituals,
such as are more arbitrary and accessary to the name
of our Spiritual Life; providing we can humbly wait
for free grace, and hang on the word of promise,
we are safe; if the Lord will clearly shine on us, and
refresh us; this is much to be desired and prized, but
if he so think fit, what if we should be all our days
held at a distance, and under a cloud of wrath, it is but
a moment in his anger; then follows a life time
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:104216:226"/>
in his favour, an endless life time; 'tis <hi>but sorrow for
a night, and joy comes in the morning,</hi> that clearer

                  <p>AMongst other spiritual secrets, this is one, and

boldness, <hi>humble confidence:</hi> This the true temper of a
Child of God, towards his great and good Father;
nor can any other have it, but they that are indeed
his Children, and have within them that Spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
which he sends into their hearts.</p>
                  <p>And these two here the Apostle joyns together.
<hi>Humble under the hand of God,</hi> and yet <hi>cast your care on
him,</hi> upon that same hand under which you ought to
humble your selves, must you withal cast over your

                  <p>Consider, (1.) The nature of this Confidence.

                  </p>
                  <p>Every man hath some desires and purposes that
are predominant with him, beside the daily exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his life, he is compast with; and in both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their importance or his esteem, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:104216:226"/>
occurring in them, he is naturally carried to
be thoughtful and careful in them. Now the excess
and distemper of this care is one of the great diseases
and miseries of mans life. Moral Men perceiving and
resenting it, have been tampering at the cure, and
prescribing after their fashion, but with little success,
some present abatement and allay of the paroxism or
extremity their rules may reach; but they never go
near the bottom, the cause of the evil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot work a through sound cure of it.</p>
                  <p>Something they have spoken, somewhat fitly, of the
surpassing nature's rule, and size in the pursuit of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
needless things, but for the unavoidable care
of things needful, they knew no redress but to their
own industry and diligence; they can tell how little
will serve him, that seeks no more than what will serve;
but how to be provided of the little, or to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of it, and freed from troubling care they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell.</p>
                  <p>Now truly it were a great point to be well schooled
in the former, and that which is necessary for the
due practice of this rule here given touching ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
cares, first to cut off cares unnecessary, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
all extravagant superfluous desires: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a great part of the troubling cares of men are
all about things that are such that have no necessity
in them, but what our disorder'd desires make, nor
truly any real good in them, but what our fancy puts
upon them: Some are indeed forc't to hard labour for
their daily bread, but out of doubt a great part of
the sweat and toyl of the greatest part of men is about
unnecessaries.<note place="margin">Ad super vacu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

those possibly to whom they are so enthrall'd, are
themselves at as little liberty, but captivated to the

food and rayment, resolving that they will have them,
or fall in the chase, willfully and unavoidably bent on

hard enough of it, <hi>they fall into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown
men in destruction and perdition, no recovering, but
still emplunged deeper and deeper, and (foolish lusts)
reasonless, childish desires after one bargain, such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

somewhat then to keep that whole, and so on, no end;
if upon Purchase and Land, still some House or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-field,
some <hi>Naboths-vineyard</hi> in their eyes, and
all the rest is nothing without that, which discovers
the madness of this humour, this dropsie thirst.</p>
                  <p>And this is first indeed to be lookt to, that our
desires and cares be brought to a due compass: and
what would we have think we, contentment lies in so
much, and no less when that is attained, it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
as far off as before: when Children are at the
foot of a high Hill, they think it reaches the Heavens,
and yet if they were there, they find themselves as

                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ar off, as before, sensibly no nearer. Men think,
Oh! had I this, I were well, and when it is reacht,
it is but an advanced stance to look higher and spy out
for some other thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="447" facs="tcp:104216:227"/>
We are indeed Children in this to think the good of
our estate is in the greatness, and not in the fitness: he
were a fool that would have his cloaths so, and think
the bigger and longer they were, they would please
him the better. And certainly as in Apparel, so in
place and estate, and all outward things; their good
lies not in their greatness, but in their fitness for us;
our Saviour tells us expresly,<note place="margin">Luc. 12. 13.</note> that <hi>mans life consisteth not
in the abundance of the things he possesseth.</hi> Think you
great and rich persons live more content, believe it
not, if they will deal freely, they can tell you the
contrary, that there is nothing but a shew in them;
and that the great estates and places have great grief
and cares attending them, as shadows are proportioned
to their bodies.</p>
                  <p>And if they want real crosses, luxury frames troubles
to it self, variety of dishes corrupting the stomach,
and causing variety of diseases: and for need, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
vain discontents that will trouble men as much
as greater, be it but this Hawk flies not well, or that
Dog runs not well, to men whose hearts are in those
games.</p>
                  <p>So then, I say, this first to be regulated, all childish
vain needless cares to be discharg'd, and as being unfit
to cast on thy God, quite cast out of thy Heart. and
entertain no care at all, but such as thou maist put
into God's hands, and make his on thy behalf; such
as he will take off thy hand, and undertake for
thee.</p>
                  <p>All needful lawful care, and that only will he receive,
so then rid thy self quit of all that thou canst not take
this course with, and then without scruple take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
this course with all the rest: seek a well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
sober Spirit. In the things of this life content

ornament, but rayment: and resolve that what thy
Father carves to thee, is best for thee; the fittest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
for he knows it, and loves thee wisely. This
course our Saviour takes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. first to cut off su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
care, then to turn over on thy God the
care of necessaries, he will look to that, thou hast
him engaged, and he can and will give thee beyond
that, if he see it fit.</p>
                  <p>Only this is required of thee to refer the matter to
his discretion wholly: now in thy thus well regulated
affairs and desires, there is a diligent care and study of
thy duty, this he lays on thee; there is a care of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
in the work, and the success of it, this thou
oughtest to lay on him, and so indeed all the care is turn-off
from thee upon him; even that of duty, which
from him lies on us: we offer our service, but for skill
and strength to discharge it, that care we lay on him,
and he allows us; and then for the event and success
with that we trust him entirely. And this is the way
to walk contentedly and cheerfully homewards, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and resting all the way on him who is both our
guide and our strength, who hath us and all our good
in his gracious hand. Much zeal for him and desire
of his glory, minding our duty in relation to that, is
the thing he requires, and we bending our whole care
to that, he undertakes the care of us and our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

                  <p>And for the issue and success of thy way, let not
that trouble thee at all, that is the care he would have

do not vex thy self with thinking how will this be and

the punishment of it close tied to't: If thou wilt be
struggling with that which belongs not to thee, and
poysing at that burden that is not thine, what wonder,
yea, I may say what pity, if thou fall under it, art
thou not well serv'd, is it not just, that if thou wilt
do for thy self, and bear thy self, what thy Lord

                  <p>But what is the way of this devolving of my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?
there is a faculty in it that every one hath not,
though they would do thus with it they cannot, it
lies on them, and they are not able to cast it on God.
The way is doubtless by praying and believing; those
are the hands by which the Soul can turn over to God
what it self cannot bear, all cares, the whole bundle;
most dexterously translated thus, <hi>Philip. 4 6. Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                  <p>No more, but when thou art either to do or suffer
any thing, when thou art about any purpose or busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess,
go tell God of it, acquaint him with it; yea,
burden him with it, and thou hast done for matter of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:104216:229"/>
caring: no more care but quiet sweet diligence in thy
duty and dependance on him for the carriage of
thy matters. And in this Prayer, Faith acts, 'tis a
believing requesting; <hi>ask in faith not doubting,</hi> so
thou rollest over all on him, that is the very proper
working of Faith, the carrying the Soul and all its
desires out of it self unto God, so exprest, <hi>Psal. 37. 5. roll

                  <p>Now, Faith to do this stays it self on the promise,
it cannot move but on firm ground, and the promises

                  </p>
                  <p>This must be establisht in the heart. (1.) The firm

life: the World thinks not so<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> looks on them as poor
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:104216:230"/>
discontented lowring Creatures, but they see not what
an uncaring truly secure life they are called to,
while others are turmoyling and wrestling each
with his projects and burdens for himself, and at length
crusht and sinking under them, for that is the end of
all that do for themselves. The Child of God goes
free of the pressure of all that concerns him, laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
on his God, if he use his advantage, he is not
rackt with musings, Oh! what will become of this and
that; but goes on in the strength of his God as he may,
offers up poor, but sincere endeavours to God, and
is sure of one thing, all shall be well, lays his affairs
and himself on God, and so hath no pressing care,
no care, but the care of love, how to please, how to
honour his Lord, and in this depends on him too both
for skill and strength, and touching the success of things
leaves that as none of his, to be burdened with; casts
it on God, and he careth for it, they need not both
care, his care alone is sufficient, hence peace, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
peace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inf.</hi> 2. But truly the godly are much faulty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by the not improvement of this their priviledge,
they too often forget this their sweet way, and fret
themselves to no purpose, wrestle with their burdens
themselves, and do not entirely and freely roll them
over on God, they are surcharg'd with them, and he calls
for them, and yet they will not give them him;
think to spare him, but indeed in this they disobey
him, and dishonour, and so grieve him, and they find
the grief return on them, and yet cannot learn to be
wise.</p>
                  <p>Why do we thus with our God, and with our Souls,
grieve both at once? let it never be, that for any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thing thou perplex thy self, and ravel thy
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:104216:230"/>
thoughts as in thickets with the cares of this life, Oh!
how unsuitable to a Child of God provided to a life so
far more excellent. Hath he provided thee to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and will he not bestow thy charges in the way
to't: think it not; he knows you have need of these
things, seek not vain things nor great things in these,
for that likely is not for thee, but what is needful
and convenient in his Judgment, and refer to that.</p>
                  <p>Then for thy Spiritual estate lay over the care of
that too, be not so much in thorny questionings, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and disputing each step. Oh! is this accepted and
that, and so much deadness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But apply more simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thy self to thy duty, lamely, as it may be, halt on and
believe that he is gracious and pities thee, and lay the
care of bringing thee through upon him; lie not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and arguing, but <hi>up and be doing, and the
Lord shall be with thee.</hi> I am perswaded many a Soul,
that hath some Truth of Grace, falls much behind in
the progress by this accustomed way of endless questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onings;
men can scarce be brought to examine and
suspect their own condition being carnally secure,
and satisfied that all is well; but then when once
awaken and set to this, they are ready to entangle
in it, and neglect their way by poring on their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and will not set chearfully to any thing, because
they want assurances and hight of joy, and this course
they take is the way to want it still: walking
humbly and sincerely, and offering at thy duty, and
waiting on the Lord is certainly the better way, and
nearer that very purpose of thine; for he meeteth
him that rejoyceth and worketh righteousness, that
waits for him in his ways. One thing, the Christian
would endeavour, firm belief for the Church, all the

perform all his Word to her, then think, do I trust
him for the whole Church, and the great Affairs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, and shall I doubt him for my self or any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerns me? do I conside on him for the steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and guidance of the whole Ship, and shall I be pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishly
doubting and distrusting about my pack in
it?</p>
                  <p>Again, when to present and past, thou callest in after
evils by advance, the dangers before, and thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
good indeed to entertain by these, holy fear
and self distrust, but by that be driven in to trust on
thy undertaker, on him in whom thy strength lies, and
be as sure and confident in him as thou art, and justly
art distrustful of thy self.</p>
                  <p>Further learn to prescribe nothing, study entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signment,
for that is thy great duty and thy peace,
that gives up all into the hand of thy Lord, and can
it be in a better hand. <hi>First,</hi> Refer the carving of
outward things to him, heartily and fully; then stay not
there but go higher, if we have renounced the comforts
of this World for God, let us add this, renounce even
Spiritual comforts for him too, put all in his will, if
I be in light, blessed be thou, and if in darkness even
there, blessed be thou too; as he saith of these, <hi>Gold
is mine, and Silver is mine,</hi> and this may satisfie a
Christian in those too; desire no more of them than
their Father sees fit to give them, knowing that he
having all the mines and treasures of the World at
his command, would not pinch and hold short his
Children if it were good for them to have more;
thus even in the other the true riches. Is not the
Spirit mine, and comforts mine, may he say, I have
them, and enough of them, and ought not this to
allay thy afflicting care and quiet thy repinings, and to
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:104216:231"/>
establish thy heart in referring it to his dispose, as
touching thy comforts and supplies, the whole golden
mines of all Spiritual comfort and good are his, the
Spirit it self. Then will he not furnish what is fit for
thee, if thou humbly attend on him, and lay the care
of thy providing upon his wisdom and love? This were
the sure way to honour him, with what we have, and
to obtain much of what we have not, certainly he deals
best with those that do most absolutely refer all to
him.</p>

                  <p>THE Children of God if they rightly take their
Father's mind, are always disburden'd of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
carefulness: But never exempted from diligent
watchfulness. Thus we find here they are allowed,
yea, enjoyned to cast all their care upon their wise
and loving Father, and are secured by his care, he takes
it well they lay all over on him, yea, he takes
it not well they forbear him and burden themselves.
He hath provided a sweet quiet life for them, could
they improve and use it, a calm and firm condition in
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:104216:232"/>
all the storms and troubles that are about them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
things go, to find content, and <hi>be careful for
nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now upon this a carnal heart would imagine
streight according to its sense and inclinement, as it
desires to have it, so would it dream, that it is, that then
a man devolving his care on God, may give up all
watch and ward, and need not apply himself to any
kind of duty, but this is the ignorance and perverse
mistake, the reasonless reasoning of the flesh; you see
these are here joyned not only as agreeable, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
inseparable. <hi>Cast all your care on him, for he careth
for you:</hi> And withal <hi>be sober, be vigilant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is the Scripture Logick,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>it is he that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in you to will and to do:</hi> Then would you possibly
think I need not work at all, or if I do, it may be
very easily and surely; no, <hi>Therefore,</hi> says the Apostle,
because he worketh in you to will and to do, <hi>work you

                        </gap>ut your salvation,</hi> yea, and do it <hi>with fear and trembling;</hi>
work you in humble obedience to his command, and
in dependance on him that worketh all in you.</p>
                  <p>Thus here, cast your care on him, not that you
may be the more free to take your own pleasure and
sloathful ease, but on the contrary that you may be
the more active and apt to watch, being freed from
the burden of vexing carefulness that would press and
incumber you; you are the more nimble, as one eased
of a load, to walk, and work, and watch as becomes
a Christian, and for that purpose is that burden taken
oft from you, that you may be more able and disposed
for every duty that is laid upon you.</p>
                  <p>Observe those two connexed, and thence gather.
<hi>First,</hi> There is no right believing without diligence and
watchfulness joyned with it, that slothful reliance of
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:104216:232"/>
most souls on blind thoughts of mercy, shall undo
them, their faith is a dead faith, and a deadly faith,
they are perishing and will not consider it, do not
duely cast their care on God for their Souls, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they have no such care. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other
thing is, that there is no right diligence without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
                  <p>There is, as in other affairs, so even in Spiritual
things, an anxious perplexing care, which is a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and disturbance to the Soul; seems to have a heat
of zeal and affection in it: but is indeed not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
right heat that is healthful, and enables for action,
but a diseas'd feverish heat, that puts all out of frame,
and unfits for duty, it seems to stir and further, but
indeed it hinders, and does not hasten us, but so as
to make us stumble, as if there were one behind a man
driving and thrusting him forward, and not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to set and order his steps in his course; this
were the ready way instead of advancing him to
weary him, and possibly give him a fall.</p>
                  <p>Such is the distrustful care that many have in their
Spiritual course, a hundred questions about the way
of their performances, and their acceptance, and their
estate, and the issue of their endeavours: indeed we
should endeavour to do all by our rule, and to walk
exactly, and examine our ways especially in holy things,
to seek some insight and faculty in their performance
suiting their nature and end, and his greatness and
purity whom we worship. This would be minded
diligently, and yet calmly and composedly; for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
doubtings do retard and disorder all, but quiet
stayedness of heart on God, dependance on him and
his strength for performance, and his free love in
Christ for acceptance, this makes the work go kindly
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:104216:233"/>
and sweetly on, makes it pleasing to God and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thy Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inf.</hi> Certainly thou art a vexation to thy self, and
displeasest thy Lord, when thou art questioning whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou shalt go on or no, finding in thy service so
much deadness and hardness, thinking therefore that it
were as good do nothing, that thou doest but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
him in all, now thou considerest not, that in
these very thoughts, thou doest more wrong and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
him, than in thy worst services, callest in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
his lenity and goodness, takest him for a rigorous
exacter, yea, representest to thy self as a hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
him that is the most gentle and gracious of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
do not use him so: indeed thou oughtest to
take heed to thy foot; see how thy heart is affected
in his worship, keep and watch it as thou canst; but
doing so, or endeavouring to do so, however thou
find it, do not think he will use rigours with thee;
but the more thou observest thine own miscarriages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, the less he will, and to think otherwise,
and fret, and repine, that thy heart is not to his mind,
nor indeed to thine own, to go on in a malecontent
impatience, this is certainly not this commanded watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
but that forbidden carefulness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be sober.</hi>] This we have formerly spoke of; the
Apostle having formerly exhorted it once and again
in this Epistle. It were easie to entertain mens minds
with new discourse, if our task were rather to please,
than profit, for there be many things that with little
labour might be brought forth as new and strange to
ordinary hearers. But there be a few things that chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern us to know and practise, and these are
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>ãâ¦ã</desc>
                     </gap> frequently represented and prest. This
Apostle and other Divine Penners drew from too
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:104216:233"/>
full a spring to be ebb of matter, but they rather
chuse profitable iterations, than unprofitable variety,
and so ought we.</p>
                  <p>This Sobriety is not only Temperance in meat and
drink, but in all things that are of the fleshes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even that of diet is, though not all, yet a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part of it, and that not only hath in it, that one
exceed not in the quantity or quality; but even requires
a regulating our selves in the manner of using our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past:
as we make not careful and studious provision, do
not take up our thoughts how to please our palate; so
even in the use of sober mean diet, we indeavour the
mortifying of our flesh, not to eat and drink to please our
selves, or satisfie our natural desire, but for God, even
to propound this in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>itting down to it, in obedience
to him; to use these helps of life, and the life it self
to be spent in his obedience, and endeavour of advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his glory.</p>
                  <p>It is a most shameful Idol, a Dunghill-God indeed,
to serve the belly, and to delight in feastings, or
in our ordinary repast, laying the reins loose on our
appetite to take its own carreer: And yet in this, the
most commonly offend, even persons that are not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
intemperate, neither gluttinous nor drunken
and yet I say, have not that holy retained
bridled way of using their repast with an eye upon
an higher end.</p>
                  <p>But this Sobriety in its ample sense binds not only
that sense of lust, but all the rest in the use of their
several delights, yea, and in the whole man, all the
affections of the Soul in relation to this World, and the
things of it, to be in it as weaned from it, and raised
above it in the bent of our minds, <hi>to use it as if we
used it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="460" facs="tcp:104216:234"/>
This we speak and hear of, but do not apply our
selves really to this rule, each hath some trifle or
earthly vanity, one or more, but especially some
choice one, that they cannot be taken off from, as
Children readily have some toy that they set more by
than the rest: We have childish hearts cleaving to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
one some Preferment, another some Estate, Lands, or
Houses, or Money, and drunk in the pursuit of these,
that when our hearts should be fixed on Divine Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
they cannot stand, but reel too and fro, or stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
down and fall asleep<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> roving after these thoughts
of it, which we affect, staggering ever and anon, or
else so implunged in them all the time, that we are as
asleep in them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore these two are here, and ordinarily, joyned
<hi>be sober and watchful.</hi> Glutting our selves either with the
delight or with the desires and cares of earth makes
us sleepy, the fumes that arise from them surcharge us,
and cast us into a deep sleep, a secure unminding of God
and of our selves, the interest of our immortal
Souls.</p>
                  <p>The pleasures of sense too gross for the Divine Soul,
for so it is by original, but we abase it and make it flesh
by those gross earthly things, and make it unfit to rise
heavenwards; as insobriety, intemperance in dyet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
the very natural Spirits, making them dull, clogs
their passage, and makes them move as a Coach in a
miry way, thus doth all inordinate use and love of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
things, make the Soul of a low heavy consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
that it cannot move freely in any thing that is
spiritual, yea where there is some truth of grace,
yet is it obstructed and dull'd by taking in too much
of the World, and feeding on it, which is no more
proper for the finest of it, for the Soul, than the course
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:104216:234"/>
plowmans dyet is for delicate tender bodies of higher
breeding, yea the disproportion is far greater.</p>
                  <p>If then you would have free Spirits for Spiritual
things, keep them at a spare dyet in all things temporal;
let not out your hearts to any thing here below, learn
to delight in God, and seek to tast of his transcendent
sweetness that will perfectly disrelish all lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;
so your sobriety in abstaining from them shall
be still further recompenc'd with more enjoyment of
God, and you shall not lose pleafure by denying the
pleasures of earth, but change them for those that are
unspeakably better and purer, in their stead; he shall
communicate himself unto you, the light of whose
countenance feeds and satisfies the glorified Spirits that
are about his Throne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be vigilant.</hi>] This watchfulness joyned with it
extends to all the estates and ways of a Christian being
surrounded with hazards and snares. <hi>He that despiseth
his way shall die,</hi> says <hi>Solomon:</hi> the most do thus, walk
at a random, give attendance on publick Worship,
and have some customary way of private prayer, but
further do not eye how they walk, what is their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
all the day long, what they speak, how they are
in company, and how alone, which way their hearts
go early and late, what it is that steals away most of
their affection from God.</p>
                  <p>Oh! My beloved, knew we our continual danger,
it would shake us out of this miserable dead security
that possesses us, we think not on it, but there are
snares laid for us all the way, in each path we walk in
and each step of it, in our meat and drink, in our
calling and labour, in our house at home, in our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying
abroad, yea even in Gods House and in our
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:104216:235"/>
spiritual exercises; both there and in private, knew we,
or at least considered we this, we would choose our
steps more exactly, and look to our ways, to our words,
our thoughts, which truly, whatsoever noise we make,
we really do not; <hi>ponder the path of thy feet,</hi> says <hi>Solomon,</hi>
and before that, <hi>let thine eyes look right on, and let
thine eye lids look straight before thee,</hi> Prov. 425, 26.
And further, <hi>put away away a froward mouth, and perverse
lips put far from thee.</hi> But first of all as the main
reason and spring of all, <hi>Keep thy Heart with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
or above all keeping<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> for out of it are the issues of
life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Because your adversary the Devil.</hi>] An allarm to watch
fulness is here given from the watchfulness of our grand
adversary, there be other two usually ranked with
him, as the leading enemies of our Souls, the World and
our own Flesh, but here is he expresly named
that commands in chief, and orders, and manages the
War, uses the service of the other two against us, as
prime Officers under which most of the forces of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
tentations are ranked, some others there be that
he immediately commands and leads on himself, a
Regiment of his own, some spiritual tentations.</p>
                  <p>And we have need to be put in mind of the hostility
and practises of Satan against us, for if the most were
po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>'d cut, they would be forc't to confess that they very
seldom think on their spiritual danger from this hand.
As we keep loose guard against the allurements of the
World and of our own corruption, we watch not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the devices of Satan, but go on by guess and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
nothing, and so are readily a prey to all.</p>
                  <p>The least enemy being despised and neglected, as
Men observe, proves often too great, the smallest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of evil, the least things that may prejudge
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:104216:235"/>
our spiritual good, while we make no reckoning of
them, may do us great mischief; our not considering
them makes them become considerable, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the command of a vigilant and skillful lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that knows how to improve advantages. Therefore
in things, that we many times account petty and not
worthy our notice, as having any evil in them, we
should learn to suspect the address of this adversary, who
usually hides himself and couches under some covert,
till he may appear irresistable, seize on us, and then
indeed he roars.</p>
                  <p>And this seeking the destruction of Souls is (you
see) mark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> as all his work, the prey he hunts is Souls,
that they may be as miserable as himself. Therefore
justly called our adversary, the enemy of holiness and
of our Souls, tempting to sin, and then accusing for sin,
as his name here imports, appearing against us upon
the advantages he hath gained; studies our nature and
fits his tentations, knows the prevalency of lust, or
earthliness, or that great and most general evil of
pride, so like himself, and that is his Throne in the Heart,
sometimes he boweth down, as it is said of the Lyon,
<hi>Ps.</hi> 10. He waits his opportunity crastily, and then
assaults fiercely, and the Children of God find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so much violence of his tentations, that they sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
them, and such horrid thoughts cast in, as poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
arrows or fiery darts, as the Apostle speaks; and
this his enmity, though it is against Man generally, yet
is most enrag'd against the Children of God, goes
about and spies where we are weakest, and amongst
them most, against those that are most advanc'd in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and nearest unto God</p>
                  <p>They were once under his power, and now being
escaped from him he pursues, as <hi>Pharoah</hi> with all his

forces, as a prey that was once in his den, and under
his paw, and now is rescu'd, he rages and roars after
it.</p>
                  <p>The resemblance hath in it, his strength, his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,

able so to do? Thus, <hi>stedfast in the faith.</hi> The most of
Men are under the power of one of these two evils,
Security or Distrust; and out of the one we readily fall
into the other. Therefore the Apostle frames his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
and the arguments of it in opposition to
both these. First against Security in the former verse,
<hi>Be sober and watch,</hi> and presses that by the proper argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

distrust. <hi>Whom resist stedfast in the faith.</hi> And adds an

lists the Soul up to the firm advanced ground
of the Promises, and fastens it there, and there it is
sure, even as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that cannot be removed.
He says not <hi>stedfast by your own resolutions and purposes,</hi>
but <hi>stedfast by faith,</hi> the power of God by faith becomes
ours, for that is contain'd and engag'd in the Word of
Promise; faith lays hold there, and there finds Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

them, carries up the Soul and takes refuge in Christ,
and there is safe, that's the power of faith, sets a Soul
in Christ, and there it looks down upon all tentations,
as at the bottom of the Rock breaking themselves
into foam. When the floods of tentations rise and
gather, so great and many that the Soul is even ready to
be swallow'd up, then by Faith it says, Lord Jesus
thou art my strength, I look to thee for deliverance,
now appear for my help; and thus it overcomes,
guilt of sin, that's answered by his blood, power of
sin conquered by his spirit, and afflictions that arise are
nothing to these, his love and gracious presence makes
them sweet and easie.</p>
                  <p>We mistake if we think to do any thing, or be any
thing without him; and we mistake again, if we think
any thing too hard to be done or suffered with him:
<hi>without me you can do nothing,</hi> says he, and <hi>I am able
to do all things,</hi> or <hi>can all things,</hi> (so the Apostles
word is,) <hi>through Christ that strengthens me.</hi> All things.
Oh! that is a big word, yet a true word, and thus
made good through Christ impowering me; that
frees it both from falsehood and vanity. A humble
confidence, for it is not in himself, but in Christ and
this boasting is good, <hi>my Soul shall make her boast in
God,</hi> says <hi>David.</hi> Oh! they have only warrant to

I am often foiled, yea, I cannot find that I prevail at

from thine own imagined strength, to make use of
his real strength, and be not hasty, think not at very
first to conquer, many a hard conflict must thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve

thing much troubles the patience, and weakens the
Faith of some Christians, that they are ready to think
there is none, yea, there was never any beloved of
God in such a condition as theirs. Thus sometimes
they swell even their outward trials in imagination,
but oftner their inward, which are most heavy and
pressing to themselves, and the parallel of them least
discernable by them in others. Therefore the Apostle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> breaks this conceit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and here is the

and besides the happy end of it, is it not sweet, even
for this simply, because he went in it? yet this

                  <p>HIS Divine Doctrine and Exhortations the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
closes with Prayer, as we follow this
rule in publick after the Word preached: so St. <hi>Paul</hi>
frequently, so Christ himself, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. after that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the preceding Chapters: it were well if both
Ministers and People would follow forth the same way
more in private, each for themselves, and each for
the other: and the want of this is mainly the thing that
makes our preaching and hearing so barren and fruitless;
the Ministers of the Gospel should indeed be as the
Angels of God, going betwixt him and his People, not
only bringing down useful Instructions from God to
them, but putting up earnest supplications to God for
them. In the <hi>10th.</hi> of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the Disciples are sent forth
and appointed to preach: and in the <hi>11th.</hi> we have
them desiring to be taught to pray; <hi>Lord teachus to pray,</hi>
and without this there can be little answer or success
in the other, little springing up of this Seed, though
Ministers sow it plentifully in preaching, unless they
secretly water it with their prayers and tears.</p>
                  <p>And People truly should keep some correspondence
in this duty, and that if other engagement will not
perswade, even for their own advantage, for it returns
unto them gainfully; if much of the Spirit be poured
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:104216:239"/>
forth on Ministers are they not the more able to
unfold the Spiritual Mysteries of the Gospel, and
build up their People in the knowledge of them;

                     <hi>But the God.</hi>] The Prayer suits the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
word in his direction to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Chapter 4. 6.
'tis supplication with thanksgiving, prayer with praise.
In the prayer or petition, consider the Matter, the Stile.
The Matter or thing requested in divers brief words,
which though they be much of the same sense, yet are
not superfluously multiplied, for they both carry the
great importance of the thing, and the earnest desire
in suiting it: and though it be a little light and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solid
to frame a different sense to each of them, nor
are any of the ways that such kind of Interpreters have
taken in it very satisfactory to any discerning judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet I conceive they are not altogether without
some profitable difference, as the first [<hi>perfect</hi>] carries
more clear than the rest, their advance in victory over
their remaining corruptions and infirmities, carrying
them on towards perfection. <hi>Stablish</hi> hath more express
reference to both the inward lightness and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
that is natural to us, the counterblasts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
and tentations; and to outward oppositions,
and imports the curing of the one, and support a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the other. <hi>Strengthen</hi> the growth of their
graces, especially gaining of further measures of those
graces, wherein they are weakest and lowest. And
<hi>settle,</hi> though it seems the same, and in substance is
with the other word <hi>stablish;</hi> yet it adds somewhat to
it very considerable, for it signifies to found or fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a sure foundation; and so indeed may have an
aspect to him who is the foundation and strength of
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:104216:240"/>
Believers, on whom they build by faith, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
in whom we have all, both victory over Sin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Grace, and establishment of Spirit, power to
persevere against all difficulties and assaults; he is
that corner foundation stone laid in <hi>Sion,</hi> that they that
build upon him, may not be ashamed, that Rock that
upholds the House founded on it in the midst of all
winds and storms.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Obs.</hi> These have in them that which is so primely
to be sought after by every Christian, perseverance and
progress in Grace. These two here interwoven, for
there be two words importing the one and two the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and are interchangeably plac'd: this is often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
them as their duty, and accordingly ought they
to apply themselves to't, and use their highest diligence
in it, not to take the beginning of Christianity for the
end of it, to think it enough they are entered into the
way of it, and sit down upon the entry, but to walk
on, to go from strength to strength, and even through
the greatest difficulties and discouragments, to pass
forward with unmoved stability and fixedness of
mind. To be aiming at perfection, this we shall
still fall exceedingly short of, but the more we study
it, the nearer to it shall we come, the higher we aim,
the higher shall we shoot, though we shoot not so high
as we aim,</p>

of a Christian, to be daily outstripping himself, to be
spiritually wiser, holier, more heavenly minded to
day than yesterday, and to morrow (if it be added to
his life) than to day, every day loving the World
less, and Christ more than the former, and gaining
every day some further victory over his secret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
his passions more subdued and mortified,

his desires in all temporal things more cool and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,

more solided and fixed upon God, aspiring to more

them up, faith more confirmed and stayed, love more
enflamed, composed meekness making more deep
humility. Oh! this were a worthy ambition indeed,
you would have your Estates growing, and your credit
growing; how much rather should you seek to have
your graces growing, and not be content with any
thing you have attained to.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Obs.</hi> But all our endeavours and diligence in this
will be vain unless we look for our perfecting and
establishing from the right hand, without which we do
nothing, thither the Apostle moves his desires for his
Brethren, and so teaches them the same addr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ss for
themselves, <hi>the God of all Grace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This prayer is grounded (as all prayer of faith must
be) on the promise and covenant of God. He is our
Rock, and his work is perfect; he doth not begin a
building, and then leave it off, none of his designs
break in the middle, or fall short of their end, <hi>he will
perfect that good work, which he hath begun, to the day of
Iesus Christ,</hi> Phil. 1. And how often is he called the
<hi>strength of those that trust on him,</hi> Psal. 18. 30. <hi>Their
Buckler, and his way perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence is the stability of grace and perseverance of
the Saints, 'tis founded upon his unchangeableness, not
that they are so, though truly sanctified, if they and
their graces were left to their own manage. No, 'tis
he, that not only gives that rich portion to those he
adopts to be his Children, but keeps it for them, and
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:104216:241"/>
them in the possession of it, he maintains the lot of our
Inheritance. And to build that perswasion of perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
upon his truth and power engag'd in it, is no
presumption, yea, 'tis high dishonour to him to
question.</p>
                  <p>But when Nature is set to Judge of Grace, it must
speak according to it self, and therefore very unsuitably
to that which it speaks of. Natural wits apprehend
not the spiritual tenour of the Covenant of Grace, but
model it to their own principles, and quite disguise it,
and they think of nothing but their resolves and moral
purposes, or if they take a Notion of Grace confused,
they imagine it put into their own hands to keep or lose
it, and will not stoop to a continual dependance on the
strength of another, rather chuse that game of hazard,
and it is certain loss and undoing to do for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

is the immediate assisting power that bears up the
Soul under the greatest services, and backs it in the
hardest conflicts, fresh auxiliary strength, when we and
and all the grace we have within, dwelling in us is
surchar'd, then he steps in, and opposes his strength to
a prevailing and confident enemy, that is at point of

which I will put forth for thy assistance.</p>
                  <p>And this is the great advantage and comfort, that we

meaning the great distance, and so the difficulty of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aid, when need should require: but we may be

our King can, and will hear us when we call, and will

but we shall not be wholly vanquisht, 'tis but cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him in our greatest streights, and help appears
the Host of Enemies possibly we see first, and that so
great that there is no likely escape, but then praying
we espy the fiery Chariots and Horsemen, and may say,
<hi>there are more with us then with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls our God, <hi>the God of all
Consolation,</hi> as here he is stil'd <hi>the God of all Grace,</hi> and
this is our rejoycing, that in his hand is all good, our
Sanctification Consolation, Assistance and Assurance,
Grace and Glory: and this stile suits most fitly
with the present sute, that for our perfecting, and
stablishing, and strengthning in Grace, we have recourse
to the God of all Grace, whose former gifts do not
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:104216:244"/>
discharge us from seeking more, but indeed both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
us, and engages him for the perfecting of it. It
is his will that we have constant recourse to him for all
we want; he is so rich, and withal so liberal, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
that we seek and draw much from him, and 'tis
by believing and praying that we do draw from him;
were these plyed we would soon grow richer; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
all this grace, that we would receive from the
God of all grace, it must be from God in Christ, there
it flows for us, thither we are directed, <hi>it was the
Fathers good pleasure that in him should all fulness dwell,</hi>
and that for us, that we might know whether to go
to.</p>
                  <p>Now for the further opening up of his riches, exprest
in this title, <hi>the God of all grace,</hi> is added one great act
of grace, which doth indeed involve all the rest; for
we have in it the beginning and end of the work linkt
together. The first effect of grace upon us, in effectual
calling, and the last accomplishment of, it in
<hi>Eternal Glory. Who hath called us to his Eternal
Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For that calling, I conceive, doth not simply mean
the design of the Gospel wherein the outward call lies,
that it holds forth and sets before us that Glory as the
result of Grace. But the calling is the real bringing of a
Christian to Christ, and uniting him with him, and so
giving him real and firm title to Glory, such a call as
powerfully works Grace in the Soul, and secures Glory
to the Soul, gives it right to that Inheritance, and
fits it for it, and sometimes gives it even the evident
and sweet assurance of it, this indeed all the heirs of
Glory have not ordinarily within them, and scarce any
at all times equally clear, some travel on in a covert
cloudy Day, and get home by it, having so much
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:104216:245"/>
light as to know their way, and yet do not at all clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see the Sun shine of clear assurance, others have it
breaking forth at sometimes, and anon under a Cloud,
and some more constantly. But as all meet in the end,
so all agree in this in the beginning, that is, the reality
of the thing, they are made unalterably sure heirs of it,
in their effectual calling.</p>
                  <p>And by this the Apostle advances his suit for their
support, and establishment, and advancement in the way
of Grace: the way of our calling to so high and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
an Estate, did we apply our thoughts more to't,
it would work on us and perswade us to a more sutable
temper of Mind, and course of Life, would give us
more Noble sublime thoughts and ways above the
World: and the stronger were our perswasion of it,
the stronger would be in us such perswasions by it. And
as thus it would prevail with us, so might we use it to
prevail with God for all needful Grace.</p>
                  <p>All you that hear the Gospel are generally called to
this Glory; thus it is told you where and how you may
lay hold on't, you are told, that if you will let go
your sins and embrace Jesus Christ, this Glory shall be
yours; it is his purchase, and the rights of it sics in
him, and are not elswhere, and right to him is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him for a Saviour, and withal for Lord and
King, to become his Subjects, and so be made Kings;
and this is our message to you, and you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, you give it a hearing, it may be, but do not
indeed hearken to the motion, and this of necessity
must be unbelief: were you indeed perswaded that in
coming unto Christ, you were presently not only set
free from a Sentence of Death, that is still standing
above your head while you are o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>t of him; but with
all intitled to a Crown, made heirs of a Kingdom, an
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:104216:245"/>
Eternal Kingdom, I say if this were believed, were it
possible to slight him as the most do, and turn back the
bargain, and bestow their money elswhere upon trifles
of no value, Childrens Commodities, rattles and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
toys? such are your greatest projects, were it even
for Earthly Kingdoms, in respect of Christ and this Glory
provided in him. What a wonder is it, that, where
this happiness is daily proclaimed, and not only you
are informed of it, but intreated to receive it, not
only is it offered you, but prest and urg'd on you,
and you say you believe the matter; and yet the false
glory and other vanities of this World, amuse and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
you, that you close not with this rich offer of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Glory?</p>
                  <p>But they who do, it is indeed by a call that goes
deeper than the Ear, a word spoken home to within,
a touch of the Spirit of God upon the heart, which
hath a magnetick vertue to draw it, so that it cannot
chuse but follow, and yet freely and sweetly chuses to
follow; doth most gladly open to let in Jesus Christ and
his sweet Government upon his own terms, takes him
and all the reproaches and troubles that can come with
him, and well it may, seeing beyond a little passing
trouble, abiding Eternal Glory.</p>
                  <p>The State a Christian is called to, 'tis not a poor
and sad Estate, as the World judges, it is to no <hi>less</hi> than
<hi>Eternal Glory,</hi> the World thinks strange to see the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
abridge himself the delights of sin, their pursuits
and graspings of the common World after gains, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
or pleasures of sense, and they know not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
gain that he hath made, that he hath exchanged
this Dross for down weight of pure Gold. The World
sees what the Chrihian leaves, but they see not what
he comes to, what his new purchase is, in another
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:104216:246"/>
place; they see what he suffers, but not what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
and shall attain as the end of these sufferings,
which will shortly end. But he knowing well upon
what conditions all these things run, he may well say,
<hi>how small is that I forsake, how great that which I follow
after.</hi>

nor reality. But the Glory above is true real
Glory, and bears weight, and so bears aright the
name of Glory, which in the Hebrew signifies <hi>weight,</hi>
and the Apostles Expression seems to allude to that sense,
speaking of this same Glory to come, calls it a <hi>far more

with them when they have caught it, and they stay'd

how would it stir to praise, when we think of such an
one there, who will bring us up in the way to this
Crown, how will this hope sweeten the short sufferings
of this Life, and Death it self, which is otherwise the
bitterest in it self, most of all sweetned by this, as being
nearest it, and setting us unto it; what though thou art
poor and diseased, and despised here? Oh! consider
what is there, how worthy the affection, worthy the
earnest eye look of an heir of this Glory; what can he
either desire or fear whose heart is thus deeply fixed?
Who would refuse this other clause to suffer a while, a

how soon shall all this be overpast, and then overpayed

that are not much in Prayer, and they know
little of the greatness and goodness of God, that are not
much in praises. The humble Christian hath a heart
in some measure fram'd to both, he hath within him the
best School Master that teaches him how to pray, and
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:104216:247"/>
how to praise, and makes him delight in the exercise
of them both.</p>

                  <p>The living praises of God spring from much holy
affection, and that affection springs from a Divine Light
in the Understanding, so says the Psalmist, <hi>sing ye prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

Psal. 47.</p>
                  <p>It is a spiritual Knowledge of God that sets the Soul
in tune for his praises, and therefore the most can bear
no part in this Song, they mistune it quite through,
their ignorance of God and unacquain ance with him.

and mistune it.</p>

reverence of his praises at the hands of the common
ungodly World, when even his own people fall so far
behind in it, as usually they do, the dead cannot praise
him, but that they, that he hath quickned by his Spirit,
should yet be so surprised with deadness and dullness,
as to this Exercise of exalting God, this is very strange:
for help of this,</p>
                  <p>1. We should seek after a fit temper,<note place="margin">Direct. 1.</note> labour to have
our hearts brought to a due disposition for his praises;
and 1. That they be spiritual, spiritual services require
that, but this most, as being indeed the most spiritual
of all: affection to the things of this Earth draw
down the Soul, and make it so low set, that it cannot
rise to the height of a Song of praise, and thus if we
observ'd our selves, we would find, that when we let
our hearts fall and entangle themselves in any inferiour
desires and delights, as they are unfitted generally for
holy things, so especially, for the praises of our holy
God. Creature loves, abase the Soul and turn it to
Earth, and praise is altogether heavenly. 2. Seek a
heart purify'd from self-love, and possest with the love
of God: the heart that is ruled by its own interest, is
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:104216:249"/>
scarce ever content, still subject to new disquiet; self
is a vexing thing, for readily all things do not sute our
humours and wills, and the least touch that is wrong
to a selfish mind distempers it, and disrelishes all the
good things about it: a childish condition it is, if crost
but in a toy, throw away all. Whence are our frequent
frettings and grumblings, and that we can drown a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
high favours in one little displeasure, and still our
finger is upon that string, more male-content and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
for one little cross, than praises for all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
we have received? Is not this evidently the self-love
that abounds in us? Whereas were the love of God
predominant in us, we would love his doings and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposals
and bless his name in all: whatsoever were his will
would in that view be amiable and sweet to us, however
in it self harsh and unpleasant. Thus would we say in
all, this is the will and the hand of my Father, who
doth all wisely and well, blessed be his name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Soul thus framed would praise in the deep of
troubles, not only in outward afflictions, but in the
saddest inward condition, would be still extolling God,
and saying</hi> however he deal with me, he is worthy to be
loved and praised, he is great and holy, he is good and gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious,
and whatsoever be his way and thoughts towards me,
I wish him glory: if he will be pleased to give me light and
refreshment blessed be he, and if he will have me to be
darkness, again blessed be he, glory to his name; yea what
though he should utterly reject me, is he not for that to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
infinitely merciful in the saving of others, must he
cease to be praise worthy for my sake: if he condemn, yet he
is to be praised being merciful to so many others, yea even
in so dealing with me is he to be praised, for in that he is
just.</p>
                  <p>Thus would pure love reason for him, and render
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:104216:250"/>
praise to him, but our ordinary way is most untoward
and unbeseeming his creature, the best of them, much
more such worms as we are, that things must rather be
to our mind than his, and we must either have all
our will or else for our part he shall have none of his
praises.</p>
                  <p>3. That which on these two will follow, a fixed
heart, if it be refined from creature-love and self-love,
spiritualness and love of God will fix it, and
then shall it be fit to praise, but an unstable uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
heart can never be, no more than an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be harmonious and fit to play on, that
hath loose pins, that are still slipping and letting
down the strings, pins that never fasten: and thus
are the most, cannot fix to Divine Thoughts, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
God, to behold and admire his excellency, and
goodness, and his free love. Oh! that happy word
of <hi>David</hi> worthy to be twice repeated, when shall
we say it, <hi>O God my heart is fixed,</hi> well might he
add, <hi>I will sing and give praise,</hi> Oh! that we would
pray much that he would fix them, and then
he having fixed them, we would praise him
much.</p>
                  <p>2. If any due disposition be once attained for praises,<note place="margin">Direct. 2.</note>
then must the heart so disposed be set to study the
matter of praises.</p>
                  <p>And that (1.) The infinite excellency of God
in himself, which though we know little of, yet this
we know and should consider it, that it is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what all the creatures and all his works are
able to testify of him, that he transcends all we can
speak, or hear, or know of him. (2.) Look on him
in his works, behold not the vast Heavens above,
nor the firm Earth beneath us, nor all the variety
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:104216:250"/>
of his works in both, without holy wonder stir'd in
us, and that stirring us to sing praises. Oh! his
greatness, and might, and Wisdom, shining in these,
<hi>Lord, how manifold are thy Works, in Wisdom hast
thou made them all.</hi> But above all that work, that
marvel of his works, the sending of his Son forth
of his bosom, and that is the mystery the Apostles
do so magnifie in their writings, and that so much
in this Epistle, and that the chief incentive to this
close in praise, ascribing glory to him. This praise looks
particularly back to the stile in the prayer, the God
of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory
by Jesus Christ, so many other mercies, but chiefly
for that choice of mercies, to his glory; <hi>who hath
called us to his glory,</hi> then look through the work of
saving his Chosen, so redeemed by the blood of
his Son, his maintaining his own work in them
against all the enemies and oppositions about it, the
advancing it in the midst of them, and even by them,
and bringing them safe to glory, that perfecting and
establishment as in the foregoing words; it is that,
that so affects the Apostle in the very entry of this
Epistle, that there he must break forth into praise, Chap.
1. <hi>ver 3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Iesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath
begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Resurrection
of Iesus Christ from the dead.</hi> He begins there in
praise, and here ends in it, and so incloses all within
that Divine Circle. And as we would consider these
things in general, so his particular dealing with us,
his good providence in spirituals and temporals,
would we search, Oh! what a surcharge of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ercies would each of us find, and were we
better acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, had more
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:104216:251"/>
our delight in them, they would acquaint us better
with all these things, and give us light to see them,
and warm our hearts, and excite them to his praises, who
is the God of all our mercies.</p>
                  <p>3. The heart somewhat disposed to praise,<note place="margin">Direct. 3.</note> and then
studying the matter of it, would be applyed actually
to render praise. (1.) To aim at God in all, which
is continued praise, to eye his glory in every thing,
and chiefly to desire that, that his name may be exalted;
this is the excellent way indeed; whereas most are either
wholly for their self ends, or often squinting out to
them. That Soul is most noble that singly and fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aims at exalting God, and seeks this stamp on all it
speaks, and does, and desires, all to the greater glory of my
God. (2.) To abound in the express and solemn
return of praise this way. <hi>To him be glory,</hi> not a custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
dead saying of it over, as is usual with us, but the
heart offering it up. What is so pure and high as this
exercise, the praises of the ever glorious Deity? What is
Heaven but these? and were it not best, as we can, to begin
it here, and long to be there? where it shall never end.
<hi>To him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
