         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to haue the solemnities thereof perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in this present Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the time approaching, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
pleasure signified, and preparation
made accordingly, on VVednesday, the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of May last, his Highnesse accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(besides the ordinary traine of his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold)
with diuers young Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of speciall marke, departed from his
house of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> towards Richmond, where
being come towards euening, he supped and
reposed himselfe for that night.</p>
                  <p>Next morning, being Thursday about
nine of the clocke, he tooke water to returne
againe to London, attended only with some
few Barges of his owne followers, and such
Noblemen and others, as accompanied him
thither the day before.</p>
                  <p>Passing softly downe the streame, he was
seuerally encountered by diuers Lord, swhich
came to meete him on the way: the Thames
<pb facs="tcp:23169:3"/>
began soone to flote with Botes and Barges,
hasting from all parts to meete him, and the
shores on eyther side, where conueniency of
place would giue way to their desires, swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with multitudes of people, which stood
wayting with greedy eyes to beholde his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
passage.</p>
                  <p>About eleuen of the clocke, vnderstanding
that the tide was falne so low, as there would
not be conuenient roome for all the Barges in
his traine to go orderly downe, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his first appointment was to haue come
to London about noone, and dinner prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for him accordingly at White-hall, hee
made stay at Barne-Elmes, and there landing,
refreshed himselfe in an Arbour by the water
side, and tooke a short repast of such sweete
meats and other things, as could there be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
on the sudden.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Lord Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of London with the seuerall Companies
of the Citie, honorably furnish't and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and disposed in faire order, were ready at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
with a great traine and sumptuous
showe, to receiue his highnesse at Chelsey:
<pb facs="tcp:23169:4"/>
their Barges deck't with banners, streamers
and ensignes, and sundry sortes of loud-soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Instruments, aptly placed amongst
them.</p>
                  <p>There were also two artificiall Sea-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
one in fashion of a Whale, the other like
a Dolphin, with persons richly apparrelled,
sitting vpon them, who at the meeting and
parting of the Lord Mayor and his company,
with the Prince, were to deliuer certaine spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
vnto him.</p>
                  <p>In this goodly manner this well furnish't
Fleete of the City receiued his Highnes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
beyond Chelsey about two of the clock
in the afternoone: and after the Lord Mayor
and Aldermens salutation, humbly presented
and gratiously accepted by his Highnesse,
they turned their stemmes, and so proceeded
towards London: obseruing this course, that
whereas at their approach the Lord Mayors
Barge, came foremost, and the Companies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one in their degrees followed after; now
that order being chaunged, the Companies
went before, the meanest in place first, the rest
according to their seuerall rankes successiuely
<pb facs="tcp:23169:4"/>
ensuing, and lastly the Lord Mayor atten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
with his two Sea-monsters on eyther
side, going immediately before the Prince
and conducting his ioyfull passage to the
Citie.</p>
                  <p>Next after the Princes Barge followed
his seruants, &amp; the Barges of sundry Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and others which had met him on
the way; and on euery side, such a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
company of Botes of all sortes fraught
with beholders, as it seemed the Riuer
(though then enlarged to her vtmost limits
by the tides friendly aduantage) was too
little to containe them: as likewise the land
on eyther shore, which neuer felt the
weight of such an infinity of people vpon
any former occasion.</p>
                  <p>Approaching neereto VVhite hall, the
King and Queene with the young Duke of
Yorke and Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> stood in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
Gallerie window, to see the order of
their comming, and that his Maiestie
might take the better viewe of the Lord
Mayor and Citizens show, they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to passe along on London side,
<pb facs="tcp:23169:5"/>
whilst the Prince in the meane while fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
a Compasse about by Lambeth; and
so comming to VVhite-hal bridge (where
the Lord Maior and Aldermen tooke leaue
of his highnesse) there landed, his landing
being congratulated with a loude peale
of Chambers from the other side of the
water: which in their thundring voyces
carried vp to the skie, the ioy of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
hearts conueyed in the issue of these
happy triumphs.</p>
                  <p>At his highnesse comming on shore his
seruants attended vpon the bridge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
him, making a Guard for him to
passe thorow to the hall, where he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by the Lord <hi>Knols,</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Wotton</hi> Treasurer and Controller of the
houshold: likewise in the great chamber
by Vicount <hi>Fenton</hi> Captaine of the Guard,
in the Presence by the Earle of Suffolke,
Lord Chamberlaine, and lastly by the
King and Queene in the Priuy chamber.
After which his highnes reposed himselfe,
and so ended that dayes solemnity.</p>
                  <p>On munday following the Lords and
<pb facs="tcp:23169:5"/>
Peeres of the Realme being all assembled
in Parliament, his Maiesty accompanied
with the Prince, who was that morning
to be inuested in his Principalitie, tooke
water at the priuy staires at White hal, and
landing together at Westminster bridge,
his Maiesty passed directly to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-house,
and the Prince to the Court of
Wardes, from whence, after a whiles tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for the disposing of things in due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
his highnesse proceeded in this maner
to his Creation.</p>
                  <p>First went the Heralds and Officers of
Armes in their rich coates, next followed
the Knights of the Bath, being fiue and
twentie in number, apparrelled in long
Roabes of purple Satin, lyned with white
Taffata; then <hi>Garter</hi> principall king of
Armes, bearing the Letters Patents, the
Earle of Sussex the purple Robes, the train
borne by the Earle of Huntingdon, the
Earle of Cumberland the sword, the Earle
of Rutland the Ring, the Earle of Derby
the Rod, and the Earle of Shrewsbury the
cap and Coronet. His Princely highnesse
<pb facs="tcp:23169:6"/>
supported by the Earles of Nottingham
and Northamp: on came bare headed, and
so entring the Parliament chamber, where
the king was set in his Throne, and the
whole state of the Realme in order (diuers
strangers and forraigne Ambassadours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
present) he made low obeysance to his
Maiestie three times, and after the third
time, when he was come neere to the king,
kneeled downe on a rich pillow or cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whilst the Earle of Salisbury read his
Letters Patents. Then his Maiestie at the
reading of the wordes of Inuestiture put
the Robes vpon him, and girded on the
sword, inuested him with the Rod and
Ring, and set the Cap and Coronet on his
head; with which ceremony the creation
being accomplished, he arose, and was by
the Earles of Worcester &amp; Suffolke brought
and seated in his place of Parliament on
the left hand of his Maiestie.</p>
                  <p>Hauing so remained a while, all ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
finished, his Maiestie with the whole
Court of Parliament, rose vp and discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into the hal, passing forth towards the
<pb facs="tcp:23169:6"/>
bridge in solemne and stately manner: the
foremost as they proceeded in order, were
the Clerkes and Masters of the Chance<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

with the Kings Councell and other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the law: next came the officers of
Armes, and then the Knights of the Bath as
before: after them the Iudges, and so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuely
the Barons, Vicounts, Earles,
Marquesses and Dukes, according to their
degrees in the Parliament house and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of state all in their Parliament roabes;
and lastly, the King himselfe, with the
Prince, who tooke water together, the
trumpets sounding in the Row-barge all
the way as they went, and the Heralds go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before them in the same. At White-hal
staires they landed, where the knights of
the Bath and Noble-men being landed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
stood ready on the bridge in goodly
and gallant order to receiue them, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all before them, conducted them in
this manner vp to the great Chamber.</p>
                  <p>The king that day dined aboue, but the
Prince dined in the hall &amp; was serued with
great state and magnificence. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed
<pb facs="tcp:23169:7"/>
at his table with diuers great
Lords, as the Earles of Notingham, Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
Worcester and Derby, and namely all
those that exercised any place or office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his creation.</p>
                  <p>At another table in the same roome on
the left hand of the Prince sat the knights
of the Bath, all vpon one side, and had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
great seruice and attendance.</p>
                  <p>About the midst of dinner Garter princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
king of Armes, with the rest of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds,
approached the Princes table, and
with a loud and audible voyce, proclaimed
the kings stile, in Latine, French, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
thrise, and the Princes in like manner
twise, then the trumpets sounding, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
course came in, and dinner done, that

                  <p>At night a stately maske was presented
before his Maiestie, the inuention &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

of them, I could not passe them ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some remembrance. Therefore thus
much out of the note of directions from

the Commissioners appointed
for the ouersight and direction of
<pb facs="tcp:23169:10"/>
these ceremonies, the Lords &amp; others that
were to receiue the honourable order of
the Bath, repaired on Saterday the second
of Iune to Durham house in the Strond,
and there in the afternoone heard euening
prayer, obseruing no other ceremony at
that time but only passing through the
hall, the heralds going before them with
their Coates vpon their armes, into the
Chappel, from whence after seruice ended
they returned into the chamber they
were to suppe in.</p>
                     <p>Their supper was prepared all at one
table, and all sat vpon on side of the same,
euery man hauing an Escutcheon of his
armes placed ouer his head, and certaine of
the kings officers beeing appointed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them. In this manner hauing taken
their repast, the tables were remoued, and
seuerall beds made ready for their lodging,
in the same place, after the same manner,
al on one side, and each one as afore, right
vnder the scutcheon of his owne armes.
Their beds were pallets with coueringste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
or Canopies of red Say, but they vsed
no curtaines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:23169:10"/>The knights in the meane while were
withdrawne into the bathing chamber,
which was the next roome to that they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in, where for each of them was proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a seueral bathing tub which was lined
both within and without with white lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
and couered with red Say. After the
bath they betooke themselues to their
rest.</p>
                     <p>Early the next morning they were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
with musicke, and at their vprising
inuested in their Hermits habits, which
was a gowne of gray cloth girded close, &amp;
a hood of the same, with a linnen coyfe
vnderneath, and a handkercher hanging at
his girdle, cloth stockings soled with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but no shooes; and thus apparrelled,
their Esquires gouernours, with the heralds
wearing the coats of armes, and sundry
sorts of winde instruments going before
them, they proceeded from their lodging
downe through the hall, the meanest in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for most as the night before, till they
came to the chappell. Where after seruice
ended their oath was ministred vnto them
<pb facs="tcp:23169:11"/>
by the Earle of Worcester and the Earle of
Suffolke, in a solemne and ceremonious
manner, all of them standing forth before
their stalles, and at their comming out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
low reuerence towards the Altar, by
which the Commissioners sate; then were
they brought vp by the heralds by two at
once, the chiefest first, and so the rest till all
successiuely had receiued their oath: which
in substance was this. That aboue al things
they should honour God and maintaine
true Religion, loue their soueraigne, serue
their country, help maidens, widdowes, &amp;
orphans, and to the vtmost of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cause equity and iustice to be obserued.</p>
                     <p>This done whilest they were yet in the
Chappell, wine and sweet meates were
brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; then they departed to their
chamber to be disrobed of their Hermits
weeds, &amp; new reuested againe in Robes of
Crimson taffata lined with white sarcenet,
hauing white hats on their heads with
white feathers, white boots on their legs, &amp;
white gloues tyed to the strings of their
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tles. Al which performed, they mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on
<pb facs="tcp:23169:11"/>
horsbacke, their saddles being of black lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and bridles of the same, with white
crosses vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their brests &amp; cruppers of their
horses; each Knight betweene his two es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
well apparrelled, his footeman at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
and his page riding before him,
carrying his sword with the hilts vpward,
and his spurres hanging thereon.</p>
                     <p>In this order rankte euery man according
to his degree, the best or chiefest first, they
rode faire and softly towards the Court,
the trumpets sounding, and the heralds all
the way riding before them. Beeing aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the Court gate, they were conducted
by the heralds and others appointed for
that purpose, into the hall, where his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
sitting vnder his Cloth of estate gaue
them their knighthood in this manner.</p>
                     <p>First the principall Lord that is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the order comes led by his two Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and his page before him bearing his
sword and spurres, and kneeleth downe
before his Maiestie. The Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine
takes the sword of the page and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
it to the King, who puts the belt ouer
<pb facs="tcp:23169:12"/>
the necke of the knight aslope his brest, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the sword vnder his left arme. Then
two noble men of the chiefe about the
King put on his spurres, and so is the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
performed. In this sort the Earle of
Oxford which was the principall of this
number, beeing first created, the rest were al
consequently knighted alike: and when
the solemnity thereof was fully finished,
they all returned againe in order as they
came, sauing some smal difference, in that
the youngest or meanest knight went now
formost, and their pages behinde them.</p>
                     <p>Comming back to Durham-house, their
dinner was ready prepared in the same
roome, and after the same fashion as their
supper was the night before, but being set,
they were not to taste of any thing that
stood before them, but with a modest car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and gracefull abstinence to refraine,
diuers kindes of sweet musicke being play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the while, and after a conuenient time
of sitting, to arise &amp; withdraw themselues,
leauing the table furnished to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squires
and pages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:23169:12"/>About foure of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone
they rode againe to Court, to heare
seruice in the kings Chappell, keeping the
same order they did at their returne from
thence in the morning: euery knight ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
betweene his two Esquires and his
page following him. At their entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Chappell, the Heralds conducting
them, they make a solemne reuerence, the
the youngest knight, beginning the rest or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
ensuing: and so one after another take
their standing before their stalles, where all
being placed, the eldest knight maketh a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
reuerence, which is followed to the
youngest; and then all ascend into their
stalles, and take their accustomed places.</p>
                     <p>Seruice then beginneth, and is very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely
celebrated, with singing of diuers
Antheames, and playing on the Organes.
And when the time of their offertory is
come, the youngest knights are summoned
forth of their stalles by the Heralds, doing
reuerence first within the stalles, and againe
after they are discended: which is likewise
imitated by all the rest. And being al thus
<pb facs="tcp:23169:13"/>
come forth, standing before their stalles, as
at first, the two eldest knights with their
swords in their handes, are brought vp by
the Heralds to the Altar, where they offer
their swords and the Deane receiues them,
of whom they presently redeem them with
an Angell in golde, and then come downe
to their former places, whilst two other are
led vp in like manner: so doing successiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
till the whole ceremony be performed:
which done, and seruice ended they depart
in such order as they came, with accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
reuerence.</p>
                     <p>At the Chappell doore as they came
forth, they were encountered by the kings
Master Cooke, who stood there with his
white Apron and Sleeues, and a Choping-knife
in his hand, and challenged their
spurres, which were likewise redeemed
with a noble in money, threatning them
neuerthelesse that if they proued not true
and loyall to the King his Lord and Mast.
it must be his office to hew them from
their heeles.</p>
                     <p>On Monday morning they al met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:23169:13"/>
again at the Court, where in a priuate
roome, appointed for them, they were
cloathed in long roabes of purple sattin
with hoods of the same, all lined and edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about with white taffata. And thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled
they gaue their attendance vpon
the Prince at his creation, and dined that
day in his presence at a side-bord, as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
declared.</p>

fo the custome) that I, beeing imployed in the busines,
should publish a discription and forme of the late

Maiestie to solemnize the creation of the high

to preserue the memorie thereof, and to satisfie their
desires, who could haue no other notice, but by others
report of what was done. Which I doe not, out of a
desire, to be seene in pamphlets, or of forwardnes to

divulging hereof, to giue it other colours then those it
wore, or to make an Apologie of what I haue done:
knowing, howsoeuer, it must passe the way of censure,
<pb facs="tcp:23169:17"/>
whereunto I see all publications (of what nature
soeuer) are liable. And my long experience of the

affection, and conceipt had to doe: but onely serued to
entertaine their owne partialnesse, who were fore-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
and so was a labour in vaine. And it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an argument of pusilanimitie, and may make <hi>vt

cause suspected by too much labouring to defend it,
which might be the reason that some of the late grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Princes of Christendome would neuer haue their
vndertakings made good by such courses, but with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
indured (and in a most wittie age) the greatest
batterie of paper that could possibly be made, &amp; neuer
once recharged the least ordinance of a pen against it,
counting it their glorie to do whilest other talked. And
shall we who are the poore Inginers for shadowes, &amp;
frame onely images of no result, thinke to oppresse the
rough censures of those, who notwithstanding all our
labour will like according to their taste, or seeke to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid
them by flying to an Army of Authors as idle as
ourselues? Seeing there is nothing done or written, but
incounters with detraction and opposition, which is
an excellent argument of all our imbecillities &amp; might
allay our presumption, when we shall see our greatest
knowledges not to be fixt, but rowle according to the
vncertaine motion of opinion, and controwleable by
any surly shew of reason, which we find is double ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and strikes euery way alike. And therefore I do not
see why any man should rate his owne at that valew,
<pb facs="tcp:23169:17"/>
and set so low prises vpon other mens abilities. L'<hi>hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
vaut l'homme,</hi> a man is worth a man, and none hath
gotten so high a station of vnderstanding, but he shall
find others that are built on an equall floore with him,
and haue as far a prospect as he, which when al is done,
is but in a region subiect to al passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; imperfections.</p>
                  <p>And for these figures of mine, if they come not drawn
in all proportions to the life of antiquity (from whose
tyrannie, I see no reason why we may not emancipate
our inuentions, and be as free as they, to vse our owne
images) yet I know them such as were proper to the
busines, and discharged those parts for which they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
with as good correspondencie, as our appointed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
would permit.</p>
                  <p>But in these things wherein the onely life consists in
shew: the arte and inuention of the Architect giues the
greatest grace, and is of most importance: ours, the least
part and of least note in the time of the performance
thereof, and therefore haue I interserted the discription
of the artificiall part which only speakes M. <hi>Inago Iones.</hi>

pedestals and were al of gold. Behinde them were two

deuises: and these bore vp a rich Freeze, wherein were
figures of tenne foote long, of flouds, and Nymphes,
with a number of naked children, dallying with a dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie,

<hi>Zephirus</hi> with eight Naydes, Nymphs of fountaines,
and two <hi>Tritons</hi> sent from <hi>Tethys</hi> to giue notice of her
intendement, which was the Ante-maske or first shew.
The Duke of Yorke presented <hi>Zephirus,</hi> in a short robe
of greene satin imbrodered with golden flowers
<pb facs="tcp:23169:19"/>
with a round wing made of lawnes on wyers, and hung
down in labels. Behind his shoulders two siluer wings.
On his head a Garland of flowers consisting of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and on one Arme which was out bare, he wore a
bracelet of gold set with rich stones. Eight little Ladies
neere of his stature represented the Naydes, and were
attired in light robes adorned with flowers, their haire
hanging downe, and wauing with Garlands of water
ornaments on their heads.</p>
                     <p>The Tritons wore skin-coates of watchet Taffata
(lightned with siluer) to shew the Muscles of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
From the waste almost to the knee were finnes of
siluer in the manner of bases, a mantle of Sea-greene
laced, and fringed with golde, tyed with a knot vppon
one shoulder, and falling down in foldes behinde, was
fastened to the contrary side: on their heads garlands
of Sedge, with trumpets of writhen shels in their hand:
Buskins of Sea-greene laid with siluer lace. These per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
thus attired, entred with this song of foure parts,
and a musicke of twelue Lutes.</p>

                     <p>The Speech ended, the Naydes daunce about <hi>Zephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
and then withdraw them aside, when suddenly at
the sound of a loud and fuller musique, <hi>Tethys</hi> with her
Nymphes appeares, with another Scene, which I will
likewise describe, in the language of the Architector,
who contriued it, and speakes in his owne mestier to
such as are vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders &amp; louers of that design. First at
the opening of the heauens appeared 3. circles of lights
and glasses, one within another, and came downe in a
straight motion fiue foote, and then began to mooue
circularly; which lights and motion so occupied the
eyes of the spectators, that the manner of altering the
Scene was scarcely discerned: for in a moment the
whole face of it was changed, the Port vanished, and
<hi>Tethys</hi> with her Nymphes appeared in their seuerall
Cauernes gloriously adorned. This Scene was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
into 5. Neeces, whereof that in the middest had
some slender pillowes of whole round, and were made
of moderne Architecture in regard of roome: these
were of burnisht gold, and bare vp the returnes of an
Architraue, Freeze, and Cornish of the same worke:
<pb facs="tcp:23169:21"/>
on which, vpon eyther side was a Plinth directly ouer
the pillers, &amp; on them were placed, for finishings, two
Dolphins of siluer, with their tailes wreathed together,
which supported ouall vases of gold.</p>
                     <p>Betweene the two pillers on eyther side were great

                        </gap>elieuo, the Basement were two huge
Whales of siluer. Aboue in an action mounting were
two Sea-horses, and aboue them, on each side of <hi>Tethys</hi>
seat was placed a great Trident The seate or Throne
it selfe was raised sixe steps, and all couered with such
an artificiall stuffe, as seemed richer by candle, then any
cloth of gold. The rests for her armes were tvvo Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubines
of gold: ouer her head was a great skallop of
siluer from which hung the foldes of this rich drapery.</p>
                     <p>Aboue the Skallop and round about the sides was
a resplendent freeze of iewell glasses or lights, which
shewed like Diamonds, Rubies, Saphires, Emralds, and
such like,</p>
                     <p>The part which returned from the two Plinthes that

of siluer, in mannner of a fountaine, with mask-heads
of gold, out of which ran an artificiall water. On the
middest of this was a triangular basement formed of
scrowles &amp; leaues, and then a rich Vayle adorned with
flutings, and inchased worke with a freeze of fishes, and
a batta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

into the Bowle vnderneath. On the top of this was
a round globe of gold full of holes, out of which issued
aboundance of water, some falling into the receipt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
some into the Ovall vase, borne vp by the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phines,
and indeed there was no place in this great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatick

throne, that was not filled with the sprinckling
of these two naturall seeming waters. The Neeces
wherein the Ladies sate, were foure, with Pillasters of
gold, mingled with rustick stones shewing like a mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to make it more rocke, and Cauern-like, varying
from that of <hi>Tethys</hi> throne. Equall with the heads of
the Pillars was an Architraue of the same work, aboue
was a circular frontispice, which rose equall with the
Bowle of the fountaine fore discribed. On the rustick
frontispice lay two great figures in Rileue, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to beare vp a Garland of Sea-weeds: to which
from two antick Candlestickes which stood ouer the
Pillasters were hanging Labells of gold. And these
were the finishings of the top of the two Neeces next
to that of <hi>Tethys.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the space betweene the frontispice and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitraue
stood a great Concaue shel, wherein was the
head of a Sea-god, and on either side the shell to fill vp
the roome, two great mask heads in perfile. The other
two Neeces which were outermost, were likewise
borne vp with Pillasters of gold, and for variation had
square frontispices, and against the streight Architraue
of the other was an Arch. All these were mingled with
rustick, as before.</p>
                     <p>In the middle betweene the frontispice &amp; the Arch,
was a Bowle or fountaine made of foure great skal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops,
borne vp by a great maske head which had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
foure aspects, and lying vpon this Arch (to fill vp
the Concaues) were two figures turned halfe into fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
these with their heads held vp the sides of this
Bowle: aboue this were three great Cherubines heads
spouting water into the Bowle. On the middest of the
square frontispice stood a great vase adorned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:23169:22"/>The rest of the ornaments consisted of maske-heads,
spouting water, swannes, festons of maritime weedes,
great shels, and such like; and all this whole Scene was
filled with the splendor of gold and siluer: onely some
beautifull colours behinde to distinguish them, and to
set off the rest.</p>
                     <p>The whole worke came into the forme of a halfe
round: there sate three Ladies in each Neece, which
made sixe of a side: the Queene in the middest, and the
Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at her feete.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning their habite: first their head-tire
was composed of shels and corrall, and from a great
Muriake shell in forme of the crest of an helme, hung a
thin wauing vaile. Their vpper garments had the bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of sky-colored taffataes for lightnes, all embrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with maritime inuention: then had they a kinde of
halfe skirts of cloth of siluer imbrodered with golde, all
the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d work cut out for lightnes which hung down
ful, &amp; cut in points: vnderneath that, came bases (of the
same as was their bodies) beneath their knee. The
long skirt was wrought with lace, waued round about
like a Riuer, and on the bankes sedge and Sea-weedes,
all of gold. Their shoulders vvere all imbrodered vvith
the vvorke of the short skirt of cloth of siluer, and had
cypresse spangled, ruffed out, and fell in a ruffe aboue
the Elbow. The vnder sleeues vvere all imbrodered as
the bodies: their shoes vvere of Satin, richly imbrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
with the worke of the short skirt.</p>
                     <p>In this habite they discended out of their Cauernes
one after another, and so marched vp with winding
meanders like a Riuer, till they came to the Tree of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
which was a Bay erected at the right side of the
state, vpon a little mount there raised, where they offer
<pb facs="tcp:23169:22"/>
their seuerall flowers in golden vrnes which they bare
in their hands: whilst a soft musique of twelue Lutes
and twelue voyces, which entertained the time, exprest
as a Chorus, their action in this manner.</p>

                     <p>This songe and ceremony ended they fall into their
