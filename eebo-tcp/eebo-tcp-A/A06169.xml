            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Candish</hi> (whose memorie if I repent not, I lament not) it was my chance in the librarie of the Iesuits in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> to find this historie in the Spanish tong, which as I read delighted me, and delighting me, wonne me, and winning me, made me write it. The place where I began my worke, was a ship, where many souldiers of good reckning finding distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed stomackes; it can not but stand with your discretions to pardon an vndiscreete and vnstaied penne, for hands may vary where stomacks miscary. The time I wrote in, was when I had rather will to get my dinner, then to win my fame. The order I wrote in, was past order, where I rather obserued mens ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds lest they should strike me, then curious reason of men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne mee. In a worde, I wrote vnder hope rather the fish should eate both me writing, and my paper written, then fame should know me, hope should acquaint her with me, or any but miserie should heare mine ending. For those faults (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen) escaped by the Printer, in not being acquainted with my hand, and the booke printed in my absence, I must craue you with fauour to iudge of, and with your wonted curtesies to correct; and according to Ecclesiasticall law, giue vs on our confession absolution: if you will not, remember this, that a countrie lasse for Ladies, may tell them they curle too much; and for Gentlemen, that they are vnfashioned by their fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To be short, who liues in this world, let him wincke in the world; for either men prooue too blinde in seeing too litle, or too presumptuous in condemning that they shoulde not.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He blushing morning gan no sooner appeare from the desired bed of her old paramor, &amp; remembring hir of hir <hi>Cephalus,</hi> watered the bosome of sweete floures with the christal of hir teares: but both the armies (awaked by the harmonie of the birds, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded their melody in euery bush, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to arme them in their tents, &amp; speedily visit their trenches: Among the rest the two emperors (the one, <hi>Protomachus</hi> of <hi>Mosco,</hi> the other, <hi>Artosogon</hi> of <hi>Cusco</hi>) considering with themselues, the care Princes ought to haue that commaund multitudes; the prefixed houre of their fight alreadie arriued, sodainely armed themselues, commanding their corronels by sound of trumpet to draw out their companies into the plain: Then marched forth ech squadron, deaffing the aire with their cries, dimming the sunne with the reflexion of their costly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, their high lookes promised happy forwardnes, and their haughtie hearts were portraied in their dreadlesse demeane. At the last embattailed in due order, the pikemen in a <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> phalanx, the horsemen in their out-wings, the shot as gards to the pikes, al as protectors of their colours, the fatall charge was sounded, and both the armies marched forward to incounter; (when sodainly an old man, whose sober lookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened his seuere thoughts, whose morneful garments, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, his melancholie minde,) bearing the Image of the Gods, (whom he most honoured) betweene his armes, and the homage a true subiect ought to haue in his heart, thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe betweene both the armies, when sending many sighes
<pb facs="tcp:7259:4"/>
from his breast to famous pittie, and teares from his eies to moue compassion, he fixed both his hands on their knees (who were neerely encountered to enter combate) and began in their termes to perswade both the monarchs (whilst both the armies withdrew their weapons, to giue diligent attention to his words:) Stay your vnbridled furies, O you Princes, &amp; let not the world say, that you who were borne to be the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the monarchies, are (through your il-gouerned furies) become the destroyers of mankinde. Whereto tendeth this your vniust armes? if for your priuate grudges; oh how fond are you, that to reuenge your mislikes, are the murtherers of many innocents? If to enlarge your signiories; oh how vaine are you, that seek to attaine that with bloud, which you must keepe with care; that labor to sell that with stripes, which you haue bought with peace; that trauel to loose your own estates and signiories, for alitle name of souerainty? Heare me O you Princes (nay rather be aduised by me:) you haue spent huge treasures, made many widdowes, lost three yeares, and for what I pray you? for the right of one citie, the whole confines and reuenewes whereof is not sufficient to acquit for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of your charges: O vnhappy <hi>Mantinea,</hi> the cause of such hartburning: O lawles name of seigniory, the occasion of such sorrows. Heare what <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, Ye potentates, there is no warre that taketh head amongst men, but of vice: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the loue of pleasure, either couetousnes, ambition or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of rule, prouoketh the same. If this be true, as it is most certaine, why blush you not (Princes) to behold your owne follies? why reconcile you not to amend your misdeedes? If you say there are more pleasures in <hi>Mantinea,</hi> then in your seueral countries, you detract from whole prouinces, to make proud one poore cittie: and if it were, what a vaine thing is it, that such as are in authority should purchase a priuate delight by publike danger? <hi>Plato</hi> being demanded why he praised the <hi>Lydians</hi> so much, and dispraised the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, answered thus: If I commend the <hi>Lydians,</hi> it is for that they were neuer occupied but in tilling the field: and if I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> it is because they knew nothing else but to conquer Realmes: so vertuous a thing hath it bin
<pb facs="tcp:7259:4"/>
held by the learned to maintaine peace, and to shunne occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of contention. If you will be held vertuous and monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies (as I wish you should be) desire nothing to the domage of your common weales, lest in satisfying your owne humors ye subuert your subiects happines. If for couetousnes ye hunt after conquests, how vaine are you, labouring like mad men to lay more straw on your houses to burn them, and cast more water on the sea to drowne it? Couetousnes is an affection that hath no end, an extreame that hath no meane, a profit full of preiudice. Wel said <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Politikes, there is no extreme pouertie but that of couetousnes. If for ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wel may ye weep with <hi>Alexander,</hi> to be laughed at, practise with <hi>Zenos,</hi> to repent with him: for in desiring beyond your reach, you fall besides your hopes. But if all these euills be growen to one head, if your incontinencie in desire, your excessiue thirst after pleasure, your couetous longing after riches, your ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious hunting after seignioritie, haue occasioned this warre; subdue these errors in your selues for your subiects sakes: and sith <hi>Protomachus</hi> hath one daughter, and no more to inherit <hi>Mosco,</hi> and <hi>Artosogon</hi> one sonne and heire to suceede in the Empire of <hi>Cusco</hi>; let both these be ioyned together in happie matrimonie: so shall the cause of this different be quicklie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, your selfe may roote out your ingrafted errors, your subiects enioy their desired peace, and finally, your Children shal haue greater cause to praise their fathers foresight, then to repent hereafter their vniust furie. Hereunto I coniure you, O you Princes, by these holy gods, whom you honour, by these hoarie haires which you should reueren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their nobilitie (who after long debate and consultation, and cheare behoouefull) drew to an accord: wherin it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that <hi>Arsadachus</hi> the youthful heire of <hi>Cusco</hi> shoulde bee sent to the emperor of <hi>Mosco,</hi> where, (considering the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his court) he shuld find fit companions, &amp; apply himself to fancie, being continually in the presence of his faire <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garita</hi>: finally (after the decease of both the Princes) it was enacted that both <hi>Mantinea</hi> and the whole empire, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to <hi>Arsadachus,</hi> and <hi>Margarita</hi> and their heires for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

It was strange to thinke, and more strange to behold, in what order Art mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with nature, and how the lymning painter had almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded nature in life, sauing that the beauteous faces wanted breath, to make them aliue, not cunning to proue them liuely. Thus was both the emperor and his daughter lodged, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting neither delights of hunting, nor other princely plesures, to entertain them: so curious was the good olde man, in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his emperor and master. But among al other courtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights <hi>Margarita</hi> met not the least, who in this castle found a companion to accompanie hir in life, and a chaste maide to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her in loue, who (beside hir education, which was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, hir virtues such as equalled excellence, hir beauty so rare as exceeded both) was beloued by a noble lord of <hi>Moscouy,</hi> who for his singularities in poetry, &amp; science in feats of arms, was rather the seignior, then second of al the empire. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange of which affections was so conformable to the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the princesse, that she, who was ordained to be the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of loue, learnd by them &amp; their maners the true methode of the same: for when <hi>Minecius</hi> courted his <hi>Philenia, Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita</hi> conceited her <hi>Arsadachus</hi>; and by perceiuing the true heart of the one, supposed the perfect habite of the other.

This said, he gaue <hi>Minecius</hi> a mightie stroake on the head, so that the blood ouerflowed his costly attire, and he fell to the ground. <hi>Philenia</hi> halfe madde with melancholie, leapt from her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey to comfort her paramour: and seeing the whole troope of assailants ready to charge her husband, and assured that <hi>Arsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dachus</hi> was the chiefe of them, with such a piteous looke as <hi>Venus</hi> cast on bleeding <hi>Adonis</hi> shee behelde <hi>Minecius,</hi> and wiping his wounds with one hand, and touching the knees of <hi>Arsadachus</hi> with the other, she spake thus: Ah Cuscan prince though thy face is shadowed, I knowe thee by these follies, though thy raiments are changed, I iudge thee by thy rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, what seekest thou? if my fauour, it is already bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed:

In speaking these words she beheld <hi>Minecius,</hi> who through the grieuousnesse of his wounds, fell in a swowne: wherevpon she casting off all care of life, and hope of comfort, closed her soft lippes to his, breathing the balme of her sighes into his breathlesse bodie, clapping his pale cheekes with her pretie hands, moisting his closed eies, with her christal teares, so that they who were the very authors of her sorow, gan sigh to see her ceremonies.

In the meane while <hi>Arsinous</hi> hauing attained the place of the conflict, found both the murthered bodies swelte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their blouds: whereupon falling from his horse in great furie, he thus exclaimed on fortune.

Ah my deere <hi>Philenia,</hi> deare wert thou to me, that bought thee with much care, and haue lost thee with more: deere wert thou vnto me, who hast cost me many broken sleepes to bring thee vp, many carefull thoughts to bestow thee, more fatherly teares to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent thy ouerthrow, and now hauing reared the fortresse of my delights, the tempest of iniurious fortune hath destroyed it: wo is me that am carefull to publish my paines, and negligent to seeke remedy; fond am I to defie fortune from whom I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flie: ah <hi>Arsinous</hi> weepe not her that may not be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with teares, but seeke to reuenge her; shew thy selfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fatherly in act, then effeminate in teares? Which said, he gouerned himselfe, causing the dead bodies honorably to be couered and conueied with him to his castle, where within a temple erected to chastitie, hee reared a faire tombe of white marble, wherein with the generall teares of the emperour and his whole court, these two faithful louers were entombed, and ouer their graues thus written:

The gods forbid (said <hi>Arsadachus</hi>) that my desires should be so hindered, for (my noble princesse) the delay I seeke, and the order I prescribe you, is rather to ground your fathers affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards me, and get the credite of this seruice then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; yea the loue I beare thee sweete Ladie; (with that hee sighed and sealed it with a kisse) for hauing by this meanes wonne fauour, both our fortunes shall be bettered, our marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age hasted, and our fames magnified.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:7259:19"/>But marke the nature of malice (which as the poet descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth is sleepelesse, restlesse and in satiate) for <hi>Arsadachus</hi> being departed from <hi>Margarita,</hi> and earnestly bent on his reuenge, sought out <hi>Thasilides</hi> the page of <hi>Thebion,</hi> whom he so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly wrought with othes, gifts, and gold, that he made him both promise and practise the meanes to put a certaine scedule into the pocket of his masters gowne which he vsually ware, the which he himselfe had wrote, and wherein he behaued him selfe with such art, as that he had not only counterfeted <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions</hi> hand, but also the names of al such as either he thought his fauorites, or else likely to thwart his proceedings in court (among which hee forgote not <hi>Ctesides</hi> a graue counseller of the emperors, who the day before was very earnest with <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomacus</hi> to marry his daughter, shewing him euident reasons of <hi>Arsadachus</hi> counterfeiting. All these things falling out according to his own deuise and fantasie, he sought out <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion</hi> that night, whom he vsed with the greatest familiaritie that might be: and to insinuate the more into his fauour, hee bestowed on him a poiniard, whose pummel was a bright car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, the haft vnicorns horne, a iewell which <hi>Thebion</hi> had long time greatly desired, praying him of all loues to weare it for his sake; and since he was in such estimation to continue him in the good grace of the Emperour. <hi>Thebion</hi> made proud to be intreated and presented by so high a prince, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed both to weare his gift, and to winne him fauour.

For no sooner gan bright day to chase away blacke darkenesse, and the stooping stares doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the rising sunne, but <hi>Margarita</hi> arose, apparelling herselfe freshly like Maie, in a gowne of greene sendall, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered with all kind of floures in their natiue colours, and remembring her selfe of the affaire she had in hand; she vnder the conduct of loue (who is both a cunning dissembler and nice

Ah my Lord (said <hi>Margarita</hi>) it is loue indeede that disturbes mee, but not that loue that is painted with feathers, wanton looks, that loue that whispereth affections in ladies eares, and whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth womens wittes, making the eie traitor to the heart, and the heart betrothed to the eie; but that loue which was ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by nature, ordained by the heauens, attired by reuerence and duetie, and tired with nothing but death, that loue (and so speaking she wept) hath awaked me, to forewarne you. <hi>Protomachus</hi> somewhat vrged by these teares, rowzed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on his pillow, and began more intentiuely to listen, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her what had hapnes? Ah deare father, said she, this night that is past I was greatly troubled with a grieuous dreame; me thought I saw <hi>Thebion,</hi> a man in high authoritie in your court, attended by many insolent rebels, who violently brake open your maiesties priuie chamber, murthered you in your bed, and dispossest me of my heritage, me thought euen then you cried vnto me; ah <hi>Margarita</hi> help me! and I with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries calling for rescouse, <hi>Arsadachus</hi> came in hastily, who with his sword berest <hi>Thebion</hi> of life, and me of feare: And so you waked and found all false (quoth the emperour) Tut, doate not on dreames, they are but fancies: and since I see (swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus spake <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomachus</hi> smiling, yet smothered he suspect in his heart: for such as haue much, suspect much.</p>
            <p>No sooner were these discourses finished, but <hi>Arsadachus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7259:20"/>
knowing how to take his time, hastily approched the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors chamber, where intimating some occasion of high import, he required to speake with <hi>Protomachus,</hi> and was presently let in. The Emperour conceiuing new suspitions vpon this second assault, beganne to misdeeme: and seeing <hi>Arsadachus</hi> with gastly lookes entring the chamber, was ready to speake vnto him when as the yong Cuscan preuented him, saying: The gods be blessed (noble Emperor) that haue by their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight rid me of feare, and rest you of danger; for sore haue I feared lest your maiestie should haue perished before you had beene aduertised: Alas, why in such dangers are you vnatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon, when the foe is at the doore? why is not the guard in a readinesse? Ah royall Moscouite rowze thee and arise, and honour the sequele of the greatest treason that euer was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued. Why what tidings bringeth <hi>Arsadachus</hi> said <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>? Thus mighty prince (said he) yesternight very late when I entred <hi>Thebions</hi> chamber vnawares, I found his page (his master being absent) laying certaine waste papers out of his pocket vpon his table, perusing which, (as I was accustomed) by reason of the neere familiarity betweene vs, I found one among the rest where (alas that subiects should be so seditious) there was a conspiracy signed by <hi>Thebion, Cte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,</hi> and others (whose names I remember not) to make your mightinesse away, and <hi>Thebion</hi> to enioy the crowne: the maner to execute their stratageme, was when you least suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, this morning; at which time <hi>Thebion</hi> by reason of his neere familiaritie and accesse to you, should enter your cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and murther you. This paper when I had ouer-read, I laide aside, making semblance of no suspition, resoluing this morning early to signifie the whole vnto your maiestie, whose life is my libertie, whose happines is my honour, whose death were my vtter ruine and detriment. <hi>Thebion</hi> a traitor quoth <hi>Protomachus</hi>; are my fauours then so smally regarded? is my curtesie rewarded with such cursednesse? Well <hi>Arsada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> (said he) happy art thou in bewraying it, and vnfortunate he and his confederates in attempting it, for they all shal die.</p>
            <p>This saide, he presently attired himselfe, laying certaine of his trustiest gentlemen in guard behinde the tapistrie of his
<pb facs="tcp:7259:20"/>
priuy closet, expecting the houre of a most cruell reuenge: when as sodainely <hi>Thebion</hi> knocked at the doore, and was presently admitted, who had scarcely said, God saue the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, but euen in the bending of his knees, hee was thrust through by <hi>Arsadachus,</hi> and the other of the guard hearing the broile, came and mangled him in peeces, casting the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due to the Emperours lions according as hee had appointed. <hi>Protomachus</hi> grudging at the sodaine death of <hi>Thebion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to chide <hi>Arsadachus</hi> for his haste, saying, that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient for a subiect to be punished before hee were conuic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Conuicted (said <hi>Arsadachus?</hi> why doth your grace sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his guiltinesse? Beholde saide hee (drawing out the poinyard which <hi>Thebion</hi> had at his back) the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that should haue slaine you, see (saide hee) taking the schedule out of his pocket the confederacie to betray you; and should such a wretch liue then to iustifie? No (mightie Emperour) my soule abhorres it; the care I haue of you will not suffer it; the loue I beare <hi>Margarita</hi> will not indure it. The Emperour ouer-reading the writing, and seeing the poinyard, gaue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible beleefe, and with teares of ioy imbracing <hi>Arsadachus</hi> he said thus: Ah my sonne, the gods haue blessed vs in sending vs such a friend, who hath saued mee from imminent danger, and will make me fortunate by marriage, hold take thee (said he) my <hi>Margarita,</hi> and with her, enioy my empire; and more, take thou my loue, which is so rooted in me toward thee, that death may not vntwine it. <hi>Arsadachus</hi> thanked the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for this fauour, and recomforted <hi>Margarita</hi> with sweete words, being almost dead to see the stratageme passed. Meane while the Emperour gaue present direction to hang all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conspirators, and put them to other tortures, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently without knowing why, or licence to answere, were ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannously executed; so great is the tyranny of princes which are subiect to light beliefe, and led by subtil suggestions.</p>
            <p>The rumour of this accident spread through the Court, moued sundry imaginations in mens minds, some praised <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadachus,</hi> some suspected the practise, all feared; for whereas iustice sleepeth being ouerborne with tyranny, the most secure haue cause to feare; among the rest <hi>Arsinous</hi> wept bitterly,
<pb facs="tcp:7259:21"/>
knowing in himselfe the vertue of <hi>Ctesides,</hi> and remembring him of the murther of his deere <hi>Philenia,</hi> hee could not cease but welme bedlam to crie out on the heauens, whose tragedie we must now prosecute, and leaue <hi>Arsadachus</hi> and his <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garita</hi> to their mery conceits and discourses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Protomachus</hi> after that this late treason had beene disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, beganne to be more warie, to keepe greater guard, and to vse <hi>Arsinous</hi> and the rest of the nobilitie with lesse familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, who good old man, hauing before time beene shrewdly hurt, tooke this vnkindenesse to the heart (for where greatest loue is, there vnkindenesse is most grieuous) for that cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most desperate he sought out the emperour, and finding op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, he humbling him on his knees beganne thus: As <hi>Traiane</hi> (dread Monarch) was commended in Rome for bearing poore mens complaints, so art thou condemned in Mosco for shutting thy gates against all kind of sutors, so as (nowadayes) thou hearest by others eares, workest by others hands, and speakest by others mouthes, where-through iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is made a nose of waxe warmed, and wrought according to all mens pleasures, and the poore are left to complaine: the which the gods (if thou repent not) wil shortly punish in thee.

Ah, banish such a bewitched race of the Cuscans, I meane not out of your kingdome, but out of life; for he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to beholde the heauens, that conspireth against the gods, root out that bloodthirsty yongman, root out that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, roote out that monster, from the face of nature, that the poore deceased ghostes may be appeased, and their poore father pacified. Shew thy selfe a prince now <hi>Protomachus</hi>; the surgeon is knowen, not in curing a greene wound, but in healing a grieuous fistula; the warriour is knowne, not by conquering alittle village, but a great monarchie, and a prince is perceiued in preuenting a capitall pestilence, not a priuate preiudice. That I accuse not <hi>Arsadachus</hi> wrongfully, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my witnesses: which saide, he brought out <hi>Phileniaes</hi> page, who confidently and constantly auowed all he had told his master in the presence of the emperour: wherefore (noble monarch) haue compassion of me, and by punishing this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke

tyranny make way to thine owne eternitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Protomachus</hi> hearing this accusation was sorely moued, now thinking all trueth which <hi>Arsinous</hi> had said by reason of that vertue he had approued in him in times past, now deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it false, in that <hi>Arsadachus</hi> (as he supposed) had lately and so luckily preserued him from death. For which cause, calling the yong prince vnto him, he vrged him with the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the old man, and the yoong ladde his accuser, who shooke off al their obiections with such constancie, that it was to be wondered: what saith he <hi>Protomachus,</hi> am I, who haue lately manifested my zeale in sauing your life made subiect to the detraction of an old doting imagination with his pratling minister, I hope your Maiestie (saith he) measureth not my credit so barely, nor wil ouerslip this iniurie so slightly, since you know, that when the murder was done I was in my bed, when the tragedie was published, I was the first that prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the reuenge; and more, the friendship twixt <hi>Minecius</hi> and me should acquit me of this suspition. But it may be, that this is some set match of <hi>Thebions</hi> confederates that seeke my death, which if it shall be heere countenaunced, I will returne to Cusco, where I dare assure my selfe against al such subtilties. This said, <hi>Arsadachus</hi> angerly departed: for which cause, <hi>Protomachus</hi> fearing his speedy flight, sent <hi>Margarita</hi> to pacifie him; and causing the tongue of the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse lad to be cut out, and his eies to be prickt out with nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, both which were guiltie (as he said) the one of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded seeing, the other of lewd vttering. He banished the olde Duke of Uolgradia, who for all his faithfull seruices, had this lamentable recompence, and remoued himself, his court, and daughter to Mosco, where wee will leaue him a while.</p>

Here <hi>Arsinous</hi> seated himselfe, resoluing to spend the residue of his dayes in studies, praying to the gods continually for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, and to the end (if happily any shoulde passe that way) that his deepe sorrow might be discouered, he with a punchion of steele in a table of white Alablaster engraued this ouer the entrance of his caue.</p>

            <p>The third day being ended, and the honours bestowed on them that best deserued them: the emperour in the chiefest of the festiuall caused the tables to be remoued, and the musicke to be called for; thinking by his meanes to giue loue more fuell, in hope it should burne more brighter: whereuppon the princes betooke them to daunce; and <hi>Arsadachus</hi> as chiefe, led <hi>Margarita</hi> the measures.

To this motion all the assembly easily consented, in that for the most part, they had bin buzzing in their eares, &amp; baiting their harts, whereupon be brought them into a faire arbor, couered with Roses, and honisuckles, paued with Camamile, pinkes, and violets, garded with two pretie christall fountaines in euerie side, which made the place more coole, &amp; the soyle more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

My ghests said he (for name of Princes I haue sent them lately vnto pallaces) now let each of you be thinke him of mirth not of maiestie, I will haue no stoicall humor in this arbour, but all shall be either louers, or loues wel-willers, and for that, each of vs may bee more apt to talk of <hi>Venus</hi>; we wil taste of her frend <hi>Bacchus</hi>; for a draught of good wine, (if <hi>Lamprias</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> may be beleeued) whettes the conceits, and be when he had drunke most, debated best: <hi>Aschilus</hi> therefore ere he had dipped his penne in the inks to write tragedies, diued into the bottome of a wine put to find termes; for as, where the wolfe hath bitten most soundest, the flesh is most sweetest, so wheras wine hath warmed most hotely, the tongue is armed most eloquently, I therefore carowse to you my familiars, and as I giue you licour to warme, so will I crowne you with ioy and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to alay: then haue at loue who list, for me thinks I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie prepared for him: This said be drunke vnto them, and all the rest gaue him the pledge, and being crowned after the manner of the philosophicall banquets, they sate downe.

But to our purpose, since loue is the affection that leadeth vs, at him we will leuill our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, canuassing this question amongst vs, whether bee so best worketh, by the eie, the touch, or the eare, for of the fiue sences I thinke these three are most forcible.

in respect of loue, am confounded in thinking of them, such power hath fancie, where it hath hold-fast.

Our question is of loue faire la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whereat you blush when I speake, and I bowe when I thinke, for he giueth me words to discourse, and courage to decide; for as <hi>Plato</hi> saith, loue is audacious in all things, and forward in attempting any thing: hee yeeldeth speech to the silent, and courage to the bashfull, hee giueth industrie to the negligent, and forwardnes to the sluggard, making a courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a clowne; and lighting on a currish <hi>Minippus,</hi> hee softe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him as iron in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And that the forcible working of the eie may be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to exceed all other the senses, what reason can be greater, since according to euery affection of the heart or distempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the minde, the radiations of the eie are correspondent; if the heart be enuious, the lookes dart ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what I pray you) moued this affection in <hi>Xerxes</hi> but the eie? A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yong man of <hi>Athens</hi> loued so much the stature of good fortune erected neere vnto the <hi>Prytaneum,</hi> that he embraced it, and kissed it, and offered a great summe of money to the Senate to redeeme the same, and not attaining his suite, hee slew himselfe; and what wrought this in this noble yong man but the eie? for this marble image had neither sent to delight the sent, speach to affect the eare, nor other meanes to moue affection; it was then the sole force of the eie which conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the heart each impression, and fixeth each fancie in the same: what resteth there then but to giue the honor to the eie? which as it is the best part in a woman, so hath it the most force in loue. Soft (saide <hi>Plicotus</hi>) claime not the triumph before you heare the triall; for if vertue and the whole praise thereof (as the philosophers say) consisteth in act, let the touch haue the first place, and the eie the second; for lookes doe but kindle the flame, where the touch both maketh it burne, and when it listeth, quencheth the furie.

Quoth <hi>Plicotus,</hi> saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron floures procure sleepe; the Amethist staieth drunkennesse, by which reasons you ought to ascribe as much power to the scent as to the sight. But heare me, you detracters from the touch; the hearb <hi>Alissus</hi> taken in the hand, driues sighes from the heart. Yea but (said <hi>Arsadachus</hi>) the mad elephant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the raine groweth wilde. Yea but the wilde bull tied to the figge tree, and tasting thereof, is no more wrathful (said <hi>Plicotus</hi>) ascribe therefore to the touch farre more then the sight; heape all the argument that can be for the eies, it bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the sickenesse: but wee rather commend the hearbe that purgeth the disease, then the humour that feedeth it, the salue that healeth the wound, than the corrosiue that grieueth it, the floure that comforteth the braine, and not that which cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same: the touch therefore in loue should haue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue which both reareth it, and restraineth it; and that the touch hath greater power then the sight, what greater reason may be alleadged then this, that we only see to desire, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to touch? the furniture of all delight is the taste, and the purgatorie in loue, is to touch, and want power to execute the affection, as may appeare by this example. In the dayes of <hi>Apollonius Tianeus,</hi> who by euery man was held for the fountaine of wisedome, there was an eunuch found out in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> who had vnlawfully conuersed with a paramour of the Kings; for which cause the king demaunded of <hi>Apollonius</hi> what punishment the eunuch ought to haue for that his rash and bold enterprise: no other answered <hi>Apollonius</hi> saue that he liue to behold and touch without further attempt.

               <hi>Stilconos</hi> hearing that question, replied thus: Truely a senslesse desire, which hauing no power of loue but instinct of life, ought neither to be mentioned by modest tongues, nor vttered in chaste hearing: that loue which is gathered by the eie, and grounded in the heart, which springeth on the vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of affection, hauing in it selfe al the principles of musike (as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> saith) as griefe, pleasure, and diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct that loue which the <hi>Graecians</hi> call <hi>Ghiciprion,</hi> which is as much to say as bitter sweete; of that we talke, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which sacred affection I haue both tasted with the eie, and tried by the touch, &amp; haue found so many effects in both, that as the sea ebbes and flowes by the motion of the moone: the <hi>Tropi</hi> of Egypt waxe and waine according to the flouds, and fall of <hi>Nilus,</hi> so haue I by smiles, and louers pleasures, &amp; repulses, found such a taste in loue, that did not the eare claim some greater preheminence, I should subscribe to you both: but as loue beginneth by the sight, and hath pleasure in the touch, so gathereth he his eternitie from hearing, by hearing <hi>Cupid</hi> a boy, is made <hi>Cupid</hi> a god, by hearing <hi>Cupid</hi> scarce fligd gathereth store of feathers; for euen as breath extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth fire in the beginning, but when it is increased, both nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth and strengtheneth it, so loue that is couered members by the aire, and scarce enabled and fashioned by the touch, is angrie with those that discouer him; but when he flies abroad, and braggeth in his wrings, he is fedde with sweete wordes and laughes, at pleasant languish if he faint, kinde wordes do releeue him; if he be sicke, perswasions purge him; if hee misdeeme, reasons recouer him; in briefe, by the eare loue sucketh, by the eare loue thriueth, and by the eare all his es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is fashioned: and for that cause <hi>Melpomene</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psicore</hi>

the Muses are gouernours of our hearing, whereas not any muse or godhead hath any affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the eie or touch: for delight and gladnesse in loue proceedeth from eloquent perswasion, which receiued by the eare, changeth, mooueth, altereth and gouerneth all the passions of the heart. <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita</hi> blushing in that her turne was next, draue <hi>Stilconos</hi> out of his text in this sort: My lord (saide shee) if loue were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the eare, olde men for their wise discourses shoulde winne more credite then yong men for their worthy comlines; or if by the touch, loue had his triall, the diuinitie of loue would be wronged by too much inhumanitie. It must be the eie then which can discern the rude colt from the trained steed, the true diamond from the counterfet glasse, the right colour from the rude, and the perfect beautie from the imperfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour: had not the eie the prerogatiue, loue shoulde bee a monster, no myracle: and were the touch only iudge, the soft Ermine for daintinesse, the Seale for his softnesse, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for his smoothe sweetenesse, would exceede both Ladies best perfections, and the finest skinne of the choicest louer. If by the eare loue were discerned, the Syren by her sweet song should winne more fauour then <hi>Sibilla</hi> for hir science, and the flatterer should be held for the best fauourite: let the eie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue the prerogatiue, which is both curious to beholde, and emperious to conquer. By it the heart may discouer his affections as well as fine phrases, and more sweete hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes beene gathered by a smile then a touch: for by the one, we gather a hope of succeeding pleasure, by the other, a ioy in suspect for feare we be deceiued, which beginneth in a minute and endeth in a moment. All cattes are grey in the darke (said <hi>Calandra</hi>) and therefore (good madam) you doe well to preferre the eie. Yea but said <hi>Ephania,</hi> the eie had neede of a candle to light it, or else (perhaps) the fatte were in the fire. Well (said <hi>Gerenia</hi>) I will trust mine eare then: for where neither the eie seeth, nor the touch feeleth, certainely by darke let me heare the words, for they are the tell-troths, Ah <hi>Gerenia</hi> (said <hi>Stilconos</hi>) trust them not, for they that are false for the most part by day, wil (perhappes) faile you in the night.

these three sences in one, and then tell me the felicitie, when the eie shall giue earnest of the heart, the heart take comfort by the eare, the wordes we haue heard, and the sights wee haue seene confirmed by touch, this is the loue I had rather haue in mine armes then heare it in this place discoursed by argument. Since therefore (my subiects) you are at my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beisance, and vpon my direction are to doe homage to loue, I giue you free licence to discourse, free libertie to looke, the sweetes whereof, after you haue gathered, come to me, and after the priest hath hand-fasted you, come touch &amp; spare not, you shall haue my pattent to take your pleasure.

            <p>Thus passed the affaires in <hi>Mosco</hi> til such time as the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour growing more and more in sicknes; by the consent of his nobles, hasted on the marriage. The rumor whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spread abroad, made euery one reioice; but among the rest, <hi>Margarita</hi> triumphed, who called into open assembly by the Emperour, was betrothed to <hi>Arsadachus</hi> in the presence of the nobilitie, who by his lowring lookes at that time, shewed his discontents; yet will he, nill he, the day was appointed, the sixteenth of the Calends of <hi>March,</hi> next insuing: against which time there were high preparations in Court, and throughout all the prouinces for pastimes. But since it is a most true axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome among the Philosophers, that whereas be many errors, there likewise must needs follow many offences: it must need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow, that since <hi>Arsadachus</hi> was so fraught with corrupt thought, hee should practise and perforne no lesse vngratious corrupt and vngodly actions, for no sooner was hee departed from the presence of the Emperour, but he presently beganne
<pb facs="tcp:7259:31"/>
to imagine how to breake off his nuptialls, forcing in himselfe a forgetfulnesse of <hi>Margaritaes</hi> vertues, her loue and good deserts, so that it may euidently be perceiued and approued that which <hi>Ammonius</hi> saith, that things concluded in neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie are dissolued by violence, and truely not without reason was loue compared to the sunne, for as the sun thrusteth forth his purer &amp; warmer beams through darknes and the thickest cloude, so loue pierceth the most indurate heartes, and as the sunne is sometime inflamed, so likewise is vnstable loue quicklie kindled. Moreouer, as the constitution of that body which vseth no exercise endureth not the sunne, so likewise an illiterate and corrupt mind cannot entertaine loue, for both of them after the same manner are disturbed from their estates, and attainted with sicknes, blaming not the force of loue, but their owne weakenesse. But this difference is betweene loue and the sunne, for that the sunne sheweth both faire and foule things to those that looke on vpon the earth: loue onelie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth care of the beautie of faire things, and onely fixeth the eies vpon such things, enforcing vs to let slip all other. By this may be gathered that <hi>Arsadachus</hi> being vicious coulde not iustly be attainted with loue, but with some slight passion, such as affect the greatest tyrants in beholding the pittifull massacre of the innocent, as shal manifestly appeare by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele: for after long debating in his restlesse minde, somtime to flie the court, and by that meanes to escape the bondage which he supposed was in wedlocke; sometime to make the princes away by poison, ridding himselfe thereby of suspect, and <hi>Artosogon</hi> of hope.

O Prince this last doubt is your least daunger, for where you may command my life, where you are lord of my wealth, can I be so forgetfull of duetie, thinke you to denie you my daughter, whose worth is of too great weakenesse, to entertaine such dignitie? but since it pleaseth your excellence to daine it her in vertuous sort, command me and her to our vtmost powers, we are yours. <hi>Arsadachus</hi> thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in heauen, thanked <hi>Argias</hi> for his courtesie, who at last wholly discouered vnto him, how secret he was to his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, shewing him his sonnet: to be briefe, it was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted that without further delay, <hi>Arsadachus</hi> should bee presently wedded to <hi>Diana,</hi> which was effected so, that both these two married couples in the height of their pleasures, passed their time in wonderfull delight in <hi>Argias</hi> castle. But as nothing is hidden from the aid of Time, neither is any thing so secret which shall not be reuealed: the emperor <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosogon</hi> (by reason of <hi>Arsadachus</hi> continuall abode at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias</hi> house) discouered at last both the cause and the contract: whereupon, storming like the Ocean incensed with a north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east brise, he presently sent for <hi>Argias</hi>; and without either hearing his excuses, or regard of his intreaties, presently caused him to be torne in peeces at the tailes of foure wilde horses, then casting his mangled members into a litter, hee sent them to <hi>Diana</hi> in a present, vowing to serue her in the same sawce her father had tasted, that durst so insolently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to espouse with the sole heire of his empire.

Being arriued in court, hee cloyed the gates thereof with armed men, placing in euery turning of the citie sufficient rowts of guard to keepe the citizens from insurrection: Then ascending the royall chamber where the Emperour his father with his nobilitie were resident, hee prowdly drew him from his seate royall, in which action those of the nobilitie which resisted him were slaine, the rest that tremblingly behelde the tragedie, heard this which ensueth: <hi>Arsadachus</hi> prowdly setting him in his fathers seate, was ready to speake vnto the assembly, when the olde Emperour that had recouered his fall, awaking his spirites, long dulled with age and weakenesse, beganne in this sort to vpbraide his vngracious heire: Uiper villaine and worse, auaunt, and get thee out of my presence.

This said, sorrow stopped the passage of her speech, and they both swowned, bee to beholde his <hi>Lelia</hi> so forlorne, she to see her <hi>Artosogon</hi> so martyred: he that saw <hi>Venus</hi> lamenting <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donis, Aurora</hi> bewailing <hi>Memnon, Mirrha</hi> her tosst for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, saw but the shadow of cares, not the substance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; for this sorrowe of the princes was onely beyond compare, and past beleefe; wherein so long they demeaned themselues, till age and sorrow, after long strife surrendred to death, who pittied the olde princes, being despised of their lewd sonne, and ended their sorrowes in ending them. The rumour of whose fall was no sooner bruited in the eares of <hi>Arsadachus,</hi> but that instead of solemnizing their funeralles, he frequented his follies, instead of lamenting for them, hee laughed at them, causing them for fashion sake to haue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the graue, not for any fauour he bare them: then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for <hi>Diana</hi> to his court, he honoured her as a goddesse, causing his subiects to erect a shrine, and to sacrifice vnto her: and such was his superstitious and besotted blindnes, that he thought it the only paradise of the world to be in her presence, no one was better rewarded then he that could best praise hir; sometimes would he (attiring him like a second <hi>Diana</hi> readie to chace) disguise himselfe like a shepheard, and sitting apart solitarily, where he might be in her presence, he would recount such passions as gaue certaine signes in him of an excellent wit, but matched with exceeding wickednes: among which these tenne, as the most excellent for varietie sake, after his so many villanies, I thought good to set downe in this place.</p>

The tyrant of <hi>Sicely Dionisius,</hi> of whome it is said, that he gaue as great rewarde to those that inuented vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as Rome did to those that conquered realmes) died a priuate man and in miserie.

the emperor of Rome was so disordered in his life, that if all the Romanes had not watched to take life from him, he would haue waited to take life from them; this monster bare a brooch of gold in his cap, wherin was written this sentence: <hi>Vtinam omnis populus vnam praecisè ceruicem haberet, vt vno ictu omnes necarem.</hi> And what was this man in regarde of <hi>Arsadachus</hi>? Truely almost innocent; for the one pretended kindnesse to those that gently perswaded him, but the other neither feared the gods, neither spared his friends, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded iustice, and can such a monster deserue life? The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes when the tyrant <hi>Tiberius</hi> was made away, sacrificed in their open streetes, in that the gods had reft them of such a troublesome wretch; why cease you then (you <hi>Cuscans</hi>) to sacrifice to your gods, to the end they may deliuer you of this trouble-world. It was a lawe among the Romanes, that that childe which had disobeyed his father, robbed any temple, iniured any widdowe, committed any treason to a stranger should be banished from Rome, and disinherited of his fathers possessions; and what hath not <hi>Arsadachus</hi> done of these things? and why is not <hi>Arsadachus</hi> punished? <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dasus</hi> daughters being violated in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged by the magistrates of the cittie; the gods inflicted both the guiltie and vnguiltie with plagues, in that they afflicted not punishment on the offenders: and what can you hope (ye <hi>Cuscans</hi>) that suffer this sincke of sinne to triumph in your pallaces? You will perhappes say, that no man is to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished afore hee be conuicted. And (I pray you) for what

should ill men pleade? since as <hi>Chrisippus</hi> saith, nothing is profitable vnto them. You see testimonies of his murther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eies, tokens of his periury I ring in your eares, his lust the gods abhorre, and shall he yet liue?</p>
            <p>This said, there grew a great muttering among the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and the noise thereof awaked the emperour (whose sleep had stayed the working of the inchantment) who finding him selfe wholy imbrewed with blood, his doores fast locked vnto him, beganne to misdeeme: whereuppon calling and exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his attendants, some of them at last fearefully opened the doores.
