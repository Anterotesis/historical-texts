            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sence. </seg>1</label> Firſt, it is taken for <hi>heaven and earth, this ſtate of the world on earth, &amp; that ſtate of the world in heaven,</hi> which are two worlds, only here will be a queſtion, why heaven ſhould be called a world to come, when it is extant now as well as the earth, which is called the preſent world: To which it may be anſwered, that though heaven be a world now that is extant, yet to us poor creatures here below it is a world to come, though it was created at the ſame time this lower world was, its comfort to Saints that they have a world to come; for wicked men come in for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhare in this, therefore called men of this world; let them take it, its their world; Saints have a world to come, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. but this doth not ſeem to be that which the Apoſtle aimes at here.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sence. </seg>2</label> Secondly, this phraſe may note <hi>the duration of Chriſts kingdome that it is everlaſting;</hi> for ſo in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is uſed to expreſſe <hi>eternity, Mat.</hi> 12. 32. And therefore <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. which we tranſlate <hi>the eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> the Septuagint reads, <hi>the Father of the world to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me,</hi> and ſo Chriſts kingdome is ſaid to be <hi>for ever and ever;</hi> that is, not for <hi>one ever</hi> but for <hi>all evers,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 12. ſaith, that Chriſt after he had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

one ſacrifice for ſinne, <hi>for ever</hi> ſate down at the right hand of God. Now that word <hi>for ever</hi> doth not relate to Chriſts ſitting at Gods right hand, but rather to the ſacrifice he offered, who <hi>for ever</hi> by one ſacrifice took away ſinne; for it may be ſaid that there are not Principalities and powers <hi>for ever,</hi> that Chriſt may ſit for ever at Gods right hand; when this world ends, there will be an end of all Principalities, and powers, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 24. Then cometh the end, when he ſhall deliver up the Kingdome to the Father and ſhall put down all rule,</hi> &amp;c. Take notice in what ſence Chriſt hath a kingdome, and ſits at Gods right hand for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and in what ſence he is ſaid to give up this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Father, I would clear it by two diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Diſtinct. </seg>1</label> Firſt, there is <hi>a naturall kingdome due to Jeſus Chriſt as he is in the God-head, and a naturall inheritance due to him being man, as he is joyned to the God-head:</hi> For ſo hee inherits the priviledges of that ſecond perſon, which is this <hi>naturall Kingdome,</hi> which he obtained, and which was due to him by inheritance, <hi>Heb. 1. 8. To the ſonne he ſaid, thy throne O God is for ever and ever:</hi> he ſpeaks of his <hi>naturall inheritance,</hi> though the right be involved in him as he is God, and ſo he is joyned in commiſſion for ever as God and man with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo in reſpect of this naturall dominion of his all things are ſaid to be <hi>made by him and for him, Col.</hi> 1. 16. Now this <hi>naturall right</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt hath remains for ever, and accordingly many of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which are to be underſtood by his ſitting at the right had of God, they likewiſe muſt remaine for ever.</p>
            <p>As firſt, <hi>a fulneſſe of joy; At thy right hand is fulneſſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118767:4"/>
of joy.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt doth enjoy a fulneſſe of joy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>All that perſonall honour and thoſe glorious abilities</hi> which he was filled and crowned with, when he went firſt to heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. all theſe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to eternity; And they are <hi>naturally</hi> due to Chriſt, though they were beſtowed on him then when he came to heaven; he is thus in commiſſion with his Father, ſo farre as <hi>naturall rule</hi> goes, though in that reſpect leſſe then the Father.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond part of this diſtinction is, that there is <hi>a diſpenſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ory kingdome that Chriſt hath,</hi> and that is, as he is conſidered as Mediator between God and his Church, which <hi>kingdome is given</hi> to him, it is not by <hi>nature due</hi> to him, but as he was the Sonne of God, he was choſen our to exerciſe that power which in this kingdome is held forth, and this is pointed out by his ſitting at Gods right hand, which God gave him as the reward of his obedience, <hi>John 5. 22, 23. The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son;</hi> It is committed to Chriſt, he is that Lord that God hath ſet up to do all his buſineſſe for him viſibly and apparantly; and this kingdome is in a ſpeciall manner appropriated to Chriſt; it is ſo Chriſts, as it is not the Fathers, in a more eminent manner; <hi>the Father judgeth no man.</hi> To appropriate a work to one perſon rather then another, is an act of Gods wiſdome; hence it is that Chriſt hath his work for a time, and afterwards gives it up to another, till the day of judgement be over Jeſus Chriſt hath the government of the kingdome, and ſhall reigne; but after the day of judgment, the kingdom is to be given up to the Father, &amp; the reaſons why God hath
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118767:4"/>
appointed a time of raigning to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, is <hi>to draw all mens thoughts to him;</hi> that is, that all men might honour the Sonne, as they honour the Father. <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. As for every work there is a ſeaſon, ſo likewiſe for every perſon, wherein they ſhall in a ſpeciall manner be more glorious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this was <hi>a reward exceeding due to Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he ſhould have a kingdome appropriated to him for a ſeaſon, that all judgment ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to him, and he ſhould draw all mens eyes to him in a more immediate manner, becauſe he vailed himſelfe in obedience to his Father; therefore the Father to recompence him, he will not appear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo much in the government; ſaith he, let my Sonne take it, I will commit all judgement to him; and ſee the equity of this, becauſe God will put all things under the feet of Chriſt, therefore will he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine give up all things to God, and be ſubject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to him as God-man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. Though Jeſus Chriſt hath this kingdome and means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all his enemies, before he give it up: yet when he is in the height of his dominion, when he is in his full triumph, and hath cleared all the worlds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, then will he give up the kingdome to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which may teach us, when we are higheſt, and moſt aſſiſted and raiſed, to fall down and give glory to the Lord; ſo Jeſus will do when he hath all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his feet, and judged and pronounced ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon all, then will he ſet up his father, deliver up the kingdome unto him, and he ſhall become all in all, this will be the laſt and great ſolemnity of all.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt diſtinction, his naturall kingdome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118767:5"/>
which is due to him as man joyned to God, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains forever, but there is ſomething of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory kingdome to be given up.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Diſtinct. </seg>2</label> The ſecond diſtiction is this; <hi>This Mediators king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it receives a double conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Conſider Chriſt as a Mediator for the Church,</hi> and ſo conſider him as under imperfection, ſinne, or miſery, or any other want, till they ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; or</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider him as he is head to the Church,</hi> made compleat, and perfected in all parts &amp; degrees, that I may explain my ſelf: You may call to mind, that when I opened the third and fourth verſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ſeventh verſe, I told you that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection there were two great deſignes or contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the one was more principall, and cheif, which I called <hi>Gods decree of the end,</hi> what Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne was to make us, and there it was that God choſe us in Chriſt as a head unto abſolute glory, which with Chriſt and in Chriſt we ſhal have for ever in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heavens.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God deſigned the <hi>way unto this end,</hi> and ſo God was pleaſed, that he might ſet off the glory of that perfect ſtate the more; therefore he lets us fall into ſin and miſery, and ſuffers our bodies and ſouls, to be ſeparated, before we ſhall come to that end which God hath deſigned us to; To enjoy this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> we muſt go through a wilderneſſe to it. Now anſwerable to this double deſigne of God, Jeſus Chriſt hath a double relation to his Church, the one <hi>as a head</hi> ſimply conſidered, and ſo were choſen in him, to that perfect ſtate unto which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned us; Secondly, Chriſt hath the relation of <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer

and Mediator</hi> for us, that as we are fallen into ſinne, and miſery, and diſtreſſe, ſo he might redeem us and helpe us; now while the Church is in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate, and hath not all its members, nor they out of all danger neither; though they be in no reall danger, yet they are to give an account of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and there is a final ſentence to be paſt upon them; and in that ſence, there may be ſaid to be forgiveneſs of ſinne in the world to come, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for one, that he may finde mercy at that day; Now while there is any ſuch thing as guilt, or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it, or any imperfection, and till that finall ſentence be paſt, ſo long is Jeſus Chriſt a Mediator for us, and ſo God hath given him <hi>all power in heaven and earth, to give eternall life to them that believe:</hi> Now ſo long as Jeſus Chriſt rules in a way of conflict, and as a Conqueror is deſtroying ſinne and death, and all emnity, alſo raiſing ſoule and body, and bringing them together; in this ſence the Sripture ſpeaks of his <hi>ſitting at the right hand of God;</hi> but when once the finall ſentence is paſt, then this work of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, his reigning, as to deſtroy enemies and ſuch like is over, and then Jeſus Chriſt will preſent us to to his Father, <hi>Loe here I am, and the children which thou haſt given me;</hi> we are now as thou didſt look upon us in thy primitive thoughts in election; ſo he ſtands in relation to them as a head, there we are conſidered as perfect, and the Mediators office is laid down, and God becoms all in all both to Chriſt and us. I would add a third thing to this, &amp; that is, how Chriſt is a King, and ſits at the right hand of God for ever; when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath given up this kingdom of his Redeemer-ſhip unto the Father, yet then he ſhall ſit
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118767:6"/>
down for ever with this honour, that it was he that did exerciſe this office, ſo that there is not a ſoule loſt, nor a ſinne unſatisfied for, nor any enemies unſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is true, he is not a Generall in Warre any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but he ſhall have this honour, that he did all theſe exployts, brought all theſe rebels in; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, &amp; in truth, Jeſus Chriſt ſhall reign more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with the Father after that time of judgement is over, then ever he did before; now he ſhall raigne triumphantly, whereas before he raigned as one in conflict and conqueſt. Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe will ſay, that he never was King ſo much as he ſhall be now; Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ever have the glory of it, that he was that great and glorious Dictator, that he ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all enemies, and delivered up the kingdom peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to his Father, and in ſome ſence ſet the Crown upon his Fathers head, who was as it were in ſome ſence put out of his rule in the world by Satan and wicked men, that did what they liſt; and the Saints they lye under ſin and miſery, and Chriſt he ſubdues all theſe enemies, and preſents all theſe ſoules to the Father with a peaceable rule and government, and this he enjoys with the Father for eternity; now whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Of his kingdome ſhall be no end,</hi> the meaning is, it ſhall not be deſtroyed for ever; its a kingdome that gives way to no kingdome, it ſhall ſtill be continued, though he himſelfe give it up to the Father, and become viſibly and apparently more ſubject then he was before; not in reſpect of his Godhead, for ſo he is never ſubject; nor in reſpect of his manhood, for ſo he is always ſubject; but then Chriſt ſhall acknowledge the Father to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his kingdome, and that he gave him power,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118767:6"/>
and honour, and glory, and then ſhall he reſigne up his Crown to his Father againe from whom he had it; ſo much for the ſecond ſence of the words.</p>

            </p>
            <p>God hath appointed a ſpeciall world, on purpoſe for Jeſus Chriſt, which in Scripture is called <hi>a world to come,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts world:</hi> That as this world was ordained for the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and given to the ſonnes of men: ſo there is a world to come for the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> even as that time after the day of Judgment, is more eminently; for God when he ſhall be all in all: So there is <hi>a world to come,</hi> which is made for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and which the Angels have nothing to do withall, for it is not ſubjected unto them, as this world now is. <hi>Heb. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Angels hath he not put into ſubjection the world to come, whereof wee ſpeake, but one in a certaine place teſtifieth, ſaying, What is man that thou art mindfull of him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou madeſt him lower then the Angels, thou crownedſt him with glory and honour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And hath put all things in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction under his feete: But</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Wee ſee not yet all things put under him, but wee ſee Jeſus Christ, who was made lower then the Angels, crowned with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

We ſee plainly that he ſpeaks there of Jeſus Chriſt as he doth here in the Text: And what he here in the <hi>Epheſians</hi> calls <hi>ſitting at Gods right hand,</hi> there he expreſſeth it to be <hi>his crowning with glory and honour:</hi> And then likewiſe for that paſſage of <hi>all things being under the feete of Chriſt,</hi> which is ſpoken of here in the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> the Apoſtle quotes out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 8 6. which ſpeaks of Chriſts dominion, and that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is no where found in the Old Teſtament, but only there, and quoted likewiſe in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27. all which places relates to Chriſt: Then againe he calls it <hi>a world to come,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. that is ordained for this man, and hee doth the like here in the Text; therefore theſe places compared together, we ſee how they agree. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25. He ſaith, Chriſt muſt reign <hi>till he hath put all things under his feet,</hi> which he quotes out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110. 1 So that theſe places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named, they are all parallel places with the Text, and there is another place parallel with it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. compared with the 13. <hi>verſ. The heavens and earth which are now by the ſame word, are kept in ſtore and reſerved to fire againſt the day of judgement.</hi> And at the 13. <hi>verſe,</hi> in oppoſition to the heavens and earth which are now, he ſaith, <hi>We according to his promiſe looke for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth righteouſneſſe;</hi> that is, we look for <hi>a world to come,</hi> wherein righteouſneſſe dwels: and that theſe places hold forth the ſame thing, appeares by this, that when he had alledged there was to be a new heaven, and a new earth, that is, <hi>a world to come:</hi> At the 15. <hi>verſe,</hi> he quotes <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had written to them of theſe things, and that was in his Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews:</hi> For it's the beſt argument to prove that <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118767:7"/>
wrote the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes;</hi> Hee hath written to you, ſaith he, of this <hi>new world,</hi> and that was in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. there hee wrote of this <hi>new World:</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>unto this give all the Prophets witneſſe,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. And therefore I am not aſhamed to give witneſſe to it too, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10. When they ſaw Chriſt once take the booke, and was inſtalled King, what do their thoughts preſently run out too? it is to <hi>the World to come. He hath made us Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reigne on earth:</hi> To be ſure at the day of Judgment they ſhall, which ſhall certainly be a long day, when all the accounts in the world ſhall be certainly rip't up, and the world ſhall be new hung againſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of their new King, and the glory of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures then wil put down the glory of this old world. We ſee then how this place to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. how parallel they are: Now I would have you conſider likewiſe the ſcope of the 8. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as the Apoſtle brings it to prove this <hi>new World:</hi> And indeed any one that reads that Pſalm, would think the Pſalmiſt doth but ſet out old <hi>Adam</hi> in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in Paradiſe, who was made in his nature a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower then the Angels; One would thinke that were all the meaning, and that the Apoſtle applies it to Chriſt only by way of alluſion: but the truth is, the Apoſtle brings it to prove, and to convince theſe <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that that Pſalm was meant of the Meſſiah whom they expected; ſaith he, <hi>One in a er taine place hath teſtified:</hi> Hee brings it as an expreſſe proof and teſtimony that it was meant of Chriſt, and was not an alluſion only. Now the ſcope is this, as you read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. that <hi>Adam</hi> was a type of him that was to come, namely Chriſt: So in the 8. <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:118767:8"/>
you read there <hi>Adams world is the type of a world to come.</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had his world where there was ſheep, and oxen, and fowles of the ayre: Now whereas it is ſayd in the Pſalm, that <hi>all things were under his feet,</hi> it is not meant <hi>of man in innocency,</hi> but of the Meſſiah, <hi>Chriſt and his world,</hi> which is made of purpoſe for him, as the other world was for <hi>Adam;</hi> That it was not meant of man in innocency properly and principally, appears,</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe it's ſayd, <hi>Out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings haſt thou ordained ſtrength:</hi> There was no babes and ſucklings in <hi>Adams</hi> time, he fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it's ſaid <hi>was to ſtill the enemie &amp; avenger:</hi> But the Devill was not ſtilled by <hi>Adam,</hi> he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him; therefore it muſt be meant of another that ſhould ſtill this enemie: <hi>How excellent</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>is thy name in all the earth,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>this world. Adam</hi> he had a Paradiſe, but he never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated Gods name in all the earth, much leſſe did he ſound it in the heavens.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Adam,</hi> though man, yet he was not the ſon of man, but called the ſonne of God, he came not of a man.</p>
            <p>Againe, take the argument the Apoſtle uſeth; ſaith <hi>he,</hi> this man <hi>muſt have all ſubject to him,</hi> all but God; he muſt have Angels ſubject to him, for <hi>he hath put all things in ſubjection under his feet:</hi> This could not be <hi>Adam,</hi> no not in the ſtate of innocency; but it's true of Jeſus Chriſt, Angels and all were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet.</p>
            <p>2. As it is not ment of man in innocency, ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant <hi>of man fallen neither,</hi> that is as playn
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118767:8"/>
as the other. The Apoſtle himſelfe ſaith, that <hi>we ſee not all things ſubject to him.</hi> Some think that is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the Apoſtle anſwers, but indeed it's a proof to prove that man fallen cannot be meant, for we do not ſee all things ſubject to him: You have not any one man of the whole race of man-kind to whom all things are ſubject; take all the Monarchs of the world, there was never any man that was a ſinner that had all ſubject to him, therefore it is not meant of man fallen: but ſaith he, <hi>We ſee Jeſus crowned with glory and honour,</hi> and therefore it's this man, and no man elſe that is there ſpoken of: And then againe, take notice, that it is not <hi>an Angel</hi> to whom all ſhall be ſubject, but plainly man that is made a little while lower then the Angels, but then crowned with glory and honour.</p>
            <p>And it is not only <hi>this world</hi> that ſhall be in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this man, but it is <hi>a world to come:</hi> For ſaith he, <hi>We ſee not yet all things under his feet, but we ſee Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt crowned with glory and honour:</hi> Therefore it is not <hi>this world,</hi> but there will be <hi>a world</hi> that ſhall be in ſubjection unto Chriſt, when <hi>all things ſhall be under his feete:</hi> And it is that which the 8. <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſpeaks of; beſides Chriſt interprets this <hi>Pſalm</hi> of himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 16. when as they cryed <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and made him the Saviour of the world, the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees were angry at it: and our Saviour confutes them out of this Pſalm, <hi>Know you not, or have you not read, that out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained praiſe,</hi> quoting this Pſalm to ſpeak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; what the meaning is, I refer to what Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> hath written upon the 8. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he interprets it of that man Chriſt principally, that was but a babe, by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118767:9"/>
whom God would ſtil the enemie, it is therefore Jeſus Chriſt to whom only all things are ſubject, &amp; ſhal be put under his feet: He is the ſole manwhom the Pſalmiſt and Apoſtle means, that hath <hi>a world to come,</hi> ordained for him, as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>a world</hi> made for him, ſo ſhall Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> have <hi>a world to come</hi> made for him, this world was not good enough. <hi>When I conſidered</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the work-manſhip of thy hands.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath a <hi>better world,</hi> a better heaven and earth then <hi>Adam</hi> had: <hi>A new heaven and a new earth,</hi> according to his promiſe, when the Saints ſhall reign: <hi>This world he hath not ſubjected to Angels,</hi> none of thoſe Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers rule there: As there are two <hi>Adams,</hi> and the one was the type of the other, ſo there are two Covenants, the Law and the Goſpel; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, they by nature were above the world, and all things in it, and the Law was their Covenant, they were the deliverers and declarers of it, the Law was given by Angels.</p>
            <p>There's a ſecond Covenant, which is the Goſpel, ond that declares and ſpeaks of this <hi>ſecond world</hi> made for Chriſt: Now the Angels, God hath not uſed them to preach the Goſpel, they do not meddle with it, that worke is not carryed on by them; but God hath appointed men to do it, who were babes, and ſucklings; out of their mouth hath he ordained ſtrength, to begin to create this <hi>new world,</hi> but then why is it <hi>a world to come?</hi> If we ſpeak of it as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel beginning of it; becauſe as the other world was 6. days in making, the work went on by degrees, ſo will it be in this new world: and we are now but at the firſt dayes worke, the perfecting of it is to come.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118767:9"/>
Therefore the Kingdome of heaven is ſayd to be like to a grain of muſtard-ſeed, which is the leaſt of all ſeeds, but grows to a great bigneſſe by degrees: The Apoſtle calls converſion a delivering of us from this preſent evill world; there is the firſt days work, and God will never leave till he hath perfected this world: and becauſe the perfection of it was to be afterwards, therefore it was ſayd to be <hi>A world to come:</hi> And as the firſt world had a ſeventh day for the celebration of the Creation in it, ſo hath the new world a Lords day, a Reſt, of which hee ſpeaks in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. Now this world, when it is finiſhed, it ſhall not be ſubject to Angels, but to Chriſt, and his babes and ſucklings, to the man Chriſt Jeſus for whom it was made, and to the Saints who ſhall be the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of this world; as they ſuffer with him, ſo they ſhall reigne with him. Wee do not read that the Angels at the day of Judgement, ſhall ſit upon thrones of Judgement: But it's ſayd of Saints, that they <hi>ſhall ſit upon thrones,</hi> Mat. 19. 20. and ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. And ſo likewiſe Chriſt promiſeth to give the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>tenn Cities</hi> to him that had ten Talents, and improved them; and <hi>five Cities</hi> to him that had five <hi>Talents.</hi> The Devils ſhall be ſhut up; and if they be gone, there needs not the Principalites of good Angels to oppoſe them. That which good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do to the Saints in this preſent ſtate below, that office and worke ſhall the Saints that ariſe from the dead perform unto the Saints that ſhall remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in that world to come. For it is now ſuch as have part in the firſt Reſurrection that ſhall have to do in that world, and not Angels, and it's no abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity neither: And if Angels which have alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118767:10"/>
the face of the Father (as Chriſt ſaith of them) yet have they beene buſied and employed about things below, why may not Saints be ſo too? It will be an honour rather to them: <hi>Thou hast made us Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reigne on earth:</hi> It is true, the Angels ſhall gather the Elect from all the corners of the world, and they are Executioners to throw men to hell: but they that are the Principalities and powers of this vvorld to come, they are men that ſhall judge the Angels, and then ſhall Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be at it's height; and when that is ended, the Kingdom ſhall be given up to the Father.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE laſt time my work was to ſhew you, that between this world as now it is, and the ſtate of things after the day of Judgment, when God ſhall be all in all; that there is a ſtate which the Scripture calls <hi>a world to come,</hi> which is of purpoſe, and in a more ſpeciall manner appointed for Jeſus Chriſt to be King, when he ſhall have all things put under his feet. I quoted divers places to make it good, eſpecially that in the eighth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118767:13"/>
               <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> At the 5. <hi>verſe</hi> of <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. I found it was the Apoſtles ſcope to prove that the Pſalmiſt had prophecyed of a world to come ordained for Chriſt: and he proves it by this, that he was to have a world, wherein hee was to have all things ſubject to him, which was but the ſame thing that follows here in the text: And ſaith he, though we now ſee Chriſt crowned with glory and honour, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. which is all one with ſitting at the right hand of God: Yet, ſaith he, <hi>We ſee not all things put under him;</hi> therefore it proves that there is a world to come, wherein all things ſhall be ſubject to Chriſt. Now then, finding in the Text mention of <hi>a world to come,</hi> wherein Chriſt hath his Kingdome over all, and all things is under his feet; and which in the judgment of moſt Interpreters, is taken out of the 8. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> no ratioall man could imagine; but in the ſame ſenſe that the world to come is taken, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. it muſt be taken here in the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> I ſpent time the laſt day to prove that the Son of Man prophecyed of in the 8. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> that was <hi>to have all things under his feet,</hi> was Jeſus Chriſt: Now I ſhall ſpeak of this, that he hath a world to come ordained for him, and I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my ſelfe in theſe two heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the world to come, mentioned in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 5. wherein Chriſt is to have all things under his feet, it is not this world that now is, or meerly the government that Chriſt now hath; nor it is not the world or ſtate that ſhall be after the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet it is ſaid to be a world to come.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, I ſhall in a few words ſhew what I thinke is meant by that <hi>world to come,</hi> and ſee the ſeverall ſteps and degrees of its growing up to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118767:13"/>
perfection, I ſhall ſpeake a little to theſe two things to cleare up what I delivered the laſt day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I fear I was not well underſtood in what I ſaid, and I ſhall do it with as much brevity as I can.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, <hi>That the world to come mentioned in</hi> Heb. 2. 5. <hi>and prophecyed of in the</hi> 8. Pſalm, <hi>that it is not the world that now is,</hi> that is playn; for the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth the world that now is, from that world to come: <hi>By this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we do not now ſee all things ſubject to him,</hi> and it is the argument by which he proves there muſt needs be <hi>a world to come</hi> that muſt be ſubject to Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 2. 8. Wee ſee not all things now put under his feete,</hi> which implies that there is <hi>a world to come</hi> wherein this is to be fulfilled; take this world now as it is in its ruffe, and it falls farre ſhort of that world to come, wherein all things are to be ſubject to Chriſt, for that is not grown to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we ſee Jeſus now only Crowned, but we ſee not all things ſubject to him; it's true, this world to come is begun, but is not come to its perfection.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall prove, that <hi>it is not the ſtate of the world after the day of Judgement,</hi> and that I ſhall prove likewiſe out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. compared with this place.</p>
            <p>My firſt reaſon to prove that the <hi>world to come</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned for Chriſt, is not that world <hi>after the day of Judgement:</hi> I meane it is not that ſtate then, <hi>becauſe this world to come here ſpoken of which is for Chriſt,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams <hi>world was the type of.</hi> Now looke in to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19, 20, 21, 22. He ſhewes you there, that <hi>Adams</hi> world, that is this very vvorld vvherein novv vvee are, vvhich is the type of that world to come; hee tels you there, that this world that now is, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in it they groane for the manifeſtation of the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118767:14"/>
ſons of God; for ſaith he, <hi>the creature was made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him that hath ſubjected the ſame in hope; for we know that the whole creation groaneth,</hi> &amp;c. Wee may in theſe words plainly ſee that there is <hi>a world to come,</hi> which is not that world or ſtate of things after the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For what will become of theſe creatures then no man can tel, but it is this very individual Creation wherein we live, that <hi>groanes for reſtitution,</hi> and the reſtitution of it is <hi>a world to come,</hi> as the preſent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and bondage of it, is <hi>this world;</hi> then look into the 8. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which is Chriſts world typed out, it is ſayd, that <hi>heaven and earth, the moone and starres, the ſheepe and oxen, the fowls and fiſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they are all ſayd to be ſubject to him.</hi> This cannot be meant after the day of Judgment, for there is nothing after that which heaven and earth, the ſun, moon, and ſtars, the ſheep and oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould ſignifie and typifie; ſo that the <hi>world to come</hi> is a State which is between the ſtate of this world, which is yet in its Ruffe, and height, and that ſtate which is after the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon for it is this; <hi>When this world to come ſhall come, and Chriſt ſhall have all ſubject to him: Now after this ſubjection of all things to him, then ſhall he deliver up the kingdome to his father,</hi> namely after the day of Judgment is over: This is playn in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24, 25. When Jeſus Chriſt is fully in poſſeſſion of this <hi>world to come,</hi> that all things are ſubject to him, then ſhall the ſonne alſo himſelfe be ſubject to him, that put all things under him, ſo that this world of Chriſts ſhall ceaſe after the day of Judgment is over, for then cometh the end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:118767:14"/>
Thirdly, out of the words of the Text, <hi>you have this world and the world to come, wherein there are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, Powers, Mights, and Dominions: Now after the day of Judgement there will be no Principalities, and Mights, and Dominions;</hi> that is plain in 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 24. He ſhall deliver up the Kingdome to his Father, when he ſhall have put down all rule, and power, and authority;</hi> ſo that <hi>the world to come</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, wherein Chriſt is actually to have all things under his feet, it is not that time or ſtate of things after the day of Judgement is ended, nor is it this world or the ſtate of things now: ſo much for the firſt generall head.</p>
            <p>Now I would a little explaine what is meant by <hi>this world to come,</hi> and that but in few words. I would firſt ſhew why it is called <hi>a world,</hi> and then why <hi>a world to come,</hi> and the <hi>ſeverall degrees</hi> and countings on of this world, and when it is <hi>at its perfection,</hi> and when <hi>it ſhall ceaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, why is it called <hi>a world?</hi> (my brethren) you muſt know this; that <hi>as God made this world for Adam, and put all things under him, though not under his feet, for God appointed a world for the ſecond Adam Jeſus Chriſt, and Adams world was but a type of this world, Rom.</hi> 5. 13. its ſaid <hi>Adam was the type of him that was to come,</hi> anſwerably this old <hi>Adams</hi> world which now good Angels, and bad Angels, and ſinfull men rule, it is but the ſhadow of that world which is to come, propheſied of in the 8. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and mentioned in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Yea let me add this, that <hi>God doth take the ſame world that was Adams, and makes it new and glorious;</hi> this ſame creation groans for this <hi>new world,</hi> this new
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118767:15"/>
cloathing; as we groan to be cloathed upon, ſo doth this whole creation, even as God takes the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of mans nature, and engrafts grace upon it, ſo he takes the ſame world, and makes it <hi>a new world, a world to come.</hi> For the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ſame world ſhall be reſtored which was loſt in <hi>Adam;</hi> this God will do before he hath done with it, and this reſtitution of it is the world to come.</p>
            <p>Now then, why is it called <hi>A world to come?</hi> It is called ſo, <hi>though the foundation of it be now laid, and was laid then, when our Lord and Saviour was upon earth, the foundation of it is laid in the new creature.</hi> As the firſt creation began the old world, ſo this new creature begins the new world; and as the old world was ſix days in making, ſo this new world is not perfected at once: the new creature that is in your hearts, it is but the beginning of it.</p>
            <p>Mark in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. how this new world is begun, and but begun, and when it began; <hi>Ver. 2. If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſteadfaſt, how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at firſt began to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by our Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him, God alſo bearing them witneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For unto Angels hath he not put into ſubjection the world to come, whereof we ſpeak;</hi> its plaine, hee ſpeaks before of the preaching of the Goſpel, which was begun to be preached by Chriſt; and though the Angels delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Law, yet this Goſpel which is the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> and the beginning of the <hi>world to come,</hi> whereof we now ſpeak; this Goſpel was not delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Angels, this world to come was not ſubjected to them, they preached it not, neither ſhall they have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118767:15"/>
to do in that world, which the Goſpel begins; ſo that you ſee <hi>this world to come</hi> began when Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach, and therefore obſerve the language of the Goſpel; <hi>Repent,</hi> ſaith <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingdome of Heaven is at hand;</hi> the world to come is coming upon you; ſo our Saviour, <hi>Mark 1. 14. Mat. 16. 28. There be ſome ſtanding here that ſhall not dye,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and yet all were dead that ſtood there long ago; <hi>they ſhall not dye</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>till they ſee the Sonne of man come in his Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The foundation of this world was laid by Chriſt in bringing in the Goſpel, and it was he that was Propheſied of in <hi>Dan. 2. 44. In the dayes of theſe Kings</hi> (whiles Principalites and Powers were ſtanding, he that meant to raigne in the world, came ſtealing in upon it) <hi>In the dayes of theſe Kings ſhall the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſet up a Kingdome that ſhall never be deſtroyed,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>new world</hi> began in the flouriſhing and height of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchie: what did Chriſt when he came into the world, and afterwards went up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? he began this world, before that time the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill was worſhipped as the God of this world, in all parts of it; Chriſt he flings him downe, <hi>Luke 10. 17, 18. I ſaw Satan fall down like lightning.</hi> Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Devil in all thoſe heathen Oracles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by people were deceived; when heatheniſme did not prevaile, then did Jewiſme ſhew it ſelfe, and Chriſt he throws that down too, by the preaching of the Goſpel, the Apoſtle cals this <hi>a ſhaking of the earth:</hi> There was a great deal of the old world gone preſently, and fell down before this new world: Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt he converted by the Apoſtles millions of ſoules over all the world, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Converſion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118767:16"/>
is there expreſſed by the paſſing away of old things; this is the firſt dayes work, for the world is yet to come; this is but a delivering us out of this preſent evill world, and not a ſubjecting of it to Chriſt, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. When Chriſt threw down heatheniſme, and Jewiſme, it was but the firſt dayes work, like a new naile that being ſtrucken in, puts out the old one by degrees. This kingdome of Chriſts ſhall break in peeces and conſume all other kingdomes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. this will eat out all the Monarchies, and glory of the world.</p>
            <p>Now after this firſt days work of throwing down heatheniſme and Jewiſme, then came a night of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was ſet up in the room thereof: what will Chriſt do before he hath done? he will have a ſecond days work, and will not ceaſe till he hath thrown down every ragg, all that droſſe and defilement that Antichriſt and Popery brought into the world: We now are under the ſecond days work, we are working up ſtill to a purer world; it is ſtill this new world, working up to its perfection; and Jeſus Chriſt will never reſt, till he hath not onely thrown out all the droſſe of this world, both of doctrine and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which conformity to the world hath brought in.</p>
            <p>But for a ſecond degree of this work, Jeſus Chriſt will not reſt, till he hath brought in the generallity of men in the world to be ſubject to himſelfe; the world (according to Scripture account) conſiſts of Jews and Gentiles; and how bitterly doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle complaine in his time, of Gods cutting off the Jewes, the generality of the Nation was caſt off: and for the Gentiles, ſaith he, <hi>Who hath beleived our
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118767:16"/>
report.</hi> There was very few of them in compariſon that did come in to Chriſt; but there will come a time, when this <hi>new world</hi> ſhall have a further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when the generality of mankinde, Jew and Gentile, ſhall come into Chriſt: The world was made for Chriſt, and he will have it before he have done, <hi>Rom. 11. 26. All Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.</hi> There he tels us of <hi>a new world</hi> of the Jewes, and for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; he tels you, <hi>They ſhall be caſt in, the vaile ſhall be taken from off all nations, Iſa.</hi> 25. 7. And that which is ſo much aleadged for unity, ſhall one day be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, but it will be when Chriſt is Lord of all the earth, and not till then; Chriſtians will not agree till then, here will be a brave world indeed, that will be another degree of that <hi>world to come:</hi> One ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard and one ſheepfold of Jewes and Gentiles, and that as large as all the world, <hi>John</hi> 10. 16. This was never yet fulfilled, Jewes and Gentiles, were never yet one ſheepfold together, but they ſhall be ſo one day: Read the Prophets, and you ſhall read there of ſtrange things, of glorious times, that ſhall be here upon earth, of all Nations coming into the Church, the mountains of the Lords houſe, being ſet on the top of the mountains, and all Nations flowing unto it, and of great proſperity they ſhall have, which was never yet fulfilled; and there are many fall in and acknowledge thus much, that there ſhall be a glorious church on earth, when the Jews ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but there is a third thing which is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, which here followeth.</p>
            <p>The third degree of this new world is this, that vvhen this glorious time comes that Jeſus Chriſt, as we have ſaid, will call home both Jews and Gentiles,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118767:17"/>
and have <hi>a new world,</hi> in reſpect of the multitudes that ſhall come into him; Chriſt vvill alſo make this new vvorld more compleat, he vvill bring part of Heaven dovvn too, to add to the glory of this ſtate. I ſhall breifly give you ſome grounds for vvhat I ſay, ſuch as for this tvventy years I have not knovvn vvell hovv to anſvver.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay that Chriſt himſelfe ſhall come dovvn from Heaven to reign here on earth; but let it be underſtood that Chriſt ſhall ſtill remaine in Heaven, and there to be his Court, where he ſhall reign both over this world, and the world to come; Yet this I conceive, that part of Heaven ſhall come down and rule this new world, to make the glory of it the more compleat; and that it may clearly put down old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> world; my reaſons and grounds which ſatisfies me in this are theſe.</p>
            <p>If this be not ſo, I do not know how to underſtand that place which ſhall be the foundation of the reſt, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. the whole Capter; but ſpecially the five firſt verſes, you ſhall finde, and ſuch as know that Book, they do acknowledge as much, that in the Chapter going before, both Pope and Turke is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: In <hi>Chap. 19. Ver.</hi> 20. it is ſaid there, <hi>The Beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe Prophet, that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the marke of the Beaſt, and them which worſhipped his Image, theſe both were caſt alive into the lake of fire, burning with brimſtone.</hi> Here we ſee the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet is gone, where is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill? he is left ſtill; therefore in the beginning of the 20. <hi>Chapter,</hi> he tels us, what becomes of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: <hi>I ſaw an Angell come down from Heaven, having
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118767:17"/>
the key of the bottomleſſe pit, and a great chain in his hand, and he laid hold on the Devill, and bound him a thouſand years, and cast him into the bottomleſſe pit, and ſhut him up, ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould deceive the Nations no more, till the thouſand years were ended.</hi> The Devill, though now he travell the Earth up and down, and is ruler over the world, yet here he is kept up, that he may not deceive the Nations: This was never yet fulfilled, it could not be fulfilled, during the times of Antichriſt; for the Devill never deceived the creatures more then he did in that time; and we ſee how it follows in order, after the Beaſt is taken and deſtroyed, then is Sathan bound up: but we know the Beaſt is not yet deſtroyed, therefore this thing is not yet come, and it cannot be after the day of Judgement, his binding up, for he is after his bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be looſned a little ſeaſon: and you ſhall finde that after Satan is let looſe a little while, then the day of Judgement follows, when all the dead ſhall riſe and be Judged, as in the 11, 12, 13. <hi>Verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now take notice, that when the Devill is gone and thus ſhut up for a thouſand years, what ther's done in theſe thouſand years, of that we read in the 4, 5, 6, 7. Verſes, <hi>And I ſaw Thrones, and they ſate upon them, and Judgement was given unto them;</hi> Who are they that have this Judgement given unto them? What is meant by Judgement, but reigning, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that ſuch ſhall have. <hi>And I ſaw the ſoules of them that were beheaded for the witneſſe of Jeſus, and the word of God</hi> (which were the Martyrs in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, under the Roman Emperors perſecution) <hi>and</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which had not worſhipped the Beaſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had received his marke on their foreheads, or in their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118767:18"/>
hands,</hi> which were ſuch as had ſtood it out in the times of Antichriſt, and had not defiled themſelves. <hi>They lived</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years, but the reſt of the dead lived not againe untill the thouſand years were finiſhed,</hi> this is the firſt reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Now it is ſaid by ſome, that the firſt reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a ſpirituall reſurrection, of mens ſouls from the death of ſinne, ſuch interpretations are commonly put upon it: Now I deſire yon would conſider with your ſelves a little, and weigh the place.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all it is the body of men that are ſaid to be dead, that is plaine, for they are ſaid to be beheaded, or ſlaine with the ſword, for the witneſſe of Jeſus. It cannot be ſaid ſo of the ſoule, that it's beheaded or ſlaine with the ſword. And as the death is, ſuch muſt be the reſurrection, but their death was a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall death, and their reſurrection muſt be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And ſaith he, <hi>They lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years.</hi> This is not meant the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that reigned with Chriſt onely there, for ſo they ſhall reigne for ever with him, and ſo they had reigned from the firſt time that they were ſlain, they were with Chriſt in glory; but this reigning is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their riſing from the dead, for ſaith he, <hi>The reſt of the dead lived not againe;</hi> therefore this riſing of theirs is a living againe; <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the firſt reſurrection.</hi> Now (my brethren) conſider further, where doe theſe reigne? It ſeemes it is on earth by this argument, becauſe why elſe is the Devill bound up, he need not be bound up for their reigning in Heaven; but we ſee here as a preparation to their reigning, the Devil is bound: this is a place I could urge multitude of things out off, but I muſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118767:18"/>
I know not likewiſe how to anſwer another place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 10. where we have the the Saints in <hi>Johns</hi> time, ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt made us Kings and Preiſts, and we ſhall reigne on earth:</hi> They do not ſay, vve do reign, but vve ſhall reign on earth, and then joyne with that what is ſaid in 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 13. We according to his promiſe looke for new heavens, and a new earth,</hi> &amp;c. We Apoſtles, we Saints that live now, we look for it; how prove you that? becauſe the uſe he makes of it ſhews as much, as in <hi>ver. 14. Wheréfore beloved ſeeing you looke for ſuch things, be deligent that you may be found of him in peace, without ſpot, and blameleſs.</hi> It could be no argument to them in thoſe times to be holy, and blameleſſe: If they that lived in thoſe times might not perſonally look for it; and what was it which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe the Saints then looked for? it is for <hi>a new heaven and a new earth.</hi> If we take heaven properly, there is new heavens to be made, but the old heavens ſhall continue which was made from the foundation of the world, and where we ſhall ever be with Chriſt after the day of judgment: And how is there a new earth? It ſhall be an earth wherein righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs dwels; becauſe as I ſaid, it will be a new world, ſubject to Jeſus Chriſt, when the new <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> comes down from heaven; if you aske me what the Saints that riſe from the dead ſhall do here in this new world: For that I ſhall give you ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as ſhall take off the abſurdity that ſeems to be in the thing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to tell you what they ſhall not do; <hi>They ſhall not eate and drinke, nor marry, and give in marriage:</hi> So Chriſt tels us in <hi>Mat. 22. 30. The children of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction do none of theſe things:</hi> And therefore to imagine
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118767:19"/>
a Turkiſh heaven here below, is the abſurdity that hath been put upon it, and which indeed made the Fathers, many of them, after the firſt 300. years after Chriſt, to flye out ſo much againſt this ſubject; for there was an opinion then, that Chriſt ſhould reign at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that they ſhould abound in all ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pleaſures and delights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this the Fathers were againſt. I have told you what they do not; I will tell you what they do: he tels us, as I ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>they ſhall be Kings and Prieſts,</hi> as in <hi>Rev. 20. 6. Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> why? <hi>on ſuch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſecond death hath no power;</hi> they are out of all danger of it, being in a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial ſtate: <hi>

That <hi>hee hath not put this world to come in ſubjection to Angels:</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels now, they are the Thrones, and Principalities, and great ones that rules this preſent world, but the Saints ſhall be <hi>Kings then:</hi> And for them to take the Angels places, to be as the Angels now are, after their reſurrection, there is no abſurdity in it: Chriſt ſaith, after the reſurrection, the Saints <hi>they ſhall be as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God,</hi> &amp; they ſhall be <hi>Prieſts likewiſe.</hi> I ſhall take off what abſurdity there may ſeem to be in that by this: Our Saviour when he took up his body out of the grave, he continued forty dayes upon the earth; What did Chriſt do all that while? It is playne, he performed the part of a Prieſt and Prophet; he did inſtruct them in the worſhip of God, and ſpeaking to them of things pertayning to the Kingdome of

God, ſo you read expreſly in <hi>Acts</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. the Apoſtles had a brave Teacher, Chriſt riſen from the dead; ſo he began that <hi>new world,</hi> and he remained forty dayes here of purpoſe to do it: Now conſider, is it any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity for the Saints to be conformed to Chriſt their Lord and head, to run through the ſame ſtates that he did? he lived in this world, was poore and miſerable, ſo are you; when he dyed, he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his ſpirit into the hands of his Father; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ſoul went, our ſouls goe: So likewiſe when he took his body again out of the grave, he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forty dayes upon earth, inſtructing his Diſciples in the things concerning the Kingdome of God: If the Saints do ſo when they take up their bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in all this here is but a conformity to Chriſt, he aſcended then up to heaven, and ſo ſhall his, and be for ever with the Lord.</p>
            <p>But the great objection is, <hi>That the ſoules of men that are now in heaven, and ſee the face of God, for them to come downe and reign on earth, and do ſuch ſervice here below, it would be a diſadvantage to them, or changing a better eſtate for a worſe, which ſeemes to be a great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer, conſider to take off the abſurdity that even this State I ſpeak of will be a better State then what their ſoules are now poſſeſſed of, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST when his body and ſoule was united againe at his reſurrection, was not in a better ſtate then his ſoule was in after death, when it was ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from his body. Certainly his ſtate after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, whilſt upon earth, was better then his ſtate before his reſurrection: but you will ſay, they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118767:20"/>
are now in heaven, where they behold the face of God as the Angels do, which they may looſe by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming here upon earth; that doth not follow, for the Angels came down here below, and yet Chriſt ſaith, <hi>they alwayes behold the face of their father,</hi> ſo may theſe Saints on earth behold the face of God. <hi>Stephen,</hi> though a mortall man, yet the heavens were opened to him: He ſaw the glory of God, and Jeſus ſitting at the right hand of his Father. My brethren, God hath eternity of time to reveale himſelfe to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in: and he doth advance his Favourites by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Firſt, he glorifies their ſouls apart; after when ſoul and body is united, it's in a better condition, ſimply conſidered, then the ſoule had before, how many wayes God hath to manifeſt himſelfe to his Saints, &amp; how many degrees they ſhall paſs through, and how many worlds he will have to do it in, that is known to himſelf, however the more the better. If God ſhall lead you by degrees through this and that glory, from one to another, it will be to your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. As in a Maſque there are ſeveral ſhews, which adds to the excellency of it, God hath eternity of time to make all theſe ſhewes and repreſentations of himſelfe to his children: And let mee adde this, that the will that he fulfilled, which is prayed for in that we call the Lords prayer, <hi>Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</hi> There is a time when the will of God ſhall be done on earth, as compleatly as in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is in that time of the firſt reſurrection: My brethren, I have ſpoken theſe things, as that which hath a great ſhew of truth in it, and as that which is exceeding probable: I have told you my grounds for it, which I could never anſwer my ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:118767:20"/>
Now there is a fourth degree of this <hi>world to come,</hi> and that I am ſure will hold, and that is that time du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the day of judgment, ſtrictly ſo taken, after the generall reſurrection both of juſt and unjuſt: Then to honour this <hi>New World,</hi> not only ſhall the Saints come down, but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf will come down and abide a long day here below: Therefore it is not abſurdity for Saints to leave heaven, when Chriſt himſelf ſhall do it; neither will it diminiſh any thing from Chriſts happineſſe, for he will come and bring all his glory with him. That we call the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be a long day, judg you your ſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will be ſo or no: Do you think that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of all the world can be caſt up in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye? Doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay expreſly, <hi>That God will bring every worke to judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether good or evill,</hi> in <hi>Ecclèſ.</hi> 12. And doth not the Apoſtle ſay in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. That <hi>when the Lord comes, he will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the heart,</hi> Will not this require much time? ſurely it will be a long day, when our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt will do that great work or ſervice to God, the greateſt that ever was, more then all his preaching, which is the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the accounts of all the world, convincing all man-kind of their evill, and ſending them ſpeechleſs to Hell. Things ſhall be ſo there, that the Saints ſhall be able to judg the world too, according to that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
            <p>Now here this new world will be in its height and perfection, here is Chriſt and all his Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels about him: Yet not that this world ſhall be ſubject to Angels, but they ſhall gather all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118767:21"/>
together, and ſhall execute the ſentence that Chriſt pronounceth againſt them, and fling them all to Hell: but the Angels ſhall not ſit as Judges, they ſhall ſtand and not ſit, whereas the Saints are ſayd to <hi>ſit upon 12. Thrones,</hi> and they are ſaid likewiſe in 1 <hi>Cor. 6. To judge Angels:</hi> And now ſhall this <hi>world to come</hi> be at its perfection; that creature that hath groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under mans luſts, ſhall then be fully reſtored to the glorious liberty of the ſons of God, the world will then be new hung; This is Chriſts world to come, wherein he ſhall have all things ſubject to him. For at this time ſhall all things be under Chriſts feet, and never till then; for the laſt enemie that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death: and when all things ſhall be ſubdued to him, then ſhall the ſonne alſo himſelf be ſubject, then ſhall he give up the Kingdome to the Father: And what that State is that ſhall come after Chriſt hath given up the Kingdome to his Father, no man knows, only the Scripture ſaith this of it; <hi>That God ſhall be all in all, and that Chriſt himſelfe ſhall then be ſubject.</hi>
