         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Last Speech and Carriage.
OF THE
LORD RVSSEL, upon the Scaffold, &amp;c.
On Saturday the 21st. of July, 1683.</head>
            <p>ABout Nine in the Morning, the Sheriffs went to <hi>Newgate,</hi> to see if my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>
was ready; and in a little time his Lordship came out, and went into his Coach
taking his Farewel of his Lady, the Lord <hi>Cavendish</hi> and several other of his Friends
at <hi>Newgate;</hi> in the Coach were Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who accompanied
him to the Scaffold built in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-fields,</hi> which was covered all over with Mourning.
Being come upon the Scaffold, his Lordship bowed to the Persons present, and turning to
the Sheriff made this following Speech.</p>
            <sp>
               <p>Mr. SHERIFF.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Expected the Noise would be such, that I should not be very well heard. I was never fond of
much speaking, much less now, therefore I have set down in this Paper all that I think fit to
leave behind me. God knows how far I was always from designs against the King's Person, or of
altering the Government. And I still pray for the preservation of both, and of the <hi>Protestant
Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff, I am told, that Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> Yesterday said some things concerning my knowledge
of the Plot: I know not whether the Report is true or not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sheriff,</speaker>
               <p>I did not hear him name your Lordship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Writer.</speaker>
               <p>No, My Lord, your Lordship was not named by any of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Russ.</speaker>
               <p>I hope it is not, for to my knowledge I never saw him, nor spake with him in my
whole Life; and in the words of a Dying Man, I profess I know of no Plot, either against the
King's Life or the Government. But I have now done with this World and am going to a better, I
forgive all the World heartily, and I thank God I die in Charity with all Men, and I wish all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<hi>Protestants</hi> may love one another, and not make way for Popery by their Animosities. I pray
God forgive them, and continue the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> amongst them, that it may flourish so long
as the Sun and Moon indures. I am now more satisfied to die then ever I have been.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then kneeling down, his Lordship prayed to himself, after which Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi> kneeled
down and prayed with him, which being done his Lordship kneeled down and prayed
a second time to himself, then pulled off his Wigg, put on his Cap, took off his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat,
and Coat, and bidding the Executioner, after he had lain down a small moment, do
his Office without a Sign, he gave him some Gold, then embracing Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> he laid him down with his Neck upon the Block.</p>
            <p>The Executioner missing at his first stroke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though with that he took away Life, at two
more severed the Head from the Body: The Executioner held up the Head to the People, as
is usual, in Cases of Treason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which being done Mr. <hi>Sheriff</hi> ordered his Lordships
Friends or Servants to take the Body, and dispose of it as they pleased, being given them
by his Majesties Favour and Bounty.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>The Paper delivered to the Sheriffs by My L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Russel.</head>
               <p>I Thank God, I find my self so composed and prepared for Death, and my Thoughts so
fixed on another World, that I hope in God, I am now quite weaned from setting my
Heart on this. Yet I cannot forbear spending some time now, in setting down in Writing
a fuller Account of my Condition, to be left behind me, than I'll venture to say at the Place
of Execution, in the Noise and Clutter that is like to be there. I bless God heartily for
those many Blessings, which he in his infinite Mercy has bestowed upon me, through the
whole Course of my Life: That I was born of worthy good Parents, and had the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of a Religious Education; which I have often thank'd God very heartily for, and look'd
upon as an invaluable Blessing: For even when I minded it least, it still hung about me, and
gave me Checks, and hath now for many Years so influenced and possessed me, that I feel
the happy Effects of it in this my Extremity, in which I have been so wonderfully (I thank
God) supported, that neither my Imprisonment, nor the Fear of Death, have been able to
discompose me to any degree; but on the contrary, I have found the Assurances of the Love
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41108:3"/>
and Mercy of God, in and through my blessed Redeemer, in whom only I trust; and I do
not question, but that I am going to partake of that Fulness of Joy which is in his presence,
the hopes whereof does so wonderfully delight me, that I reckon this as the happiest time of
my Life, though others may look upon it as the saddest.</p>
               <p>I have lived, and now die of the Reformed Religion, a true and sincere Protestant, and
in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though I could never yet comply with, or
rise up to all the heights of some People. I wish with all my Soul, all our unhappy Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
were removed, and that all sincere Protestants would so far consider the Danger of
Popery, as to lay aside their Heats, and agree against the Common Enemy; and that the
Church-men would be less severe, and the Dissenters less scrupulous: For I think Bitterness
and Persecution are at all times bad, but much more now.</p>
               <p>For Popery, I look on it as an Idolatrous and Bloody Religion; and therefore thought
my self bound, in my Station, to do all I could against it. And by that, I foresaw I should
procure such great Enemies to my self, and so powerful Ones, that I have been now for some
time expecting the worst. And blessed be God, I fall by the Axe, and not by the Fiery
Tryal. Yet, whatever Apprehensions I had of Popery, and of my own severe and heavy
share I was like to have under it, when it should prevail, I never had a Thought of doing
any thing against it basely, or inhumanly; but what could well consist with the Christian
Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom. And I thank God, I have exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all my Actings in that Matter, with so great Care, that I can appeal to God Almighty,
who knows my Heart, that I went on Sincerely, without being moved, either by Passion,
By-End, or Ill-Design. I have always loved my Country much more than my Life; and
never had any Design of changing the Government, which I value, and look upon as one
of the best Governments in the World, and would always have been ready to venture my
Life for the preserving of it, and would have suffered any Extremity, rather than have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to any Desigu to take away the King's Life: Neither ever had Man the Impudence to
propose so base and barbarous a thing to me. And I look upon it as a very unhappy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy
part of my present Condition, That in my Indictment there should be so much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so vile a Fact; though nothing in the least was said to prove any such Matter; but
the contrary, by the Lord <hi>Howard:</hi> Neither does any Body, I am confident, believe the
least of it. So that I need not, I think, say more.</p>
               <p>For the King, I do sincerely pray for him, and wish well to him, and to the Nation,
That they may be happy in one another; that he may be indeed the Defender of the Faith;
That the Protestant Religion, and the Peace, and Safety of the Kingdom may be preserved,
and flourish under his Government; and that He in his Person may be happy, both here,
and hereafter.</p>
               <p>As for the share I had in the Prosecution of the Popish Plot, I take God to Witness, that
I proceeded in it in the Sincerity of my Heart; being then really convinced (as I am still)
that there was a Conspiracy against the King, the Nation, and the Protestant Religion:
And I likewise profess, that I never knew any thing, either directly or indirectly, of any
Practice with the Witnesses, which I look upon as so horrid a thing, that I could never
have endured it. For, I thank God, Falshood and Cruelty were never in my Nature, but
always the farthest from it imaginable. I did believe, and do still, that Popery is breaking
in upon the Nation; and that those who advance it. will stop at nothing, to carry on their
Design: I am heartily sorry that so many Protestants give their helping Hand to it. But I
hope God will preserve the Protestant Religion, and this Nation: though I am afraid it
will fall under very great Tryals, and very sharp Sufferings. And indeed the Impiety, and
Profaneness that abounds, and appears so scandalously bare-fac'd every where, gives too just
reason to fear the worst things which can befal a People. I pray God prevent it, and give
those who have shew'd Concern for the Publick Good, and who have appear'd Hearty for the
true Interest of the Nation, and the Protestant Religion, Grace to live so, that they may
not cast a Reproach on that which they endeavour to advance; which (God knows) hath
often given me many sad Thoughts. And I hope such of my Friends as may think they
are touch'd by this, will not take what I say in ill part, but endeavour to amend their
ways, and live suitable to the Rules of the true Reformed Religion; which is the only
thing can administer true Comfort at the latter End, and revive a Man when he comes
to Dye.</p>
               <p>As for my present Condition, I bless God, I have no Repining in my Heart at it. I
know for my Sins I have deserved much worse at the Hands of God; So that I chearfully
submit to so small a Punishment, as the being taken off a few Years sooner, and the being
made a Spectacle to the World. I do freely forgive all the World, particularly those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41108:3"/>
in taking away my Life: And I desire and conjure my Friends to think of no
Revenge, but to submit to the holy Will of God, into whose Hands I resign my self en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely.</p>
               <p>But to look back a little; I cannot but give some touch about the Bill of Exclusion, and
shew the Reasons of my appearing in that Business; which in short is this: That I thought
the Nation was in such danger of Popery, and that the Expectation of a <hi>Popish Successor</hi> (as
I have said in Parliamen) put the King's Life likewise in such danger, that I saw no way
so effectual to secure both, as such a Bill. As to the Limitations which were proposed, if
they were sincerely offered, and had pass'd into a Law, the Duke then would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the Power of a King, and the Government quite altered, and little more than
the Name of a King left. So I conld not see either Sin or Fault in the one, when all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were willing to admit of 'tother; but thought it better to have a King with his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
and the Nation easy and safe under him, than a King without it, which must have
bred perpetual Jealousies, and a continual Struggle. All this I say, only to justify my self,
and not to inflame others: Though I cannot but think my Earnestness in that matter has
had no small Influence in my present Sufferings. But I have now done with this World,
and am going to a Kingdom that cannot be moved.</p>
               <p>And to the conspiring to seize the Guards, which is the Crime for which I am condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and which was made a constructive Treason for taking away the King's Life, to bring
it within the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> I shall give this true and clear account. I never was
at Mr. <hi>Shepheard's</hi> with that company but once, and there was no undertaking then of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing,
or seizing the Guards; nor none appointed to view, or examine them: Some
Discourse there was about the Feasibleness of it; and several times by accident, in general Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
elsewhere, I have heard it mention'd, as a thing might easily be done, but never
consented to as fit to be done. And I remember particularly at my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s,
there being some general Discourse of this kind, I immediately flew out, and exclaim'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and ask'd, If the thing succeeded, what must be done next but massacring the
Guards, and killing them in cold Blood? Which I look'd upon as so destable a thing, and
so like a Popish Practice, that I could not but abhor it. And at the same time the Duke of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> took me by the Hand, and told me very kindly, My Lord, I see you and I are of
a Temper; Did you ever hear so horrid a thing? And I must needs do him that Justice
to declare, that I never observed in him but an Abhorence to all base things.</p>
               <p>As to my going to Mr. <hi>Shephards,</hi> I went with an Intention to taste <hi>Sherry;</hi> for he had
promised me to reserve for me the next very good Piece he met with, when I went out of
Town; and if he recollects, he may remember I ask'd him about it, and he went and
fetch'd a Bottle; but when I tasted it, I said 'twas hot in the Mouth; and desired that
whenever he met with a choice Piece, he would keep it for me: Which he promised. I
enlarge the more upon this, because Sir <hi>Geo. Jefferies</hi> insinuated to the Jury, as if I had
made a Story about going thither; but I never said, that was the only Reason: And I will
now truly, and plainly add the rest.</p>
               <p>I was the day before this Meeting, come to Town, for two or three days, as I had done
once or twice before; having a very near and dear Relation lying in a very languishing and
desperate Condition: And the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> came to me, and told me, He was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
glad I was come to Town; for my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and some hot Men would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
us all, if great Care be not taken, and therefore for God's sake use your Endeavours
with your Friends to prevent any thing of this kind. He told me, there would be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
at Mr. <hi>Shephard's</hi> that Night, and desired me to be at home in the Evening, and he
would call me; which he did: And when I came into the Room, I saw Mr. <hi>Rumsey</hi> by the
Chimny; though he swears he came in after; and there were things said by some with
much more Heat, than Judgment, which I did sufficiently disapprove, and yet for these
things I stand condemned. But I thank God, my part was sincere, and well meant. It
is, I know, inferred from hence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was pressed to me, that I was acquainted with these
Heats and ill Designs, and did not discover them. But this is but Misprision of Treason at
most. So I dye innocent of the Crime I stand condemn'd for, and I hope nobody will
imagine that so mean a Thought could enter into me, as to go about to save my self, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
others. The part that some have acted lately of that kind, has not been such as to
invite me to love Life at such a rate.</p>
               <p>As for the Sentence of Death passed upon me, I cannot but think it a very hard one. For
nothing was sworn against me (whether true or false, I will not now examine) but some
Discourses about making some Stirs. And this is not levying War against the King, which
is Treason by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and not the consulting and discoursing about
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41108:4"/>
it, which was all that was witnessed against me. But, by a strange Fetch, the Design
of seizing the Guards, was construed a Design of killing the King, and so I was in
that cast.</p>
               <p>And now I have truly and sincerely told what my part was in that, which cannot bemore
than a bare Misprision; and yet I am condemned as guilty of a design of killing the King. I
pray God lay not this to the charge, neither of the King's Counsel, nor Judges, nor Sheriffs,
nor Jury: And for the Witnesses, I pity them, and wish them well, I shall not reckon up the
Particulars wherein they did me wrong; I had rather their own Consciences should do
that, to which, and the Mercies of God, I leave them. Only I still averr, that what I said
of my not hearing Col. <hi>Rumsey</hi> deliver his Message from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was true; for
I always detested Lying, tho never so much to my advantage. And I hope none will be
so unjust and uncharitable, as to think I would venture on it in these my last Words, for
which I am so soon to give an account to the Great God, the Searcher of Hearts, and Judg
of all Things.</p>
               <p>From the Time of chusing Sheriffs, I concluded the Heat in that Matter would produce
something of this kind; and I am not much surprized to find it fall upon me. And I wish
what is done to me, may put a stop, and satiate some Peoples Revenge, and that no more
innocent Blood may be shed; for I must and do still look upon mine as such, since I know I
was guilty of no Treason; and therefore I would not betray my Innocence by Flight, of
which I do not (I thank God) yet repent, (tho much pressed to it) how fatal soever it
may have seem'd to have proved to me; for I look upon my Death in this manner, (I thank
God) with other eyes than the World does. I know I said but little at the Trial, and I
suppose it looks more like Innocence than Guilt. I was also advis'd not to confess matter
of Fact plainly, since that must certainly have brought me within the Guilt of Misprision.
And being thus restrained from dealing frankly and openly, I chose rather to say little, than
to depart from Ingenuity, that by the grace of God I had carried along with me in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
parts of my Life, and so could easier be silent, and leave the whole matter to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the Jury, than to make the last and solemnest part of my life so different from the
course of it, as the using little Tricks and Evasions must have been. Nor did I ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to a great readiness in speaking: I wish those Gentlemen of the Law who have it,
would make more Conscience in the use of it, and not run Men down by Strains and Fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
impose on easie and willing Juries, to the Ruine of innocent Men: For to kill by Forms
and Subtilties of Law, is the worst sort of Murder: But I wish the Rage of hot Men, and the
Partialities of Juries may be stopp'd with my Blood, which I would offer up with so much
the more Joy, if I thought I should be the last were to suffer in such a way.</p>
               <p>Since my Sentence, I have had few Thoughts, but Preparatory ones for Death: Yet the
Importunity of my Friends, and particularly of the best and dearest Wife in the World, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with me to sign Petitions, and make Addresses for my Life: To which I was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
For (I thank God) tho in all respects I have lived one of the happiest and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted'st
men in the world, (for now near fourteen years) yet I am so willing to leave all,
that it was not without Difficulty, that I did any thing for the saving of my Life, that was
Begging. But I was willing to let my Friends see what Power they had over me, and that
I was not obstinate, nor sullen, but would do any thing that an honest Man could do for
their Satisfaction. Which was the only Motive that sway'd, or had any weight with me.</p>
               <p>And now to summ up all, as I never had any Design against the King's Life, or the Life of
any man whatsoever; so I never was in any Contrivance of altering the Government.
What the Heats, Wickednesses, Passions, and Vanities of other men have occasioned, I ought
not to be answerable for; nor could I repress them, tho I now suffer for them. But the
Will of the Lord be done, into whose Hands I commend my Spirit; and trust that thou,
O most merciful Father, hast forgiven me all my Transgressions; the Sins of my Youth, and
all the Errors of my past Life, and that thou wilt not lay my secret Sins to my Charge; but
wilt graciously support me during that small part of my Life now before me, and assist me
in my last Moments, and not leave me then to be disorder'd by Fear, or any other Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but make the Light of thy Countenance to shine upon me; for thou art my Sun and
my Shield: and as thou supportest me by thy Grace, so I hope thou wilt hereafter crown
me with Glory, and receive me into the Fellowship of Angels and Saints in that blessed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
purchased for me by my most merciful Redeemer, who is, I trust, at thy Right
Hand, preparing a Place for me; into whose Hands I commend my Spirit.</p>

            <head>THE
SPEECHES
Of Captain Walcot, Jo. Rouse, and Will. Hone,
On Friday the Twentieth of July, 1683.</head>
            <p>CAptain <hi>Thomas Walcot</hi> being drawn to <hi>Tyburn</hi> in one Hurdle, <hi>John Rouse</hi> and
<hi>William Hone</hi> in another, and there put into a Cart, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Cartwright,</hi> Dean of <hi>Rippon,</hi> and one of His Majesties Chaplains in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
with Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Ordinary of <hi>Newgate,</hi> began to acquaint Captain
<hi>Walcot,</hi> That this was the last time he had to spend in the world, and therefore desired
him to make a good use of it, telling him, <hi>That as death leaves him, so Judgment will
find him;</hi> and earnestly exhorted him to make an ingenious Discovery and Confession
of what he knew touching the Conspiracy and Treasons of which he had been found
guilty, and received Sentence to die.</p>
            <p>To this Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> replyed, That he had some Papers in his Pocket, of what
he had prepared to say in Writing, because his memory was bad; therefore he desired
they might be pulled out, and he would read them.</p>
            <p>Then Dr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the Ordinary spake to <hi>Hone</hi> and <hi>Rouse</hi> to the effect before-mentioned,
earnestly desiring them to confess the whole of what they knew; instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
some places of Scripture to them, as <hi>Joshuah's</hi> advice to <hi>Aeloan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My Son, confess,
and give glory to God whom you have dishonoured,</hi> &amp;c. telling them, they would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued
their hands in the Blood of a merciful and good Prince who had often pardoned,
and gave many Acts of Oblivion and Indemnity to his Subjects; and whose Reign
hath preserved the purity of the Protestant Religion amongst us: That we cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
more than we do enjoy: with other good admonitions for them to make cleer Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of the truth of what they knew.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> in the mean while was prepared to read his Speech.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> askt him if he could discover any more than he had done already.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>I've not in the general. I told the King the thing was laid very deep:
There was a Gentleman with me last night, I told him what I told the King, and that
was all: I told him I thought an Act of Indulgence would be very necessary, because he
had a great many men to take Judgment of. I know not the particulars of the Design;
but the King hath the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Mr. <hi>West,</hi> and others that know more than I. I
was never in Councel with them, nor never with them above four, five, or half a dozen
times.</p>
               <p>Then looking upon his Paper, he began his Speech as follows.</p>
               <p>THis great Concourse of people do not only come here to see me dye, but also to
hear what I shall say; and because I would not be reproached, and thought to be
an Atheist when I am gone, I have two or three words to speak for my Religion. I
do believe in Three persons, and one God, and I expect and hope to be saved by the
Merits and Righteousness of his Son Christ Jesus, without the hope of an advantage
by any Merits or Righteousness of my own. And I believe that the Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament are the word of God; that <hi>they were not written according to
the will of Man, but holy men of God writ them as they were inspired by the holly Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41108:5"/>
I believe that these Scriptures ought to be the Rule of our Faith, and the method of
our Worshipping of God: I believe that as Christ is the head of his Church, so he is
their Law-giver, That it is not in the power of any Council or Conclave of Cardinals,
or power upon earth whatsoever; to set up the Precepts and Traditions of men, and
to make them of equal validity with the word of God. I believe it was not because
the Jews rejected and Crucified Christ, that he rejected them, but because they rejected
his Word; which appears by the Three thousand that God by one Sermon of <hi>Peters</hi>
Converted; they being <hi>prickt in their hearts, and touched in their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Consciences,</hi> cryed out,
<hi>Men and Brethren what shall we do?</hi> and they were <hi>that day added to the Church.</hi> It was
certainly because the Jews rejected the Word and Gospel of Christ, that <hi>the things were
hid from their eyes which belonged to their peace.</hi> It is a dreadful thing to reject the Word
of God; and it is a dreadful thing to live in a sinful course of life, till God withdraws
his <hi>Spirit</hi> from us: For it is said, <hi>it shall not always strive with man. Death is the wages
of sin.</hi> I believe had not <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, he and we his posterity had not dyed. Death
is said to be the <hi>King of Terrours,</hi> but it is only so to those that are terrifyed with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
Conscience, that have the arrows of the Almighty sticking in them, from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
of great guilt, and see no hopes of mercy, have no assurance of pardon; but
those that are Christs, he takes away the terror, and horror, and sting of death, he
enables them to say with <hi>Paul, To me to live is Christ, and to dye is gain:</hi> he enables not
only to get <hi>unto</hi> Christ, but <hi>into</hi> Christ; and so they have <hi>Communion and Fellowship with
the Father and the Son.</hi> It is no hard matter to get the notions of the promises of the
Gospel into our heads; but unless the Lord is pleased to apply them to our hearts, we
cannot believe: except we be <hi>in Christ as branches in the Vine,</hi> we are not Christians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
It was the case of poor <hi>Francis Spira;</hi> he was certainly a knowing man, but
notwithstanding he had not faith to apply the promises. Christ hath said, that <hi>he that
believes in him, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and he that lives and believes in him,
shall never dye.</hi> So if we be able to apply the promises by the Spirit of God, we may
have comfort through Faith: but then <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> and <hi>Faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the Word of God, and receiving it in the love of God.</p>
               <p>I shall not be tedious, Mr. Sheriff, I shall be very short.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sheriff.</speaker>
               <p>Take your own time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>As to the present occasion of my death, I do neither blame the Judges, nor
the Jury, nor the Kings Councel: I only blame some men that in reality and in truth
were deeper concerned, and more engaged than I, that came in as Witnesses against me;
who Swore me out of my life to save their own, and who for fear they should not do it
effectually, contrived that, That I will appeal to you all, whether there be a probability
in it or not: for they said that I made it a scruple of Conscience to have a hand in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the King, or to embrue my hands in his blood, but was so generous as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Charging his Guards, whilst others did it, and to the end another might do it.
Truly I will appeal to all that know me, whether they believe me so much an Idiot, that
I should not understand it was the same thing to engage the Kings Guards, whilst ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Killed him, as to Kill him with my own hands. But however, by their Swearing
against me, they have secured their own Lives and Estates, and made my Blood the
price of theirs. I confess I was so unfortunate and unhappy, as to be invited by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Rumsey,</hi> (one of the Witnesses against me) to some meetings, where some things
were discoursed of, in order to the asserting our Liberties and Properties, which we looked
upon to be violated and invaded. But it was he, and Mr. <hi>West,</hi> and some Gentlemen that
are fled, who were the great promoters of those Meetings. I was near a quarter of a year
ill of the Gout, and during that time Mr. <hi>West</hi> often visited me, and still his discourse
would be, concerning <hi>Lopping the Swo Sparks;</hi> That was the word he used, meaning
the King and the Duke; and proposed it might be done at a Play: This was his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
discourse: for he said, Then they would dye in their Calling: it was his very
Expression. He bought Arms to do it with, without any direction of mine; I never
saw the Arms, nor I never saw the men that were to do it: though they said they had
fifty imployed to that end. I told several of them, That the Killing the King would
carry such a blemish and slain with it, as would descend to posterity; that I had Eight
Children, that I was loath should be blemished with it: and withal, I was confident the
Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would revenge his Fathers Blood, if it were but to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41108:5"/>
from having any hand in it. Mr. <hi>West</hi> presently told me, that the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
did not refuse to give an Engagement, that he would not punish those that should
kill the King.</p>
               <p>And now I desire to forgive all the World from the very bottom of my heart; and
I pray God of his mercy from my heart to forgive them, even Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me up, who promised to carry me into <hi>Holland,</hi> but instead of that, he brought me
into the condition wherein I now am. I do desire with all my heart to forgive the
Witnesses; and withall do earnestly beg, that they may be observed, that some remarks
may be set upon them, whether <hi>their End be Peace,</hi> and that <hi>they die the common Death of
all men.</hi> Certainly, though it be the Law of the Land I ought to die and the King may
justly and reasonably put me to death for being in those Meetings where a War was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated;
yet I think these men are guilty of my Bloud, that were as deep in as I, and
have betrayed me, and taken in away. Then in the next place I beg leave, Mr. Sheriff,
to speak one short word of Advice to my Friends, that hath been often given to me,
though I was not so fortunate and so happy as to take it, and that is, That they would
neither hear any man speak, nor speak themselves, that which they would not have repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
for there is no such thing as Faith in man to man whatever there is in man to God:
either the Tears of a Wife, or a Family of little helpless Children, something or other
will tempt and provoke men to betray one another. When God hath a Work to do,
he will not want Instruments, for he can make them; nor will he want a way to do it,
for he can contrive it and bring it to pass. And I do most heartily desire, and my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Prayer to the Almighty is, That this may be the last Bloud spilt upon this account.
I know Acts of Indulgence and Mercy in the King would make him much easier in his
Government, and would make his People sit much easier under it, and that the Lord
may encline his heart to Mercy, ought to be the Prayer of every good man. What
hath happened, and what hath been the present occasion of our Calamity, I suppose
every man knows; what Provocations have been on the one hand, Fears and Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Jealousies and Sufferings of the other; I will not intermeddle with, resolving to use
my utmost endeavour to make that Peace and reconciliation with my God, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for me to make with men; and to make it my hearty Prayer to the Great God
before whom I am in little time to appear, That he would stench this Issue of Bloud, and
find out some other way to preserve these Kingdoms in Unity and Peace, to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Glory of his Great Name, and the eternal Comfort of his People.</p>
               <p>One word, Mr. Sheriff, I desire leave to speak as to <hi>Ireland,</hi> because the King prest it
hard upon me, and several people have been with me about <hi>Ireland,</hi> how far <hi>Ireland</hi> was
concerned in this matter. I do aver here, as in the presence of God, before whom I am
now going to appear, That I do not know an English-man nor Protestant in <hi>Ireland</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in it. What I did know, was onely of one Scotish Gentleman in the North; and
the King knows it, but he says he does not believe it. For they that were concerned, I was
never in any of their Councils: I never saw any of those Lords, but the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
and that was I believe above six months ago. I never saw nor spoke with one
Lord, onely my Lord <hi>Howard;</hi> I heard my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> say, That they did not value
<hi>Ireland,</hi> for it must follow <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have not more to say, Mr. Sheriff: but truly you will do an act of a great deal of
Charity, if you will prevail with the King for an Act of Indulgence and Liberty to his
People; I think so: and so the Lord have mercy upon me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You blame them for that which is their Vertue, and not their Crime;
That they have been Witnesses for the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>I was not for contriving the Death of the King if you'll believe me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You blame them for betraying of you in Contriving the War, upon
which the death of the King must have followed, if your Treason had gone forward, for
else you could not have defended your self from that Justice to which he hath brought
you: and therefore you to lay that as a Crime upon your Witnesses, is indeed very
strange.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Walcot.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I think it was but reasonable that I should suffer that is due from Justice,

did it to save themselves.</p>

               <p>Better late than never: a man had better save his Soul and Body
too, than die as now you do, for Crimes that ought to make every good mans heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
and therefore for your blaming them, it was for that which was their duty to do;
they have not committed a Crime in that, but a very meritorious act.</p>

               <p>That circumstance which you call aggravating, is no aggravation at
all: That is rather a mitigation of your Crime, to make them believe that You were
tenderer of the Kings person than to shoot him when he was not armed. But you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess

               <p>Truly, Sir, since you do press me to speak, we were under general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,

were allowed by the Law to meet five in a house, besides those of the Family. It is true,
the Conventicles have been disturbed of late; and I would have you look upon it as a

               </speaker>
               <p>It was a Crime to sollicite you to those Meetings; but when you
were in, it was a Duty in you and in them to reveal it: if God had given you the grace
to reveal them, the turn had been theirs which now is yours. And whereas you say you
cannot excuse them, that is uncharitable.</p>

in, I saw the thief and consented; I have looked upon my self since to be

insnared; for I never was at any of their meetings, none of their Cabals,
but in a publick <hi>Coffee-house</hi> or <hi>Tavern,</hi> where they discoursed the matter of
Fact: and I was to meet the <hi>K.</hi> and the D. of <hi>York.</hi> but I did not know at that

               <p>I believed that then I was very near another snare: I was resolved
to go down into the Country, and not meddle in the thing at all, and had
been in the Country, but meeting with <hi>Keeling,</hi> (I freely forgive him for
whatsoever is done,) he called me, and discoursing with him, I did say I was
for killing the K. and saving the D. of <hi>York.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>What was your own private reason for killing the K. and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>As to that I think this, that the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> did openly profess himself to
be a <hi>R. Catholick,</hi> and I did say I had rather dispose of the K. than the D. of <hi>Y.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>That do's deserve a reason, Mr. <hi>Hone.</hi> You ought to give some
reason of that, you cannot but have some reason; if you had had a design to
kill the D. and save the K. then it might be to prevent Popery, but you say
the quite contrary. God in Heaven forgive you for your murderous design.</p>

               <p>As a man and a Christian, in the first place, as God hath made me
a Christian through his Grace, that the World may understand, that I do
not dye as Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> saies, an Atheist; I do here declare in the presence of
God, and this vast number of people, what Faith I dye in: In that very
Faith which was once delivered, and in the Belief of that Doctrine which
the Church of <hi>England</hi> makes Profession of, and is agreeable to the
word of God, being founded upon the Doctrine of the Prophets, and
Apostles, whereof Jesus Christ is the Corner Stone. There have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
various opinions concerning me, upon the account of the various imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that I have been exercised in, both here, and beyond Sea: It has been
my lot to fall under such circumstances, and to fall under such misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and Censures, upon the account of some publick Imployments, that
I have been in for the K. and after I returned from <hi>Flanders,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41108:7"/>
of Disbanding, it was almost morally impossible for such a one in
my capacity, to stand right in the affections and opinions of all people.
When I was imployed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the payment of that Army, I was then
between 2 Rocks; I will leave it to the Judgment of all sorts of people, you
know the Country, I need not particularise, nor reflect upon opinions, and
the like. But I having been bred up in <hi>England,</hi> and had that education it
pleased God to give me, I was not fond of, nor carried off with, that debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
in those times: and sometimes, more than once or twice, it was my
lot that I was like to have been murthered for pleading for, and justifying
the actions of the King of <hi>England.</hi> Since my return, and being imployed
under Sir <hi>Tho. Player,</hi> and some others about disbanding, there it came to
my Lot, because I could not humour some Gentlemen, who neither fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God, nor honoured the King (I will not say so of all, for I know some
were very worthy Gentlemen, that scorn'd any of those actions, which some
would attempt. There is one worthy Gent. I can speak very honourably
of) that so they might have their pockets full of money, did not value how
the Accounts were stated, and at the very same time I was under many
temptations of handfuls of Guineas in my hand to do so and so, to cheat the
K. and because I would not do that, I was looked upon as a Jesuit. I did
wave all these things under those circumstances. It hath been my lot
likewise being imployed by Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> and the rest of the Commissioners to
fall into those Companies and places where my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and others
have been, and have had some kind of Discourse, which was not Treason,
but rather a thing that I ever abhorred, and declared a detestation of:
since these hurly burlys, concerning Parliaments going off, and coming on,
did discontent the people upon one account or another, I confess I have
been a hearer, and have understood too much of some kind of meetings,
which I pray God forgive them for, and especially those that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Protestants, being 10000 times worse than any others. That there
have been such kind of Designs, and Meetings, and Clubbs, I have not
been ignorant of; God forgive me that I have not been as careful and as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
and as ready and forward to discover it a great while since. That
I ever had a hand in it, or the least thought or resolution, or intention to
appear in it, but rather, on the contrary, have declared my opinion against it
both in the sight of God, and man, as a breach of the Laws of God, and the
Laws of the Land, and contrary to our Duty, who are bound to pray for
the King, and all that are in Authority. I do declare in the presence of
God, I am a perfect stranger, and I thank God my Conscience is clear, I
have acquainted his Majesty in Council, and I have had the Honour to be
admitted into his Majesties presence in private almost half an hour on
<hi>Saturday</hi> was seven-night, where I was as clear and above board, and as
faithful to his Majesty as I could be in an humble manner, according to my
duty; where I offered to have some time, and place allotted, that I might
give him a whole Scheme of the business: For there were a great many
Gentlemen that had a respect forme; It was their opinions that I had a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Knowledge of all the Clubbs, and all the Designs that ever were since
the King came in, but they were under a mistake. I gave his Majesty an
account to the best of my knowledge, and when I had done, his Majesty
seemed to be pleased, and to thank me for it; but before I had power to
put it in writing, and wait upon his Majesty, the Providence of God did
so order it, the Council thought it fit that I should be committed to Prison,
where I was some days; I have had more kindness among <hi>Heathens</hi> and
<hi>Indians,</hi> I pray God to forgive them for it, I had not liberty to send to my
Wife big with Child, in two days where I was.</p>
               <p>Sir, I shall not hold you in suspence, and multiply words, but what is
most proper to this occasion. What I have given to his Majesty in
Council, and what I have spoken to his Majesty, in private, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the naked truth to clear my own Conscience, that I may
not go out of the world with any thing upon me: I wish those that
call themselves Protestants would discharge their duty better to God and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41108:7"/>
the King, than either I or the best Subject ever did. I have lookt upon 't
as an obligation ever since I knew what it was to be a man, to carry
my self obedient to those that God has set over me, especially the King
and those that are in Authority; and I have made it my practice to pray
for the King, as for my own soul. That it has been my lot to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with those vanities of Clubbs, and persons, no rational man
will wonder, considering the Circumstances and places I was called to.
There is one particular Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Sheriff;</hi> I must desire the favour to
clear my self by something that I took occasion to speak of yesterday. I
did acquaint you, Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> with what I had spoken to the King, how
I was interrupted in the further discovery of what I had a mind to say.
What was further said yesterday, it was nothing but the naked truth: In
the first place, as to what was afterwards discourst of, as to some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
persons, namely and particularly Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> I must do justice
to all the world. That he hath been acquainted with the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi>
none, here, will wonder; but that he hath been very shy of his Company
since he came out of the <hi>Tower:</hi> for he told me many times, he never was
in his company but once, for he did not like some things, and saw some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
that he was afraid were going on; and thereupon Sir <hi>Thomas Player</hi>
was so ingenuous and honest to the King, as to break off. I always look'd
upon him as a very Loyal subject, and I must declare in the presence of God
and all these people, I never heard him speak one dishonourable word of
the King; what he may have had with others is best known to himself. I
have been in several Clubbs eating and drinking, where it has been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courst
to accommodate the Kings Son, the D. <hi>M.</hi> That there was a design
to set up the D. of <hi>M.</hi> I will not say while the King raigns, though some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
hot-headed men have taken upon them to discourse these things,
but not any worthy man: I know those that were worthy to be called by
that name, have declared in my hearing, that in opposition to the
D. of <hi>Y.</hi> if the King be seised, they would stand by the D. of <hi>M.</hi>
There are others, (I will not give nicknames to any, you are wise men,
and know what I mean by speaking in the general,) that were for
a Common-wealth, and some there were, two or three persons. I shall
be as plain as I can, and I hope you will bear with me since it came
to my lot to come to the knowledge of it. Some were for the D. of
<hi>M.</hi> some for a Commonwealth, and some, but very few, not worth
naming, were for the D. of <hi>Bucks:</hi> But that I think fell at last between
these two, being the greater part, as far as I did apprehend by discoursing
here and there in the City, which I did very frequently do. But the way
of these Gentlemens discoursing these things was only one at a time, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
a very industrious Gentleman that hath made it his practice a long
time, (for it hath been my lot to be acquainted but two months and
that too long,) which is the Witness that comes against me, and I pray
God to forgive him, and I blame him not for discovering me, but for
the words he spake himself, by way of instigating me to enter into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against the King; they were his own words and not mine. I
blame him not for discovering any thing whereby the King may be
served. He did tell me several times there were Clubbs in <hi>London,</hi> but I
could never get out of him the places where the Clubbs were. Yet I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
what possibly I could to come to the bottom of that design; for
my intent was to make a faithful and true discovery, that I might not go
to <hi>Whitehall</hi> or a Justice of Peace, with an idle story, or a sham: but at
last I got out of him that <hi>Rich. Goodenough</hi> was chiefly instrumental. This
was a very few days before notice was given, this certain person <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Lee</hi> the <hi>Dyer,</hi> that he was sworn against by one <hi>How:</hi> I asked him
the meaning. He told me that that <hi>How</hi> was a very Rascal. I
asked <hi>Lee,</hi> Sir, what course shall be taken? for what by the <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi>
of the one hand, and what by the persecutions of the other,
we must think of a way how to relieve it. There is some design in
hand, says <hi>Lee,</hi> don't you know? ho, said I, I would be glad to hear:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41108:8"/>
There is an invasion, said he, going on, a design against the King and
the Government, but that was only a fallacy; but he discovered after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to me that there was a resolution, and a certain number of people
about the City and the Nation, to make an attack upon the <hi>Tower</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> upon <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and upon St. <hi>James</hi>'s:
I said what do you design then? have a care that you don't shed more
innocent blood, for the Land is stained with blood too much already.
No, saith he, the resolution as Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> saith, is not to spill a drop
of blood, but only to secure the Kings person, that the Papists do not
kill him, and then saith he we will deal with the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> as we please.
They were his own words to the best of my remembrance. Afterwards
this Gentleman was sworn against by one Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> in <hi>East-Smithfield,</hi>
saith he, he's a Rogue and a Dog, and I have seen him but once these
nine Months, and I had no discourse but only drunk a glass of drink;
which proves since to the contrary. Being then in Company at the <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
Tavern</hi> in <hi>Swithens-Ally</hi> near the <hi>Exchange,</hi> news was brought, he
was sworn against, he did not know what to do, but found out a place
near <hi>London-wall,</hi> and desired me to go to one or two about the matter,
he knew not how to obscure himself, his house was beset, Messengers
after him, and likewise a kind of Judgment or Execution; how to put
both ends together he knew not. I told him, if he would I had a bed, he
might go to my house. I never heard a word from <hi>Rich. Goodenough</hi> one
way nor another of any design against the K. and the Government, whom
I have known this seven years; only this <hi>Lee</hi> told me, his hand was as
deep as any other. Its true, this Gentleman comes and swears against me,
that I should be the only person to ingage in taking the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
Sir <hi>John</hi>—you know very well in what capacity I have been, and how
very uncapable I was in my person to take the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> I speak
in the presence of God, before whom I am to appear in a few minutes, I
never had any such thought, never had any such desire, never consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with any persons of Quality, never discoursed of any Arms in order
to it, but only this I was saying. This fellow being set on (and I think a
more proper person than any man in the world) for that he was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
low in the world, he was under a temptation of being thrown out by
an <hi>Anabaptistical Church,</hi> for some kind of failings, he was under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
to make himself somebody, therefore he did close with Mr. <hi>Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi>
and some others; and when the first Proclamation came forth, he
himself told me, I never knew it before, that <hi>Rumsey,</hi> Captain <hi>Walcot,
Nelthrop</hi> and <hi>Goodenough</hi> and <hi>West</hi> were concerned in this design, he was
the man told me: and when the second Proclamation came out, then he
could tell me of those too; I told him he was a wretch he had not discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it betimes; as to his swearing against me, for which God forgive him,
that I had a hand in taking the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the thing is this: He
knew I was intimately acquainted with a certain Captain, one <hi>Blage,</hi> who
was my servant 21 years ago in <hi>Virginia;</hi> he hath been a very faithful and
honest servant, I believe, to his Majesty for these 15 years, particularly
five years in three of his Majesties Men of War. I know very well the man
is of such a principle that he abhors to ingage in any wicked design. But
only <hi>Lee</hi> discoursing at random about taking the <hi>Tower,</hi> Captain <hi>Blage</hi>
gave this answer, (for he is a very jocular man,) if I were of a mind to
take it, were it for the service of the King, if there were an enemy
coming in, saith he, I would with six Ships well manned and armed with
Guns undertake to take the <hi>Tower:</hi> upon what account he said it, I
don't know, but I believe in my Conscience he had no more design to
put such a thing in practice, than I have to cut my own throat at present;
Captain <hi>Blage</hi> had heard these discourses <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> saith he 2 or 300
men would do it, it's weak in such a place, I wonder his Majesty dos not
make it stronger. Now when he came to swear, as soon as he was taken
up, he took occasion to swear against me, all the discourse he used in pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
me to undertake this design.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheriff, I have nothing at all to say, either to blame the Judges, or
the Jury, or the Witnesses themselves, the greatest of all. I thank God I was not
any way to have had any hand in it: but the very words themselves that came
out of his mouth he makes me the Author of, but I freely forgive him, as I desire
God would forgive me: tho he did tell me positively there were five hundred Arms
to be brought out of the Countrey. I heard of such a thing, I confess, here and
there, but could never know the Authors of it, nor the Clubbs where it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed:
it was lately that he told me, <hi>Goodenough</hi> told him, That the King was to
be taken off as he came from <hi>Windsor,</hi> That there was several things to be done
in order to it, That they wanted a place of meeting, and some thought of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Plain,</hi> and some of <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> but the most convenient place pitched upon
was <hi>Black Heath.</hi> They were discoursing how to gather the People together; Some
were for communicating it privately, others for a Ball. They asked my Thoughts:
said I, the best way will be, if you throw up a Silver Ball, to get the People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
for my design was to get what I could out of them. Thereupon he went
to Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and discours'd him, and told him, that my Opinion was, to
throw up a Silver Ball and declare, All those that will come and drink a Bowl of
Punch, shall be welcome, and that by this means they would have gathered thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or forty thousand men in two or three dayes time, which otherwise would have
been a fortnight a doing: but for himself, I will not blame him, nor lay any
thing to his charge of which he is not guilty. I must needs give him his
due. I do not remember that ever he insisted upon shedding of Blood, but that
he hath discoursed in very opprobrious terms and base Language of the Duke of
<hi>York;</hi> by calling him Rogue, and Dog, and such things: and that <hi>We will do his
work:</hi> That is true. And, that after the King's decease, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
having a Vogue with the People, must of necessity succeed: I cannot tell what I
can say more as to that; that is the chief thing I have to say, if I have not forgot any
thing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Rouse.</speaker>
               <p>There was no Consultation at all, Sir. That I had was from this <hi>Thomas Lee</hi>'s
mouth himself, That there were five hundred Arms to be brought in; That he had
it from <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> and <hi>Nelthorp,</hi> and Mr. <hi>West,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>West</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
knew from whom these Arms were to come, for he gave me a hint that part
of the Arms were bought by Mr. <hi>West.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Rouse.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, he was saying, there was several Propositions made in the Club where
<hi>Goodenough</hi> was, and some thought of one way and some another, but they could
not find out a proper way; Saith he, what do you think? Said I, if the People
meet together they may throw up a Ball, just in that careless way, I said so. So he
came to me afterwards, and said, that he had discoursed with Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> told him, that there was forty thousand pound in Bank, and if such
a Ball cost thirty or forty pound, it mattered not, to carry on such a Design as that
was.</p>

and to demand Priviledges and Liberties, not to take away the Kings Life, but only
let the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> look to it: for he was resolved upon it that he should not succeed the
King. Then he delivers another Paper, being his Petition to the King, and some

               <p>No Sir, I don't desire it. Mr. Sheriff, I do freely acknowledge and confess
that it is just in God in the first place, and righteous and just in the King, that I die;
and that I die justly for concealing it. I would lay no blame upon the King nor any
other Person in the World. I did not conceal it upon any Account to his Majesty's
Prejudice nor any Man in the Nation; and I hope God will give more Grace to
those Persons that do succeed. I beg a Word or two I had almost forgot, as a Man
and as a Christian, That it is a thing of such evil Consequence, I have found it by
bitter Experience now, for such and such publick Places to be visited, especially by
those that are Professors of the Protestant Religion, and particularly Coffee-Houses,
where it is very well known too much time is spent, and Families, and Wives, and
Children, suffer too much: I pray God the People may take notice of it and lay it
to Heart that spend their time so, thinking it is but a Penny and a Penny; and so
discourse of State-Affairs as if so be they were Gods Counsellors in the Government of
the World, running from the Coffee-House to the Tavern and from the Tavern to
the Coffee-House, which hath been the Debauchery of this Age; and so bring them
into this <hi>Dilemma</hi> to discourse of those Things neither pleasing to God nor the King,
nor themselves, but their Prejudice. The Profanation of the Sabbath-Day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
discourst of in this place; God forgive me for not observing it as I should. I
pray God those that follow me may be more careful of their Duty to God and Man,
for the good of themselves, their Souls, and their Families; those that are young es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
and coming up, that they may chiefly mind their Concerns for Eternity, and
that they would pay their Duty and Homage to the King and those that God has set
over them, and not neglect that great Command to pray for the King and all that
are in Authority.</p>

            <p>Being asked if they had any thing more to say, They said, No. Mr. <hi>Ordinary</hi>
then prayed with them, and sung a Psalm; and then they desired to pray themselves;

               <head>Captain Walcot's Prayer.</head>
               <p>O Lord, our God, Thou art the God of present help in time of Trouble, a
God, that hast promised to be with thy People in the Fire and in the
Water. O Lord, we pray thee, that thou wilt afford thy presence to thy poor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Servants at this time, that thou wilt enable us to pray with Faith, to trust
in thee, to be in expectation and hope of Mercy from thee. O Lord, thy Servant
that speaketh doth confess, that the Iniquities at his heels have justly overtaken
him, that just and righteous art thou in all thy Judgments, that he hath reason
to bear thy Indignation, because he hath sinned. O Lord, we beg, even for thy
Son Christ Jesus's sake, that our sins may not be brought to our remembrance in
order to our despondency or discouragement, or our despairing in thy Mercy, but
rather, O Lord, in order to an assurance that our great God hath pardoned and
forgiven them in the Blood of his Son. O do thou bath each of our Souls in that
Fountain set open for Sin and for Vncleanness. Give us, O Lord, inward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
strength from thy self, and give us cause to bless thy Name for inward sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
Graces, for inward assistances. O let us find an increase of spiritual
strength, let us be assured that our Sins are done away, and let us also be assured
that our Names are written in the Book of Life, and let it be such an assurance
as may be matter of joy and rejoycing to our Souls. O do thou enable every one
of us, from the inward evidence of thy Spirit, to say with thy Servant <hi>Job,</hi> That
we know and are assured that our Redeemer lives. O do thou give us such an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of an Interest in thee, that we may be inabled in deed, in reality, and in
truth, to say, that we have run our race, and we have finished our course with
Joy: O let us now receive the fruit of those many Petitions that we have put up
unto thee. O let us now find the Spirit influencing our Hearts to a yielding pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and a thorow subjection to the Will of God: let us find thy Spirit assuring
us that we are thine. O let us have stronger Evidences of thy Love, stronger
Testimonies of thy Affection: O give us some inward Tastes of those heavenly
Joys that we hope through the Mercy of Jesus Christ in a little time to have a
more full Fruition of. O Lord, do thou speak peace to every one of our Consciences;
enable us to take hold of thy Strength that thou may'st make Peace with us, and
let us not be discouraged, O Lord, since we have a High-Priest that can be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with our Infirmities: let us with Boldness have Access to the Throne of Grace,
that we may obtain Mercy and Grace to help in time of need. O take away the
Sting and Terror that is in Death in any one of us, by assuring us of our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in thee, by assuring us that our Names are recorded in the Book of Life; tho
we lye under a Sentence of Death from Man, we beg that we may have a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Life eternal from our God; and tho we meet thee, O Lord, in a Field
of Blood, we beg that thou wilt come to meet with us in a Field of Mercy. O
Lord extend thy Mercy, thou Lord whose Compassions faileth not, cause the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of thy tender pity to yearn with Compassion towards us: enable every one of
us, O Lord, to die believing in Jesus Christ, to die hoping in his Mercy, to die,
relying upon him for Justification, for Sanctification, and for Adoption. O
Lord, though we have been Prodigals, we desire to return to our Fathers House
where there is Bread enough. O enable us to come unto thee as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41108:10"/>
to their Parents. O let our Prayers be offer'd with so much Fervour
in Christ Jesus, that thou may'st think it reasonable to assure us of thy Love. O
let the Intercession of Jesus Christ be accepted. O Lord, we beg that he may be
our Advocate; if our Advocate be our Judge, certainly we cannot miscarry. O
let Jesus Christ be the Hope of every one of our Souls; and Lord let
not our Hope be like that of the Hypocrite, but let our Faith be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rock of Ages, and let us not fail from the apprehension of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Punishment from men. Yet, O Lord, do thou so order our
Hearts and our Spirits aright, that thou may'st be the Lot of our Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and our Portion for ever. O do thou interest us in thy self;
Lord carry on thy own Work. We desire to come unto thee that we
may have life. Lord help us, Lord put to thy helping Hand, Lord teach
us truly to leave no Sin unrepented of in any one of our Hearts. And O
Lord, we beg that with us thou wilt give us leave to recommend unto thy
Care our poor Wives and Children: Thou hast promised to be the Father
of the Fatherless and the Husband of the Widdow; and thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to cast the Care of them upon thee. O do thou make Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for them, deal kindly with them, imprint thy own Image upon
them, and enable them to bear this severe stroke with Patience. O
Lord, stand by and support them; let their Ways be found so
pleasing and acceptable unto thee, that thou may'st think it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to make all their Enemies at Peace. Lord, interest them in thy
Love, and do thou favour them with thy Mercies and loving. Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
O Lord, we also beseech thee in the behalf of these poor King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
wherein we are, that thou wilt be merciful to them, prevent Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among them, heal all their Breaches, compose their Differences, make
all that are thine of one Heart and Mind in the things of thee our God.
And Lord, if it be thy Will, do thou rule in the Heart of the King, that he
may rule and reign for thee, and for the good of thy Church and people. Lord,
favour us with thy mercy, assure us of thy love, stand by us in the difficult
hour, take us into thine own Care, cause thy Angels to attend us, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
our Souls as soon as they are divided from our Bodies, into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
into the Paradice of our God. And Lord, we beg that thou wilt be with
us, with thy extraordinary Presence, helping us to trust in thee, doing for
us beyond what our narrow Hearts are able to ask or think. All which we
beg for the sake of thy Son Jesus Christ, in whom, O Lord, this little time

               <p>GLorious Lord our God, thou art the God of the whole Creation, and the God that
created the Heavens and the Earth in six days; by thy power we stand here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee: Lord, help us to be looking up unto Jesus Christ, who is exalted to be a Prince
and a Saviour to give Repentance to <hi>Israel,</hi> and Remission of sins. Now, Lord, for
thy mercies sake we would be helped to say, That Power that raised up Christ from the
dead, that is able to raise up our poor Souls before thee from Death to Life. O Lord,
for thy mercies sake wash all our Souls in the Bloud of Jesus Christ, <hi>which speaketh better
things than that of Abel:</hi> and, Lord, for thy mercies sake pardon all our sins, from our
first, our Original sins, and our sins of Sabbath-breaking, and our sins of Transgression,
and the sin for which we are condemn'd; O Lord, pardon it, and let us not go out of
the World with one sin hid in our Souls. For thy mercies sake pardon all our sins; and,
Lord, do thou preserve this Nation, and put it into the heart of the King to be merciful,
and to rule in Truth and Righteousness. And for thy mercies sake, rule the Affairs
of this Nation, and help to rule and govern all things for the government of our Souls
and our Spirits, for thy mercies sake; and help us that with joy we may be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Glory, into the eternal Habitations: for Christ is sent into the World to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to save sinners, of whom we are chief. And, Lord, for thy mercies sake, let me
have a true belief in Jesus Christ aright, to be looking up unto him for Life and for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Oh that we might perish if we perish, and be found doing thy will to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of our power. Lord accept of us, and help us and be with us this little time we
shall be in this world. All which we beg for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
be Glory with the Kingdom both now and for evermore.</p>

               <p>O Lord our God, who art nearer to each and every one of us, than we are to our
selves: It is not all the Confessions to men in the world, were it confessed by the
Tongues of Angels, those glorious Spirits above, that can avail any thing with the great
God, against whom we have sinned, or that can procure pardon for the least transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which deserves, eternal wrath. And therefore for the Sins that we have been
guilty of, either against the first or the second Table, either against God as our Creator,
Christ as our Redeemer, or the Holy and Blessed Spirit as our Sanctifier, the sins that we
have committed against thy holy Church, and that Faith that I hope we die in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of, the sins that we have been guilty of against our Neighbours, upon one account and
another, the sins that we have been guilty of against our Governours and Rulers, to
whom thou hast obliged us under manifold obligations, both as Men and Christians, the
sins that we have been guilty of in our several places, Relations and Capacities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
whatever have been their Circumstances and their Aggravations, the least where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
deserves everlasting death, without the Merits of Jesus; for all those greater or
lesser sins, whether that original sin we brought into the world with us, that source and
fountain, and foundation of all other sins, those actual sins and transgressions against
any of those that thou hast set over us, or those that have been equal with us; those
relation-sins, as Husband and Wife, as Master and Servant, in every relation and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
Lord forgive them, and wash them away in the blood of the Lamb of God, that
stands at the right hand of the Majesty on high. And because we have no worthiness
of our own to recommend us to thee, therefore we beg thee for thy Sons sake to fetch
arguments from thy self. Our righteousness is as filthy rags, and the best of us are as
a menstruous cloath. Fetch Arguments from the riches of thy grace, from the goodness
of thy nature, from the multitude of thy mercies, from the blood of thy Son, from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41108:11"/>
that blessed, eternal intercession that we hope he is making for us, and for all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the election of Grace, and shall be brought to glory. Remember thy Churches,
hasten the fulfilling of thy promises, the accomplishing of thy prophesies through the
world, the downfal of the man of sin, and the destruction of all thy true Churches
implacable enemies. Lord hasten the day of the calling the Jews, and the fulness of the
Gentiles; put an end to Wars and rumours of Wars, let the desire of all Nations come.
Dwell in these Three Nations, be a wall of fire round about them; prevent any kind
of Insurrection at home, all manner of Invasion from abroad; let those that tarry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
enjoy peace, and truth, and righteousness. Dwell in and reign in the heart of the
King, Lord bless and prosper him in his Person, give him a long, a prosperous, and an
happy Reign. Good Father we pray thee, let him live here with a flourishing Crown
upon his head, till thou in thy due time shalt receive him to an eternal Crown hereafter.
Bless him in his Royal Family and Relations, in his Royal Brother. Bless him in his
Royal Consort, make the King a Nursing Father, and the Queen a Nursing Mother.
Confound all hatred, malice and envy, all evil speaking, every thing that is contrary to
sound Doctrine, and give thy people that live under him, to shew that dutifulness and
respect as becomes Christians, and as becomes Loyal Subjects. Bless the Clergy, by
whatsoever Names or Titles distinguished, make them sound in their Doctrine, and
make them useful and unblameable in their Lives and Conversations. Help them to
mind the Souls committed to their charge, and help them to do their duty, that they
may be able to say, behold here are we and the Children whom thou hast given us. Now
Lord bless all the Nation from the highest to the lowest, from the Prince to the Peasant,
of all sorts, ranks and degrees. Give Loyalty towards our dread Sovereign, who is a
merciful and gracious Prince, whom thou hast set as thy Vicegerent to Reign over us,
who can do nothing but what is just and equal before thee, to whom he must give an
account of all his Transactions, even to thee the King of Kings. And Lord grant peace
and love and unity one among another, and the practical observation of thy holy day,
and those duties that relate to God and Man. Grant that those that follow after us,
may take particular Example by us. We must needs acknowledge and smite upon our
thighs, that we in Justice are brought hither, that we have nothing to do, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
our selves, and justifie the Justice of the Land, and to pray God to bless his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to Reign in these Nations, and those that shall succeed him upon the Throne. All
which we beg upon the account of our Lord Jesus Christ, who was dead, and behold he
lives, to whom with thy self and eternal Spirit, we desire to ascribe, as is due, all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
praise, and glory everlasting. Amen.</p>
