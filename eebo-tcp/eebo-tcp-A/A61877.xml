            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The general <hi>Archaeus</hi> of the <hi>Stomach</hi> and that <hi>appropriate to each part</hi> seem to me to import no more, nor to be <hi>more intelligible</hi> than the <hi>innate heat of each part,</hi> and <hi>that other influencing each part</hi> and <hi>disseminated from the Heart</hi>: If the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat of each part</hi> be called a <hi>particular ferment,</hi> it matters not much: I comprehend it as little still: How the <hi>operations of Nature</hi> are performed I <hi>know</hi> not, nor ever shall understand by <hi>Canting terms,</hi> or <hi>Similitudes</hi>: That the notion of <hi>Fermentation</hi> is <hi>equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> or not to be accommodated to the Stomach and its <hi>digestion,</hi>

i. e. In the first place it is to be held for a certain truth, that pestilential diseases have their properties, that <hi>they are deadly to most, being very afflicting, and mortal.</hi> But that they should be <hi>contagious,</hi> it is not necessary, except the putrefaction be come to that height as to produce such a morbid exhalation as may infect other bodies. For it is most apparent that many dye, and yet there is not any sign of contagion to be demonstrated by its proper effect, of having introduced the like sickness in others.

We do therefore avow, that those we call <hi>private Pests</hi> do not prejudice or infect those that attend the sick party. —Besides, even in our Age several deadly Plagues have destroyed multitudes in the Eastern and Southern Climates of the World, which yet have not diffused themselves by <hi>contagion</hi> unto others, so that none have declined to converse with the sick.</p>

that they should <hi>imitate</hi> that operation by <hi>promoting sweat</hi>: they are afraid that potent <hi>sweats</hi> may divert <hi>Nature</hi> from her <hi>usual</hi> and <hi>intended course</hi> or dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it self into the <hi>Glandules,</hi> and whilest a <hi>double eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation</hi> is purposed by the <hi>Physician,</hi> the <hi>Patient</hi> may find the benefit of <hi>neither,</hi> the <hi>sweat</hi> being so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to disturb that <hi>other motion</hi>; and the <hi>humours</hi> in which the <hi>venome</hi> is incorporated being so <hi>gross</hi> (why else should <hi>Nature</hi> never take the more <hi>facile</hi> and <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite</hi> way of the <hi>Skin,</hi> but the more <hi>difficult</hi> of the <hi>Glandules</hi>?) as not to be exonerated in <hi>that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>

                     <p>Lastly, Supposing the <hi>Plague</hi> to be a <hi>venenate disease</hi> they do not conceive that all <hi>poysons</hi> are to be cured <hi>one way,</hi> and that by <hi>sweat,</hi> especially <hi>as soon as ever they are taken:</hi> much more if they be of a <hi>Septic</hi> nature: they do not believe <hi>sweating</hi> to be the <hi>remedy</hi> for <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic,</hi> or <hi>Lapis infernalis,</hi> should any take them.

"If thou beest unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied whether <hi>opening a vein</hi> as it is indicated from Evacuation, or Revulsion, <hi>be a competent sufficient Remedy</hi> for the cure of a <hi>Pleurisie,</hi> or any high Feaver; thou shalt find in this short Tract a Resolution in <hi>a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative sense,</hi> grounded on <hi>Reason, Authority,</hi> but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which is the sum of all, <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered according to what Experiments are past, offered to be made good for the future."
— Thus he bespeaks his <hi>Reader</hi> in the <hi>Preface:</hi> and a little after he assures him, that
"He is able to resolve any one that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the most <hi>Plethorick body</hi> taken with a Feaver, or any one <hi>Cachochymic</hi> afflicted with a <hi>Pleurisie</hi> may be cured without the Lancet more <hi>speedily</hi> and safely than by using the same."

                     <p>Fifthly, They imploy their care in <hi>securing</hi> such parts as are particularly indangered by <hi>their eruption</hi>; expedite the <hi>maturation of them,</hi> if it be to <hi>slow,</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi>; hinder their <hi>regress,</hi> and suffer not any <hi>recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentition particles</hi> again to <hi>reincorporate</hi> with the blood, and <hi>beget a new Feaver,</hi> or other <hi>dangerous symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi>: and in case any <hi>new distemper</hi> happen (as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Pleurisie,</hi> or the like may do) they provide for the <hi>due cure</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:107178:108"/>These are the <hi>common intendments</hi> of all rational <hi>Physicians</hi>: these things Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> (whose short discourse of <hi>this disease</hi> contains in a manner all that our best Writers do suggest) doth propose to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: and whosoever doth ponder well the <hi>course of the disease</hi> must assent thereunto.

                     <p>I come now to <hi>those Means</hi> by which <hi>Physicians</hi> principally are said to act: and those are the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, of <hi>vomiting, gentle purges,</hi> and <hi>bleeding</hi>; and to declare the usefulness thereof; 'tis necessary that we consider the <hi>Small Pox</hi> under a <hi>twofold</hi> notion.

In this <hi>distinction</hi> we are freed from those <hi>impertinencies</hi> which others molest us with, as if the <hi>concomitant disease</hi> were a <hi>crisis</hi> of the other: whereas indeed this <hi>concomitancy</hi> makes us look on them rather as a <hi>complication of maladies,</hi> than any such <hi>succession</hi> as is feigned; and we are thence obliged to consider what <hi>indications</hi> arise from this <hi>conjunction:</hi> for it is confessed that in <hi>these cases</hi> the <hi>primary disease</hi> is not <hi>terminated,</hi> nor <hi>altogether</hi> to be <hi>cured</hi> in the <hi>usual manner,</hi> but with a regard to its <hi>associate:</hi> but our care ought to spend it self so as that the <hi>primary Feaver</hi> may <hi>innocently</hi> and without prejudice to the <hi>sick</hi> introduce its <hi>Associate,</hi> and that <hi>conclude</hi> with an happy recovery. To do this we consider the nature of the <hi>primary Feaver:</hi> which is in the <hi>Small Pox</hi> a <hi>simple Synochus,</hi> or a <hi>Synochus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tride</hi>; and sometimes a <hi>Tertian,</hi> or <hi>double Tertian,</hi> or some <hi>malignant Feaver.</hi> These we are so to manage that they neither become <hi>exorbitant,</hi> so as to destroy the Patient before the <hi>Associate</hi> discovers it self, nor <hi>then</hi> become so <hi>depraved, violent,</hi> or <hi>malignant,</hi> as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the <hi>subsequent cure:</hi> No man can <hi>in reason</hi> doubt but the best and most direct means to moderate the <hi>primary Feaver</hi> is to begin betimes;<note place="margin">

and finds a more facile and certain exiture; but the <hi>Small Pox</hi> are of a <hi>grosser substance,</hi> and come not forth with <hi>equal facility.</hi> It is also to be considered, that as a large evacuation by <hi>sweat</hi> may happily terminate a <hi>Synochus</hi>; so, although the Patient do abound with blood, Nature <hi>may</hi> sometimes so expel and regulate the matter, that the party may avoid the imminent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils: but he that trusts thereunto must well ponder not only how <hi>plentifully</hi> the Pox come forth, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>proportionate</hi> to the exigencies of Nature (for whatever is not <hi>such,</hi> is <hi>minute</hi>) and what <hi>alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation</hi> insues: not to mention other things.

                     <p>"A noble Lady of the age of fourteen years fell sick, and bled at the Nose, she had a nauseousness at Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and great pains in her back: the Physicians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent for, a Clyster was proposed of Broth with Cassia, it came away without any operation: her pains and Feaver increased, and certain spots appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behind her Ears, which portended the <hi>Small Pox</hi>: one of the Physicians commended <hi>Blood letting,</hi> as the most suitable remedy for a great disease, and not inconsistent with her years and strength, especially since she was plethorical; hereby, he said, the <hi>blood</hi> being diminished, the vessels would be less distended, the malignity repressed, and pains mitigated: But so it happens frequently, that we cannot embrace the most obvious counsils, whether it be an imbecillity in our minds, which being distracted betwixt hope and fear, and sollicitous about the future, forgets the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent urgency: or whether it be the method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which to effect its designs transports us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our selves: The rest of the Physicians seemed astonished at the proposal, and neither assenting, nor dissenting, proceeded only to insinuate the peril of that operation: But, that they might seem to do something, they proposed an anodyne Fomentation to mitigate her pains, which having continued ten hours, produced no benefit: The ensuing night she was very restless, and on the morning her strength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be sensibly impaired: thereat the Physicians were much troubled, and considering the present exigency, they gave her a Cordial of <hi>Bezoar</hi> and the <hi>species de Hyacintho</hi>: it was not given sooner, because there was amongst the number one who
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107178:129"/>
was extreamly averse from giving any Cordials in the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> to bring them forth, as if thereby the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours were exasperated, the ebullition rendered too violent, and the Pustules protruded in so great an excess as to strangle the Patient, he said that Nature understood her own work, and could do it best, that she was to be left to her self, and needed no incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: And by these suggestions he intrigrued the determinations of the Physicians, so as that no <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi> or Alexipharmacon was given sooner. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient having taken some of the aforesaid <hi>Cordial,</hi> and afterwards avoided a <hi>great deal of blood</hi> by Urine: which yet some suspected to be a <hi>Menstruous</hi> excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a little after she vomited up a <hi>great deal of blood:</hi> this same took to be a <hi>Critical</hi> effort of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which had alleviated the violent ebullition of the blood in the greater vessels by discharging a part thereof at the Mouth and ordinary passages: in the mean space, the <hi>malignity</hi> of the Disease prevailed above the strength of Nature, the <hi>whole mass of blood</hi> being vitiated, and 'twas a miserable sight to behold the poor Lady as it were <hi>drowned in her own blood,</hi> and thus destroyed: all her back was full of large <hi>livid setlings of blood,</hi> as if she had been bruised or whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with cords; and being dead her body was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the same day, all her Bowels were sound, the <hi>Liver</hi> in no default, only the Lungs were blackish through the adustion of the blood in the Disease.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107178:129"/>
privately to confess, that their great failour was in omitting Phlebotomy, and that this was the cause of her death.</hi> Thus Physicians oftentimes occasion the death of their Patients, by not doing <hi>what they should,</hi> and not only by <hi>over-acting</hi>: this last is the default of those who attend on the sick, and first try their own <hi>pretended Experiments,</hi> then have recourse to the <hi>receipts</hi> of the <hi>populace,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of some <hi>practising Ladies,</hi> and thus by <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they ought not,</hi> they most officiously kill the sick, and prevent the seasonable advise of <hi>wise Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> who ought to have been consulted at first.

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> in general, there is one Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, that I think I ought to take notice of, since it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Originally from some <hi>Virtuosi</hi>: And though <hi>one</hi> that hath urged it, be most grosly mistaken in his assertion that the <hi>Turks</hi> use no <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> the contrary whereunto is not only evident out of <hi>Prosper Alpinus,</hi> but is confirmed unto me by the observation of my intelligent friend Mr. <hi>Denton</hi> of Q. Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> (nothing being more frequent at <hi>Constantinople</hi> then to <hi>bleed</hi> upon every small occasion, and every <hi>Barber</hi> there being a <hi>Phlebotomist</hi>) yet I believe that in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan</hi> the <hi>Natives</hi> do not practise <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> though the <hi>Europeans</hi> there do: Notwithstanding <hi>this,</hi> I do, not apprehend the force of the Objection as 'tis managed against <hi>Plebotomy,</hi> nor can I commend <hi>their judgement</hi> who from <hi>those Presidents</hi> (which indeed are but <hi>one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> the <hi>Iaponese</hi> being no other then a <hi>Chinase-Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (would put <hi>us</hi> upon an Essay of practising without <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne section.</hi> Eor, the difference of <hi>particlar Countries</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (arising either from their <hi>Temperament, Diet,</hi> and <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious Medicaments</hi> and <hi>Method of Curing</hi>) as to render

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout <hi>Christmas,</hi> I was earnestly pressed by some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Great Learning,</hi> and of no <hi>Common Repute,</hi> to make some Reply unto— <hi>G.

And to propose it to their judgment,
"Whether 'twas like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that my <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> was so far beyond other Scholars in his <hi>Intellectuals,</hi>

I</hi> believe there is a near Connexion between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and there's a <hi>Taste</hi> in the Soul, whereby it relisheth <hi>Truth,</hi> as the Palate <hi>Meats</hi>; which sense and gusto <hi>vice</hi> depraves and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates."

To what an heighth of <hi>Impudence</hi> and <hi>Arrogance</hi> it hath transported <hi>Ecebolius,</hi> is manifest: Nor are his <hi>Abettors</hi> less moderate: The <hi>History</hi> contains the <hi>like Suggestions</hi> as I have shewed: And the <hi>Anonymous Epistoler</hi> doth fly as high: 'Tis strange a <hi>Doctor of Divinity</hi> should write so; and more, that he should thus defend the passage I animadverted upon, in a <hi>Manuscript</hi> not yet published, but communicated to others; the reply to what I say (p. <hi>42. and 29.</hi>) how he makes the <hi>Vniversities Lands alienable,</hi> is:
"They <hi>most were designed for another kind of</hi> Worship than what is now in use: And <hi>they may be changed in one as well as in another Particular</hi> for the better. But I speak not against useful and modest disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but against <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>conceited Terms.</hi>"
—Reader, The <hi>Subject of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> betwixt <hi>him</hi> and <hi>me,</hi> is <hi>Controversial Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> not the <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>conceited Terms</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Who can <hi>Dispute</hi> with such men as these?</p>
                     <p>It may not be impertinent to this <hi>subject</hi> for me to take notice of a passage of Mr <hi>J. E.</hi> concerning the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,</hi> which though it be more favourable to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> then this <hi>last Author</hi> would allow of, yet did it not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107178:158"/>
become <hi>Him</hi> to write, it being very derogatory to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities.—
"That might redeem the <hi>World</hi> from the Insolency of so many <hi>Errours</hi> as we find by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will not abide the <hi>Test,</hi> and yet retain their Tyranny; and that by the credit <hi>only</hi> of, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses of those many <hi>Fencing-Schooles</hi> which have been built <hi>(not to name them Colledges)</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed in all our Vniversities: I speak not here of those reverend and renowned Societies which converse with <hi>Theology,</hi> cultivate the Laws <hi>Municipal</hi> or forreign; but I deplore with just indignation, the <hi>supine neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> of the <hi>Other,</hi> amongst such numbers as are set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for empty and less fruitful <hi>Speculations</hi>—"
These are his words in the Dedication of <hi>Nadius's</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions concerning a <hi>Library</hi> (out of which <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> I find T.
