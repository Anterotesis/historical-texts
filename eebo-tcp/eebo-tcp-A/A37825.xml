            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>11. <hi>Altho' the Pretors</hi> Edict <hi>is very express, yet the Explanation of it is not to be passed over. 12. The</hi> Woman <hi>is bound to intimate her being with</hi> Child, <hi>to all</hi> those <hi>who are concerned in it, and to</hi> all others <hi>to whom either the whole</hi> Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance <hi>or a part of it belong; whether by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in the course of Law, or by the Will of the Dead. 13. And even if a</hi> Slave <hi>is made</hi> Heir <hi>by the</hi> Will, <hi>there being no Child,</hi> Aristo <hi>writes,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41575:2"/>
that the <hi>Pretor</hi> ought, according to his discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to give him some, though not all those privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of watching over the birth; in which I think he is in the right: <hi>For it is of publick concern, that there should be no suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Births; and that the Dignity of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, &amp; of the different ranks of men, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served entire.</hi> And that therefore even this <hi>Slave,</hi> who is put in the hope of the Succ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssion, should be heard, how mean soever his condition may be, since the <hi>Publick is concerned</hi> in that which he looks after, as well as he is as to his own particular.</p>
               <p>14. The matter ought to be imtimated to <hi>those</hi> who are the next in the <hi>Succession;</hi> but not to those who come after them in the entail: but if the <hi>Father</hi> died without a Will, then it must be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to those who succeed immediately to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct: and if there are many Heirs Portioners, it must be intimated to them all, 15. As for that Clause, in which the <hi>Pretor</hi> says, that upon the <hi>hearing of the Cause,</hi> he will not put the Child in possession, and that he will not give him leave to sue for it: by this (of hearing the Cause) is to be understood, that if by a clownish simplicity some of those things have been neglected, that the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> has appointed to be observed, this must not turn to the prejudice of the Child; for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is there, that if any of those things have been omitted, which the <hi>Pretor</hi> has order'd to be slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed, that then the Possession of the Estate should be denied to the Child? But a regard is to be had to the <hi>Custom of the Country;</hi> and according to that, both the <hi>Big-Belly,</hi> the <hi>Birth,</hi> and the <hi>Child,</hi> are to be visited and watched over.</p>

                     <q>I knew another Woman, who said that she was in Labour, and pretended to have had her Pains for the space of ten days, till she had bought a Child, mean while the Husband was running about to all places, buying those Remedies that hastened Labour. But an Old Woman brought in a Pot a <hi>Child</hi> to her, the Mouth of which she had shut up carefully with Wax, that so it might not cry out; and as soo as she had made a Sign to the Woman, intimating what she had brought to her, she that pretended to be in Labour, cried out to her Husband, <hi>Get you gone; get you gone, Husband; for I am now upon the point to be brought to bed, and I feel the Child, kicking with his Heels ready to break out.</hi> Upon this he in great joy withdrew, and presently the Old Woman pluck'd out of the Child's mouth that Wax with which she had stopped it: upon which that cursed Woman that had brought in the Child run out with great joy to the Husband, and said, You have a Son born that looks like a Lyon, like a Lyon; and that is yor very Image in all things.—<hi>What follows, is too immodest to be translated.</hi>

Laws consist not in the words in which they are conceived, but in the intent of the Makers of them; and are to be explained by the good of the Publick for which they are made. Nothing is specified in the Law concerning such a case, because the Law-giver, who mentioned another case in the Law, could not but conclude, that the one being expressed, no body could doubt of the other. For after all, there are many cases that seem to be omitted in many Laws, which yet we ought not to think omitted; because we may easily see what we ought to think of them from those cases that are mentioned in the Law.</p>
