            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For warre it is not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at this time to make comparison, or commit the two Nations together. The controuersie is already moued by other, and hangeth vndecided in the Court of learning. Thus much, me thinks, I may truly affirme, that the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> were the first, that out of variety of actions, and long experience reduced the knowledge of Armes into an Arte, and gaue precepts for the orderly mouing a Battaile, and taught, that the moments of victory rested not in the
<pb facs="tcp:7163:3"/>
hands of multitudes, but in a few men rightly instructed to manage armes, and trained vp in the obseruation of the discipline of the field. In which regard they had almost in all Cities amongst them Masters of Armes, whom they called <hi>Tacticks,</hi> which deliuered the Arte Military to such, as were desirous to learne. Out of whose Schooles issued those chiefs of warre in number so many, in skill so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, in valor so peerelesse, in all vertues beseeming great Generals so admirable, that no Nation of <hi>Europe</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to this day hath been able to match, much lesse to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-match their fame, and glory. And the time was when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> exceeded the rest in Martiall skill, and were thought to be the best Souldiers of <hi>Greece;</hi> by meanes whereof they aduanced themselues to the Principality of <hi>Greece,</hi> which they held with such reputation, that an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie by the space of 500 yeares was not seene within their Territory. Till at last growing insolent, and surfeiting of, and being not able to brooke their owne fortune, they sought to oppresse, and with wrong and force to possesse the City of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and stirred vp <hi>Epaminond as a The ban</hi> by birth, and from his tender yeares nourished by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers care in the study of Philosophy, and the science of Armes, to oppose against them, who in two battailes, the one at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> the other at <hi>Mantinea</hi> so broke their forces, that from that day forth they were neuer able to recouer their wonted authority, and power in the field. <hi>Philip</hi> the sonne of <hi>Amyntas</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> being but a priuate man, was deliuered as a hostage to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> &amp; brought vp in the same house and learning with <hi>Epaminond as.</hi> He afterward became King of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> which being of it selfe but a poore kingdome, and before his time sometimes kept vnder by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> sometimes by the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> sometimes by the <hi>The bans,</hi> &amp; finding it at his entrance

to the Crowne harried, and spoiled by the <hi>Paeonians,</hi> and forced to pay tribute by the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> by erecting a new arte, and discipline of warre, to which he exercised, and enured his <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he not only freed his Countrey from the Barbarous nations, but also ouercame the <hi>Graecians,</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the only Masters of armes till that day, and caused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be declared Generall of <hi>Greece</hi> against the <hi>Persians:</hi> against whom after he had made his full preparation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to go in person. But being preuented by death, he left the succession of his kingdom, and execution of his designes to <hi>Alexander</hi> his sonne, whom he had before curiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the discipline of Armes inuented by himselfe. The same <hi>Alexander</hi> (being about 20 yeares of age) after he had vanqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His kingdomes were after his death diuided amongst many Successors, who by the same Arte military easily maintained the possession of their conquests. This Arte is it, that I at this time present vnto your Highnesse. It was comprised in writing by many, and yet none of their works attained our age, but only that of <hi>Aelian;</hi> who hath in a small volume so expressed the arte, that nothing is more short, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more linked together in coherence of precepts, and yet distinguished with such variety, that all motions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, or to be vsed in a Battaile are fully expressed therin. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> liued in the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor. How much the booke was of ancient time esteemed may appeare by this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that <hi>Leo</hi> a succeeding Emperor setting downe Martiall instructions for the gouernment of his <hi>Empire,</hi> transcribeth whole passages out of <hi>Aelian,</hi> &amp; whensoeuer he citeth, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the <hi>Tacticks,</hi> he giueth still the first place vnto <hi>Aelian.</hi>

From thence hee passed into Germany, &amp; being rather desirous of peace, then warre, yet hee so exercised his souldiers, as though warre were at hand; teaching them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure paines &amp; hardnesse, himselfe giving an example of military life: gladly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vsing Camp fare, as namely lard, &amp; cheese, for meate, &amp; water mingled with vineger for drink, in imitation of Scipio Aemilianus, &amp; of Metellus, &amp; of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian the author of his preferment &amp; rising, bestowing rewardes vpon many, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors vpon some, to encourage them to beare such things, as seemed harshe in his commaundes.

Furthermore hee was carefull to vnderstand the controversies betwixt souldier and souldier, and searched with great attentiuenesse into the revenues of the Provinces, to the end to supply, what was wanting; endevouring notwithstanding aboue all neither to buy, nor feede ought, that was not for vse. Wherefore when he had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned his souldiers to his owne example, he passed over into Britaine, where hee corrected many thinges, and was the first, that drew a wall along by the space of eighty mile; wherewith hee diuided the Romans from the barbarous people. <hi>Hetherto Spartian.

Howbeit there is none heere mentioned by Aelian, whose workes are extant. Where by may be esteemed the inestimable losse, these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages haue suffred in being deprived of such excellent monuments. I hope, I may so terme them without offence, though I haue not seene them. For what but excellent, can proceed from men of such excellencie in theire profession? such as the most parte of those were. Yet, for some of them, I can say nothing, as finding litle remembrance of them in auncient writers. Of this kind are Eupolemus, Stratocles, Hermias, Clear chus, Pausani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as: albeit such names may often bee founde: The rest are specially mentioned, and much commended.

For his life and worth resort to the preface of the same Casaubon to Polybius his history. Hee had beene in Achaia, his owne countrey, Generall of the horse. Afterward being in displeasure with the Romans, hee lived long in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at Rome: and was for his worth finally released by intercession of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test men of Rome: and became companion to Scipio Africanus the younger; with whom also he was at the siege and destruction of Carthage. His Tacticks, whereof Aelian speaketh, are perished with other of his workes. Yet are there many passages dispersed heer, and there in his history, which argue his extraordinary skill in matters of warre. And it may seeme, that Aelian hath taken much from him both for matter, and wordes.</hi>

               <p>I will then beginne with such <hi rend="sup">1</hi> preparations as are absolutely necessary for service in warre, the forces whereof are of two sortes, the one Land forces, the other ship forces. <hi>Land</hi> forces are such, as fight on land: <hi>Ship</hi> forces such, as are ordered for fight in shippes vppon Sea, or Rivers. But the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Sea</hi> service I will reserue for another place, and intreat now of things pertayning to <hi>Land</hi> service.

                     <hi>IN this Chapter the kindes of Souldiers are distinguished according to theire seueral armes borne in fight. And therefore of foote some are called</hi> armed, <hi>because they beare heavy armes; other</hi> light-armed <hi>or</hi> naked, <hi>because they weare no defensiue armes, other some</hi> Targetiers, <hi>because theire chief defence rested in a slight target, wherewith they covered theire bodies. The horse also haue theire appellation, as theire</hi> armes <hi>are. And some are Cataphracts, because themselues &amp; horses were armed compleatly, other Launciers, for that they vsed a launce: other some Acrobolists, by reason they fought with flieng weapons a farre of. The first thoughts of a Prince, or State, that is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to put an army into the field, ought to be to provide</hi> armes. <hi>Armes are the security of theire own souldiers, the terror of the ennemy, the assured ordinary meanes of victory. The antiquity of armes is all one with the beginning of warre. For when of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time mighty men puffed vp with pride, and led by ambition, sought by violence to enlarge their empire, and to bring vnder subiection their bordering neighboures, they were enforced to flye to the invention of</hi> armes, <hi>without which noe victory could bee obteyned. Since,</hi> armes <hi>haue been taken vp for defence also, necessity, the mother of artes, inventing a meanes to withstand ambition. As Antalcidas wel obiected to Agesilaus being wounded by the Thebans;</hi> you are well rewarded for your labour, quoth hee, since you would needes teache the Thebans to fight, that had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will, nor skill so to doe. For the Thebans being put to necessity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence grewe warlick through many invasions of the Lacedemonians, <hi>saith</hi>

This is certeyne, that the most warlick nations, and most victorious haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes sought to haue advantage of theire enemies by advantage of armes. The end of armes is either to defend, or assault. Hence are armes diuided into two kindes: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue, and Offensiue. Defensiue are those, which are worne to resist the force, and charge of the enemy. Of this sort are the head-piece, gorget, curace, vambrace, gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, tases, greves, and target.

                     <hi>But as defence, and security of a mans self is more agreable to nature, then to hurt an enemy, so are the defensiue armes preferred before the offensiue, in that they bring safety to him, that beareth them, where as the other are imployed in annoieng the enemy onely. The Poets sett foorth theire bravest and valiantest men alwayes best armed for defence. So Achilles in Homer, and Aeneas in Virgil, are armed to point with armes wrought by Vulcan, to the end to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vntowched amiddest the stormes of theire enemies weapons.

But by litle &amp; litle beginning to turne theire thoughts from vnnecessary expences to a loue of comelinesse in thinges, that were profitable &amp; honest, he brought them at last to leaue the expences of the body, &amp; to shew themselues gallant, &amp; braue, in soldierly, &amp; warlick furniture. A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might therfore haue seene the shoppes full of silver and golden cuppes cutte a pieces, of curaces guilded with gold, of silvered targets, and bittes; the places of exercise fraught with colts then first backed for service, &amp; with yong galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts managing their armes; &amp; in the handes of women head-pieces adorned with divers-coloured trymmings, horsemens coates, and souldiers cloakes curiously embellished with flowers.

And seing them glitter with gold and silver, and with all excesse of bravery, as the manner of the Asiaticall people was, tooke so great delight therein himself, that calling Anniball vnto him, hee shewed his troopes, and demaunded, if hee thought not that Army sufficient for the Romans: yes quoth Anniball, though they were the most covetous people in the world. Anniball with good reason derided the vaine shewe fitter for a mask, then a field, which hee assured himselfe, would fall into the Romans handes to bee spoiled. Mithridates committed the like errour in his first warre against the Romans.</hi> For, as Sophisters are wont for the most parte, saith <note n="d" place="margin">Plutarch. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

bravery to the outward view: But being foiled to his shame, and weighing in his minde, he must take vp second armes against them, he sought to reduce his forces to a true kinde of arming, &amp; fitte for the service, he intended. Reiecting therefore multitudes, and confased threatnings of barbarians, and furnitures of armes guilded, and sette with precious stones, as being a pray for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, and noe assurance for him, that weares them, hee brought in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man swords, and caused long heavy targets to bee framed, and chose horses, rather that were already managed, and made fitte for service, then those, that were richly trapped and garnished. So farre Plutarch. <hi>The souldiers care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to bee first for surenesse, then for fitnesse, lastly sor comelinesse and ornament in armes. If the two first faile, the last availeth litle, and will proue rather a burden, then a defence. And thus much of armes in generall: Nowe followe the particulers of armes, as they are in Aelian.</hi>

For purposing to fight by water you must haue shippes, by land, you must haue foote, and horse. For which, if you prouide noe armes, you put them into the field not to fight, but to bee slaughtered. The manner of fight in the field is not of one sort. Some time celerity is needfull, to attempt or prevent the enemy: sometime a slowe and sure proceeding, lest, with to much hast, wee be overtaken our selues Therefore the divers arming of souldiers, ought to be such, that they may serue for all occasions, and vses, and that wee may employ alwayes to service such, as by reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some take them to haue been made of other matter, &amp; covered over with brasse: &amp; that otherwise the souldier should not haue been able to haue born them for the weight. I deny not, that in auncient time some targets were plated with brasse: the rather, because I find, that Alexander to match the Indian pompe covered the targets of his souldiers with plates of silver.

Yet vsed the Macedonian souldiers both; at one instant they both charged theire pikes, and covered themselues with theire targets against the flyeng weapons of the enemy. The manner was this: when they closed with the enemy, they charged theire pikes with both handes, and with a slight wryeng of the body, and lifting vp the right shoulder, whirled their target, hanging at their backe, vpon the left shoulder, that stood next the enemy in the charge: and so covered all theire body to the midle, and beneath.

The fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weapons haue theire advantages; They haue also theire disadvantages. Theire advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is, they pierce all defence of armour, and lighting vpon a place of the body, the wound whereof endaungereth life, they bring with them certeine death. Theire disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are, they are not alwayes certeine, sometimes for want of charging, sometimes through over charging, sometimes the bullet rowling out, sometimes for want of good powder, or of dryed powder, sometimes because of an ill dryed matche, not fitte to coale, or not well cocked.

Neither is the force of arrowes so weake, as is immagined, noe not in the arming of our dayes. For the pike albeit hee haue his head and body covered, yet are his legges, and feete, his armes, and handes open to woundes: any of which parts being wounded bringes a disability of service. To say nothing of his face, and eyes, before which the showers of arrowes falling like a tempest without intermission, must needes breed a remedilesse terrour, and make him thinke rather of saving himselfe, then offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his enemy. The musketier being also vnarmed is as subiect to the shotte of arrowes, as the archer is to the shotte of the musket; and the arrow touching any vitall parte, as much taketh away life, as doth the musket. Lastly a horse-man for his owne person (I must confesse) is safe enough from the daunger of arrowes by reason of his armour but his horse, being a faire and large mark, and having neither barbe, nor pectorall, nor ought else to hide his head or breast, how can hee escape woundes?

Of old they had noe curaces, but fought in short gownes girded to them. By reason whereof they were ready, &amp; actiue to alight from, and gett vp quickly, on theire horses. But their fight was daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous with the enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they wanted armes. Theire staues had two incommodities. For, being made slender and quivering, they neither could touche the mark, they aymed at, and most of them, shaken with the motion of the horse, fell out to bee broken, before the head touched, or fastened vpon any thing. Ioyne, that, having no iron point at the butt end, they served but for one stroke onely, and that at the first. And yet the head being broken of, the remnant of the staffe was of noe vse. The targets they had, were made of oxe-hyde in forme like to cakes named <hi>Popanae,</hi> which are vsed in sacrifices. And they were neither fitte to encounter the enemy, by reason they had noe stiffnesse or fastnesse in resistance, and being resolved, and soked, or putrified with raine, they could not bee any thing worthe. Finding these inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by experience, they quickly chaunged for the Graecian armour; In which the first stroke of the head of the staffe is certeyne, and worketh the designed effect, by reason of the forme, which is not quivering, but stiffe and sturdy: &amp; likewise turning foreward the butte end, which is armed with a sharpe point, they might therewith fasten a sound, and forcible blowe vpon the enemy. The like may be said of the Targets, which both in charging, and defending, haue a sure &amp; vnfailable vse. Which they noe sooner saw, then imitated. For the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, if any other nation, are good to change their fashions, and to choose that, which is best, wheresoever they finde it. <hi>The Launcier then had a Curace, a head-piece, a launce, and a sword for his armes, and this was generall in Launciers; but some had besides a target, and were therefore called targetiers.

In doeing these things they vsed to alight from theire horse, and rest themselues, and if any of the enemy singled out to fall vpon them, leaping quickly againe to horse-backe, they fled: and being pursued any distance from the army, as soone as those that pursued them retired, the Tarentines followed, and plyed them with their darts, and put them to great distresse: forcing the whole armie to advance, and retire, as they list them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.

At the end of the yeare all things were brought to extreame hasard. For both the Consuls camp, being assaulted, was hardly defended, and not long after, when the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie was ledd through a forrest, the way whereof was streight, and narrowe, the Ligurians possessed themselues of the mouth of the straights. Through which when the Consull could find no passage, hee turned about his armie, and purposed to reduct it, the way he came. But the mouth of those straights was likewise possessed by a part of the enemies forces. And now the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the <hi>Desaster</hi> of Caudium presented it self not onely to the minds, but even almost to the eyes of euery man. There were wellnigh eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Numidian horse at that time in the camp. The Commaunder of them promised the Consull to breake through on which side, hee pleased; onely he desired to know on which side most hamblets, and villages were. Vpon them, said hee, I will fall, and sett the houses on fire presently, that, that feare may

compell the Ligurians to forsake the streights, they hould, and runne severall wayes to defend theire owne. The Consull much commended the man, and laded him with hopes of promises. The Numidians vp to horse, and began to ride heere and there, before the enemies gards, provoking yet no man. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the first sight was more contemptible. The horse, and men, were little, and leane. The horsman vngirded, and vnarmed, saving that hee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried darts; the horse without a bridle galloping deformedly with a stiffe neck, and a head thrust out at length. They purposely augmenting this contempt slid from their horses, and dallied, and sported, to bring the enemie to a gaze. Wherefore the enemy, which at first were intentiue, and ready for a charge, became gazers on, and the most part vnarmed themselues, &amp; sett downe vpon the ground. The Numidians rode vp neerer, and then backe againe, and by little, and little, gott to the skirts of the forest; as if theire horses, being resty, had caried them forward against theire wills. At last, putting spurres to they broke through the midst of theire enemies gards, &amp; entring into a larger field, they sett fire on all the houses next the way; then burned they the next vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and wasted, and filled, all things with fire, and sword. The smoke first scene, then the cry of the people affrighted, lastly ould men, and children, flieng for succor, raised a tumult in the campe. Therefore without counsell or commaund every man of himself ranne to the defence of his owne, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moment both the enemies camp was forsaken, &amp; the Consull, delivered from his siege, came to the place intended. <hi>By these two examples the kinde of fight, that these darters one horse-backe maintained, may he perceiued, which was</hi>

Let a sould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier serue never so many years, so long, as hee is vnexercised, hee shall bee still a raw souldier. <hi>The knowledge and science of armes maketh a souldier, which is not gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but by action. As long as a souldier handleth not his weapons, hee is noe Actor, but a looker on. For as all abilities in artes (which are called</hi> Habits) <hi>arise out of a number of actions precaeding, so can noe man atteyne to a perfect knowledge of armes, till hee haue with care, and diligence, employed his study and labour therein, and vpon the foundation of practise raised the frame of sound and perfect skill. Noe man is naturally borne a souldier. One may more incline to warre then another, but the skill commeth not without industry and paines.</hi>

And as in all other things hee that is to rule, and governe another, ought to haue more knowledge, then hee that is commaunded, and governed, so is it in matter of warre. Further, as his skill, so his valour, ought to bee most: that his example may incourage and incite the rest. Which is the cause, that other commaunders also are placed in front, and in the eye of the souldiers that theire valour &amp; forwardnes may bread an honest emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the souldiers to doe, as they doe. Besides, the first place is most beseeming him, that best deserveth, and the more valiant a man is, the more hee desireth to shewe it in the face of the enemy, thereby to winne himself honor, and reputation. Furthermore, hee may doe best service in the front, by entring into the enemies battaile, and making way for the rest. Not vnlike a sworde, whose edge maketh speedy passage into the thing, it cutteth, and draweth after it the rest of the iron, bee it never so blunt. In the front, the ranke of the file leaders giue the push to gaine the field. Which reason I thinke lead</hi>

                        <hi>to the institution of the Romans, who held the Triarij (theire eldest, and best souldiers) in the rear, and brought them not to ioyne, till both the Hastati, and Principes were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or retired. But if wee consider the diuersity of both theire embattailings, wee shall see noe great difference, or at lest wee shall see, that the reason of placing their-best men was not much different. The Graecians in framing theire foure-fold Phalange made in length an even front of a 1024. files. The files were 16. deepe. and the best men therefore in front, because being placed in the midst, or in the reare, there would haue beene no vse of theire valour, and the Phalange might haue beene broken, before it had come to theire turnes to fight. The Romans contrary-wise, in ordering a Legion, made many mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and gaue the front to the Hastati, the middest to the Principes, the reare to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arij. Nowe the Triarij being ordered in the Reare, might at the beginning bee brought to fight in Front, if need were; being noe need, they kept theire place, till their Generalls found it fitt to call vpon them. So then this is the difference. The File-leaders of the Graecians had the Front, because otherwise in so deep a body, as the Phalange was, they could not haue come to fight: The Triarij might alwayes haue beene imployed in Front, in flanke, or in the reare, as pleased the Generall. And that the Romans also in theire seuerall Maniples pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theire best men in Front, I cannot doubt. There stood the Centurions, which were the leaders of the Maniples, and in reason were to bee seconded with the hest men vnder theire commaund.</hi>

Albeit both the text bee corrupted in Pollux, having</hi> Eunomotia <hi>for</hi> Enomotia, <hi>&amp; the interpreter hath worse tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated it, re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring</hi> Enomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, militarie discipline, <hi>&amp;</hi> Moira a duty. <hi>As the Lochos is great, or little, so is the</hi> Eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motia. <hi>The Lacedemonian</hi> Enomotia <hi>was 32. men, the</hi> Lochos <hi>being 512. but the file of Aelian being 16. and the</hi> Enomotie <hi>noe more,</hi> then the fourth part of a file <hi>the</hi> Enomotie <hi>must conteine</hi> noe more then foure men. <hi>One of euery of these foure must bee a commander; who is called</hi> Enomotarcha, <hi>or the commander of that</hi> Eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motie. <hi>So that in the whole file, consisting of 16. there ought to bee foure</hi> Enomotar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas. <hi>Where they should stand in the file, is a question. Patricius maketh the file-leader the first</hi> Enomotarcha, <hi>the fift man, the second, the ninth man, the third, &amp; the 13 man the fourth; excluding the bringer vp, whom notwithstanding hee acknowledgeth to bee the second man of the file, and in dignitie next to the file-leader. I am of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and yet allowe the places of the first, fift, and ninth, but thinke the bringer-vp ought to bee the last</hi> Enomotarcha: <note n="i" place="margin">Arr. l. 7. 164: C</note> 
                        <hi>Arrian confirmeth my opinion: who writeth thus:</hi> Alexander returning to Babilon, found Prucestes newly come out of Persia, bringing with him 20000. Persians. Then commending the Persians for theire obedience in all things to Prucestes, and Prucestes for his care, and diligence, in ordering them, hee reparted them into bands according to the Macedonian manner. Over every file hee appointed a Macedonian file-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to command, and next a Macedonian dimaerite, and a Decastater, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the paye hee had, which was lesse then Dimaerites, and more then the common souldiers; then twelue Persians, and last of all the file a Macedonian, who also was a Decastater. So that in the whole file there were foure Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, three, whose pay was more, then the common souldiers, and a file<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader the fourth, and more over 12. Persians. So Arrian. <hi>Out of which wordes wee may learne first the number of the Macedonian file, which consisted of</hi> 12. Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and 4. Macedonians, in all 16. <hi>the number, that Aelian requireth in his file. Next,</hi> that the Enomotarchs, or commanders of the foure parts of the file, were likewise 4. <hi>Lastly that the</hi> bringer-vp was one of the foure <hi>by expresse words of Arrian, which is contrarie to the opinion of Patricius, and whereas Arrian termeth the third</hi> Enomotarch. Decastateros <hi>of the pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee received, it is to bee vnderstood, that</hi> Stater <hi>was a piece of coine, of the weight of foure</hi> dragmes <hi>of</hi> Athens <hi>whereof the</hi>

His words sound thus:</hi> over the other sixteen you are to appoint a file-leader (as hee is termed) resolute, and fitt for service, and eight of these sixteen, that shall bee found fittest, you shall place in the front, and reare, of the file, foure in the front, namely in the first, second, third, and fourth place, other foure in the reare, in the sixteenth, fifteenth, foureteenth, and thirteenth place, that the front and reare may be <hi>strengthened</hi> with foure men a piece. The weaker are to bee placed in the midst of the file. <hi>This counsell, or rather precept, of Leo hath this reason. The</hi> front, <hi>and the</hi> reare, <hi>are the principall places the enemy commonly giveth vpon. The</hi> front <hi>wee alwaies turne against the enemy, if we can.

For Leo placeth the light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>armed, and horse in the</hi> flanks. <hi>Soe these two places, being most subiect to the violence of the enemy, require extraordinarie care, and assurance.

I will set downe the effect of Cyrus words at large because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the ordering of an armie to fight according to the iudgement of Xenophon.</hi> Cyrus then being to trye a battaile with Craesus thus directs his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders: you, saith hee, Araspes take your place in the right wing, as you now doe, and you the other Myriarches, as you are acoustomed. For when the fight is once a foote, noe Chariot may change horses; and command the Taxiarches, and file-leaders, to order theire files every one divided in two parts Phalange-wise, that is each half fronting one with another in a right line. A file conteineth foure an twenty men. Then saide one of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riarches, doe you thinke Sir, that wee shall bee able, in this order, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter so deep a Phalange, as the enemies? Cyrus answered, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langes that are deeper, then may with theire armes reach the enemy, are they fitt thinke you either to annoye the enemy, or profitte theire frindes? For my part I could wish those, that are ranged 100<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in depth, to bee in depth a thowsand. For so should wee haue the fewer to fight with all. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that I giue for the depth of the Phalange, I doubt not, but will entirely serue for vse, and maintaine a joynt fight in every part. The Darters I will place after the armed, and after the darters the Archers. For who will sett them in front, that confesse themselues vnable to maintaine a fight hand to hand? Howe then will they hould theire grownde, if they bee sett before the armed? but being in the reare, some with darts, other with arrows, sent over the heads of the armed, will greatly endammage the enemy. And it is cleere, that wherewithall soever an enemy is endamaged, with the same a mans owne fide is eased, and relieved. You therefore order your selues, as I haue appointed. As for the captaines of the Targetiers I will haue them, and theire files, stand likewise next the armed in the Reare, and after them the Archers. And you the chiefe Commaunder of the Reare
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7163:33"/>
enjoyne the other reare Commanders every man to haue an eye to those vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, that they doe theire duties. And let them sharply threaten the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and in case any man treasonably forsake his place, punish him with death. For it is the worke of Commanders both with word, and deed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage those, they command, &amp; to make the cowards more afraide of them, then of the enemy. This is your charge, but you Euphratas, that command over the Engines, see that the beasts, that drawe the Engines, and Turrets, followe the Phalange as neere, as may bee. And you Daouchus, that haue the charge of the baggage, come with your manye next after the Turrets, and let your Serieants seuerely punish them, that hast to much before or come to slowly after. And you Carduchus, that rule the wagons, wherein the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are, order them next the baggage. For all these, comming in the reare, will both breede an opinion of multitude, and giue vs meanes to lay an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush, and will force the enemy, purposing to encompasse vs, to fetche a larger compasse; which the larger it is, soe much the weaker must hee be. And you Artabasus, and Artagersas, each of you leade next after these, the 1000. foote you commande a piece. And you Phranuchus, and Asiadatas, order the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarchies of horse you commande not with the Phalange, but set them by themselues a part behind the wagons; and when you haue done it, repaire to vs with the rest of the commanders. But you are to bee in a readinesse; as if you were first to fight. And you the commanders of the Camel-riders place your selues after the wagons, and doe what Artagersas shall bidde you. And you the Commanders of the Chariots, after lotts are cast, let him, whose lotte it is, range himself, and his 100. Charriots, before the Phalange; the other two hundred, one of them is to follow, the Phalange on the right side, wing-wise, the other on the left. So farre Cyrus. <hi>I haue rehearsed the words at large, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to shewe that the light-armed in ancient time were placed sometimes behinde the Phalange; and yet further also, to represent the manner of embattailing an armie, which was then vsuall.

And albeit many of these particulers agree not with our manner at this day (for wee haue neither Engines, nor Camels, nor Chariotts, nor slings, nor darts, nor arrowes) yet is the reason of warre alike in all, and in our placing also</hi> the fitnesse of <hi>seruice prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to bee respected.

And when the Roman <hi>Armed</hi> coulde hardly breake them, by reason of theire depth, and fast knitting together; and of theire bouldnes in daring (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of slaues) to abide the danger of the encounter, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and darts cast in aboundance from the Reare, made them shewe their backs, and fall in a route. <hi>Wee finde heere, that the</hi> light-armed <hi>from the reare effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that, which the</hi> Armed <hi>could not. These slaues endured the shocke, and could not bee broken by the armed, and yet were defeated with Arrowes, and darts, from the Reare: Nowe for the distance that should bee betwixt the bodies of the light-armed, and betwixt them, and the reare of the armed, Aelian saith nothing: I make noe doubt, but there ought to bee as great (if not greater) as in the sections of the armed. For wee must vnderstand, that the sections, that served to sever the</hi> Phalangarchies <hi>one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, must runne through the light-armed in depth to the reare. And by them are the</hi> Epixenagies <hi>to bee devided a sunder, as the</hi> Phalangarchies <hi>are: with</hi> Epixenagies <hi>answer the</hi> Phalangarchies <hi>for number of files, albeit not in number of men.

A dart can not bee sent for ciblie without running two, or three, steppes in the delivery of it. A sling being throwne, and circled about the head, before the stone, or bullet, can bee forced out to any purpose, will not suffer a neere stander by. In bowes, and arrowes, is the like reason, if they be vsed as they ought. Besides the light-armed, in their fight are tied to noe certainty of order, or grounde, but fight dispersedly: Soe that the more grounde they haue, the fitter they are for seruice. In which respect a large intervall croswise betwixt the armed, and them, should serue to purpose it having liberty for their motion forward, and backward, as occasion should require.</hi>

For otherwise it was an ordinarie matter in marching (as it is the manner also at this day) to dispose the horse half behinde, and half before. I will content my self with one example. When</hi>

Either party prepared them selues to fight. The Thessalians holding it not sure with Horse alone to incounter armed foote: Turning about their faces, began leasurely to retire, and the Lacedaemonians slowly to followe, Agesilaus, perceaving the errour of both, sent the best of his horse, that were about him, commanding them to signifie to the rest, that they together should goe, and charge the Thessalians with all speede, and giue noe respite to them, to turne their faces. The Thessalians contrary to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation being hottly charged, some fled, other some turned about towards the enimy, other some indevouring to turne, were surprised by theire ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that by that time were come vp to theire flancke. <hi>Nowe for the reason of Aelians placing the Horse in the reare, I haue noe more to say, then, that from thence they might bee soone drawen to all places, front, flanke, or wheresoever the enemy is like to distresse vs. For it hath beene the forecast, of all generals to fashion their battails accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the figure the enemy hath before chosen.

At a reasonable space behinde, were the Principes placed in as many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples: but soe that theire maniples stoode directly behinde the voide spaces of the Hastati. And against the bodies of the hastati, they left likewise spaces in the Principes to the end. the Hastati being overlaid, might retire within those spaces: or else themselues might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance against the enemy, through the intervalls of the Hastati. Lastly at a larger distance behinde these were the Triarij set, and divided with spaces betwixt euery maniple, which spaces were great enough to receaue the Principes, in case they retired also. Now the Horse being ordered in the reare after the Triarij, if from thence, they had gon to charge the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies front, through the spaces of the Triarij, they must of necessity, haue fallen vpon the Maniples of the Principes whoe were set directly against the intervalls or spaces.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>To giue therefore free passage to theire horse, the Roman Generals removed the maniples of the Principes from theire ordinarie place, and bestowed them, in a right line, after the maniples of the Hastati, and made an open lane, (as it were) from the reare of theire battell to the front. So that nothing hindred the horse, but they might freely fly vp to, and fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the enemies front. And yet I take not Aelians meaning, to be, that the Horse set in the reare, should during the time of the fight still remaine there. For soe would noe great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice bee had of them. But hee placed them there the rather to avoyde confusion in ordering the foote. And that after theire embatteling, they might bee led from thence to any place, front, or flanke, or wheresoever they might yeeld most vse. For in the fifteenth and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith chapter, he would haue both light-armed, and horse soe placed, that they might answer all attempts of the enemy. And in his caution following, hee saith,</hi> if occasion require both horse and light-armed, may bee otherwise placed. <hi>That they were vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed in the wings, I haue before shewed.

                           <hi>Eumenes being to fight against Craterus and Neoptolemus, both greate generalls, that had served vnder Alexander in all his warrs, ordered the fight thus:</hi> Because hee vnder-stood, that theire Army confisted of twenty thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foote, the most parte Macedonians renowmed for theire valour, and skill in fight (In whom they set theire greatest trust) and of more then two thowsand horse; and knewe his owne foote, albeit they were as many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet all to bee ramasses of diuerse kinds of people, and that his owne horse were fiue thowsand, with exceeded the enimy both in number, and valor, hee determined to hasard the battaile vpon his horse, before the two Phalanges of foote should come together: Advancing therefore with his horse farre before
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7163:35"/>
his foote, hee tooke the right wing himselfe, and gaue the left to two strangers, to Pharnabarus a Persian the sonne of Artabazus; and to Phenix a Tenedian: Craterus stood in the right wing of his owne horse, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Neoptolemus on the left. And seeing the enemies horse comming forward, with greate fury charged them first, and fought brauely. But his horse failing vnder him, hee fell to grounde, and it being not knowne, whoe hee was by reason of the medly, and throng of those, that gaue backe, and fled, hee was trampled vnder foote, and ended his life after a strange manner. By his death the enemy tooke courage, and encompassing theire adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on all sides, made a great slaughter, and the right wing, after this manner, with might overpressed, and put to the worst, was faine to fly for succour to the Phalange of foote. In the left winge Neoptolemus stoode directly against Eumenes, and the mutuall sight of eche bredde a greate emulation betwixt the <hi>generalls,</hi> and a fervent desire to come to hands. And being easely knowne, both by theire horse, and other marks, they flewe one vpon another; and out of theire single fight made away to a consequent victorie. And first they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed one another with swords, and after fell into an vnlooked for, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Monomachy, for being transported with anger, and mutuall hatred, quitting the raines of theire bridles, with theire left hands they eache seazed, and tooke hold vpon the body of other, which hapening, and the horse conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing theire careare, and springing from vnder them, they both fell to the grounde, neither of them could wel arise by reason of the suddaine, &amp; violent fall, and of the heavines of theire armor. Yet Eumenes got vp first, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Neoptolemus, stricking him on the ham. The wounde was wide, and his strength of footing thereby failed, &amp; soe lay as one, that had noe vse of his legge, being not able to raise himself because of the hurt: notwithstanding, courage over coming the weaknes of his body, hee lift vp himselfe vpon his knees, and hurt his adversarie in the arme, and thighes, giving him three wounds. But none of the wounds were mortall, and they being yet warme, Eumenes with a second blowe hitting his necke, slewe Neoptolemus out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Whilest these things were a doing the rest of the horse fell together. Many were slaine on either side: some therefore falling, other being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, at the first the daunger was equall. Afterward, when the death of Neop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolemus was openly knowne, and that the other wing was put to flight, euery one shifted for himselfe, &amp; made towards the Phalange of foote, as to a strong wall of defence to saue himselfe. <hi>This was the issue of the battaile. Wherein Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes, placing his horse before his foote, because hee held them his strength, and with the trieng the hazard of the day, shewed himself, both in councell, and action, a greate gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. And Craterus on the contrary side, albeit highly esteemed emongest the Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as one, that had with great sufficiency served Alexander in all his warres, yet failed in iudgment, in that hee chose rather with his horse to encounter the stronger parte of his enimies forces, then with his Macedonian Pholange (which Eumenes himself feared) to trie his fortune. For as it is a pointe of forecast to knowe a mans owne advantage, and vse it: Soe it is noe lesse iudgement, to knowe wherein the enimye is stronger, and avoyde yt. Eumenes did both; for hee vsed his owne horse, which were his strength, and brought to passe, that Craterus his Phalange did him noe good, in as much as they never came to fight. Craterus failed in both, in that hee neither brought his Phalange to fight, nor yet provided sufficientlie to encounter Eumenes horse; which exceeded his in valour, and number; so appeares both, that horse were placed before the front of the foote; and also the storie giues the reason, why they were placed there.</hi>

                     <hi>THE Chapter before spake of the parts and dimension, of the Phalange, and of the place of the armed, the horse, and light-armed. This treateth of the number that goeth to the Phalange. In choise of which number, Aelian saith consideration is not soe much to bee had of multitude, as of fitnes for service. For such a number as cannot aptly bee disposed of for fight, is rather meanes of confusion, then of order without which noe fight can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned: Therefore such a number is to bee chosen as will serue.</hi>

                     <item>1 The diverse shapes, and transmutations of our Battaile] <hi>Euery motion in the battaile makes not a Transmutation, or diversitie of shape. In</hi> turning of faces <hi>to the one hand or other there is noe other shape of the Phalange, then was at first: As a man turning his face any way, the same proportion of lineaments remaines that was in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Soe likewise</hi> in countermarch <hi>or</hi> wheeling <hi>after the</hi> Countermarche, <hi>or</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>is done, every souldier if he keep his right distance, and remaine in file and ranke, hath the place hee had before: And soe noe transfiguration of length or of depth followeth. The motion then, that Aelian meanes to make Transmutation, are Doublinges: For whether you enlarge the length, or depth, of your Phalange; you straight induce another shape. A long fronted Phalange, and a Herse differ much in forme. If you will make of the ordinarie Phalange a herse, you are to double your files soe often, as your thinke convenient for the length of your herse. Then if from the Herse, your would returne it to the first forme, you are not to cease</hi> doubling Ranks, <hi>till you haue gained that forme: likewise if of your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Phalange, you would make a long fronted Phalange, your</hi> rankes <hi>are to bee</hi> dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>and by continuing your</hi> doublinge, <hi>you may drawe out what length you will. And</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:7163:36"/>
                        <hi>contrarywise, by due</hi> doubling <hi>your files againe, you come to the first forme: How much you double your Ranks, Soe much you take away from the depth of your Phalange; as on the other side,</hi> doubling <hi>of your</hi> files, <hi>diminisheth the length. For the purpose, your Phalange is sixteen deep, double your Ranks; the depth hath but eight men; double it once more, and it hath but foure. Soe is the Phalange consisting of foure</hi> ranks, <hi>&amp; euery</hi> ranke, <hi>hath foure thousand, and ninty six men in it: But the length is foure times as much as it was. In like manner doubling your files (which in Aelians Phalange are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, and twenty foure) the first doubling loseth fiue hundred, and twelue files and soe many remayne; the second seven hundred, and sixty eight, and two hundred fifty six remaine; and soe many men haue you in a</hi> ranke. <hi>But where the Phalange was but six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen deepe, nowe in the second doubling it is become sixty foure deep: If you please to reduce it to the first forme, two</hi> doublings <hi>of</hi> ranks <hi>will suffice. Heere wee must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that doubling ranks, is not to make twice soe many as they were before, but to giue twice so many men, to every ranke, as they had before by insertinge the even ranks into the odde; as the second into the first, and the fourth into the third, and the sixt into the fiuth, and the eight into the seventh, &amp;c. The vse of</hi> doubling <hi>I will shewe in my notes vpon the twenty nine chapter of this booke. Aelian therefore would haue his Phalange, of such a number as may bee</hi> reparted continually into halfe, till you come to one; <hi>which number hee saith to bee sixteen thousand three hundred, and eighty foure. And yt ariseth out of the Multiplication of one by two soe still doubling the product, till you haue made vp the full number, of sixteen thousand, three hundred, and eighty foure. And as the Multiplication by two begetts this number, soe it being divided by two continually, it may bee reduced at last to one: which is the thing, that Aelian aymes at. For the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that haue not equall division by half, leaue some supernumerary men in the Phalange: (which) in doubling will disorder both files, and Ranks: Every man acquainted with the lowe countrie militarie exercise at this day, knoweth, that when there is an vneven number of files, the odde file supernumerary brings a difference, and cannot bee doubled in the sort as the rest are: As in fiue, seven, nine, eleuen, severall bodies of files. Two, six, eight, ten, may well bee doubled, and become two, three, foure, fiue files a piece: but the fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, must bee severed from the rest of the doubled files; and serue to noe purpose, being not matcheable in depth with the rest after theire doubling. The same reason is of ranks: Now when Aelian saith, that this number in a Phalange may bee devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by half and reduced at last to one, wee must with all vnderstand, that the file of the Phalange in such division, ought to be either of eight, or sixteen men a piece. For noe number vnder eight, except foure, or two (which fitte not the depth, of a Phalange) nor betwixt eight, and sixteen, is divisible by half, till you come to one. Noe nor aboue sixteen except it bee produced out of the duplications of sixteen. A file of 12. comes nearest. And of that number was the file of Cyrus in Xenophon. Such a file notwithstanding by diuision of two staies at three, and can descend noe lower. Ten was the old file of the Graecians, and it was called</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Xenop. Cyrop. lib. 2. 43. B.</note> Decas. <hi>And albeit after ward vpon better consideracion they enlarged the number of the file to twelue, yet they reteined the name of Decas still. But ten receiveth but one diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and goeth downe ward noe further then fiue. The vneven numbers vnder sixteen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee divided at all. Vnles by fraction. As thirteen, which if you will divide by halfe, the quotient will bee six, and there remaineth an odde man over: of which number, if all the files of the Phalange should bee, you should haue a thousand, two hundred, and sixty, which will receiue noe more, then two doublings without a fraction. If then the files be aboue sixteen, and vnder thirty two, you cannot divide them continually by half, but you must saile of the manner, that Aelian speaks of. As for the number of sixteen thousand, three hundred, and eighty foure, albeit of it self, it is diuisible by two till you com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <item>3 A Phalange to consist of 16384.] <hi>Aelian (out of the most Tactick writers as he professeth) will haue the</hi> Phalange <hi>of sixteene thousand, three hundred, eighty and foure men. I haue noted before that a</hi> Phalange <hi>may be more, or lesse, than this number. But I take this to be the number of the Macedonian Phalange.</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Appian. in Syriacis. 107. B.</note> Appian <hi>seemes to testifie with me, thus he saith:</hi> Antiochus whole army consisted of 70000 men. Of which the chiefest strength was the <hi>Phalange</hi> of Macedonians, conteining 16000 men, ordered according to the forme, that <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> had before vsed. He placed them in the middle, diuiding the 16000, into 10 equall parts, in euery of which parts was 50 men in front, and 32 in depth, and vpon the flanks of euery part 22 the shew of the <hi>Phalange</hi> was like a wall, of the Elephants like turretts: <hi>hitherto Appian. I haue translated</hi> He Phalanx, He Macedonon <hi>according to the word, the Phalange of the Macedonians, where the right meaning is, the Macedonian Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange. For it consisted not of Macedonians, but was armed, and ordered, after the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian manner. For how was it possible for Antiochus to wage, and haue in his seruice</hi> 16000 <hi>Macedonians, being neuer himselfe King of Macedonia, and the King, that then was (namely</hi> Philip <hi>the sonne of</hi> Demetrius) <hi>was his enemy, and in league with the Romans? Besides</hi> Appian <hi>hath in expresse words:</hi> the Phalange was armed, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, according to the institution of Philip and Alexander: <hi>whose manner Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus mought well reteine, considering he was lineally descended from Seleucus, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor of Alexander in the kingdome of Assiria: And Seleucus had beene in the seruice of Alexander in the whole conquest of Persia.</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Liv: Decad. 4 lib. 7. 141. A.</note> Liuy <hi>saith also, they were armed after the Macedonian manner. Whereby a man may inferre, they were no Macedonians: Hee speaking of the same battaile (which was the battell of Antiochus against L. Scipio) hath thus:</hi> The Kings army was mingled of sundry nations, and diuers with dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of armes and aides. There were 16000 foote armed after the manner of the Macedonians. They were called <hi>Phalangites.</hi> This was the middle of the battell, and in front diuided into 10 parts, which parts were distinguished by placing 2. Elephants in each intervall. The battell had 32 rancks in depth. It was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall strength of the Kings forces, and both with the other shew, and also with the Elephants, which were eminent amongst the Armed only, brought with it great terror. <hi>Liuy saith the</hi> 16000 <hi>were armed after the Macedonian manner, and were called</hi> Phalangites; <hi>Appian, that there were</hi> 16000 <hi>ordered, and distributed according to the ordinance of</hi> Philip <hi>and</hi> Alexander. <hi>Liuy, and Appian, both agree, that there was</hi> 10 <hi>parts, and euery part seuered with intervalls, and had</hi> 32 <hi>men in depth, which is the Macedonian file once doubled.</hi> Livy <hi>speaketh not of the number of the length of the Phalange.</hi> Appian <hi>saith plainely there were</hi> 50 <hi>in front, of euery of the</hi> 10 <hi>parts, which amounts to</hi> 500: <hi>for</hi> 10 <hi>times</hi> 50 <hi>makes</hi> 500. <hi>Now if you multiply the length of the Phalange which is</hi> 500 <hi>by the depth, which is</hi> 32, <hi>you haue the</hi> 16000, <hi>whereof</hi> Liuy <hi>and</hi> Appian <hi>spake. But yet resteth a doubt, in the difference betwixt both these authors, and</hi> Aelian. Livy, <hi>and</hi> Appian, <hi>both giuing but</hi> 16000: <hi>Aelian</hi> 16384 <hi>to the Macedonian Phalange. For</hi> Livy, <hi>we are not much to insist vpon him, who being a Roman (we may probably coniecture) was halfe a stranger, in the Art Tacticke of the Graecians, and that, which he wrote, he had from others; perhaps no better skilled in the same Art than himselfe.</hi> Appian <hi>was a Graecian (for so those of Alexandria in Aegipt accounted themselues, after</hi> Ptolomy <hi>the first had established that Crowne in his family) and as his historie sheweth, well acquainted with the order the Graecians held in embatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>

                        <hi>their armies, and therefore we may the better rely vpon his authoritie. Who albeit hee first affirmed the</hi> Phalange <hi>was of the number of</hi> 16000, <hi>yet after in numbring the depth and length alone, he findeth</hi> 16000: <hi>and further expounding his owne meaning he sheweth, there were more vpon the flanks of the ten parts, into which the</hi> Phalange <hi>was diuided. His words import: That</hi> Antiochus <hi>diuided his</hi> Phalange <hi>into</hi> 10 <hi>equall parts, giuing euery part in front</hi> 50 <hi>men, in depth</hi> 32; <hi>which being multipliea together, make vp the</hi> 16000. <hi>He addeth;</hi> And in the flanke of euery part he set 22. <hi>If the meaning be, he set</hi> 22 <hi>vpon each flanke of euery part, the parts being</hi> 10, <hi>and the flanks</hi> 20, <hi>the number will arise to</hi> 440, <hi>where</hi> Aelian <hi>alloweth no more than</hi> 384. <hi>But if</hi> 22 <hi>were added to one of the flanks of each diuision, which also being collectiuely taken are flanks in the plurall number, we shall come short and finde no more than</hi> 220. <hi>Yet whether sense of both you admit, it is plaine, that</hi> Appian <hi>attributeth more, than</hi> 16 <hi>thousand, to that</hi> Macedonian Phalange. <hi>And it may be, there is an error in the number of the</hi> 22, <hi>and that it ought to be written</hi> 32. <hi>For if</hi> Antiochus <hi>had giuen</hi> 32, <hi>as he gaue</hi> 22, <hi>to one flanke of euery part, and set</hi> 32 <hi>vpon the vttermost flanks of euery winge to strengthen them, of the</hi> 12 <hi>times</hi> 32 <hi>had arisen the iust number of</hi> Aelians Phalange; <hi>which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is the fittest, for vse, and for diuision of the</hi> Phalange <hi>in all doublings. The armed foote then, according to</hi> Aelian, <hi>ought to be,</hi> 16384. <hi>The light armed.</hi>

                     <item>4 Halfe so many] <hi>The armed amongst the</hi> Graecians, <hi>were accounted the strength of the field, which was the cause their number was greatest.

But in any case, let the Ensignes of euery <hi>Turmarchy</hi> be different one from an other, &amp; cleare to be discerned, that the souldiers may know them euen at a farre distance. <hi>His meaning, as I take it, is, that euery great body, or regiment should beare in their</hi> Ensignes <hi>a seuerall colour, and that the Companies of that</hi> body <hi>should likewise hold themselues to the same colour in their</hi> Ensignes: <hi>So notwithstanding that (as the vse is at this day) the</hi> Ensignes <hi>of euery Company should haue a seuerall marke to bee knowne by, besides the colour in generall.

               </head>
               <p>WE are now to speake of <hi>distances</hi> both in length, and depth betwixt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and Souldier, as they stand ordered in Battaile. The <hi>distances</hi> vary in three sorts. For first they are placed in thinner distance for some speciall causes. And a Souldier so placed taketh vp <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 4 cubits. But in <hi rend="sup">2</hi> 
                  <hi>Densation</hi> or <hi>closing</hi> he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp 2 cubits. <hi rend="sup">3</hi> In <hi>Constipation</hi> or <hi>shutting,</hi> one cubit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Densation</hi> then, or <hi>closing</hi> is, when we draw wide distances close together, and by <hi>side-men,</hi> and <hi>followers</hi> (that is both in <hi>length</hi> and <hi>depth</hi>) gather vp the bodie of the <hi>Phalange:</hi> so notwithstanding that the souldier yet hath libertie to moue, and turne about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constipation,</hi> or <hi>shutting</hi> is when the <hi>Phalange</hi> by <hi>side-men</hi> gathereth it selfe yet closer together, then in <hi>Densation;</hi> so that by reason of the nearenesse there is left no <hi>Declination,</hi> or turning of faces either to the right, or left hand.</p>
               <p>The vse of <hi>Closing</hi> is, when the <hi>Generall</hi> leadeth the <hi>Phalange</hi> against the enemy. Of <hi>Shutting</hi> when he would haue it stand fast (and as it were <hi>locked vp,</hi> and <hi>serred</hi>) to receiue the charge of the enemy.</p>
               <p>Seeing then there are 1024 <hi>File-leaders</hi> in the front of the <hi>Phalange,</hi> it is plaine that <hi rend="sup">4</hi> in their ordinary array they take vp in length 4096 <hi>Cubits</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi> (that is ten fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and ninetie six cubits) In <hi>Closing</hi> fiue furlongs, and forty eight cubits. In <hi>Shutting</hi> two furlongs, a halfe, and fower and twenty cubits.</p>

For the other armor of the</hi> armed (<hi>whereof I spake, in my notes to the second Chapter) is (no question) to be fitted to the body of him, that shall beare them.

The</hi> Diameter <hi>that serues to couer the bodie from the vpper part of the necke to the middle part of the thigh, is enough in these round targets. That, which is more, is rather troublesome, then fit for vse. And I am of</hi> Iphicrates <hi>iudgement in targets, that performing the couering of the bodie, they should be as light, as may bee, least the shoulder be ouer-laden with vnnecessarie weight.

The file-leaders laid hold on the pikes, and the enemy stroue to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them out of their hands.

For the same policie might haue prevailed as well against short pikes, as long, each, assoone as the enemies haue seized vpon them, growing to be of no vse. But that the longer pike is to be preferred before the shorter, I haue shewed before by reason: and the reformation of armes made by</hi> Iphicrates <hi>amongst the</hi> Athenians, <hi>and by</hi> Philopomen <hi>amongst the</hi> Achaians, <hi>will be warrant enough so to hold.

                        <hi>When</hi> T. Quintus Flaminius <hi>the Rom: Consull had driuen King</hi> Philip, <hi>and his army from the streights neare</hi> Antigonia, seeing that the enemy kept himselfe with his strength, and absteined from the field, he determined to try the Cities of <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and hauing wonne some by force, some by feare, he came before <hi>Rhage,</hi> and besieged it. He found the siege longer, and more difficult, then any man would haue thought. And the enemy made his resistance, that way, the <hi>Consull</hi> would hardly haue beleeued, he could. For he imagined that all his labour should be in throwing downe the walls. If once he found passage for the Army to enter, there would after be nothing else, but flight and slaughter, as is wont, in wonne-Cities. But after that part of the wall was throwne downe with the Ramme, and the Armie entred the Citie by the breach, it was the beginning of a new and fresh labour. For the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that were there in Garrison, being many, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, thinking it also a glory to them, if they could defend the Citie, rather with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7163:59"/>
armes and valor, than with walles, <hi>serring</hi> themselues close together in a deepe <hi>Phalange,</hi> when they perceiued, that the Romans began to enter the breach droue them out, the place being cumbersome, and hard to make a retreat. The <hi>Consul</hi> much offended therewith, and thinking that shame concerned not only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of winning one Citie, but also the state of the whole warre, (which for the most part dependeth vpon moments of small matters) purging the place which was heaped vp with the fall of the halfe-ruined wall, aduanced a Tower which in many stories was stuffed with multitudes of armed men, and sent besides <hi>Cohorts</hi> vnder their Ensignes to breake with maine force (if it were possible) the body (they call it the <hi>Phalange</hi>) of the Macedonians. But the kinde of weapons and fight was more aduantagious for the enemy, than for the Romans; especially in that place, which was narrow, and streightned with the small space of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne wall. When the Macedonians, <hi>serring</hi> themselues close, had charged pikes of a great length before their front, and the Romans, after their darts throwne in vaine against the <hi>Iestudo</hi> compacted, as it were, of the thicke knitting together of the Targets, had drawne their swords, they could neither come vp close, nor cut a sunder the pikes. And in case they cut the heads of, or broke any, the steale amongst the rest of the whole pikes filled vp the roome with their sharpe fragments. Ioyne that that part of the wall, which was yet whole, secured the enemies flankes on both sides; neither needed they much ground in retiring or advancing to charge, which things are wont to cause the breach of array. There also fell out a chance which increased their hopes, and spirits. For the Tower being driuen on vpon a rampier, that was not well rammed vnderneath, but had loose earth, one of the wheeles sinking deeper into the ground than the rest, made the Turret to nodd, &amp; lie of one side, that both the enemy beleeued it would fall, and they within it were put in a pitifull feare. When nothing succeeded well, the <hi>Consull</hi> was euill appaide, that the Macedonian souldiers, and kinde of Armes, might seeme matcheable to his, and seeing no great hope of speedy winning the Citie, and that the place was vnfit to winter in, raised his siege. <hi>So here the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian souldier is not onely equalled, but also preferred before the Roman, and that onely by reason of his armour, the</hi> Pike <hi>and</hi> Target. <hi>An other experience fell out in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile betwixt</hi> Perseus, <hi>and</hi> Aemilius, <hi>whereof I spake in this Chapter.

Then after-ward againe closed. And when <hi>Domitius Scipio's</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, incompassed it round with horse and light-armed, which he might easily doe, by reason it was thrust vp into a thicke <hi>Plinthium;</hi> it was driuen to great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse; being neither able to charge the enemy, nor yet to countermarch in so great depth, as it carried. It grieued them much, that their long experience no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auailed them to annoy the enemy, and that notwithstanding they were subiect to arrowes, and darts at all hands. Yet, bearing out a multitude of pikes on euery side of their square, they called the Romans to come to handy blowes, and still made a countenance, as though they meant to charge, keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for all that within their Ranks, as being footmen, and heauy armed, and the rather, because they had to doe, with an enemy on horse-backe. Besides they were loth to breake the thicknes of their battaile, which forme they could not now alter. The Romans also, durst not approach them, and come to sword, fearing their experience in warre, and closenesse of array, and desperation. But running about here, and there, plied them with arrowes, and darts, whereof none was throwne in vaine, falling amongst a troupe so closely put vp together, that they could neither auoide, and decline any thing throwne, nor giue way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they saw it comming. At last being weary, and irresolute what to doe, they retired easily, with a threatning countenance notwithstanding, and in good order, and not deliuering the Romans of feare, who durst not yet come neare, but sought to annoy them aloofe; till the Elephants placed in the <hi>Macedonian Phalange,</hi> being affrighted, and not to be ruled by their Gouernours, troubled all, and gaue occasion of flight: <hi>hitherto</hi> Appian. <hi>Out of these three examples, the truth of that, which</hi> Aelian <hi>saith, is to be seene, that is, that the</hi> Macedonian Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange <hi>can not be forced, or resisted by an enemy, (taking with all</hi> Polybius <hi>his caution) if it be in the right posture, and figure, and haue such ground, as is fit.

                        <hi>rested that day, where he had taken it, being busie in selling of it. In the meane time many</hi> Acarnan <hi>Targetieres assembled themselues together, where</hi> Agesilaus <hi>was incamped vpon the side of a mountaine, and with darting and slinging, they forced his Campe to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the plaine, themselues in the meane time being free from hurt. The next day</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesilaus <hi>led away his armie. The passage out of the place was straight, by reason of the mountaines lying about in a circle, which the</hi> Acarnans <hi>possessing, plied the</hi> Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <hi>with darts, and stones, from the higher ground, and sometimes descending to the skirts of the hills, they pressed the armie so, that it could not moue forward. And when the armed, foote, or horse, fell out vpon them, they profited little: For the</hi> Acarnans <hi>retired</hi> immediately, to their strength. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> perceiuing it would be hard for his armie to winde out of those straights, so long as the enemy so hung vpon them, resolued to charge those on his left hand. For the ascent on that side was more easie, both for his horse, and armed foote. Commanding therefore, his men to charge, the armed (of 29 yeeres of age) first fell on, and the horse after them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the spurre. Himselfe followed with the rest. The <hi>Acarnans</hi> therefore, that were descended, and busie a darting, were quickly put to flight, and many slaine in seeking to remount the hills. But their armed foote, and most of their Targetiers, stood imbattailed on the toppe, and from thence both threwe other missiues, and lanced Iauelines, wherewith they wounded horsemen, and killed some horse. But being ready to be charged by the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> armed, they fled, loosing some 300 in the flight. <hi>These</hi> light-armed <hi>then, as long as they can keep aloofe from the enemie, annoy them sore by wounding (as</hi> Aelian <hi>saith) a farre of; as soone as the armed come vp, they are glad to quite their place, and saue themselues by flight.</hi>

                     <item>2 Fashioned and forme of a Rhombe] <hi>There are three kindes of horse battailes mentioned by</hi> Aelian, <hi>the Rhombe, the Wedge, and the Square. And the square is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a iust, square, or longer in flanke then in front, or in front then in flanke. The Rhombe was the inuention of the</hi> Thessalians, <hi>and in that forme they vsually fought. But where he maketh</hi> Iason <hi>to be the inuentor of it, he afterward expoundeth his owne meaning, attributing the inuention to</hi> Ileon <hi>the</hi> Thessalian <hi>(from whom also it was tearmed</hi> Ile) <hi>but the chiefe practise to</hi> Iason. Euclyde <hi>defineth a Rhombe in this sort:</hi> 
                        <hi rend="sup">f</hi> A Rhombe is a square figure, that hath the sides equall, but the angles not right.<note place="margin">b Euclyd. lib. 1. definit. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>That is, the foure sides of the square are of one, and the same length, but the points, which make the angles, are two of them stretched out in greater length, and become more sharpe, two of them brought narrower together, and made more blunt, then the right angles of a</hi> Tetragonall <hi>square. See the figure. It is the same figure in a battaile, that at this day we call the</hi> Diamond <hi>battaile, which is sometimes practised amongst the foote for shew, and evercise sake, but amongst the horse I haue not seene it practised. And as the square goeth to charge with all the souldiers, that stand in one of the sides, that is with the front, (for the front is but a side of the square) so the Rhombe chargeth with one of the points, which is the front of the Rhombe. Whether of them is of most vse in the field, I am not to determine. For the square standes the practise of our daies, besides the vsage of the</hi> Persians, Sicilians, <hi>and most</hi> Graecians, <hi>as</hi> Aelian <hi>saith. For the Rhombe the</hi> Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians <hi>alone (which notwithstanding were acknowledged the best horsemen of</hi> Greece) <hi>vnlesse we allow the Wedge for a parcell of the Rhombe, (a Rhombe being but a double Wedge, as making two wedges, when it is diuided in two) and then haue wee for the Rhombe not onely the</hi> Scythians, <hi>and</hi> Thracians <hi>(both nations very good Horsemen) but King</hi> Philip Amintas <hi>sonne, and</hi> Alexander <hi>the great, and his successours. Either of both formes haue their reasons. For the squares they, that vse them, held opinion (as</hi> Aelian <hi>saith) that they were easier to frame, and fitter for ioint mouing of horse, and sooner in order of file, and ranke, and that the Commanders iointly charged the enemy, which in no other forme could be done. For the easinesse to frame I see no great difference, onely custome, and vse, must in euery for me, yea in the squares themselues make the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ready to know, and take, and keepe his place. The same may be said for the ioint moou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the horse. Now to file and rancke is common to the square with some Rhombes, and as soone done in the one, as in the other, the number of the troupe being once knowne, and euery horseman hauing his place assigned, and the forme resolued vpon, into the which it must be cast. For where there are 4 kinds of Rhombes, one, that fileth, and ranketh; an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that fileth, but ranketh not; the third, that ranketh, but fileth not; the last that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fileth, nor ranketh (as</hi> Aelian <hi>teacheth in the next Chapter) The first will finde no more difficultie, of fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The fourth is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther curious then profitable, as I take, neither doe I find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> example of it. And it may bee truly affirmed of it, that the square is much easier to be fashioned. We shall haue occasion to speake of the last three in due place. Touching the ioint falling on of the Commanders, I confesse the aduantage is great. For when the best men (such as the Commanders ought</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:7163:69"/>
                        <hi>to be) altogether fall vpon the enemy, they are very like to put hard to them. And as it is a great part of skill to bring many hands to fight, so is it no lesse, to bring the best hands to fight. Many hands make light worke, the best hands sure worke. Now for the</hi> Rhombe Aelian <hi>alledgeth these reasons. First, that it is fittest for all encounters, because the horsemen are ready to turne their faces euery way with speed. Then, that they cannot be surprised in flanke, or reare, hauing the best men in their flanks, and the Commanders in euery point of the</hi> Rhombe. <hi>And cannot the square turne faces euery way? They can, but not with the same advantage. For the</hi> Rhombe, <hi>which way soeuer faces are turned, remaineth in the first forme. And whether it be to the right, or left flanke, or to the reare, it keepeeh still 4 euen sides, and the men of most seruice in the sides. Besides that one point alwaies affronteth the enemy. Not vnlike a</hi> Calthrop, <hi>which howsoeuer you cast it to the ground, hath one point bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring right vp to wound the horses feet: But the square in turning faces to either flanke altereth the forme of the front. In a broad square, the front at the first was longer than the sides, faces being turned to either flanke the sides become longer, than the front; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise in the</hi> Herse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> battaile. <hi>Besides in such turning of faces the square leeseth the advantage of embattatling, the Commanders, that stood in the front, standing now in one of the flanks, and being not able to charge the enemy iointly, (the greatest advantage of that forme) and so the front being without Commanders, is subiect, and in danger of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, where the</hi> Rhombe, <hi>which way soeuer faces turne, hath as many Commanders in the front, as at first. But let vs take the horse square in full strength with all Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in front; whether shall that forme be better, than the</hi> Rhombe? <hi>I dare not affirme it. For where there are two kindes of fight; One with</hi> maine force, <hi>the other with</hi> sleight, <hi>and</hi> Art; <hi>in the first I will preferre the</hi> square, <hi>in the last the</hi> Rhombe. <hi>The</hi> square <hi>for slaughter and violent ouerthrowing, the</hi> Rhombe <hi>for piercing, and artificiall breaking the enemies battaile, which last amongst great Commanders hath alwaies beene accounted the best kinde of</hi> winning. <hi>In the</hi> square <hi>all the Commanders fall iointly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemy, and because they are supposed to be the chiefe of the Army, in all likelyhood they will ouerthrow the formost, and slay many. Yet by reason of the length of their front, they sticke man to man, and can make no farre entrance, and the victorie hangeth doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, till they haue slaine the most of them, that resist, and so make the rest to flie. The</hi> Rhombe <hi>contrary-wise, being narrow, and pointed in the front, first forceth a passage with the point, which maketh way to the rest that follow, and then without great labour piercing further, and further, breaketh the aduerse battaile, &amp; disperseth, and putteth them to flight, and after doth execution at pleasure. Neither can I make a fitter resemblance, then by comparing the 2 figures, one to an</hi> axe, <hi>the other to a</hi> wedge, <hi>both instruments vsed for diuiding solid masses of wood. For the</hi> axe, <hi>albeit sharper, than the</hi> wedge, <hi>yet hauing the edge drawen out in length, can not by any strength be driuen farre into the wood, but by doubling many stroaks, and by much labour commeth at last to diuide it. The</hi> wedge <hi>contrary-wise, though not so sharpe, being once entred, insinuateth it selfe more by litle, and litle with the narrownes of the point, and maintayning the hold it first got, at last forceth it asunder, though it be neuer so tough. So is it in the</hi> square, <hi>and</hi> Rhombe: <hi>whereof the</hi> square <hi>beginneth, and endeth with violence; the other vseth first cunning, and mildenes, as it were, to enter: being once entred renteth a peeces, and disparteth all that standeth in the way. The manner of our times alloweth not of</hi> Rhombes; <hi>Experience of former times highly prized them. I will insist vpon the</hi> Thessalians <hi>alone, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the inventers of the</hi> Rhombe, <hi>&amp; fought alwaies</hi> Rhombe-<hi>wise.</hi> Polybius <hi>had seene their seruice, and beene Generall of the Horse in his owne country, and therefore able to iudge.

they could not be resisted: to fight man to man in single combat, they had neither will, nor courage. <hi>What then should be the reason, they should be so powerfull in troupes?

                           <hi>Now</hi> Aelian <hi>bringeth reasons, why the</hi> wedge <hi>was holden better than the</hi> square. <hi>Let me with leaue adde a word or two why I take it to be better than the</hi> Rhombe. <hi>And first it cannot be denied, that the</hi> wedge <hi>hauing the same manner of disposition that the</hi> Rhombe <hi>hath, that is a front ending in a point, where the</hi> Captaine <hi>standeth; two points of the two flanks, where the</hi> flanke-commander <hi>stands, the</hi> Lieutenant <hi>in the reare, and the best men in the flanks, but it must be as powerfull to open the enemies battaile, as the</hi> Rhombe <hi>is. Then it hath this advantage of the</hi> Rhombe <hi>that it bringeth more hands to fight. For let the</hi> Rhombe <hi>and</hi> wedge <hi>be framed of an equall number, the</hi> wedge <hi>in figure resembling the forepart of the</hi> Rhombe <hi>must haue the horse, that should be ranged in the reare of the</hi> Rhombe, <hi>orderly couched within the</hi> 3 <hi>sides thereof: where by both the number of the horse in the sides is increased, and the bulke of the body betwixt flanke and flanke inlarged. And seing both the</hi> Rhombe <hi>and the</hi> wedge <hi>goe to the charge with the point of their front, the</hi> wedge <hi>both hath the property to pierce, and enter the enemies battaile by art, and sleight, as well as the</hi> Rhombe, <hi>and doth it with more strength, because of the great number of hands in the sides, which all come to fight. Ioyne, that the hinder part of the</hi> Rhombe <hi>serueth onely to auoide surprizes, and worketh nothing in charging. For after the two flanke points are entred, the rest of the</hi> Rhombe <hi>growing narrower, and narrower toward the Reare, falleth further off from the enemy, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent onely to follow the way, that was made to hand by the front, and flanks; without being able to strike a stroke; especially if it preserue the order it ought to keepe: whereas all parts of the</hi> wedge <hi>are effectuall, the</hi> point <hi>to enter, the</hi> sides <hi>euen to the</hi> flanke corners,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7163:70"/>
                           <hi>where the Reare endeth, to dispart and disseuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and finally to disorder the enemy, whereby the victorie ensueth. And if we may rely vpon authority, the authority of</hi> King Philip <hi>will sway much for the</hi> wedge. <hi>For vnlesse he had held it better than the</hi> Rhombe, <hi>hee would not haue chosen, nor accustomed his</hi> Macedonians <hi>to it, nor</hi> Alexander <hi>after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined it, if he had not beene of the same opinion. Neither did the euent deceiue them: for almost in all battaile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted, neither</hi> Rhombe, <hi>nor</hi> wedge <hi>haue found grace in the eyes of the great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls of our daies, nor can we tell what to insist vpon, till experience hath taught, how well these formes will agree with the weapons, and seruice of our moderne warres.</hi>

D.</note> Xenophon <hi>telleth, that</hi> the rest of his iourney was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impediment, till he came not farre from <hi>Dascylium.</hi> There when his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men galloped to a hill to discouer the country, by chance the horsemen of <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus (an other of the King of Persians Lieutenants)</hi> being about the same num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the Graecians were, and sent by <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> vnder the command of <hi>Rathynes,</hi> and <hi>Bancaeus</hi> his bastard brother, galloped vp the same hill, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering one the other no further of, than two parts of a furlong, at the first they stood still; the Graecians ordered Phalange-wise 4 in depth, the Barbarians ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their front 12 in length, the depth many more. Afterward the Barbarians began first to charge. when they came to hands, all the Graecians that ioyned, broke their staues. The Persians hauing <hi>Corneil</hi> darts killed some 12 horsemen, and 2 horses. Herevpon the Graecians fled. But when <hi>Agesilaus</hi> came with the Armie to the reskew, the Barbarians againe forsooke the field. <hi>The</hi> Persians <hi>then vsed a</hi> square <hi>longer in flanke, then front: The</hi> Graecian <hi>a</hi> square <hi>longer in front, theu flanke. But which of the three squares is most to be esteemed</hi> Aelian <hi>sheweth in the words following, saying those squares are best, that</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5 Double the number of the length, to the number of the depth] <hi>What the length, and depth in a battaile are, we haue seene before. Yet to vnderstand</hi> Aelian <hi>the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let vs repeat, that the length of a battaile is the</hi> extension <hi>of the</hi> front; <hi>the depth the</hi> extension <hi>of the</hi> flanke. <hi>To double then the number of the length to the number of the depth, is to place twise so many men in front, as in flanke. As for the purpose,</hi> 6 <hi>in front,</hi> 3 <hi>in flanke; or</hi> 8 <hi>in front,</hi> 4 <hi>in flanke; or</hi> 10 <hi>in front,</hi> 5 <hi>in flanke. And that this was the manner of the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>appeareth by the</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Plutarch. in Lycurgo.</note> Oulamos, <hi>or horse-troupe instituted by</hi> Lycurgus, <hi>which was figured</hi> Tetragonally <hi>with</hi> 4 <hi>equall sides, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in it</hi> 50 <hi>horse. Now that it could not be a square of number, that is, to haue as many horse in flanke, as in front may hereby be shewed, because no square number will make</hi> 50. <hi>The nearest is</hi> 7 <hi>times</hi> 7, <hi>which amounts to</hi> 49. <hi>But proportioning the number of the length double to the number of the depth, that is</hi> 10 <hi>in front, and</hi> 5 <hi>in flanke, euen</hi> 50 <hi>will arise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the horse troope of the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>had the number of the length double to the number of the depth, and made a square in the equality of measure of the sides, not in number, which is the</hi> Tetragonall <hi>figure, whereof</hi> Plutarch <hi>speaketh. And where</hi> Xenophon <hi>(as I haue alledged before) reporteth that the horsemen of</hi> Agesilaus <hi>were but</hi> 4 <hi>in depth, it hindereth not this truth. For, as I noted before, the ordinary aray of the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>foote was</hi> 8 <hi>in depth. Yet did</hi> Pausanias <hi>the Lacedemonian</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:7163:71"/>
                        <hi>King cast his men into a deepe Phalange against</hi> Thrasibulus. <hi>Other examples I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the same place touching the same matter. Besides this appeareth to be but a</hi> tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous <hi>fight either of the parties comming soddainely in the sight of the other, and going presently to charge, before they could haue time to alter the order they then were in. And to say the horse troupe of the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>ought to haue beene but</hi> 4 <hi>in depth, it must thereof necessarily follow that they were</hi> 12 <hi>in length, which yet will come short of</hi> 50: 4 <hi>times</hi> 12 <hi>makes but</hi> 48. <hi>Indeed</hi> 
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Leo cap. 12. 9. 40.</note> Leo <hi>holdeth opinion, that in a horse battaile, the depth ought to be no more than</hi> 4. <hi>I will set downe his words as neare, as conveniently I can english them.</hi> The depth, <hi>saith he,</hi> or thicknes, as it was of ancient time limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is sufficient, if it be of 4 horse in euery troupe; because in horse a greater depth will be idle, and to no purpose. For they cannot, as foote doe with their thicknes, thrust one an other forward from behind; and so the formost, will they, or nill they, are forced to goe against the enemy. And this is done amongst foote. But the horse can not thrust forward those, that are before them, nor the <hi>file-leaders</hi> that stand in front, be seconded in that kinde by the rest, that stand in depth after the fourth man. For if they be <hi>Lancers,</hi> the fift ranke cannot reach with their launces to the front. If Archers, they shall be faine to shoot aloft for feare of hurting their companions before; and so their arrowes serue for no vse, after fight is ioyned. Therefore is the number of 4 sufficient in depth, as I haue said. <hi>This was the opinion of</hi> Leo. <hi>To which I cannot absolutely assent; vnlesse he had giuen</hi> 8 <hi>for the front of his troupe, and so made it of</hi> 4 <hi>equall sides in figure, not in number, as</hi> Aelian <hi>requireth to be done in the best squares. For the reason of launces not reaching to the front in the fift ranke, reacheth not home to the reason of warre.</hi> Aelian <hi>before hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the pikes of the seuenth ranke reach not to the front of the Phalange. Yet no man will thereof inferre, that the Phalange ought to be but</hi> 6 <hi>deepe. Yea but the foote that come after, helpe the formost, seconding them, and thrusting them on with the weight of their bodies, which the horse can not doe. This must be granted to be an advantage, that foote haue aboue horse in depth. Yet are there other reasons also of giuing depth to a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange: In the order whereof two considerations concurre; one of offence, the other of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The reaching of pikes or horsemens staues ouer the front is good for offence, that is to annoy the enemy in the shocke: likewise the thrusting on of those that come behind, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth with the violence to make them giue ground. A reasonable depth is for defence, in as much as it defendeth a</hi> Phalange <hi>against the indeuour of the enemy to breake it a sunder. And as it is a fault to make it too deepe, so is it likewise a fault to make it too shallow. Too much depth narroweth the front, and giueth easie meanes to the enemy to incompasse, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The first at this day, we call a square of men, the other a square of ground. When the number of the sides is equall in length, and depth, it giueth but halfe so much ground in front, as in flanke. Each souldier, if it be a foote battaile, occupying a foote, and a halfe of ground in front, when he goeth to charge, where in flanke he must haue</hi> 3 <hi>foote. And in a horse troupe</hi> 3 <hi>foote in front, and double, or (as some say) treble as much in flanke. And so are the sides vnequall. The euen length of flanke and front giueth a like ground to both, and maketh the sides of the figure equall, but the number of the front double to the number of the flanke, whether it be in horse or foote. In foote, because the souldiers in Ranke haue but halfe so much distance, as they haue in file; In ranke a foote and a halfe, in file three foote. In horse, because the length of the horse is much more, than his breadth, and that length is fully stretched out in flanke, the bredth onely in front.</hi>

               <p>They that fashion <hi>Horse</hi> into <hi>Rhombes,</hi> so fashion them, that some <hi>Rhombes file,</hi> and <hi>ranke;</hi> some neither <hi>file,</hi> nor <hi>ranke;</hi> othersome <hi>file,</hi> but <hi>ranke</hi> not; other <hi>ranke,</hi> but <hi>file</hi> not: euery particular whereof standeth thus.</p>

The <hi>Leader</hi> of the <hi>Troope</hi> standing in the middest, and 5 other being laid to him back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly on either side; so that this <hi>Ranke</hi> conteineth two sides of the <hi>Rhombe.</hi> Then the <hi>reare-Commander</hi> is placed directly behind the <hi>Leader,</hi> and to him are other ioyned forwardly on either side, and the number of euery following ranke after the first, is to be two lesse than the former, and therefore 4 must be added on either side to the <hi>reare-Commander,</hi> and the number of the second ranke be 9. This ranke maketh two sides <hi>Parallel</hi> to the two former sides of the <hi>Rhombe.</hi> The third must be 7, and so forward to one.

                     <item>1 The heads of the horses reach to the heades of his shoulders] Aelian <hi>saith, that in a</hi> Rhombe <hi>the</hi> Captaine <hi>standeth first, and the heads of the next horse reach to his horse shoulders. This rule, if it be taken generally, and meant of all</hi> Rhombes, <hi>will deceiue vs; if for two kinde of</hi> Rhombs <hi>alone, there is nothing more true. The</hi> Rhombe <hi>neither filing, nor ranking; and the</hi> Rhombe <hi>filing, not ranking, haue the followers horses heads advanced to the shoulders of them, that stand before. But the</hi> Rhombe <hi>filing and ranking, and the other ranking not filing, come wholy behind the horse of the</hi> Captaine, <hi>as the figure shewes, and will appeare in the verball description of the</hi> Rhombe.</item>
                     <item>2 A Rhombe both to file and ranke] <hi>To make a</hi> Rhombe <hi>both file and ranke, choice must first be had of an vneuen number for the ranke the middest of the Troupe, where the manner is to begin the</hi> Rhombe; <hi>which number must neither be too great, least the Troupe grow also too great, nor too litle, lest there be in it no strength.</hi> Aelian <hi>giues a</hi> 11, 13, <hi>or</hi> 15 <hi>for that ranke, and willeth vs to begin the frame by placing first the middle ranke, to which the other rankes are to be ioyned on both sides, the middle men</hi>

                        <hi>against the middle man of the first ranke in a right line of file, and the rest in like sort; euery Ranke still decreasing</hi> 2 <hi>men, till at last in the front, and reare-angle you come to one. The figure of this kinde of</hi> Rhombe <hi>I haue placed in the praecedent Chapter; wherein the middle ranke is of</hi> 11, <hi>and the whole troupe of</hi> 61, <hi>and the horse heads of those that follow reach not to the former horses shoulders.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3 The halfe Rhombe is called a wedge] <hi>I haue spoken of</hi> wedges <hi>before, but nothing of the framing of them.</hi> Aelian <hi>here sheweth how they are framed, when he saith, that the forme of them appeareth in the</hi> Rhombe, <hi>and that the halfe</hi> Rhombe <hi>is a</hi> wedge. <hi>For as in a</hi> Rhombe <hi>filing, and ranking, you begin with placing the middle ranke first, and so proceed adding on both sides ranke to ranke, till you come to one man in the front: So must you proceede in a</hi> wedge, <hi>sauing that to the first, and greatest ranke you ioyne the rest onely on the one side, abating still in euery ranke</hi> 2 <hi>men, till you come to the point of the front, where the Captaine standeth alone. And this was the ordinarie horse troupe amongst the Macedonians, and is described in the next Chapter.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4 That the horsemen neither file nor ranke] <hi>The second kinde of</hi> Rhombe <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified here by</hi> Aelian <hi>is directly opposite to the first. The first both filed, and ranked, this neither fileth, nor ranketh; and is that kinde, which I noted in the last Chapter, to haue more curiositie, than vse. For the rest, what is more easie to frame, than they? In which either files, or rankes are laid together; or files alone, or ranks alone. And out of that ioyning both in the inward parts of the</hi> Rhombe, <hi>and the outward (that is the flanks) arise, and are without difficulty figured. In this you must first begin with the outsides, and make two front lines, or sides of the</hi> Rhombe; <hi>and after adde as many to the Reare. And then when the</hi> 4 <hi>sides are framed, and haue their place, patch vp by peece-meale the rest of the body within. Wherein if there be not very large distances left betwixt horse, and horse, especially euery one being laid head to shoulder to an other, it is not possible to convey so many horses within the foure sides, as will make vp the full</hi> Rhombe. <hi>And yet make it vp as you will, the trouble is more, than in the rest of the</hi> Rhombes. <hi>And for the vse, I see not how it can be greater, than in the rest, whatsoeuer is alledged for turnings, and other motions. And the more I thinke vpon it, the more I am induced to thinke, that it was the invention of some Tacticke master (of whom were great plenty amongst the</hi> Graecians) <hi>who seeing that some</hi> Rhombes <hi>filed, aud ranked not; other ranked, but filed not; other both ranked, and filed, and that the two first were opposite the one against the other, would needs bring in a fourth, neither filing, nor ranking, to make an opposition likewise against the third. But because this kinde also is specified by</hi> Aelian, <hi>let vs see how it is to be framed.</hi> Aelian <hi>for examples sake would haue the Troope to consist of</hi> 36 <hi>horse. To put these</hi> 36 <hi>horse in a forme, that shall neither file nor ranke, we are thus to worke. First, we must begin with the two front sides of the</hi> Rhombe, <hi>and make them of</hi> 11 <hi>horse, placing them thus: The Leader and Captaine in the point; next him backwardly on each side a horseman, his horse head reaching to the shoulders of the Captaines horse; then on the outward side of each of these a Horseman, and their horses heads must likewise reach to the shoulders of the next horses before. So must you goe on, till you haue in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bestowed</hi> 2 <hi>a peece more on each side, still opening the two sides of the</hi> Rhombe <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally. Thus done you haue two sides of the</hi> Rhombe <hi>which will be in this forme.</hi> 
                        <figure/>
                        <hi>Then are we to fashion the two Reare sides of the</hi> Rhombe <hi>of</hi> 9 <hi>horse, placing them after this manner: The Lieutenant in the Reare angle, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite to, &amp; yet looking toward the Captaine; on either side of him forward toward the front</hi> 2 <hi>Horsemen, their horses shoulders lying euen with the head of the Lieutenants horse. And after them the other</hi> 6; 3 <hi>on one side, and</hi> 3 <hi>on the other in the same proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And so haue we the other two sides of the</hi> Rhombe <hi>in this forme.</hi>

There remaine</hi> 16, <hi>which are thus to be ordered: Within the</hi> Rhombe <hi>we must at reasonable distance place a horseman behind the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in aright line, and in the manner as before lay</hi> 3 <hi>to him on each side. The number will amount to</hi> 7, <hi>and this is the figure</hi> 
                        <figure/>
                        <hi>Then another horseman is to be set at the same distance directly before the Lieutenant, and on ech side of him two other toward the front, which will be</hi> 5 <hi>in all, and in this forme</hi>
                        <figure/>
                        <hi>And these</hi> 12 <hi>horse ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will fashion out a lesser</hi> Rhombe, <hi>comprehended within the sides of the first. So are</hi> 32 <hi>horse disposed of. The</hi> 4 <hi>that are left are thus to be ordered. In a right line againe after the Captaine, and at the former distance is another horsema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be set: Then</hi> 2, <hi>one of the one side, &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of th' other side of him, their horses heads reaching to his horses shoulders thus</hi>

                        <hi>And this is the true description of the Troope neither filing, nor ranking. I haue beene the longer in describing it, because the figure grauen is not fully to my minde, no horse head reaching to the shoulders of the horse, that standeth before him.</hi>

Take what number of horse you please, and make a file; then lay to the distances betwixt horse, and horse of that file on each flanke two other files, each file conteyning one lesse in number, than the first. And the heads of the files are to be laid right against the space which is betwixt the Captaine, and his follower, and the rest of the horses against the other spaces successiuely. In all the paires of files, that follow, and are laid to the flanks, you must still diminish a horse a peece, till you come to the points, which haue but one either of them. And of this abatement of one in euery file, both front, and reare, and flankes grow into points, and make a Rhombe: As of the euen number in euery file, a square battaile would arise. See the figure. This was the forme the</hi> Thessalians <hi>fought in, as appeareth by</hi>

This beginneth at the flanke points, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to the front and reare. First therefore a ranke is to be laid of what number you list.</hi> Aelian <hi>would haue it of an vneuen number; but it will fall out as well in an euen number, as the figure sheweth. To the distances of this ranke you must lay</hi> 2 <hi>ranks more, one on either side, whose number must be one lesse a peece, than the former ranke. Thus continue laying ranks still toward the front, and reare, and in euery paire of ranks diminish one a peece, till you come to the points, either of which haue but one, namely the Captaine, &amp; the Lieutenant, and the</hi> Rhombe <hi>will ranke, and not file.</hi>

And there is a distance to be left in front betwixt euery troupe, to giue liberty to <hi>wheele</hi> and <hi>double-wheele.</hi> So that one furlong will conteine 800 horse; and 10 furlongs 8000; 4 furlongs 3200: And eleuen thousand, and two hundred Horse will fill the space of 14 furlongs in length. <hi>The words seeme at first somewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, being well weighed they will be cleare enough.</hi> Polybius <hi>saith, that these</hi> 800 <hi>horse were ordered</hi> 8 <hi>in depth, and that they tooke vp a furlong of ground in length. There must be therefore of them a hundred files. For a hundred files of</hi> 8 <hi>horse a peece, will arise to</hi> 800 <hi>horse.

And the <hi>Perimeter</hi> alone of the outward foure sides conteineth 11600 feete. And because 6 feete make a fathome, and a 100 fathoms make a furlong, and 7 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and a halfe, make a mile, the whole <hi>Perimeter</hi> of 11600 feete will come to two mile, and a halfe, and neare a 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part. In this distance therefore according to the closest order, or shutting, the thirty thousand horse are conteined. But if they stand not so close, you must alter your account according to the thinnesse, and out of the greatnesse of place coniecture of the multitude of the people. <hi>So</hi> Leo. <hi>Which place albeit it seeme to require a large interpretation, because many things worth the noting offer themselues in it; yet for this time I will onely insist vpon that, which I first propounded, that is the distance of three foote betwixt horse, and horse, when they goe to charge (for that is the meaning of</hi> Leo, <hi>when he speaketh of the closest order) which distance is expresly here set downe. And the matter will yet seeme more cleare, if we adde the words of</hi> Leo <hi>in the</hi> Paragraph <hi>next, but one, to this, which are these:</hi> The oldest Tacticks in ordering of foote Battailes giue euery man at the first distance foure Cubits; when the battaile is closed two Cubits; when serred and shut one Cubit. Out of which proportion a <hi>Scout</hi> may exactly discouer by the quantitie of the place the number, not onely of horse, but of foote also. <hi>These oldest Tacticks that</hi> Leo <hi>mentioneth agree with</hi> Aelian, <hi>as wee haue seene. But where the foote haue three distances, the horse are to haue but two. The open order of six foote they ought to haue, and likewise that of three foote; nearerer they cannot come together, because of the bredth of their horse, and because they are to haue roome sufficient for the weilding of their weapons.</hi>

                  <p>AElian <hi>in the Chapters precedent, hath numbred vp all kindes of forces, as well foote, as Horse, and Chariots, and Elephants, that in ancient time were accounted necessarie for warre. And hath giuen them their armor, and furniture, and distinguished them into militarie bodies, and imbattailed them, and taught the distances, that they ought to hold in fight. It followeth now that he speake of motions military; which are the life of an armie, and onely giue meanes of victorie; and without which all preparation of forces is vaine, and auaileth nothing in the field, nor to the end, for which they were leuied. This Chapter then conteineth the names of those motions; the following Chapters the particular explication of them. To which we will note, what we finde in ancient writers. For the signification of the words, I referre them to the seuerall Chapters, where they are expounded.</hi>

In</hi> open Order <hi>they chose to countermarch; In</hi> close Order, <hi>hauing place, to wheele their battaile about, and so turne the face of it against the enemy. If they could doe neither of these, they came to the last remedy, which was</hi> turning of faces <hi>of euery particular man in the battaile.</hi>

                     <item>1 Clisis, or turning of faces] <hi>This motion is of lesse paines then any other, but of no lesse importance, or necessitie. In the rest the</hi> Phalange <hi>changeth the place, or the forme: In this it holdeth both, and yet is ready for any attempt of the enemy. Onely euery Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in particular turneth his countenance to the right or left hand, as he is commanded. To turne his face to the Pike is to turne to the right hand, because that hand bore the pike, to turne to the Target is to turne to the left hand; because the</hi> Macedonians <hi>caried their targets on their left shoulder. For the vse of this turning of Faces,</hi> Aelian <hi>saith,</hi> It hath place when the enemie sheweth himselfe in flanke</item>
                     <item>2 To incompasse, our wings] Clisis <hi>is no more, then bearing faces to the right, or left hand, that is to our wings. When then we finde our enemies, to incompasse our right wing, wee turne our faces, and weapons that way to receiue him: to the left, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to charge vs on that side. If on both sides, then turne wee the faces of our</hi> Phalange <hi>halfe to the right, halfe to the left hand; which is the</hi> Antistomus Phalange <hi>whereof</hi> Aelian <hi>speaketh hereafter. Briefely, there is almost none of the marching</hi> Phalanges <hi>which are afterward discribed, but it hath neede of this motion. Besides if vpon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the</hi> Phalange <hi>be to moue from any of the flanks, you are only to command Turning of faces to that flanke, and then to lead on. I will giue an example, or two.</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Polyen. lib. 4. in Alexand. § 17.</note> Alexander at Arbela hauing imbattailed his armie to fight with <hi>Darius,</hi> had intelligence, that <hi>Darius</hi> had strowed the ground betwixt the two armies with Calthropes. He <hi>commanded therefore the right wing, which himselfe led, to</hi> turne faces to the right hand, and follow him, to the end to go round about, and auoide the places, that were sowed with Calthropes. <hi>Darius</hi> marching against him to the left hand, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned his troupes of horse, and <hi>Alexander</hi> taking the aduantage, and giuing in quickly betwixt the spaces, put <hi>Darius</hi> to flight. <hi>If</hi> Alexander <hi>had marched on with the right front, he had fallen vpon the Calthropes. To auoide them, be vsed the benefit of this motion, and</hi> turning faces <hi>to the right hand he led on, vntill hee had passed the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and then turning againe to the first posture, went to charge, and defeated the enemie. An other example is in</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Polyb lib. 11. 634.</note> Polybius, <hi>who describing the battaile</hi> betwixt Machanidas the Lacedemonian Tyrant, and Philopoemen the Achaean Generall, telleth, that Machanidas hauing in the left wing put the <hi>Achaean</hi> mercenaries to flight, followed hard the chase. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> as long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as there was hope, indeuoured by all meanes to stay his men: when he saw them vtterly defeated, hee hasted to the

right wing, and perceiuing the enemie busie in chase, and the place voide, where the fight had beene, commanding the first <hi>Merarchies</hi> to turne their faces to the right hand, hee led them on with high speede, not yet breaking the order of their imbattailing. And quickly seazing vpon the forsaken ground, hee both cut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that gaue chase, and home, and withall got the aduantage of the vpper ground against the left wing of the armed. Whereby hee obteined the victory. <hi>If</hi> Philopoemen <hi>had in this action vsed wheeling of his battaile, which onely was the other motion, which would haue serued his turne, besides the troublesomenesse of the winding about, he should haue beene forced to haue vsed two wheelings, and so failed of the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </item>
                     <item>3 Two turnings of the Souldiers face] Clisis, <hi>or turning faces to the right, or left hand, consisteth of one turning and moueth no further, then the side. If the motion be to the reare, it hath two turnings, and is called</hi> Metabole, <hi>which is defined to bee a</hi> changing of euery mans face in particular from the front to the reare, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise. <hi>And as wheeling of the whole body carieth about the fronts of the battaile to the reare; So doth</hi> Metabole <hi>turne the face of euery particular Souldier, and maketh him looke from the front to the reare. The word properly signifieth a change, which happeneth herein, when the souldiers are changed from the front to the reare, or contrariwise. The vse of</hi> Metabole <hi>is principally to resist the enemy that giues on vpon the reare.</hi>

                        <hi>So the armie of</hi> Cyrus <hi>the elder retiring from</hi> the walles of Babylon, often turned about their faces to the left hand, and waited their enemie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were reported to be on foote, and ready to come and charge them. <hi>And if the enemy assault both the front, and reare, it hath beene the manner to continue halfe the souldiers in each file with their faces to the front, and command the other halfe to turne their faces to the reare against the enemie behind. And this forme is called</hi> Phalanx Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistomos <hi>discribed by</hi> Aelian <hi>cap.</hi> 38. <hi>And sometimes it is vsed to speed our march, and preuent the enemie, as was said before of</hi> Clisis. <note n="c" place="margin">Xenoph.

                        <p>4 There are two kinde of Metaboles] <hi>Before were rehearsed two kinde of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of faces about, one to the</hi> pike, <hi>the other to the</hi> target, <hi>here is added two more, one from the enemy and the other against the enemie; which are all one indeed, and differ onely in name. What the true meaning of these turnings should be, I am in doubt,</hi> Aelian <hi>expounding them one way,</hi> Suidas <hi>an other.</hi> Aelian <hi>esteemes them by the right, and left hand,</hi> Suidas, <hi>albeit he haue that signification also, esteemeth them by the front and reare. Therefore</hi> Suidas <hi>defines the turning from the enemie to bee</hi> a turning about, toward the reare: <hi>that against the enemie,</hi> a turning about toward the front. Aelian <hi>would haue the first to</hi> containe two turnings toward the right hand, <hi>the second</hi> two turnings toward the left. <hi>I for my part assent rather to</hi> Aelian. <hi>For touching the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of</hi> Suidas, <hi>I cannot yet vnderstand, why turning toward the reare should be a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the enemie; Or toward</hi> the front <hi>a turning to the enemie: Considering that</hi>

                           <hi>whether soeuer you turne</hi> faces, <hi>the enemie is imagined to be there; faces and weapons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bee opposed alwaies against the enemie, which is the onely end of turning.</hi> Aelians <hi>opinion seemeth to haue more probability in it, at least if I conceiue the right reason. For I take it thus: That seeing the</hi> Graecians (<hi>as the</hi> Romans <hi>likewise) were Targetieres, and caried their targets on their left side, and in fight aduanced that side alwaies neerest the enemie, which they sought to couer with their targets, that therefore the turning about to the enemy, was called</hi> turning to the Target; <hi>as contrarily turning to the right side, on which side the Pike was caried, and which being naked of such defensiue armes was called</hi>

                  <hi>EPistrophe</hi> (or wheeling) is when the battaile being so closed, that no man can turne, or twice turne his face by reason of the neerenesse of man to man, it wholy, and iointly wheeleth (as a ship, or some other body caried about) the order thereof remaining vndissolued. When the wheeling is to the Pike, we warne the right-corner-file-leader to stand still (as it were the hooke of a doore hinge) and the rest of the battaile proceeding forward to turne about the same file-Leader like the doore. In the same manner is wheeling to the Target; It may be thus defined: <hi>Epistrophe</hi> is, when shutting the battaile by gathering close the Followers, and Side-men, we turne it wholy (as the body of a man) toward the Pike, or Target, it being caried about the corner-file-leader, as about a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and, changing the place of the front, transferre the countenance of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to the right, or left hand; the followers and sidemen euery one remayning in file and ranke as before.

                  <hi>Anastrophe,</hi> or returning to the first posture, is the restoring of the wheeling to the place, where the battaile first stood close, before it beganne to wheele. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rispasmos,</hi> or wheeling about, is the motion of the battaile in two wheelings, so that thereby the front commeth to the place of the reare. <hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                        <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Epistrophe (or wheeling) is, when the Battaile] Shortly Epistrophe <hi>is no more, then the first turning of the battaile to the right or left hand. In doing whereof first the files must be closed to the hand, you meane to wheele, then the rankes. Then the corner file-Leader on the same hand is to stand still, then all the rest keeping their files, and rankes closed, to turne to the same hand iointly about the Corner-file-leader circle-wise, who is to moue by little, and little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till he haue turned his face to that side, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And when the first ranke is euen with him, and the rest wheeled enough to the same hand, they are to stand still: The words of the definition of</hi> Epistrophe (<hi>or wheeling) are plaine enough in</hi> Aelian; <hi>I neede vse no exposition. Now because in exercise we relie not vpon one forme of motion alone, but acquaint our souldiers with all the kindes; It is necessarie to bring the body againe to the first place, to the end we may proceede in the rest. This reducing to the first Posture is called</hi> Anastrophe, <hi>by which the battaile retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but by a contrary hand, to that, to which the</hi> Epistrophe <hi>was made. And but for changing the hand the wheeling backe againe is all one with the wheeling forward. Wee shall see hereafter how it is done. To bring the battaile to haue the front, where the reare was, you must vse a double wheeling. And that is called</hi> Perispasmos. <hi>Which commeth of two</hi> Epistrophes, <hi>and is made either to the right, or left hand. Onely it must bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, that if the</hi> Perispasmos <hi>(or wheeling about) be to the right hand, the</hi> Anastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe <hi>(or reducing to the first posture) must be to the left.

Otherwise seeing that one wheeling is sooner made, then two, and therefore sooner then three, I see no neede of three wheelings, especially seeing we may doe that, wee desire with one. For example, let vs wheele our battaile thrice to the right hand, the front will come to be in the place of the left flanke. The same will be performed as well with one wheeling to the left hand.</hi> Et frustra fit per plura, quod potest fieri per pauciora, <hi>especially in matter of warre, where the least moment of time often carieth the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse.

                     <hi>The vse of the motions of wheeling, and double wheeling, is, when the battaile being closed, and the enemy comming to assault you in any other one place, then the front, you seeke to bring the best men to fight. For if you be to be charged in two places at once, or more, wheeling helpes little; except it be to turne the front to one enemy, and in that case your onely shift is, to turne faces against them, that come to charge, on what side soeuer they come. Examples of these two motions, I meane</hi> Epistrophe, <hi>and</hi> Perispasmos <hi>meete vs almost in euery Greeke Historie. Of which I will represent one, or two, especially of the</hi>

                     <note n="a" place="margin">Plut. in Pyrrh.</note> Plutarch <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth,</hi> that after King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> had in vaine assaulted <hi>Sparta,</hi> he was invited by an <hi>Argiuan</hi> named <hi>Aristaeus</hi> to receiue <hi>Argos</hi> into his protection, and that hee marched thitherward with his armie. <hi>Arieus</hi> the king of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> laying am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes for him, and taking the principall streights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which he was to passe, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his reare, wherein the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Molossians</hi> were. When <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> heard the bruite and noise, he sent his sonne <hi>Ptolomy</hi> with the band of Companions to aide, himselfe with all speede marching out of the streights, led on his armie. The medly being sharpe about <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and the chosen <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> commanded by <hi>Eualcus</hi> standing close to their busines, <hi>Oroesus</hi> a <hi>Candiot</hi> of <hi>Aptera,</hi> valiant of his hands, and swift of foote, running crosse against the young Prince gaue him a deadly stroke and ouerthrew him. His fall made the rest to flie. And the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> hauing the victorie, and following the chase came into the Champian ground still killing but not remembring they were not followed with armed foot. Vpon whom <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> hauing euen then heard of, and being much mooued with the death of his sonne, wheeled about the Molossian horsemen. And himselfe first aduancing vpon the spurre imbrued himselfe with the slaughter of <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians.</hi> He alwaies seemed mighty, and terrible in armes; but then he exceeded himselfe in daring and valor. For turning his Horse vpon <hi>Eualcus</hi> who shunning him, shifted a side, and with all strooke at his bridle hand as he passed by, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but little of cutting it off. But missing the hand, he light vpon the raines, and carued them quite a sunder. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> with all strooke him thorough the body with his Launce. Then leaping from his horse, and fighting a foote, hee cut in pieces the chosen <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that fought to recouer the body of <hi>Eualcus.</hi> This was the fight that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> made by wheeling about his Horsemen against the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that followed vpon his Reare. Another example of <hi>Wheeling</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout is reported by <hi>Polybius,</hi> and it is of <hi>Amilcar Annibals</hi> father, <hi>this is the history.</hi> The mercenary souldiers of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> reuolted from them, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw some of their Generalls, and shut them vp within the Citie of <hi>Carthage,</hi> possessing both other streights, that led into the Countrey, and also a bridge laide ouer a riuer called <hi>Macar,</hi> which riuer was not passable, but by that Bridge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they built a City for defence of that Bridge. <hi>Amilcar</hi> seeking to dislodge the enemie from that Bridge, and hauing no way to come at them conueniently; obserued, that when certaine windes blew, the mouth of the riuer toward the sea was commonly filled vp with sand, and would giue passage sufficient for his armie. Finding then a fit time, hee put ouer his army in the night, and before day, or ere any man knew of it, made himselfe Master of the passage; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently led against them, that held the bridge. <hi>Spendius</hi> (hee was one of the chiefe Rebells) hearing thereof, aduanced to meete <hi>Amilcar</hi> in the plaine, and both ten thousand from the City at the bridge foote, and fifteen thousand more from <hi>Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> came out one to aide another, thinking to wrappe in the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them; who were not aboue ten thousand Souldiers of all sorts, and 70 Elephants. <hi>Amilcar</hi> led on his armie. Before were the Elephants, the horse, and light armed followed next, the armed foote came last. And perceiuing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that followed his Reare, pressed hard vpon him, he commanded his whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to turne about. Those that were in the Vangard of the march hee willed to returne to him with speede; <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>the other, that at first had the reare, hee wheeled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and straight opposed against the enemy. The <hi>Lybians</hi> and mercenaries ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> fled for feare, fell vpon them disorderly, and boldly came

to hands. But when they saw the Horsemen, being now turned about, and come vp neere to the foote, and already put in order, make a stand, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, by reason they looked for nothing lesse, fell into a feare, turning their backes fled presently, as before they gaue on vnaduisedly, and straglingly. And some of them falling vpon their owne people, that were comming on, wrought both theirs, and their owne destructions: othersome were trampled vpon, and trode to death, by the horse, and Elephants, that followed the chase. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Polybius. <hi>And thus farre of Wheelings.

                     <hi>OF filing, and ranking enough is spoken before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 To restore to the first posture] <hi>This motion differeth from</hi> Anastrophe <hi>before specified. For</hi> Anastrophe <hi>bringeth backe againe the whole body to the first place after a Wheeling: This the Souldiers faces particularly to the first aspect. So that this is vsed after the making of an</hi> Anastrophe. <hi>For alwaies in motions it is requisite, that the Souldiers faces moue</hi> forward. <hi>To moue</hi> backeward <hi>hath many inconueniences, of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings vpon vneuen ground, or stones, or pittes, or stubbes, or such like. Which is the cause that in</hi> Anastrophe <hi>after a Wheeling,</hi> Aelian <hi>willeth, that the Souldiers</hi> turne their faces the contrarie way first, then moue on, <hi>till they haue recouered their first ground, then open rankes, and files, and lastly to restore to the first aspect. And as it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from</hi> Anastrophe <hi>so differeth it likewise from</hi> Metabole. Metabole <hi>only turned faces about, this setteth the Souldier in his former posture, not onely for his face, but for his armes, also, which, are ordered as at first. The wordes wherein this motion is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by</hi> Aelian <hi>are</hi> Ep orthon apodounai, <hi>and</hi> Eis orthon apoca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>be vpright, or right, more in that, then in any other posture. For the Souldier not onely in front, but in flanke, and in the reare carrieth himselfe vpright, or right. I doubt not, but that it may be applied to the vpright standing of men, as appeareth by sundry places of</hi> Pausanias: <hi>Who reherseth, that</hi> Mineruas <hi>Image set</hi>

Because in euery motion, not onely in this, the men stand</hi> vpright. <hi>How then can they be restored to their standing vpright, when they doe it already. I take the</hi> originall of the appellation <hi>to come from another cause, and that is from</hi> the ordering of the Pike. <hi>For when the battaile is first set in the field, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Souldier standes with his Pike</hi> ordered, <hi>that is</hi> vpright. <hi>For</hi> to order a pike <hi>is to set the butt end on the ground before the Souldier somewhat wide of his right foote, and to hold it vpright with the right hand borne euen with the shoulder. But when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, or continue any motion, the manner is to</hi> aduance, <hi>or</hi> to shoulder the Pike, <hi>and so to proceede. But being commanded</hi> to returne to the first posture, <hi>it must bee</hi> ordered <hi>againe. So that the first posture of an armed man is to stand</hi> with his pike vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. <hi>And after many motions and windings, he at last returneth to</hi> the same posture, <hi>which I take the command of</hi> Ep'orthon apodounai <hi>to signifie. Now that I may not seeme to relie vpon a probable coniecture alone, I will bring witnesse for the confirmation of my opinion. It is reported by</hi>

               <head>Of Countermarches, and the diuers kindes thereof, with the manner how they are to be made. <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are two sorts of <hi>Countermarches,</hi> one by file, the other by ranke; each of these againe is diuided into three kindes. The first called the <hi>Macedonian:</hi> The second the <hi>Lacedemonian:</hi> The third the <hi>Choraean,</hi> which is also the <hi>Persian,</hi> and the <hi>Cretan.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi> The <hi>Macedonian</hi> is that, which leauing the ground, it first had, taketh in liew thereof the ground, which was before the front of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange,</hi> and turneth the aspect of the Souldier backeward [where before it was forward.]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:7163:94"/>2 The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> is that, which leauing likewise the ground it first had, taketh in steed thereof, the ground which was behinde the Reare of the <hi>Phalange,</hi> and turneth also the face of the Souldier the contrary way.</p>
               <p>3 The <hi>Persian</hi> is the <hi>Cretan,</hi> and <hi>Choraean:</hi> This keepeth the same ground of the <hi>Phalange,</hi> euery souldier taking another place for that, he had, the file-Leader the place of Bringer-vp, and so the rest in order; and turneth also the face of the Souldier the contrary way.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>Countermarches</hi> by ranke are made, when a man would transferre the winges into the place of the Sections; and the Sections into the place of the wings, to the end to strengthen the middest of the battaile. Likewise the right hand parts into the left hand parts, and the left hand parts into the right hand parts. They that feare to countermarch the <hi>Phalange</hi> in grosse the enemy being at hand, doe it by <hi>Syntagmaes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will now set downe, in what manner countermarches ought to be made.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Macedonian countermarch</hi> by file is said to be, when the file-leader turneth about his face, and all the rest with the Bringer-vp go against him on the right, or left hand, and passing on to the ground before the front of the <hi>Phalange</hi> place themselues in order one after an other, according as the file-Leader himselfe hath turned his face. Therefore it maketh shew to the enemy appearing in the Reare, of running away: Or it is when the file-Leader turneth about his face, and the rest passing by him on the right or left hand place themselues orderly one behinde another.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> is, when the Bringer-vp turneth his face about, and all the rest turning also their faces, and proceeding forward together with their file-Leader order themselues proportionably in the ground, which was behinde the Reare of the <hi>Phalange.</hi> Wherefore to the enemy appearing behinde, it makes a semblance of falling on. Againe the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> is, when the file-Leader tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his face about to the Pike, or Target transferreth the whole file to another place equall to the first; and the rest following stand, as before, behinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>him. Or else, when the Bringer-vp turneth his face about, and hee, that stood next before him, passing by on the right or left hand, is placed againe next before him, and the rest following are placed one before another in their former order till the file-Leader be the first.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Choraean</hi> is, when the file-Leader turning about toward the Pike, or Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, precedeth the file, and the rest follow, till the file-Leader haue the place of the Bringer-vp, and the Bringer-vp the place of the file-Leader. And these are the Countermarches by file.</p>
               <p>In the same manner are <hi>Countermarches</hi> made by ranke in case a man would countermarch by ranke. For euery ranke Countermarching either keepeth the same ground, or changeth the right hand place, or else the left hand place, of the battaile, one of which must needes fall out, and neuer faileth.</p>

And each of these is againe diuided into three; the first called the</hi> Macedonian; <hi>the second, the</hi> Lacedemonian; <hi>the third the</hi> Choraean, <hi>or</hi> Cretan. <hi>A</hi> Countermarch by file <hi>is, when euery souldier followeth his Leader of the same file;</hi> By ranke, <hi>when euery souldier followeth his sideman of the same ranke in the</hi> Countermarch.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 The Macedonian Countermarch] <hi>In this</hi> Countermarch, <hi>the purpose of the Commander is to turne the front of his battaile against the enemy that sheweth himselfe in the Reare; and withall to take the ground that lyeth before the front of the</hi> Phalange. <hi>It is called the</hi> Macedonian Countermarch (<hi>saith</hi> Aelian) <hi>because the</hi> Macedonians <hi>were the inventers of it. Which of the</hi> Macedonians <hi>he telleth not, but excludeth</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, <hi>and</hi> Alexander, <hi>who both vsed the</hi> Lacedemonian Countermarch. <hi>And before their times I haue not read of any warlike Kings of</hi> Macedonia <hi>The manner of it is this; First all the File-leaders turne their faces about either to the right or left hand; then the next ranke passeth thorough by them on the same hand; and being come to their distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, place themselues directly behind their File-leaders, and then turne about their faces the same way. And so the third ranke after them, and the fourth, and all the rest, till the Bringers-vp be last, and haue taken the reare of the battaile againe, and turned about their faces. The figure expresseth not well the action. For in it the Bringers-vp begin first to</hi> countermarch, <hi>which according to</hi> Aelian <hi>should moue last. Yet may this</hi> Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march <hi>be done, as the figure is. But I take</hi> Aelians <hi>way to be easier, and readier. And it may be also, that the</hi> Countermarch <hi>expressed in the figure is lost in the text. For one of the</hi> Lacedemonian Countermarches, <hi>which proceedeth the contrary way, beginneth the motion with the File-leaders, as this doth with the Bringers-vp, as wee shall straight see.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 The Lacedemonian countermarch] <hi>In this Countermarch the proceeding is contrary to that of the former; that tooke the ground before the</hi> Phalange, <hi>this takes the ground after. In that the mouing was from the Reare to the front, in this from the front to the reare. This is the invention of the Lacedemonians.</hi> Aelian <hi>describeth it to be done in two manners: One, when the Bringers-vp first turne about their faces, and the next</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Leo cap. 12. §<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 95.</note> 
                        <hi>ranke likewise turning faces beginneth the Countermarch, and euery man thereof placeth himselfe directly before his Bringer-vp, and the third doe the like; and so the rest, till the ranke of the File-leaders come to be first: The other, when the File-leaders begin the Countermarch, and euery one in their files follow them orderly. The figure expresseth this last.</hi> Aelian <hi>preferreth the Lacedemonian Countermarch before the Macedonian: because in it the souldiers seeme to fall on, and goe to the charge; where in the Macedonian they seeme to flie. There are notwithstanding times, when it is better to vse the Macedonian. As in case you meane to march on, and not to fight with the enemy, except you be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Or else you seeke to gaine some ground of aduantage. For the</hi> Macedonian <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth still the march, and stayeth not; the</hi> Lacedemonian <hi>returneth vpon the enemy, and so looseth ground in marching.</hi> Agesilaus <hi>after victorie gotten against the</hi> Argives, <hi>against whom he stood in the right winge, hearing that the</hi> Thebans <hi>had beaten the</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomenians <hi>in the left winge, vsed the</hi> Lacedemonian <hi>Countermarch against them.

Then <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> countermarching his <hi>Phalange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> led against them.

The <hi>Thebans</hi> perceiuing their Confederates were fied vp to the mount <hi>Helicon,</hi> clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their troupes together, as neare as they could, seeking to open a way by force, and to get vp vnto them. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> albeit he might by giuing way to the formost haue followed them at heeles, and charged the reare, yet did he it not, but met the <hi>Thebans</hi> front to front. Thus encountring, and clashing their Targets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they fought, thrust on, killed, and were killed. In fine some of the <hi>Thebans</hi> broke thorough to <hi>Helicon;</hi> other some, as they sought to escape, were left dead on the place. <hi>Agesilaus here followed the chase vpon the</hi> Argives <hi>toward the mount</hi> Helicon: <hi>The</hi> Thebans <hi>vpon the</hi> Orchomenians <hi>the contrary way towards the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Campe.

                        <hi>about with mountaines,</hi> perceiuing the next morning, that the <hi>Mantinaeans</hi> gathered together vpon the toppes, that lay right ouer the head of his Reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, determined to lead his Armie out of the place with all speed. Now if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe should lead, he feared the enemy would giue vpon his Reare. Therefore standing still, and turning his armes against the enemy, he commanded the last of the <hi>Phalange</hi> to march backe againe from the Reare, and come vp to him; and so at once he brought his Armie out of the streights, and made it by little, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle stronger. When the <hi>Phalange</hi> was thus doubled, he proceeded in that order into the <hi>Champeigne,</hi> &amp; there againe reduced the depth of the armed foote to 9 or 10 men in euery file. <hi>This place of</hi> Xenophon, <hi>if it be not corrupted, is very obscure. And I cannot tell whether to take it for</hi> doubling <hi>of the front, or the</hi> Macedonian countermarch. <hi>The words make for a doubling. For</hi> Xenophon <hi>saith plainely,</hi> the Phalange was doubled. <hi>Besides he addeth,</hi> it was made by little and little stronger; <hi>which could not be done with a Countermarch. And that a deepe</hi> Phalange, <hi>or</hi> Hearse, <hi>(such as this by the euenings march, and the straights it entred, seemeth to be) is made stronger by doubling the front, there is no question. On the other side, the streights, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough which it was to passe, perswade me, it should be a</hi> Macedonian Countermarch. <hi>For in doubling the front the length still increaseth; &amp; the manner is not to inlarge, but to extenuate the front, when an Armie is to be conveighed thorough a narrow place. And</hi> Xenophon <hi>saith expresly, that</hi> Agesilaus <hi>led it thorough the streights into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne in that order, to which it was reduced last; &amp; that in the Champion the depth of the Armed was lessened, and brought to</hi> 9 <hi>or</hi> 10; <hi>for there</hi> Agesilaus <hi>imbattailed his Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange to receiue the enemy, if he would charge. And in a march through straight waies the front is commonly narrowed, and proportioned to the way; but in open ground the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange is againe brought to the iust length. So that it seemeth the depth was much, before it come into the plaine; because in the plaine it was brought to</hi> 9 <hi>or</hi> 10 <hi>men, and therefore no doubling. Lastly</hi> Agesilaus, <hi>(and the front I doubt not of the Phalange with him) turned face to the enemy, before the Reare came vp to him. which is done in no other motion, than the</hi> Macedonian countermarch. <hi>In which all the File-leaders first turne about their faces toward the enemy, and then the whole battaile marcheth against the File-leaders, and placing themselues orderly behind them, turne their faces the same way, that they haue done before. Now where it is in</hi> Xenophon, <hi>that</hi> Agesilaus <hi>hauing gained the</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne, <hi>extended his Armie to</hi> 9 <hi>or</hi> 10 <hi>Targeteres, I suspect a fault to be in the number of</hi> 9; <hi>and that it ought to be read</hi> 8 <hi>or</hi> 10. <hi>To extend a</hi> Phalange <hi>is to draw it out in length. the length is the space betwixt the point of both wings. When he saith he extended it to</hi>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:7163:95"/>
10, <hi>the meaning is he drew it out so farre in length that he left but</hi> 10 <hi>in depth. Ten is the</hi> decas, <hi>whereof I spoke before, and I haue likewise noted, that the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>for the most part, made the depth of their battaile</hi> 8. <hi>The number of</hi> 9, <hi>as all other vneuen numbers, was reiected by the</hi> Tacticks, <hi>as vnfit for doublings. So that mine opinion is that</hi> Xenophon <hi>at the first wrote</hi> 8 <hi>or</hi> 10, <hi>not</hi> 9 <hi>or</hi> 10, <hi>howsoeuer</hi> 9 <hi>be crept into the place of</hi> 8. <hi>But to returne to</hi> Agesilaus, <hi>admit he vsed doubling of ranks, or of the front in retiring out of the</hi> Mantinaean straights, <hi>yet giue me leaue to be of opinion, that the</hi> Macedonian Countermarch <hi>had beene the fittest motion for that purpose. For himselfe being thereby cast in the reare, he had both preuented the charge of the enemie (which he feared) and yet wounde better out of the straights, the long</hi> Herse, <hi>which still remained in the</hi> Macedonian Countermarch, <hi>being more proportionable to issue out of a narrow place, then a broad-fronted</hi> Phalange, <hi>which ariseth out of doubling the front.</hi>

                     <item>3 The Persian is the Cretan or Choraean] <hi>This</hi> Countermarch <hi>is called the</hi> Persian, <hi>and</hi> Cretan, <hi>because it was vsed amongst the</hi> Persians <hi>and</hi> Cretans. <hi>And it was termed the</hi> Choraean <hi>also, of the similitude it had with the solemne</hi> Graecian <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon stages; the company, that shewed themselues in such dances being called</hi> Chorus. <hi>Who in their daunces ordered themselues into files, and ranks, as souldiers doe in battaile, and mouing forward to the brinke of the stage, when being straightned by the place, they could passe no further, they retired one through the ranks of the other, exceeding not the bounds of the place, as is done in this</hi> Countermarch. <hi>The other two kinds of</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarch <hi>changed the ground, they had before. The</hi> Macedonian <hi>tooke the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the front; The</hi> Lacedemonian <hi>the ground after the reare. The</hi> Choraean <hi>holdeth the same ground, &amp; beginneth the motion with the File-leaders, who notwithstanding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede no further, then thither, where the Bringers-vp stood, their files following them, &amp; euery souldier keeping the same distance, he had before the mouing.

There is an other cause of strengthning the winges, namely if the enemy be ready to charge either of them: and this strength</hi> Aelian <hi>would haue giuen by the</hi> Countermarch <hi>of our best men into the winges.

B.</note> Pub: Scipio, who was afterward called Africanus, and <hi>Asdruball</hi> the sonne of <hi>Gisgo,</hi> being incamped neare together in Spaine brought daily out of their Campes their Armies one against an other. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had long stood waiting, who should begin the fight, which was done at neither hand, they conveighed them backe againe. The manner of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battailing was this. The Romans, and likewise the Carthagineans mingled with the Africans, had the middle, their Confederates the wings. The opinion was they should fight in that order. <hi>Scipio</hi> when he perceiued this to be firmely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, the day before he ment to fight, made an alteration of all. When night came, he gaue the word thorough the whole Campe, that horse, and men should dine, before it was light day, and that the horsemen in Armes should keepe their horses bridled, and sadled. The day was scarse sprunge, when he sent his horse, and light-armed to beat in the Carthaginean Gardes, himselfe streight followed with the armed Legions; disposing the Romans (contrary to the setled opinion of his owne people, and of the enemy) in the wings, and receiuing the Allies into the middest. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> raised out of his bed with the cry of his horsemen, had no sooner leaped out of his Tent, and seing the tumult before the trench of his Campe, and the amazednes of his people, and the Ensignes of the Legions shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a farre of, and the field full of enemies, presently sent out his whole power of horse to vndertake the Roman horse. Himselfe issued out of the Campe with his foote, not changing any thing of his wonted manner of imbattailing. The fight of the horsemen had now a long time beene doubtfull, and could not bee tried, because still, as they were beaten (which hapned a like to both) they found a safe retreat within the battailes of foote. But when the Armies were come within 500 paces one of an other, <hi>Scipio</hi> giuing a signall of Retreat, and opening his battaile, receiued all the horse, and light-armed into the middest, and diuiding them into two parts, placed them as seconds, behind the wings. Now when time was come to begin the fight, he commanded the Spaniards, who had the middle ward, to march on leasurely, and sent a messenger from the right winge (for hee commanded there) to <hi>Syllanus</hi> and <hi>Martius,</hi> willing them to stretch out the left winge, as they saw him stretch out the right; and to charge the enemy with the light-armed, and horse, before the middle wards might be able to come vp, and ioyne. The winges being thus stretched out, they led with all possible speed three <hi>Cohorts</hi> of foote, and three troupes of horse a peece, against the enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the light-armed, and those that were receiued into the Reare, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a thwart. There was a great empty space in the middest, because the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of the Spaniards came slowly on. And now the wings were in fight, when the old souldiers Carthaginians and Africans, the strength of the Armie, were
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7163:96"/>
not yet come to vse their darts, neither durst they runne into the wings to helpe them, that fought for feare of opening the middest of the battaile to the enemy, who was comming on against them. The winges were pressed with a double medley. The Horse, light-armed, &amp; <hi>Velites,</hi> wheeling about their Troupes, charge their flanks. The <hi>Cohorts</hi> pushed on in front, to the end, to breake of the wings from the body of the battaile. And the conflict was vnequall both in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and especially because a rable, as it were of drudges, and vntrained Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards, were opposed against the Roman and Latin souldiers. The day being now farre spent, the Armie of <hi>Asdruball</hi> oppressed with the mornings tumult, and compelled to take the field, before they had strengthned their bodies with meat, began to faint, and faile in strength; which was the reason that <hi>Scipio</hi> lingered out the day, &amp; made the fight somewhat late. For it was past the seuenth houre, before the winges of foote attached one an other: and yet the fight came later to the middle wards. So that the scorching heat of the <hi>south-sunne,</hi> and the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of standing armed,</hi> and <hi>hunger,</hi> and <hi>thirst,</hi> first afflicted their bodies, before they came to hands with the enemy. Therefore they stood leaning vpon their Targets, and being weary both in body, and minde, they gaue backe at last; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notwithstanding their array no otherwise, than as if the battaile being yet entire, had retreated at the commandement of the Generall. But when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, perceiuing them to shrinke, so much the more eagerly pressed on, the brunt could hardly be indured any longer. And although <hi>Asdrubal</hi> restrained, and stopped them, that gaue ground, crying that hills and a safe place of retreat was at their backs, if they could be but intreated, to retire easily; yet feare ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming shame, and the enemy killing them that were next to hand, they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with turned their backs, and vniuersally powred out themselues into flight. <hi>This stratagem of</hi> Scipio <hi>resteth principally in shifting</hi> his best men <hi>(the Romans)</hi> into the winges; <hi>the Spaniards</hi> his worst into the middest, <hi>and in</hi> keeping the Spaniards aloofe from ioyning; <hi>and in</hi> hasting to try the day <hi>with the Romans against the weakest of the enemy.</hi> Asdrubals <hi>way to meete with this</hi> stratagem <hi>had beene to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarch by ranke halfe his</hi> Carthaginians, <hi>and</hi> Africans <hi>into one winge, and halfe into the other. And by that meanes his</hi> Spaniards <hi>should haue had the middest against the</hi> Roman-Spaniards, <hi>and his old souldiers</hi> Carthaginians <hi>and</hi> Africans <hi>beene opposed in the wings against the</hi> Romans, <hi>and</hi> Latins, <hi>and the advantage eluded, that</hi> Scipio <hi>sought.</hi>

                     <hi>As the</hi> Countermarches by file <hi>were of three kindes, so are the</hi> Countermarches by ranke; <hi>namely the</hi> Macedonian, <hi>the</hi> Lacedemonian, <hi>and the</hi> Choraean. <hi>The</hi> Macedonian <hi>beginneth to moue at the corner of the wing, which is nearest to the enemy, the enemy appearing to either flanke. And therefore inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet is there vse of it, as well as of that by</hi> file. <hi>For by this</hi> countermarch <hi>you may set the strongest part of your Armie against the enemy, and apply the weakest to some Riuer, Lake, hill, or such like, so that the enemy can not come to incompasse it. It taketh the ground that lyeth on the side of the contrary wing. The</hi> Lacedemonian <hi>taketh the ground that lieth on the side of that wing, which is toward the enemy, and bringeth the best men to be formost against the enemy: And therefore beginneth the moving on the contrary side. The vse of it is, when your forces are such as are able to incounter the enemy, and you desire to bring your best men to fight. The</hi> Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raean <hi>keepeth the same ground, the battaile had at first, &amp; bringeth one wing to possesse the place of the other; Or else the Sections to possesse the place of the wings, as might haue</hi>

                     <hi>beene done in the last example cited concerning</hi> Scipio <hi>and</hi> Asdrubal. <hi>The manner of</hi> countermarch by ranke <hi>is contrary to the</hi> countermarch by file. <hi>In</hi> countermarch by file <hi>the motion was in the depth of the battaile, and either the front remoued toward the reare, or the reare toward the front, and tooke one an others place. In this the motion is in length of the battaile flanke-wise; the wing either marching into the middest, or else cleane thorow to the other wing. In doing it the souldiers, that stand vttermost in the flanke of the wing, must moue first to the contrary wing, and the rest of euery ranke seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow them in order, The figure will shew the manner of the motion.</hi> Patritius <hi>vtterly mistaketh the</hi> countermarch by ranke; <hi>and groundeth himselfe vpon a wrong principle, namely that in all</hi> Countermarches the File-leaders must march toward the reare, and the Bringers-vp towards the front. <hi>And therefore in changing the winges into Sections, he makes the winges to fall of behind in the reare (the File-leaders wheeling about) and there to ioyne themselues as neare, as the middle Section will giue leaue, and the Sections falling backe likewise, to ioyne themselues to the flanks of them, that were the wings. Whereas the nature of this</hi> Euolution <hi>is clearely to leaue the File-leaders in front, and Bringers-vp in reare, as they were at first. And albeit the File-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then change their places, yet change they their place with none, but with File leaders, and the change is, but a change of hands, the right hand for the left, or the left hand for the right. For whereas the File-leaders of the right wing had before the right hand, now in</hi> countermarch by ranke, <hi>being transposed to the left wing, they haue the left hand of all the rest of the File-leaders; as likewise the Bringers-vp of the other bringers-vp.</hi>

In like sort we double the place with 124 files (not increasing the number) but onely commanding some to turne to the Pike, some to the Target, till the <hi>Phalange</hi> be stretched out to a convenient length, as from 5 furlongs to 10. In the same manner is the depth doubled. For either one file is inserted into an other, man for man, so that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond File-leader becomes the follower of the first, and the second man in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond file, the follower of the second in the first file, and so the rest: Or else 16 men are so extended, that they hold as much ground in length, as 32 vsuallydoe. <hi>So farre the insertion. It followeth in</hi> Aelian.</item>
                     <item>3 The length is doubled in number] <hi>When the front hath twise as many files, as it had before, this is Doubling in number, or in men, or in persons. For the persons, or men, make the number in the files. And the files carrying an euen depth of men, and being doubled, double the number of the front, or length.</hi> Aelian <hi>speaketh but of one kinde of doubling, namely of number, and that must be done in open order, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For the files of</hi> 16 <hi>standing in open order, if you command the</hi> Middlemen (<hi>as we terme them at this day, they were called in the Macedoman files the third</hi> Enomotarchs) <hi>to double their ranks: These middle men with the hinder halfe file march vp to the front, &amp; so doubling the front in number leaue yet the same measure of length. The figure shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how it is done. Yet are there two other waies, when the</hi> Phalange <hi>standeth in close or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both which double the number, and place. One is when the</hi> Middlemen <hi>diuide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and one halfe with their followers turning their faces march out of the right flanke: The other of the left flanke of the</hi> Phalange. <hi>And then turning their faces againe,</hi>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:7163:99"/>
sleeue <hi>vp and ioyne themselues in an euen line with the File leaders in front; The other when all the</hi> Middle <hi>turne their faces one way and march out with their followers beyond one flanke right or left; and turning faces againe</hi> sleeue <hi>vp to the front, and stand euen with the File-leaders. One of these is done, when we desire to enlarge both the wings of the</hi> Phalange; <hi>the other, when but one wing. Of these two last waies, I haue set downe no figure, because I finde them not expressed in</hi> Aelian. Cleandridas <hi>the</hi> Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, <hi>vsed yet an other kinde not spoken of by</hi> Aelian. <note n="n" place="margin">Polyen. lib 2. in Cleandrida. § 4.</note> Polienus <hi>telleth the story thus: Cleandridas</hi> making warre vpon the <hi>Thurians,</hi> hauing halfe as many men againe, as they, conceiuing if they had intelligence hereof, they would hardly bee brought to fight, imbattailing his <hi>Phalange,</hi> stretched it out in depth. The <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> therefore, contemning the small number, drew out their forces in length, with intent <hi>to ouer-front the enemy;</hi> which <hi>Cleandridas</hi> perceiuing, commanded the <hi>followers to march vp, and ranke with their Leaders;</hi> and by that meanes increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the length of his Phalange, and ouer-fronted the enemy; who being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, and assailed with missiue weapons on all hands perished intirely, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a few, that saued themselues by shamefull flight. <hi>The words seeme obscure to a man not acquainted with the Tacticks. There are two kinde of soldiers saith</hi> Aelian <hi>in a file,</hi> Leaders, <hi>and</hi> followers. <hi>All the</hi> Leaders <hi>are the odde of the file; as the first, the</hi> 3. <hi>the</hi> 5, <hi>the</hi> 7, <hi>and so forth: the</hi> followers <hi>are the euen, as the</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 6, 8. <hi>Those that are in the same ranke, are called</hi> side-men. <hi>Now, saith</hi> Polien, Cleandridas <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the followers</hi> to step forward, and to ranke, and become <hi>side-men</hi> with their Leaders: <hi>that is, he willed the euen files to</hi> double <hi>their ranks with the odde; and so extenuated the depth, but increased the length of his</hi> Phalange; <hi>by which art he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, &amp; inclosed the enemy on all sides. This way then to double ranks, or the length of the battaile, is to insert the euen ranks man by man into the odde. All the</hi> Doublings <hi>that haue beene rehearsed, were</hi> Doublings <hi>either in</hi> number <hi>alone, or else both in</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>and</hi> place. <hi>For doubling of place alone nothing is said in</hi> Aelian. <hi>The</hi> Insertion <hi>I recited, supplyeth this defect: saying,</hi> the place is doubled with 124 files, onely by commanding halfe to turne to the Pike, halfe to the Target, till the Phalange be stretched to a convenient length; as from 5 furlongs to ten; <hi>which is as much to say in few words, as</hi> to open the Phalange; <hi>Or to</hi> bring it from order, <hi>to</hi> open order. <hi>For so the front possesseth double ground, to that it had before.</hi>

                        <hi>being drawne out in length it is freer from enclosing, because a greater compasse must be fetched, before it can be inclosed. Yet are we to take heed, that in doubling of the front, we giue it not so much length that it faile in depth. The want of length, or depth is alike dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and giueth advantage to the enemy.

                     <item>6 By inserting the second file] <hi>There are two manner of doublings of the depth or of files; one in number, the other in place. In number, when one file is inserted into another, the Leader or first man of the second file standing behind the Leader of the first; the second behind the second, the third behind the third, and so forth of the rest: Or when the euen files countermarch, and their Leaders place themselues behind the Bringers-vp of the odde, their files following them; or (which commeth all to one) the files being whole, they diuide themselues into two parts in the front, and halfe counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march, and place themselues in the Reare of the other file to file: albeit the two last are Doublings both in number and place, and not in place alone. The true Doubling of the place alone is not</hi> Aelian. <hi>The</hi> Insertion <hi>whereof I spake, remedieth this defect also. There it is said, that</hi> when 16 men (that is a file) are so extended, that they possesse as much length as 32 should doe, (that is, as 2 files) it is doubling of place. <hi>which is nothing else but changing of the Souldiers</hi> order <hi>into</hi> open order. <hi>For in their</hi> order <hi>they haue</hi> 48 <hi>foote in depth; in their</hi> open order 96 <hi>foote in depth.

the right hand, we command the right-hand-file to stand firme, &amp; the rest of the files to turne their faces to the right hand, and to moue close vp to the right hand file. Then to turne their faces, as they were at first: Then the hinder rankes to close forward: Then the whole battaile in that closenesse to wheele about the corner-file-Leader to the right hand. This done, if neede be to reduce it to the first posture, or Station, wee command euery man to turne about his face to the Target, or left hand (that is to looke the contrary way) Then to wheele about the body, that is, as it turned, closed, &amp; serred with the front to the right hand so to returne it againe to the place, from whence it made the wheeling; Then the file-Leaders to stand firme, and the rest to open their ranks behind; Then to turn their faces about, as they stood at first; Then the right-hand-file to stand fast, and the rest turning faces to the left hand to open their files; Then to stand; And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to turne their faces againe to the right hand: and so shall euery man haue his first posture.</p>
               <p>But in case we desire to wheele to the left hand, we command the left-hand-file to stand still, and all the rest to turne their faces to the left hand, and mooue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward close vp to the left hand file; Then to turne their faces as they were; Then to gather vp the hinder rankes; Then to wheele the battaile to the left hand, and stand; and so is it done, that was commanded. But if restitution to the first po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture be needfull, we must doe, as we did in returning from the right. For euery man must turne about his face to the Pike; Then the whole battaile wheeling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the left-hand-corner-file-Leader must returne to the place, it had; Then all the file-Leaders stand firme, and turne about their faces, and the rest open their rankes in mouing forward and make Alte; Then the left hand file is to stand firme (for it hath the place it first had) and the rest turning their faces to the right hand to open their files, and moue forward, till they haue recouered their first distances; then to turne their faces as at first; and so shall euery man be in his first posture. Now if we would wheele the battaile about, to the pike we are to make 2 wheelings to the same side, so will it come to passe that the file-Leaders shall in the change haue their faces turned to the Reare, where before they had them looking out from the front. But in restoring to the first posture we command it to wheele about to the right hand; That is, we giue it two wheelings more the same way; So the file-Leaders will haue their faces set, as at first. Then we command the file-Leaders to stand firme, and the rest to open their rankes behind; then to turne their faces about; Then the right hand file to stand still (for it hath the right place) and the rest turning their faces to the right hand to march on, till the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer distances are regained; then to make Alte. So is the battaile reduced to the first Station.</p>
               <p>If you would haue the battaile turne about to the Target, you are to giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie directions; That is, in stead of commanding a double wheeling to the Pike, to command a double wheeling to the Target; Then by making two turnes the contrary way, to vse the like changes, we spake of before.</p>
               <p>There is likewise a treble wheeling of the battaile, when it turneth thrice to the same hand, namely to the Pike, or Target. The double wheeling to the Pike transferreth the Souldiers face from the front to the backe of the battaile: The treble wheeling to the Pike bringeth his face to the left flanke. The treble whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Target contrariwise to the right flank.</p>

The like may bee said of <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marches;</hi> Of which, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> are held to bee the inuentors of the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> of the <hi>Lacedemonian;</hi> and for this cause either to haue name accordingly. The Histories witnesse, that <hi>Philip</hi> (who much enlarged the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> kingdome, and ouercame the <hi>Graecians</hi> in battaile at <hi>Cheronea,</hi> and made himselfe Generall of <hi>Greece</hi>) and likewise his sonne <hi>Alexander</hi> (that in short time conquered all <hi>Asia</hi>) made small account of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> countermarch, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse necessitie forced it; and that they both by the vse of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came victorious ouer their enemies. For the <hi>Macedonian countermarch</hi> the enemy falling vpon the reare, is cause of great confusion; in as much as the hindermost dismarching toward the front, and making a shew of running away, it more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth, and emboldneth the enemy to follow. For feare, and pursuit of the enemy [ordinarily] accompanieth that kinde of <hi>countermarch.</hi> But the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> is of contrarie effect. For when the enemy sheweth himselfe in the reare, the Leaders with their followers brauely aduancing, and opposing themselues, it striketh no small feare, and terror into their mindes.</p>

               <p>WEe are to acquaint our forces both foote, and horse, partly with the voice, and partly with visible signes, that whatsoeuer is fitting be executed, and done, as occasion shall require. Some things also are to be denounced by the Trumpet, for so all directions will be fully accomplished, and sort to a desired ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The signes therefore, which are deliuered by voice, are most euident, and cleere, if they haue no impediment. But the most certaine, and least tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are such, as are presented to the eye, if they bee not obscured. The voice sometime can hardly be heard by reason of the clashing of armour, or trampling, and neighing of Horses, or tumult of cariage, or noyse, and confused sounds of the multitude. The visible signes also become many waies incertain, by thicknes of aire, and dust, or raine, or snow, or sun-shine, or else thorow ground, that is vneuen, or full of trees, or of turnings. And sometimes it will not be easie to find out signes for all vses, occasions eftsoones presenting new matter, to the which a man is not accustomed. Yet can it not fall out, that either by voice, or by signal, we should not giue certaine and sure direction.</p>

               <p>THe battaile framed in forme of a <hi>Rhombe,</hi> was first inuented by <hi>Ileon</hi> the <hi>Thessalian,</hi> and was called <hi>Ile</hi> after his name; and to this forme he exercised and accustomed the <hi>Thessalians.</hi> It is of good vse, in that it hath a Leader at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner, at the point the Captaine, of the Troupe, the reare-Commander be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and on either side the flanke-commanders. The foote battaile, fittest to affront this, is the <hi>Menoides,</hi> or <hi>Cressant,</hi> hauing both the <hi>wings</hi> stretched out, and in them the Leaders, and the middest imbowed to inuiron and wrap in the Horsemen in their giuing on. Whereupon the Horsemen ply the foot a farre off with flying weapons, after the manner of the <hi>Tarentines,</hi> seeking thereby to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue, and disorder their circled frame of marching. <hi>Tarentum</hi> is a City of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Horsemen whereof are called <hi>Acrobolists,</hi> because in charging they first cast little <hi>Darts,</hi> and after come to hands with the enemy.</p>

               <p>The Foot-battaile to encounter it is called the <hi>Plagiophalange,</hi> or <hi>broad-fronted</hi> Battaile.

            <head>THE EXERCISE OF THE ENGLISH IN the seruice of the high and mighty Lords, the LORDS the ESTATES of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted PROVINCES in the Low COVNTRIES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Soldiers are diuided into two kindes, <hi>Foote</hi> and <hi>Horse.</hi> The <hi>Foote</hi> againe are of two kindes; <hi>Pikemen</hi> and <hi>Musketiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pikemen</hi> are armed with a head-peece, a Curace and Tases defensiue, and with a Pike of fifteene foote long, and a Rapier offen siue. The Armour is all yron; the Pike of Ashen wood for the Steale, and at the vpper end an yron head of about a handfull long with cheekes about the length of two foote, and at the butt-end a round strong socket of yron ending in a pike, that is blunt, yet sharpe enough to fixe to the ground. The forme thereof is expressed in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen figure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Musketier</hi> hath a head-peece for defence, a <hi>Musket,</hi> the barrell of the length of 4 foote, the bore of 12 bullets to the pound; a Bandelier, to which are fastned a convenient number of charges for powder (sometimes as many as 15 or 16) a lether bagge for bullets, with a pruning yron; a Rest for the <hi>Musket</hi> with an yron forke on the vpper end to support it in discharging, and a pike on the nether end to sticke into the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lastly, a Rapier. The figure of this armour also is here inserted.</p>
            <p>These soldiors, both Pike-men, and Musketiers, are diuided into Companies; and euery Company consisteth, halfe of Pikes, halfe Musketiers. The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are some more in number, some lesse. Some reach to 300 men, some 200, some 100, some 90, some 80, some 70. Euery Company hath these officers of the field: A Captaine, a Lieutenant, an Ensigne, 2 Serieants, 3 Corporalls, two Drommes; and for other vses a Clerke, a Surgion, and a Prouost.</p>
            <p>Companies are compacted into Regiments; and the Regiments commanded by Coronells. Regiments conteine not alwaies a like number of Companies, some hauing 10, some 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, some 30 Companies and aboue. In euery Regiment are a Coronell, a Lieutenant Coronell, a Serieant Maior, all officers of the field; a Quarter-master, and a Prouost-martiall for other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It shall not be greatly to the purpose to mention higher officers, then Coronells, my principall intent being no other, then to set downe the armes and exercise of our Nation in the said vnited Provinces. Their armes are spoken of. Their exercise followes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:7163:134"/>FIrst both Pikes and Muskets are ordered into files of 10 deepe. The Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers are sometime placed before, sometime in flanke, sometimes in the reare of the pikes.</p>
            <p>To exercise the motions, there are two distances to be obserued.</p>
            <p>The first is when euery one is distant from his fellow 6 foote square, that is in file and ranke 6.</p>
            <p>The second is when euery Souldier is 3 foote distant one from the other aswell in file, as in Ranke.</p>
            <p>And because the measure of such distances cannot be taken so iustly by the eye, the distance of 6 foot betwixt the files is measured, when the Souldiers stretching out their armes doe touch one an others hands: and betwixt the Rankes, when the ends of their pikes come well nigh to the heeles of them, that march before. And the measure of 3 foote betwixt the files is, when their elbowes touch one another; betwixt the rankes, when they come to touch the ends of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Rapiers.</p>
            <p>For to march in the field, the distance of 3 foote from file to file is kept, and of 6 foote from Ranke to Ranke.</p>
            <p>To order themselues in Battaile, as also to goe towards the enemy, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of 3 foote in file, and ranke, is obserued; and likewise to conversion or wheeling.</p>
            <p>The Musquettiers also going for to shoote by Rankes keep the same distance of 3 foot, but going to skirmish they goe <hi>a la Disbandade,</hi> which is out of order.</p>
            <p>There is yet another sort of distance, which is not vsed, but for to receiue the enemy with a firme stand, and serueth for the pikes onely (for the Musquettiers cannot be so close in files, because they must haue their Armes at liberty) &amp; that is, when euery one is distant from file to file a foote and a halfe, and 3 foote from Ranke to Ranke. And this last distance is thus commanded, <hi>Close your selues throughly.</hi> But it is not to be taught the Souldiers, for that, when necessitie shall require it, they will close themselues but too much, of their owne accord without command.</p>
            <p>To begin therefore to doe the exercises, the Company is set in the first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to wit of 6 foote in file, and ranke, and thus is said</p>
