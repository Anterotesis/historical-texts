         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEloved, and curtious friends and Readers, we have to
consider by this strange discourse, how ready Sathan
is to take hold on us, if we fall from him never so little, he
continually runneth up and downe seeking whom he may
devoure, but not withstanding his temptations which are
great, the mercyes of God are greater, who never faile to
send comfort in temptation, if we accept thereof: great
are the examples, both of Gods mercies, and might put
us in remembrance of our sinnes, which are infinite and
loathsome, wherein if wee continue, let us undoubtedly
looke for the reward thereof, which is an everlasting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
both of body and soule.</p>
            <p>Let not this which is here declared seeme a <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ined fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto thee, but assure thy selfe that all such things are
sent as warnings for our wickednesse, and to put us in mind
of the Seate of our salvation which is an assured faith in
Christ Iesus, from which pillar if wee once shrinke, the
tempter is ready to drive us into dispaire of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>Many are the wonders which have lately happened, as
of suddaine &amp; strange deaths of Purjured persons, strange
sights in the ayre, strange births on the earth, earthquakes,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95704:3"/>
commets, and the like, all which are to put us in minde
of God whose workes are wonderfull.</p>
            <p>These are therefore as many warnings unto us, to bee
watchfull for the day of the Lord, which is at hand, least
suddenly his wrath bee kindled against us, let us therefore
pray to Almighty God, to hold backe his rod, to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
unto us, and to forgive us that is past, that through
the assistance of his spirit wee may with penitent hearts
live in his feare to our lives end.</p>

of <hi>Durham,</hi> whose name is <hi>Stephen Hooper,</hi> a man
of good wealth, and also welbeloved of his neighbours,
who being sicke, and lying in aweake estate, sent his wife
whose name was <hi>Margret Hooper</hi> to a farme which hee had
in a village, called <hi>Hanstonueth,</hi> some three miles off, at
whose comming thither, it seemed all things were
not according to her minde. Thus continuing there one
day and something more, shee returned home to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
partly agreeved at such things as shee thought her
husband might reforme, if God lent him life, now when
she was come home to <hi>Edenbyres,</hi> shee found her husband
recovered to an indifferent health, to whom shee began
to use very much idle talke, as wee concerning the same
farme as also concerning an old groat, which her sonne
being a little boy had found about a weeke before, thus
she continued as if she had beene one bewitched, or haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with an evill Spirit, untill the wednesday at night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
which night she tooke her rest something indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
untill the morning, at which time she began with
much vaine speech to disquiet her husband, and to vse
much idle talke, but her husband seeing her in such a mind,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95704:3"/>
and finding that she was, as it were desperate; he perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her to cal upon, God &amp; that being the Creature of God,
she should not forget to call upon her Creator in the day
of trouble, wherefore he councelled her to pray with him,
and to say the Lords Prayer after him, which shee partly
did, but the devill who alwayes doth build the Chapell,
so much as he may to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

most fearefull fort, for the groat, which he Sonne had
lately found, as also for her weding Ring, desiring to
see them with all speed, her husband made no great hast
thereunto, but continued in prayer that it would please
God to send her a more quiet spirit, and to strengthen
her that fairh might speedily uanquish such vanitie in her,
but the more he prayed and perswaded her to prayer, the
more shee seemed to bee as it were troubled with some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
spirit, calling for the old groat, which her husband
neglected to shew her, whereat shee began with a uery

most wonderfull sort, that he was sore affrighted at the
then he called for her sister, for that he was not able to
keepe her in the bed, which when her sister and others
were come into the chamber, they kept her downe ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
in her bed, and forthwith shee was so sore tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
that shee foamed at the mouth, and was shaken
with such force, that the bed and the chamber did shake
and move in most strainge sort, her husband continued
praying for her deliuerance, so that within one halfe

shee had beene in the Towerne to beat away the beate

her husband and frinds wished her to leave those uaine

lightnesse of her braine, which was become Idle for want
of rest, wherefore her husband and friends exhorted her to
say the Lords prayer with them, which she did, and after
tooke some rest, and thus she continued untill the Satter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
following, in which time she continued raging, as it
were distract of her memory, which came by fits, to the
great griefe of her husband, friends, and neighbours, yet
upon the Satterday there was some hopes of her recovery,
for that she tooke some reasonable rest, to the comfort of
her husband and friends, and upon the Sunday she seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be very patient, and conformable untill midnight at
which time the candle which was set burning in the same
Chamber was burned, she then suddainely awaking, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to her husband, and cryed out saying, that shee did
see a strange thing like unto a snale, carrying fire in
a most wonderfull sort, whereat her husband was amazed,
and seeing the candle was cleene burnt out, called to his
Brothers and Sisters that were in the house, with other
of their friends watching, and sitting up to comfort her,
if her extreame fit should any way molest her, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him call, come in, and brought a candle lighted, and
set it upon the table, which stood neere where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
lay, She began to wax very fearefull, saying to her
husband and the rest, doe not you see the Devill, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
they desired her to remember God, and to call for grace
that her faith might onely be fixed upon him, to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing
the Devill and his assaults, Hell (quoth shee) if
you see nothing now, you shall see something by and by,
and forthwith they heard a great noise in the street, as if it
had beene the comming of foure or five carts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
they in the chamber cryed out saying, Lord helpe
us, what manner of thing is this that commeth here, then
her husband looking up in his bed, espyed a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the bed, much like a beare, but it had no head
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95704:4"/>
nor taile, halfe a yard in height, and halfe a yard in length,
her husband seeing it come to the bed rose up, and tooke a
joynt stoole, and strooke at the said thing, the stroke
founded as though he had strucken upon a fether-bed,
then it came to the woman, and stroke her three times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the feet, and tooke her out of the bed, and so rouled
her too and fro in the Chamber, and under the bed, the
people then present, to the number of seaven persons,
were so greatly amazed with this horrible sight, that they
knew not what to doe, yet they called still upon God for
his assistance, but the candle was so dimme, that they
could scarcely see one another, at the last this Monster,
which wee supposed to be the Devill, did thrust the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
head betweene her leggs, and so rouled her in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
compasse, like an hoope through the other Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
downe an high paire of staires into the Hall, where
he kept her the space of a quarter of an house, her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and they in the Chamber above, durst not come
downe to her, but remained in prayer, weeping at the

there was such an horrible stinke in the Hall, and
such fiery flames, that they were glad to stop their noses
with cloathes, and napkines, then the woman cryed out
calling to her husband, now he is gone, then quoth he in
the name of God come up to me, and so even upon the
suddaine she was come up so quickly, that they greatly
marveiled at it, then they brought her to bed, and foure
of them, kept downe the cloathes about the bed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in prayer about her, the candle in the Chamber
could not burne cleare, but was very dimme, and sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the woman was got out of the bed, and the Window at
the beds <unclear>head</unclear> opened, whether the woman unpind the

was opened, &amp; the wamons leggs after a miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

thrust out of the Winddow, so that they were clasped
about the post in the middle of the Winddow betweene
her leggs, the people of the Chamber heard a thing knock
