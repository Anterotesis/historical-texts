         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>PSAL. xcvii. 1.</bibl>
               <q>The Lord is King, the earth may be glad
thereof: yea, the multitude of the isles may
be glad thereof.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THAT is to say, it ought to be Matter of
exceeding Joy to all the Inhabitants of
the World, that amidst all the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
and Hazards, and Variety of Fortunes,
which they here find themselves exposed to, there
is One Above that governs All.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52754:5"/>
               <hi>GOD</hi> that made the World is the <hi>King</hi> of it.
All the Beings of the Universe, Angels, Men, and
Devils, with all the other Animate or Inanimate
things in Heaven and Earth, as they are His <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
so are they truly and properly His <hi>Subjects,</hi>
and act entirely in subordination to Him, as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Instruments do under the Guidance of the
Principal Agent.</p>
            <p>GOD doth as truly Reign in the World, as
any King does in his Kingdom: He doth as truly
order the Affairs of it, as any Master doth those of
his own Family. Nay, a Man's own Thoughts
and Actions are not by a thousand times so much
attended by himself, are not so much his Care, as
the Affairs of the Universe are attended by, and
are the Care of God Almighty.</p>
            <p>This is the notion of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s being <hi>King;</hi>
and, Do you not think it ought to be matter of
<hi>Rejoycing</hi> to all Reasonable Creatures?</p>
            <p>O Lord, what a gloomy dismal <hi>Scene</hi> of things
do they present us with, that give other Accounts
of these matters?</p>
            <p>To banish God's Providence and Government
out of the World, is to banish all Joy, all Peace, all
Hope, all Comfort for ever, from all those that
have the power of Thinking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52754:5"/>
A Brute indeed is not much concern'd how
Matters are order'd: An <hi>Ox</hi> may grow fat in his
<hi>Stall,</hi> and a <hi>Colt</hi> frisk in his <hi>Pasture,</hi> let the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
of the Government of the World be what it
will. But to one that is made with a Faculty of
Reasoning, that has <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> and can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on what is past, and hath a prospect of what
is future; what black and melancholy Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
must it cause in such a one, to suppose that
no care is taken of Human Affairs; but that we
sail in the tempestuous <hi>Ocean</hi> of this World, every
minute in danger of <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Quicksands,</hi> without
any <hi>Pilot</hi> to steer us?</p>
            <p>Take what <hi>Hypothesis</hi> you will; either that
there is no God, but that all things come to pass
by <hi>Chance,</hi> or inevitable <hi>Necessity;</hi> Or, that there is
a God, but that God having once put things into
this Frame, never meant to trouble himself more
about them, but left them to shift for themselves,
<hi>Natural Events</hi> falling out from necessary Causes,
and <hi>Civil Affairs</hi> being left to Mankind, who are
to shuffle and divide the World among themselves
as well as they can! I say, proceed which way
you will, if you exclude God Almighty's <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
you make this World so dark and miserable
a place, that no serious-c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>idering man can tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
enjoy himself in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52754:6"/>
For here, upon the former supposition, you are
left without Counsel or Advice. You have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to propose, nothing to design in the course
of your Lives. It is all one how you behave your
selves, whether honestly or wickedly; whether
you mind your Business, or mind it not, for the
Event will be the same. You are obliged to no
body for any Benefits; you can complain of no
body for any ill usage. If you be in ill circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
you have none to apply to for Remedy; and
if you be in good ones, you may be stript of them
without Remedy the next moment: for <hi>all things</hi>
are carried on by a whirl of Fate.</p>
            <p>And you are not much better'd by the latter <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi>
That God hath trusted the Government
of the World with Mankind, who are endowed
with Reason and Understanding.</p>
            <p>For, if we consider how Mankind do sometimes
use their Reasons, it is as good, if not better, to
be exposed to the Hazards of Chance or Necessity,
as to be subject to their Wills.</p>
            <p>The truth of it is, if this <hi>Systeme</hi> of the World
be well consider'd, it will appear a more uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
one than the other; for it doth not remove
from us the <hi>Iron Ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> we are still under
that Yoke as much as we were before. Yet besides
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52754:6"/>
these, it puts upon us another Yoke, the <hi>arbitrary
Pleasures</hi> of those of our own kind, which if they
be not governed by Reason, are ten times more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
than the other.</p>
            <p>We are by this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> as much exposed to
<hi>Natural Evils</hi> as we were before, and there is no
help for them; but over and above, we must bear
the Indignities and Insolences, the Ravages and
Cruelty of every one that is stronger than our
selves, and hath the will to oppress us.</p>
            <p>O hard Lot of Mankind, if this was their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution!
better by far were it for them to be
Brutes, and think of nothing, than to be Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such Terms as these.</p>
            <p>Happy therefore are the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the Earth,
happy are the remotest <hi>Isles</hi> thereof, that there is
a <hi>King</hi> that reigns both over <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are we, that there is a wise and intelligent <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
that superintends all our Affairs, and so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
both the Powers of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the Powers
of <hi>Mankind;</hi> that nothing can be done by either
of them, but what is designed by, and pursuant to,
his Counsels.</p>
            <p>Upon this Supposition we may live like <hi>Men,</hi>
and enjoy our selves with some Comfort in this
World. We may propose Ends and Designs to
our selves, and hope that with our <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>good
management</hi> they may take effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52754:7"/>
Upon this Supposition we may and ought to
look upon all our good Successes, as the Blessings
of God to us, and particularly that which we are
this day met together to thank Him for; I mean,
the wonderful <hi>Preservation</hi> of His <hi>Majesty</hi> from
all the Dangers to which he hath so often been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and his safe <hi>Return</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>Upon this Supposition, we may hope, that tho'
all things have not yet succeeded according to our
Wishes, yet in due time they may, since the <hi>King</hi>
of the <hi>World</hi> hath, by the frequent and unexpected
Deliverances he hath wrought for us, and the
strange unusual Providences that have attended
our <hi>King,</hi> given us some Encouragement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
(provided we do our parts towards it) that
He hath reserv'd <hi>Vs</hi> for better Times, and <hi>Him</hi> for
the executing those <hi>Glorious Designs,</hi> which Good
Men hope will at last be accomplish'd in the
World.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Upon this Supposition, every Honest
Man will find reason enough both to bear conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
whatever uneasie Circumstances he lyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and to trust in God's Mercy for the removal
of them; and in the mean time to possess his own
Soul in a cheerfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> dependance on God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and a hearty Thankfulness for all the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Blessings he hath receiv'd, and doth daily
receive from his Hands. And therefore, since <hi>the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52754:7"/>
Lord is King let the earth be glad: yea, let the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the isles be glad thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, That the Lord is really thus the <hi>King</hi> of
the World, there are all the Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us that can be desir'd:</p>
            <p>It is the Voice of <hi>Reason:</hi> It is the Voice of all
<hi>Mankind:</hi> It is the Voice of <hi>GOD</hi> himself, both
in His <hi>Works,</hi> and in His <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave to give you a <hi>Specimen</hi> in all these
ways of <hi>Arguing,</hi> and but a <hi>Specimen,</hi> because it
would be rather the Work of a <hi>Book</hi> than of a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
to dilate upon these matters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I say, <hi>Reason</hi> tells us it must be thus. For
admitting that the World did not make it self, but
was made by God; it will follow, that the same
God that made it must still govern it: For, the
same Ends, and Designs, and Motives (whatever
they were) that induced God to make the World
at first, will oblige Him for ever to take care of it
and look after it. Unless we suppose God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
and act as uncertainly and unstedily, and
with the same inconstancy and levity of Mind that
some of <hi>us Mortals</hi> here upon Earth do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is the Voice of all <hi>Mankind.</hi> For,
otherwise how comes it to pass, that among all
Nations, and in all Ages, there has been some <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
or other practised.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52754:8"/>
I pray, what is the meaning of worshipping God,
of putting up Prayers and Supplications to Him for
the things we need; of returning Thanks for the
Benefits we have received; of appointing Religious
Rites and Methods for the expiation of Guilt, or
the averting of impendent Calamities (all which
things have been practised in all Nations, from the
beginning of the World to this day)? I say, what
is the meaning of all this, unless it was hereby
meant to be signified, That there is a God which
doth concern himself in the Affairs of <hi>Mankind,</hi>
and who doth dispense Good or Evil to them, as
they well or ill behave themselves towards him?</p>
            <p>The Truth is, To say that God doth not govern
the World, is to say, that all Religion is a Cheat;
and, that all Mankind, except a few debauch'd
<hi>Wits</hi> in the more <hi>polite Countries,</hi> and a few <hi>Brutes</hi>
in the very <hi>barbarous</hi> ones, (who are of no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at all) have been, and are a company of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
Fools. For this is certain, whatever Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
either <hi>Iew,</hi> or <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi>
can suggest to himself for the convincing him, that
it is his Concernment, or his Duty, to worship
God, or to be of any Religion at all, nay, or to
make any conscience of any Action he does; I say,
all these Arguments do not only prove, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that God both knows and orders the Affairs of
the World.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52754:8"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may likewise be as strongly proved
from <hi>Effects;</hi> from the tracks and footsteps of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
over-ruling Providence, which are to be seen
in the <hi>Events</hi> that happen in the World, which is
that I call the <hi>Voice of God in his Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are indeed so many and so visible, that
whosoever hath either read History, or hath made
Observations, must needs have taken notice of
them.</p>
            <p>If ever there were any extraordinary <hi>Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
vouchsafed to Kingdoms, or Cities, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Persons; or ever any remarkable <hi>Iudgments</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon any of these, which so carried the
<hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Signatures</hi> of God's Hand in them, that
the one could not in reason but be <hi>attributed</hi> to the
Care that he had, that <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Innocence</hi> should
not be oppressed; and the other must in reason be
interpreted as a Divine Vengeance, that pursued
the <hi>Guilty</hi> for <hi>their Crimes:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ever there were any <hi>Prophecies</hi> that did pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
foretell a <hi>Particular Event</hi> that came not
to pass till many Years after, and such an Event as
was perfectly contingent, and depended upon the
<hi>Wills of Men:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ever there were any <hi>Notices</hi> given of <hi>Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Calamities,</hi> by Voices from Heaven, by strange
Appearances in the Air, and such other like
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52754:9"/>
Presages, not naturally to be accounted for:</p>
            <p>If ever there were any <hi>Apparitions,</hi> any <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi>
any effects of a <hi>Diabolical Power,</hi> by which it
may appear, that there are a sort of Invisible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the World, which do bear ill will to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
but yet are so curbed, that they cannot do
all the Mischief they would:</p>
            <p>If ever there were any <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought either
by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> or by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and
his <hi>Apostles,</hi> for the confirmation of the <hi>Iewish</hi> or
the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion:</p>
            <p>Lastly, If ever any Good Man did ever receive
any Blessing, or avoid any Misfortune, which he
might rationally look upon as an Answer to the
Fervent Prayers that he had put up to God, or
others had put up for him:</p>
            <p>I say, if any of these things that I have now
named be true (as all Histories give us a World of
Instances of the truth of <hi>all</hi> of them, and as for <hi>some</hi>
of them, I do not doubt but they fall within the
compass of our own Observation and Experience.)
I say, if any of these things be true, then have we
a convincing Proof, that there is a Power that doth
interpose in the Affairs of the World, superiour
both to that of Nature, and to that of Mankind,
and which moderates <hi>all things,</hi> according as <hi>it seems
good</hi> unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52754:9"/>
But in truth, we need not go to <hi>supernatural
Events,</hi> or to <hi>particular Providences</hi> for the Truth
of this: For, in my Opinion, the daily effects that
every one of us sees and feels; the very Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of the World for so many Ages, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
frame that it was at first; and the fair Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Encouragement (how unequally soever
things seem to be distributed) which virtuous and
religious men have always found in it, and do yet
find, notwithstanding that far the greatest number
of men are of another stamp: I say, these very
things seem an Argument beyond exception, That
there is a God that presides over us, and takes care
of us.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Fourthly</hi> and lastly, God has yet given us a
further Proof of this, by his own many Authentick
Declarations in the Holy Scriptures (which we
call his <hi>Word.</hi>)</p>
            <p>One of the main businesses of which is, to assure
us, That <hi>He rules in the kingdoms of men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 17.</note> and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
of all their Affairs.</p>
            <p>There He is set forth as the Author of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
both good and bad;<note place="margin">Amo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 6.</note> so that <hi>no evil happens
in a City, but the Lord doth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There He is represented as the <hi>searcher of all
hearts,</hi> the Judge of all mens Designs and Actions,
the Avenger of all Evil Practices, and the Refuge
of all Good Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52754:10"/>
There we are told,<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 16</note> that <hi>He is the God of battels,</hi>
and that <hi>no King is saved by the multitude of his armies,
nor any mighty man delivered by his own strength: but
salvation is from the Lord.</hi> And so are Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
also.</p>
            <p>There we are assured,<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 14</note> that <hi>He from his habitation
looketh down upon all that dwell on the earth. He fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioneth
the hearts of them; he understandeth all their
ways.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 19. 21</note> 
               <hi>And though many are the devices that are in their
hearts, yet it is his counsel only that shall stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, it is God (as the Apostle tells us)
that <hi>worketh all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 11.</note> and he worketh them all <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the counsel of his own will.</hi> So that nothing
comes by chance, nothing is done in vain; but all
Events are in pursuance of a Design.</p>
            <p>Nay, not so much as the Event of casting a Lot
(which seems the most fortuitous contingent thing
in the whole World) is left at random: For even
in that Case <hi>the disposal of the Lot</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells
us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33.) <hi>is from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is not only the Doctrine, but in a great
measure the very Language and Expression of those
Holy Books. And, what can we desire more?
Or, what words can we invent that shall declare
more fully the thing we are speaking of?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52754:10"/>
None can that I know of, except perhaps those of
our Saviour, with which I shall shut up this point.
<hi>Fear not,</hi> (saith he to his Disciples) <hi>Are not two sparrows
sold for a farthing?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 10. 29</note> 
               <hi>yet not one of them falls to the
ground without the will of your Father. Nay, I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</hi>
O wonderful this! what! God Almighty num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the very Hairs of our Heads! <hi>Lord, what is
man, that thou shouldst have such respect unto him,</hi> and
do that for him which even the <hi>nicest</hi> and most
<hi>delicate</hi> of Men never yet did for themselves? But
thus art thou pleased to express thy particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Sons of Men. Thus art thou pleased
to let us see, that none of us are so inconsiderable,
but that we are within the Verge of thy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Objects of thy Care. And therefore
much more are <hi>Cities,</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> so,
wherein the Fortunes of so many Individuals are
wrapt up.</p>
            <p>O, blessed be God for his Love to Mankind.
O, for ever adored be his Name for thus humbling
himself to take notice of us and our Affairs, and
likewise for giving us such abundant Assurance that
He doth so. Since therefore we have such migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Evidence of all sorts, that <hi>the Lord is King, let the
earth be glad: yea, let the multitude of the isles be glad
thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52754:11"/>
And we shall still see greater reason thus to be
<hi>glad,</hi> if we consider a little more particularly the
<hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> by which God administers the
Affairs of his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> Which are not, as too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
happens in <hi>Human</hi> Governments, Arbitrary
<hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Humour,</hi> but perfect <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi>
and <hi>Goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' it be true what the Psalmist saith, That
<hi>Whatsoever the Lord pleaseth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 135. 6</note> 
               <hi>that doth he in Heaven
and in Earth, and in the Sea and all deep places:</hi> Yet
it is as true, that the Lord will never be pleased to
do any thing, either in Heaven or in Earth, but
what is suggested by Infinite <hi>Goodness,</hi> and in such
ways as are the Result of Infinite <hi>Wisdom.</hi> For, as
the same <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, <hi>He loveth righteousness and
judgment;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 33. 5.</note> 
               <hi>the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.
He is holy in all his ways, and righteous in all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 145. 17, 9.</note>
               <hi>and his tender mercies are over all his works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To say, That God deals <hi>arbitrarily</hi> with any of
his Creatures; or, that He dispenseth <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi>
to them meerly <hi>because He will,</hi> without any other
Reason, is in truth to disparage His Nature, and
gives us such a notion of Him, as we have perhaps
of some of the <hi>Great Monarchs</hi> of the World, but
whom we are far from esteeming the <hi>Best Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52754:11"/>
No certainly, if we Mankind find in our selves,
that the wiser and better we grow, the less are we
led by <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and the more do we shake
off our Indifferency to <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and the
more steadily do we cleave to the eternal Laws
of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> in all our Actions: We
may be sure that <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi>
and <hi>Goodness</hi> it self, can never in any of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Dealings with his Creatures, depart from
these Principles.</p>
            <p>The true Scheme of God Almighty's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is plainly this.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Infinite Mind</hi> clearly understood all the <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities</hi>
of things long before they were in <hi>actual
being.</hi> He knew what things were possible to be;
and how they would act if they were put into being;
and what the Events of all their Actings would be.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Infinite Goodness</hi> moved him to put into <hi>actual
being</hi> every thing that he saw was <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>Be;</hi> and
to give them all those <hi>powers of Action</hi> that they have;
and withal, to look after them so, as that both they
and all their Motions and Actions should at last be
to the Praise and Glory of the same <hi>Goodness</hi> that
first enclined him to create them.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> contrived the Methods in
which all this should be brought to pass, and so laid
the <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Platform</hi> of things, that nothing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52754:12"/>
could happen in the whole Creation, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World to the end thereof, (tho' it
was in it self never so bad, never so mischievous)
but what both might and should be so ordered, as
to be subservient to that end.</p>
            <p>And lastly, The <hi>Scheme</hi> of Things being thus
laid, His <hi>Infinite Power</hi> first produced <hi>All things,</hi> and
still upholds <hi>All things,</hi> and from time to time, in
their several seasons, actually brings to pass <hi>every
thing,</hi> according to the Determinations of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Wisdom.</hi> And tho' it doth it in ways secret to us,
yet it doth it certainly and surely, and withal, most
easily and gently, with the least violence to the
establish'd <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and without any force
at all upon the <hi>Free Wills</hi> of <hi>Intelligent Beings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I say, is the Account that both <hi>Reason</hi> and
<hi>Scripture</hi> give us of God's Making and Governing
the World. Infinite <hi>Knowledge</hi> is the Foundation
of <hi>All.</hi> Infinite <hi>Goodness</hi> is the Author and Mover
of <hi>All.</hi> Infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> is the Contriver and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
of <hi>All.</hi> And Infinite <hi>Power</hi> executes <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Admit now these Principles, and see what will
follow from them.</p>
            <p>It will follow from hence, in the <hi>first</hi> place, that
every Event that happens in the World, <hi>is beautiful
in its season;</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> expresses it. That is to
say, How unaccountable soever it may appear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52754:12"/>
to us, yet there is a good Reason to be given, both
why it happens at all, and likewise why it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
at that <hi>time,</hi> and with those <hi>circumstances</hi> that
it doth. It helps to adorn the Great <hi>Drama</hi> and
Contrivance of God's Providence, and ministers
to excellent Ends, tho' we poor Creatures do little
apprehend how it makes for them. As indeed it
is impossible we should, unless we had the whole
<hi>Comprehension</hi> of <hi>Things</hi> in our Minds, and saw the
<hi>entire Scheme</hi> of God's Government, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the end. This must needs be so, if we
be Govern'd by <hi>Infinite Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It follows from hence, that both <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Evil</hi> are measured to Mankind according to
their respective Capacities. If we be fit for Good,
Good will come. If we deserve Punishment, we
must expect that likewise. For, <hi>All God's ways are
equal,</hi> tho' <hi>Ours be unequal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore it is the most unreasonable thing
in the World to impute our Successes, whether they
be Good or Bad, so wholly to the <hi>immediate Hands</hi>
that managed our Affairs, as not in the first place
to take notice of the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>There is a Divine Power that governs all these
matters. And tho' it be true, that no Misfortune,
no ill Success ever happens, but there is a <hi>Human</hi>
Reason to be given for it; it may be found out
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52754:13"/>
upon what occasion, or by what neglect, or thro'
what ill management that Misfortune happened:
Yet it is as true, that if those that managed for
us had the Wisdom, and the Conduct, and the
Strength of the very Angels of God, yet their
Endeavours would not be effectual, for the making
us happy, unless we our selves were in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of being so, by being proper Objects of God's
Mercy and Favour. This must likewise be true,
if perfect <hi>Iustice</hi> govern the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It follows from hence, that even the
severer Dispensations of God's Providence toward
us; the things we complain of, and are uneasie
under; our very <hi>Calamities,</hi> and <hi>Misfortunes,</hi> and
<hi>Disappointments;</hi> even these are the effects of <hi>God's
Kindness,</hi> tho' at the same time they may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Instances of His <hi>Iustice.</hi> That is to say, they
are meant really for our <hi>Good,</hi> and will prove so, if
we make that use of them we should do.</p>
            <p>The very Nature of God is to do all <hi>Good,</hi> at all
<hi>Times,</hi> to all his <hi>Creatures.</hi> For, He had no other
End in making them, nor has he any other End
in looking after them. But God cannot do good
to All in the same way. <hi>Correction,</hi> and <hi>Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and <hi>Punishment</hi> is in some cases more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for the bringing People to Rights, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
their true Interests, than the giving them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52754:13"/>
all that their own Hearts can wish. In such cases
therefore God must deal with his Creatures as
every wise Parent deals with his Children. And
tho' <hi>these chastisements</hi> (as the Apostle tell us) <hi>are</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11</note>
               <hi>not joyous, but grievous,</hi> yet are they designed for
<hi>the bringing forth the peaceable fruits of righteousness
in all them that are exercised thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, we do not know what is good for
our selves. We often wish for things, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
if our wishes were granted, would undo us.
But our Happiness is, that God <hi>knows</hi> all, and so
<hi>tempers</hi> all, that all Events, even those that we are
apt to look upon as the greatest Judgments, shall at
last appear most visibly to have been the wisest
methods that could possibly have been contrived
for the doing the <hi>Greatest Good</hi> to us. And if
they do not succeed accordingly, it will be our own
fault.</p>
            <p>This must likewise needs be true, if perfect
<hi>Goodness</hi> govern All: For even <hi>Iustice</hi> it self is but
a different way of expressing <hi>Goodness.</hi> And all
that which we call <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Vengeance</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable,
unless it serve for the <hi>doing Good</hi> to the
World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Lastly; From hence it follows,
that all Events whatsoever, that ever did, or do, or
shall happen in the World, either with respect to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52754:14"/>
Nations, and Kingdoms, or with respect to particular
Persons, are really the <hi>Best</hi> that could or can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
And if things were ordered otherwise, it
would not be so <hi>well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A strange <hi>Paradox</hi> you will say this is; that not
only the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> and <hi>Calamities</hi> that fall upon
Mankind, but even their <hi>Faults</hi> and <hi>Mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
nay, their very <hi>Sins and Wickednesses,</hi> should
be for the best. But really so it is, and so it must
be, if both Infinite <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>
govern the World.</p>
            <p>Not but that a particular man's <hi>Sins</hi> may be the
occasion of his <hi>Ruin,</hi> nay, and certainly <hi>will</hi> be so,
if he persist in them.</p>
            <p>And likewise the Faults of a <hi>People</hi> may and will
have such an ill influence upon the <hi>Community,</hi> as if
they be not amended, the Desolation of the Nation
may at <hi>last</hi> ensue thereupon.</p>
            <p>But still, tho' every thing that happens do not
prove for the <hi>Good</hi> of that particular <hi>Person,</hi> or that
particular <hi>People,</hi> that is immediately concerned in
the Event; yet it will certainly prove for the
<hi>General Vniversal Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that take all the whole <hi>Series</hi> of Events to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her,
that have or shall come to pass all the
World over, we may undoubtedly affirm, that All
things have been as well managed, as it is possible
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52754:14"/>
they could be, and will be so to the end of the
World. And this we our selves shall be satisfied
of, when we come to be in a condition of making
a just estimate of things.</p>
            <p>For indeed, to suppose otherwise, is to say, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> doth not act so <hi>wisely</hi> as it
might do; or, that <hi>Perfect Goodness</hi> might <hi>do</hi> more
<hi>Good</hi> than it does do; or, lastly, that <hi>Omnipotent
Power</hi> cannot do every thing that is <hi>possible.</hi> All
which Suppositions are plainly absurd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious.</p>
            <p>And now, if all these things be true (as they
certainly are) how <hi>natural</hi> is the conclusion of my
Text? Since <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>King</hi> of all the World, and
such a <hi>King</hi> likewise, that the <hi>Measures</hi> of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
are exact <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;</hi>
what have all Mankind to do, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Good Men,</hi> but to <hi>Rejoyce and be glad?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s Inference from this Doctrin.
And this is the present Business of the Day: And
therefore let us all practise accordingly. That is
the only <hi>Application</hi> I desire to make of what hath
been said.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Two</hi> ways we ought to express our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52754:15"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> In a hearty sense of all God's <hi>past</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Mercies</hi> to us, and an actual giving Him
our Thanks for the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In a cheerful dependance upon Him
for his <hi>Future</hi> Blessings. Give me leave to
speak a little to these two Points, and I have
done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let us be heartily sensible of All God's
<hi>Kindness</hi> to us, both <hi>past</hi> and <hi>present,</hi> and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
thank Him for the same.</p>
            <p>It is very remarkable, that not only <hi>David,</hi> but
the <hi>Prophets</hi> likewise, when they are treating of
God's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> call upon the <hi>Isles</hi> in a particular
manner to take notice of it; [See <hi>Isa.</hi> xxiv. 15.
xlii. 4, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] as here in my Text, <hi>Let the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the isles be glad thereof:</hi> As if the <hi>Isles</hi> in a
more peculiar manner were to have a share in the
Blessings of his Government. And, no doubt, it
was so intended, and accordingly hath so come to
pass. For, it is the <hi>Isles of the Gentiles,</hi> by which
Name the Scripture expresseth those Countries
that were at the greatest distance from the <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
of <hi>Iudea;</hi> I say, it is these <hi>Isles,</hi> which now at
this day (God's ancient People the <hi>Iews</hi> being
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52754:15"/>
for their <hi>Infidelity</hi> long ago rejected) are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Seat of his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and to which
He vouchsafeth the Light of his Gospel, and the
Means of Salvation; so true is God to all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>But now, of all the <hi>Isles of the Gentiles,</hi> if any
one above the rest hath felt the benign and gracious
Influences of the <hi>LORD</hi>'s being our <hi>King,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>Ours</hi> is that <hi>Island.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How wonderfully bountiful hath God been to
us in a continued succession of <hi>Publick Blessings,</hi> even
from the first beginning of Time, that we have had
any Memorials of Events among us?</p>
            <p>We had the Happiness to be early made a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and by that means were
trained up to <hi>Civility,</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That made way for the greatest Blessing that
Heaven could bestow upon us, even the receiving
<hi>Christianity:</hi> And that Blessing we had with the
most early, being the first among the Nations that
embraced it.</p>
            <p>When through the just Judgment of God, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism</hi>
and <hi>Ignorance</hi> overspread the face of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and by the occasion thereof <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
made its way, and all the <hi>Western</hi> Kingdoms
gave up their Power to a Foreign Usurper; even
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52754:16"/>
then this <hi>Island</hi> made the longest stand; nay, and
was never so perfectly subdued, but that <hi>Popery</hi>
was here a different thing, from what it was in the
<hi>Southern</hi> Climates.</p>
            <p>When the happy time came, that God thought
fit to set on foot the <hi>Reformation,</hi> (having first
made way for it, by the restoring of <hi>Learning</hi>)
such was His particular Care of us, that this was
one of the <hi>first</hi> Kingdoms that was brought over
to it.</p>
            <p>And we have this Advantage above all other
<hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> that as our <hi>Reformation</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
made, and by just Authority, so it was
made most agreeably to the Pattern of the Primitive
Churches of Christ.</p>
            <p>And, God be thanked, according to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it, such hath been its Success ever since;
for we have all-along, from that time to this, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the interruption of a few Years in the late
Times) served God in Peace and Happiness, under
the same Establishment. And we trust we shall
do so to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Many indeed have been the Oppositions and
Disturbances, that have been given us by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
both at home and abroad; but as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
likewise have been our Deliverances, and that
in a most wonderful manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52754:16"/>
I need not mention them, for they are known
to us all.</p>
            <p>How many <hi>Secret</hi> Conspiracies against our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> hath <hi>God Almighty</hi>'s Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
detected and defeated?</p>
            <p>How many <hi>Open</hi> Attempts against our <hi>Laws</hi> and
against our <hi>Religion</hi> hath He by strange Providences
brought to nought?</p>
            <p>More than once hath He by wonderful methods
preserved us, when we gave up our <hi>Church</hi> and our
<hi>Liberties</hi> in a manner as lost, and that in so easie
and quiet a way, that there was no concussion of
the Nation followed thereupon.</p>
            <p>Are not these <hi>Extraordinary Instances</hi> of God's
Kindness to a People? And, ought not we, who
have receiv'd, and do yet enjoy the <hi>Benefit</hi> and the
<hi>Comfort</hi> of them, to remember them with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
all the Days of our Life?</p>
            <p>But some of us, perhaps, are not now in a <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
to think of these things; our present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
fill our Minds, and <hi>Those</hi> are difficult
enough. Let our <hi>past</hi> Deliverances have been
what they will, yet we are sure we are now in a
Hazardous Condition, notwithstanding all the
Prayers we have put up for better Successes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52754:17"/>
That is too true: And I pray God make us all
sensible of it; and especially make us sensible of
the things that have caused it, namely, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
for God's former Mercies; our Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Debauchery; the Spirit of Atheism and
Prophaneness, and Irreligion, that still reigns
among us as much as ever; and above all, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
dividing our selves into Parties, and
pursuing particular <hi>Piques</hi> and <hi>Quarrels,</hi> not only
to the <hi>neglect,</hi> but to the plain <hi>ruine</hi> of our common
Interests.</p>
            <p>These are the things that have hinder'd our
Successes, and provoked God's Displeasure against
us; and till these things be amended, I am afraid,
we shall never be a happy Nation.</p>
            <p>But yet, notwithstanding our high Provocations,
yet so gently hath God corrected us, and even in
his <hi>Iudgments</hi> so much hath He remembred <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
that we have all reason to rejoyce at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
and Kindness of His Dispensations towards
us; nay, and to render Him our most hearty and
solemn Thanks, for the Mercies that He hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon us, even with respect to the Matters
we complain of.</p>
            <p>For God hath really so far heard our Prayers
this Year, that He hath given us the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Successes, tho' not the Successes we desir'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52754:17"/>
He hath kept the <hi>War</hi> at a distance from us;
and we have, under the Happy Government of
<hi>Her Majesty,</hi> lived free from all Disturbance at
home; every man <hi>sitting under his own Vine, and
his own Fig-tree,</hi> (as the Prophet speaks) enjoying
his Religion and Rights in perfect Peace; and with
a bountiful Provision likewise, from God's Hand,
of all the Things that were either needful or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
            <p>And as for our Successes abroad, tho' it is not
proper for me to talk of those matters, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
thus much I may decently and truly say,
That tho' the <hi>King</hi> had not the <hi>Victory,</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
by <hi>Numbers;</hi> yet he gained more <hi>Honour,</hi>
and sustained less <hi>Loss</hi> than those that boasted of
the <hi>Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And which is yet more, God hath not only
<hi>Preserved</hi> his <hi>Person,</hi> amidst the infinite Hazards
he was continually exposed to, and <hi>Returned</hi> him
<hi>safe</hi> to us, but returned him likewise with such
Reputation for his <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>Vigilance,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi>
in the Difficulties he had to struggle with, as
hath gained him the <hi>highest Esteem</hi> among his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
and therefore ought much more to <hi>endear</hi>
him to his own <hi>Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52754:18"/>
And now, let all this be considered, and then
let any man say, that really loves the Interest of his
Country, whether we have not reason to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these things as <hi>Great Blessings;</hi> and as such, to
return our Solemn Thanks to God for them.</p>
            <p>And then, in the <hi>Second</hi> place, as to our <hi>Future
Successes,</hi> let us all cheerfully depend upon God's
Providence, and trust in his Mercy for them.</p>
            <p>This is all the <hi>Rejoycing</hi> that we can express as
to Future things; and this is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
calls <hi>Rejoycing in Hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely great Reason have we thus to do,
when we consider who it is that orders our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
One, whose <hi>Kindness</hi> we have no reason to
doubt of, having had so many Experiences of it,
even beyond our Hopes and Expectations: And
One likewise upon whose <hi>Power</hi> we may securely
depend, since <hi>His Arm is not shortened,</hi> nor ever can
be, how much soever our <hi>Arm of Flesh</hi> may.</p>
            <p>God Almighty is our <hi>King,</hi> and He both cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>knows,</hi> and will certainly <hi>do,</hi> that which is
<hi>best</hi> for us, provided we take care to do that which
becomes <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Away therefore with all <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Distrust,</hi> and
<hi>Despondency;</hi> it is an Argument of <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion,</hi>
as well as <hi>Cowardise,</hi> to <hi>despair of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52754:18"/>
We are in as good Hands as it is possible for us
to be: Nay, we our selves cannot wish to be in
any other.</p>
            <p>Let but us do our Parts, by qualifying our selves
for God's Mercies; and that is to be done by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
our best Endeavours, every man in his
Place and Station, to the Service of the Publick;
and then we may safely <hi>cast all our care upon him who
careth for us,</hi> and we may be sure we shall not be
disappointed.</p>
            <p>This Method, as it is much more easie, so we
shall find it much more conducing towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Successes we desire, than <hi>Complaining,</hi>
and <hi>Fretfulness,</hi> and a tormenting <hi>Anxiety</hi> about
our Affairs.</p>
            <p>We may indeed, by our <hi>Peevish</hi> and <hi>Querulous
Humour,</hi> disquiet our selves, and put others into a
<hi>Ferment,</hi> nay, and at last, perhaps, may contribute
a great deal to the <hi>Glory</hi> of hindering and defeating
the most wise Counsels that are proposed for our
<hi>Safety;</hi> but that is the greatest Point we gain.</p>
            <p>God Almighty will not alter his Methods for
any of our foolish <hi>Passions;</hi> but there is a way to
prevail upon God himself, to do for us all that our
own Hearts can desire, provided that which we
desire be good for us; and that way is, to <hi>own</hi>
Him and his Government; to <hi>love</hi> him, and to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52754:19"/>
               <hi>serve</hi> him; to be <hi>thankful</hi> for his Mercies; to be
<hi>easie</hi> and <hi>cheerful</hi> under all his Dispensations to us;
and lastly, to referr our selves entirely to his Wise
Counsels, and to <hi>trust</hi> in his <hi>Mercy</hi> for all that is to
come.</p>
            <p>Great indeed, and wonderful, are the Promises
that are made to those that put their <hi>Trust</hi> in <hi>God.
Cursed</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>be the man that trusteth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 5.</note>
               <hi>in man, and maketh flesh his arm:</hi> But, <hi>Blessed is he
that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.
Many sorrows</hi> (saith the <hi>Psalmist) shall be to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 10</note>
               <hi>but whose trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall embrace
him on every side.</hi> And again, <hi>O taste and see, how</hi>
               <note place="margin">34. 8.</note>
               <hi>gracious the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusteth in
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If now we believe these things, (and if we be
Christians, we do and must believe them) consider
I beseech you, the <hi>Vse</hi> we are to make of them.</p>
            <p>What have we All to do? Let our late <hi>Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments</hi>
have put us into never so bad a Humour;
let our present <hi>Circumstances</hi> be entangled with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so many <hi>Difficulties;</hi> yet what have we All to
do, but to <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in GOD, and to <hi>Trust</hi> in his
Mercy?</p>
            <p>All is well, and All will be well for ever to
them that Love <hi>God,</hi> and put their Trust in Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52754:19"/>
Sing we therefore unto the Lord a new song: let the
congregation of saints praise him. Let <hi>Israel</hi> rejoyce in
him that made him: and let the children of <hi>Sion</hi> be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in their King. God is the King of all the earth, let
us sing praises with understanding. The Lord hath
pleasure in his people: he will for ever help the meek
hearted: for his delight is in them that fear him, and
that put their trust in his mercy. He is our help and
strength, a very present help in Trouble: therefore will
we not fear, though the earth be moved, and though the
hills be carried into the midst of the sea: Though the
waters thereof rage and swell, and the mountains shake at
the tempest of the same. Even, <hi>in that case,</hi> the rivers
of the flood thereof shall make glad the city of God. <hi>All
the Blusterings and Storms that threaten</hi> God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>shall turn to their Advantage, and shall really at
length prove matter of rejoycing to them, how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and dreadful soever they appeared at first:
For, as it there follows,</hi> God is in the midst of her,
therefore shall she not be removed: God will help her,
and that right early. <hi>God will be with his Church,
and will deliver his People whenever it is proper
and seasonable so to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52754:20"/>
Nay, let the <hi>Worst</hi> come; tho' we were reduced
even to the utmost Extremities; which yet, <hi>God</hi> be
thanked, we neither are, nor, I hope, ever shall
be; yet even, in that Cafe, the Consideration that
<hi>God is our King,</hi> ought not only to support us, but
to fill us with <hi>Ioy.</hi> Even in that Case every <hi>Good
Man</hi> should bear his <hi>part</hi> in the <hi>Song</hi> of the Prophet
<hi>Habakkuk,</hi> (3. 17.) with which I conclude.</p>
            <p>Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall
fruit be in the vine: Although the labour of the olive
shall fail; and the fields shall yield no meat: Although
the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there be no
herd in the stalls; yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will
joy in the God of my salvation.</p>
