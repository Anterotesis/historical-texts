         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

complaints, articles,
and informations presented
first to the Lords of His

Next, to His sacred Majestie; and last from time to time

for satisfaction of our most just desires, Our zeale
to remove all rubs out of the way, which were either
mentioned unto us, or could be conceaved by us, as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances
of our pious intentions, aiming at nothing
but the good of the Kingdome, and preservation of
the Kirk, which by consumption or combustion is
liklie to expire; delighting to use no other meanes
but such as are legall, and have beene ordinarie in
this Kirk, since the reformation, and labouring ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our power and interesse, that all things might
<pb facs="tcp:150:3"/>
be caried in a peaceable manner worthie of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Covenant, Our Protestation containing a
heartie thanksgiving for what his Majestie in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
from his justice had granted of our just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
and our Protests and hopes for somuch as was
not as yet granted. All these made us confidentlie
to expect from his Majesties royall and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
disposition towards this his native kingdome,
that a free generall assemblie, and parliament should
have beene indicted, as the ordinare and most proper
remedies of our greevances, and did constraine us to
renew our petition, earnestlie intreating, that His
Majesties Commissionar, would be pleased to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto His Majestie the condition of this Kirk and
kingdome, crying in an extreame exigencie for present
helpe, with the lawfulnesse of the remedies prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Majesties lawes, required by us, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him in some particular articles, which his
Grace promised to recommend to his Maiestie, and
to doe his best indeavours for obtaining the same;
especiallie the first article, that there might bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
a full and free generall assemblie, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitation,
either in the constitution and members
thereof, in the order and manner of proceeding, or
in the matters to be treated: and if there should be
any question or doubt about one of these, or such like
particulars, that the determination thereof might bee
remitted to the assemblie it self, as the only proper
and competent judge. And now after so many su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
complaints, articles, and informations, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our necessarie protestation, expressing the humble
thankfulnesse and continued desires of our hearts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so long expectation and so much dealing, having
<pb facs="tcp:150:3"/>
with open ears, and attentive mindes heard his Majesties
proclamation, it is our desire, purpose, and endevour
so to proceede, that we may upon the one part still
be thankfull to God, and the King, for the least blinke
of His Majesties countenance, and the smallest crums
of comfort that fall unto us from His Majesties roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
hands, beseeching the Lord, yet further to enlarge
his Majesties heart, for our full satisfaction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceing
to the honour of God, the good of this kirk
and kingdome, and his Majesties never dying fame and
glorie, that his wife government &amp; zeal to the service
of God, may be a measure and patern of desires to
all generations heereafter, when they shall bee wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a religious and righteous King. And on the
other part, that Christ our Lord, the King of kings,
through our neglect or lukewarmnesse, may want no
part of his Soveraignitie and Dominion; and that in
our religion, which is more deare unto us then our
lives, we deceive not our selves, with that which can
not satisfie, and make up the breach of this kirk and
kingdome, or remove our feares, doubts, and suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of the innovations of religion: This hath made
us to observe, and perceave, that his Majesties procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
doeth ascribe all the late distractions of this
Kirk and Common-wealth, to our conceaved seares
of the innovation of religion and law, as the cause
and occasion thereof, and not to the innovations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
with which wee have beene for a long time,
and especially of late heavily pressed and grieved, as
if the cause were rather in apprehension and fancie,
then in realitie and substance. That the service book
and book of Canons are not so far discharged by this
proclamation, as they have beene urged by preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:150:4"/>
proclamations; for this proclamation onely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth
the practice of them, and rescinds the actes
made for establishing their practise, but doeth not
rescinde the former proclamations, namely that of the
19. of Februar, at <hi>Stirling,</hi> and that of the fourth of
Julie at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which give an high approbation to
these books, as fit meanes to maintaine religion, and
to beate downe all superstition, and withall, declares
his Majesties purpose, to bring them into this kirk in
a fair and legall way; and thus both our feares, that
they may be introduced heereafter, must still remaine,
and the libertie of the generall Assemblie, by such a
declaration of his Majesties judgement, is not a little
prejudged, in the mindes of so many as wisely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and compare the preceeding proclamations with
this which we now hear, although others who looking
upon one step, and not upon the whole progresse,
run on rashly, and neither considering what they are
doing, nor with whom they are dealing, may bee easily
deceived, <hi>Qui pauca videt, cito judicat,</hi> a short sight
maketh a suddaine judgement.</p>
            <p>That it is declared in this proclamation, that His
Majestie neither intendeth to innovate any thing in
religion or laws, or to admit of any change or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the true religion alreadie established and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in this kingdome: and withall, this is interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that the articles of <hi>Pearth</hi> are established by the
acts of parliament, and generall assemblie, and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of the practice only granted, and discharge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that no person be urged with the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and consequently, His Majesties intention for the
standing of the acts of the Assemblie and Parliament,
appointing the articles of <hi>Pearth,</hi> is manifest, which
<pb facs="tcp:150:4"/>
is no small prejudice to the freedome of the generall
Assemblie, That while the Proclamation ordaineth
all his Majesties subjects to be lyable to the tryall
and censure of the Judicatories competent, and that
none of them shall use any unlimited and unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
power; likewise that no other oath bee admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to Ministers at their entrie, then that which is
conteined in the Act of Parliament, in both these
articles the bishops are meaned, who are only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
for the present curbed, against their exorbitancie
and enormities, in exercing their office; but the office
of bishops is thereby not only presupposed as it que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable,
but also so strongly established, that His
Maiestie declareth for the present his intention, to
admit no innovation therein, which is more evident
by the indiction of the Parliament, warning all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
to bee present, as having voice and place in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
and by the indiction of the assemblie, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all archbishops and bishops (for so are their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
degrees and offices Ecclesiasticall here designed
and supposed) to bee present; as having place and
voice in the Assemblie, contrare to the caveats, acts
of the Kirk, and our declinator; and thus a third and
great limitation is put upon the generall Assemblie.
The Proclamation by reason of these many reall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations,
and preiudices of the libertie of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie
in the very points, which have wrought so
much woe and disturbance in this Kirk and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and wherein the libertie of the Assemblie is
most usefull and necessarie at this time, can neither
satisfie our grievances and complaints, nor remove
our feares and doubts, nor can not without prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
bee admitted by us his Maiesties subiects, who
<pb facs="tcp:150:5"/>
earnestly desire that Trueth and Peace may bee esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
and that for the reasons following,</p>
            <p>1. TO keepe silence in any thing, that may serve
for the good of the Kirk, whether it bee in
preaching, prayer, or in proposing, and voiceing in a
lawfull Assemblie of the Kirk, is against the word of
God, <hi>Esai. 62. 6. Yee that are the Lords remembrance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
keepe not silence, and give him no rest, till he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish,
and till hee make Ierusalem a praise in the earth:</hi>
1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 21. Like the halting of the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two opinions, and their not answering a word,
when the LORD called them to give a testimonie;
<hi>Act. 20. 20. I have keeped backe nothing that was
profitable unto you:</hi> And againe, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. Math.</hi>
15. 18. <hi>Rom. 1. 18. Revel.</hi> 2. 14. 20. and 3. 15, and
therefore to keepe silence, or not to medle with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
whether in doctrine, sacraments, worship,
or discipline, in a generall Assemblie of the Kirk, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened
for that end, were the readie way to move
the Lord to deny his Spirit unto us, and to provoke
him to wrath against our proceedings, and might be
imputed unto us for preiudice, for collusion, and for
betraying our selves, and the posteritie.</p>
            <p>2. This predetermination is against our supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and protestations, wherein wee have showne
our selves so earnest for a free generall Assemblie,
contrare to every limitation of this kinde, so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudging
the libertie thereof, is against the Confession
of Faith, registrated in the Parliament 1567. declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that one cause of the councels of the Kirk is for
good policie and order to bee observed in the Kirk,
and for to change such things as men have devised,
<pb facs="tcp:150:5"/>
when they rather foster superstition then edifie the
Kirk, using the same, and is against our late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
wherein wee have promised to forbeare all
novations till they bee tryed, which obligeth us to
forebeare now, and to trye them in an Assembly &amp;
by all lawfull meanes to labour to recover the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
puriue and libertie of the Gospell to which this
limitation is directly repugnant, our libertie in age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
assembly beeing the principall of all lawfull
meanes serving to that end.</p>
            <p>3, This were directly contrarie to the nature and
ends of a generall assembly, which having authority
from GOD, beeing conveened according to the
lawes of the Kingdome, and receiving power from
the whole collective bodie of the Kirk, for the good
of Religion, and safety of the Kirke; What-so-ever
maye conduce for these good ends in wisedome and
modestie should bee proponed, examined, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
without Prelimitation, either of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be treated, or of the libertie of the members
thereof. It beeing manifest, that as farre as the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
is limited in the matters to bee treated, and
in the members to bee used, the necessarie ends of
the Assembly, and the supreme Law, which is the
safetie of the Kirk, are as farre hindered, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged.</p>
            <p>This limitation is against the Discipline of the Kirk,
which booke 2. chap. 7. declareth this to be one of
her liberties, That the Assembly hath power to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
and abolish all Statuts and ordinances concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ecclesiasticall matters that are found noysome and
unprofitable and agree not with the time, or are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
by the people, and against the acts of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:150:6"/>
assembly. Like as the pretended Assembly 1610.
declareth for the common affaires of the Kirke (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception or limitation) it is necessare that there
bee yearely generall Assemblies, And what order can
bee hoped for heere-after if this assembly indicted
after so long intermission, and so many grosse corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Assembly of the Kirk was, when it was yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observed.</p>
            <p>5. It is ordained in <hi>Parl. 11. act 40. K. Iames</hi>
6. anent the necessare and lawfull forme of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
that nothing shall bee done, or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

prejudge the libertie of free voycing or reasoning
of the Estates, or any of them in time comming.
It is also appointed in <hi>Parl.</hi> 6: <hi>act 92. K. Iames</hi> 6.
that the Lordes of Counsell and Session proceed in
all civill causes intended or depending before them,
or to bee intended, to cause execute their decrees not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

appointing everie matter for its owne judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie,

And therefore much more doeth this libertie belong
to the supreme judicatorie ecclesiastick in matters so

of the soules of the people both now and in the

            <p>6. It were contrare to our Protestations, proceedings
and complaints against the late innovations. And
it might bee accompted an innovation and usurpation
as grosse and dangerous to us, and the posteritie, and
as prejudiciall to Religion as any complained upon
by us, to admitt limitations, and secret or open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations,
which belongeth to no person or judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie,
but to an Asembly, Or to consent to, and
approve by our silence the same praedeterminations It
were to be guiltie of that our selves, which we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne
in others Wee maye easilye judge how the Apostles
before the Counsell of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Fathers bee
fore the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, and our Predecessors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the assembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holden at the Reformation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
would have taken such dealing.</p>
            <p>That this Proclamation commandeth all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Subjects for maintenance of the Religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
established to subscribe and renew the <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Faith</hi> subscribed before in the yeere 1580 and
afterward. And reqyreth the Lords of privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
to take such course anent the same, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Band of Maintenance of the true Religion, and
the Kings person, that it may bee subscribed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
throughout the whole Kingdome with all pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sible
diligence, which cannot now be performed by
us. For although of late wee would have beene
glad that our selves and other his Majesties Subjects
had beene commanded by authoritie to sweare, and
subscribe the generall <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<pb facs="tcp:150:7"/>
errous, and superstitions: and now would bee
glad that all others should joyne with us in our late <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant</hi>
and <hi>Confession,</hi> descending more specially to
the novations and errours of the time, and obliging
us to the defence of Religion; &amp; of the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
person, and authoritie, and for these endes to
the mutuall defence everie one of us of another, Yet
can wee not nowe after so necessarie. and so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
a specification returne to the generall for the
reasons following.</p>
            <p>1. No meanes have beene left unassayed against
our late <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> so solemnely
sworne and subscribed. For first wee were prest
with the rendering and rescinding of our <hi>Covenant.</hi>
Next an alteration in some substantiall pointes was
urged, 3, a Declaration was motioned, which tended
to the enervation thereof, and now wee finde in the
same straine, that wee are put to a new tryall, and
the last meane is used more subtile than the former:
That by this new subscription our late <hi>Covenant,</hi> &amp;
Confession maye bee quite absorbed and buried in
oblivion, that where it was intended and sworne to
bee an everlasting <hi>Covenant</hi> never to bee forgotten,
it shall bee never more remembred, the one shall
bee cryed up, and the other drowned in the noyse
thereof, And thus the new subscription now urged
(although in a different waye) shall prove equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to the rendering of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> or what of
that kinde hath before beene assayed. Like as the
reasons against the rendering of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> doe
militate directly against this new motion.</p>
            <p>3. If we should now enter upon this new Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
wee would thinke our selves guiltie of mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:150:7"/>
God, and taking his Name in vaine, for the tears
that began to be poured forth at the solemnizing of the
<hi>Covenant</hi> are not yet dryed up &amp; wyped away, &amp; the
joyfull noyse which then began to sound hath not yet
ceased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there can bee no new necessitie from us,
and upon our part pretended for a ground of ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
this new subscription, at first intended to be an
abjuration of Popery upon us who are knowne to hate
poperie with an unfained hatred, and have all this
yeere bygone given large testimonie of our zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. As wee are not to multiply miracles upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Gods part, so ought wee not to multiplie solemne
oathes and Covenants upon our part, and thus to
play with oathes, as children doe with their toyes,
without necessitie.</p>
            <p>3. Neither would wee in giving way to this new
subscription think our selves free of perjurie: for as
wee were driven by an undeclinable necessitie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a mutuall <hi>Covenant,</hi> so are wee bound, not
onely by the law of GOD and nature, but by our
solemne oath and subscription, against all divisive
motions to promove and observe the same without
violation: and it is most manifest, that having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
refused to render, alter, or destroye our <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
nothing can bee more contrarie and adverse
to our pious intentions and sincere resolutions, than
to consent to such a subscription and oath, as both
in the intention of the urgers, and in the nature and
condition of the matter urged, is the readie waye
to extinguish, and to drowne in oblivion the Band
of our union and conjunction that they bee no more
remembred. In this case we are called to lay seriously
to our hearts. 1, That wee have sworne that wee
<pb facs="tcp:150:8"/>
shall neither directly, nor iudirectly suffer our selves
to bee divided and with-drawne from this blessed &amp;
loyall conjunction, which consisteth not only in the
generall Confession but also in our explanation, and
application thereof, but on the contrarie, shall by
all lawfull meanes, labour to further and promove
the same. 2. That our union and conjunction may
bee observed without violation, (and so without
mutilation of our application) wee call the living
LORD to witnesse, as wee shall answere to Christ
in the great Day, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. This new subscription, in stead of performing
our vowes, would be a reall testimonie and confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before the World, That wee have beene trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours
in making rash vowes, that wee repent our
selves of former zeale and fordwardnesse against the
particulars exprest first in our Supplications, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and Protestations, &amp; next abjured in our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
that wee in our iudgment prefer the general
Confession unto this, which necessarly was now made
more speciall; &amp; that we are now under the fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
and honest cover of a new oath recanting and
undoing that, which upon so mature deliberation
wee have beene doing before, This beside all other
evills, were to make waye and open a doore to the
re-entry of the particulars abjured, and to repent
our selves of our chiefest consolations, and to lie
both against God and our owne soules.</p>
            <p>5. It hath beene often objected, that our <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of faith,</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> was unlawfull, because
it wanted the warrants of publick authoritie, and it
hath beene answered by us, that wee were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of the warrant civill and ecclesiasticall which
<pb facs="tcp:150:8"/>
authorized the former <hi>Covenant.</hi> And although
wee could have wished that his Majestie had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
both his subscription and authoritie unto it,
yet the lesse constraint from authoritie and the
more libertie, the lesse hypocrisie, and more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
hath appeared: But by this new subscription
urged by authoritie wee both condemne our former
subscription as unlawfull. because alleadged to bee
done without authoritie, and precondemne also the
lyke laudable course in the like necessitie to bee taken
by the posteritie,</p>
            <p>6. What is the use of merch-stones upon borders of
Lands, the like use hath <hi>Confessions of Faith</hi> in the
Kirke, To disterminate and divide betwixt Trueth and
errour: and the renewing and applying of <hi>Confessions of
Faith</hi> to the present errours and corruptions, are not
unlike ryding of merches And therfore to content our
selves with the generall, and ro returne to it, from the
particulare application of the Confession necessarlye
made upon the invasion or creeping in of errours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the borders of the Kirke, if it bee not a removeing
of the merch stone from the owne place, It is at least
the hyding of the merch in the ground that it bee not
seene, which at this time were verie unseasonable for
two causes. One is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because Poperie is so pregnant,
and powerfull in this land, as wee have learned of late.</p>
            <p>The other, because the Papists who upon the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the <hi>Service booke,</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
of our returne to <hi>Rome,</hi> will upon this our subscription
aryse from their dispareing of us, unto their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
presumption. None of us will denye, but the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Confessionn of Faith</hi> registrated in the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doeth by consequence containe this short con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb facs="tcp:150:9"/>
and abjuration: Yet were it not sufficient against
Poperye to subscribe the one without the other. how
then shall wee thinke that the more generall Confession
and abjuration at this time, when the urging of such
Popish books hath extorted from us so necessarie an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
and doth still call for a testimonie, to bee
compleet eneugh without it.</p>
            <p>7. The Papists shall heereby bee occasioned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
their old objection against us, <hi>Annuas &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struas
sides de Deo decernunt.</hi> That our Faith chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the Moone, or once in the yeere. Other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Kirkes might justly wonder at our inconstancie
in changing our <hi>Confession</hi> without any reall necessitie,
&amp; that in one &amp; the same yere it commeth forth larger,
&amp; more particulare, then shorter, and more generall: and
our Adversaries will not faile to traduce us as troublers
of the peace of the Kirke and Kingdome without anye
necessar cause.</p>
            <p>8. It will likewise prove a confirmation of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
who think they maye both subscribe the <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Faith,</hi> and receive the <hi>Service booke,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi>
which is not onely a direct scandaling of them,
but also a readie waye to put a weapon in their
hands against our selves, who maintaine and professe
that these and such other evills are abjured in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith.</p>
            <p>9. It wee should now sweare this Confession wee
should bee obliged by our oath to maintaine <hi>Perth</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
which are the innovations already introduced
in the worship of God, and to maintaine Episco pacie,
with the civill places, and power of Kirkmen. Because
wee are bound to sweare this <hi>Confession</hi> by vertue of
and conforme unto the Kings command signed by his
sacred Majestie of the date September 9. 1638.
<pb facs="tcp:150:9"/>
(These are the very words subjoined to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Band, and prefixed to the Subscriptions)
and it cannot bee denyed, but any oath ministred
unto us, must either bee refused; or else taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the known minde, professed intention, and
expresse command of Authoritie urging the same: And
it is most manifest, that His Majesties minde, intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Commandement, is no other, but that the
Confession bee sworne, fot the maintenance of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as it is alreadie or presently professed, (these
two being coincident, altogether one and the same,
not only in our common forme of speaking, but in
all His Maiesties proclamations) and thus as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth,
and conteineth within the compasse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the foresaids novations and Episcopacie, which
under that name were also ratified, in the first Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
holden by his Maiestie. And where it may be
objected, that the Counsellours have subscribed the
Confession of Faith, as it was professed 1580. and
will not urge the Subscription in an other sense upon
the Subjects. We answere, First, the Act of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
containing that declaration, is not as yet publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Proclamation. Secondly, if it were so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
it behooved of necessitie either be repugnant
to His Majesties declared Judgement and Command,
which is more not to sweare without warrand from
Authoritie (a fault although unjustly often objected
unto us) or else wee must affirme the Religion in
the yeare 1580. and at this time to bee altogether
one and the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus must acknowledge, that
there is no novation of Religion, which were a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
contradiction to that we have sworn. 3. By ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the Proclamation anent the Oath to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
<pb facs="tcp:150:10"/>
to Ministers, according to the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which is to sweare simple obedience to the
Diocesan Bishop, and by warning all Archbishops
and Bishops to bee present; as having voice and place
in the Assemblie: They seeme to determine, that in
their Judgement the Confession of Faith, as it was
professed 1580. doeth consist with Episcopacie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Wee by our oath have referred the tryall of this
or any other question of that kinde to the generall
Assemblie and Parliament.</p>
            <p>10. This Subscription and oath in the minde and
intention of authoritie, and consequently in our swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, may consist with the corruptions of the
Service book and Canons, which wee have abjured
as other heads of Poperie: For both this present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
and his Majesties former proclamations at
<hi>Linlithgow, Striveling, Edinburgh;</hi> The Lords of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
Counsell in their approbation of the same; and
the prelates and doctors who stand for the Service
book and Canons, Doe all speake plainly, or import
so much, That these bookes are not repugnant to the
Confession of Faith, and that the introduceing of
them is no novation of religion or law: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must either refuse to subscribe now, or we
must confesse contrarie to our late Oath, and to a
cleare Trueth, that the Service booke and Canons
are no innovations in Religion. And, although the
present bookes bee discharged by proclamation, yet
if wee shall by any deed of our owne testifie, that
they may consist with our Confession of Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a very short time, either the same books, or some
other like unto them, with some small change, may
bee obtruded upon us, who by Our abjuration
<pb facs="tcp:150:10"/>
(if wee adhere unto it) have fred both our selves,
and the posteritie of all such corruptions, and have
laide a faire foundation for the pure worship of God
in all time coming.</p>
            <p>11. Although there be indeed no substantiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene that which Wee have subscribed,
and the Confession subscribed 1580. more then there
is betweene that which is hid, and that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.
A march stone hid in the ground, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
betwixt the hand closed and open, betwixt
a sword scheathed and drawn, or betwixt the large
Confession, registrat in the Acts of Parliament, and
the short Confession, or (if we may with reverence
ascend yet higher) betweene the Old Testament and
the New, yet as to scheath our sword when it should
bee drawne, were imprudencie; or at the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Princes, professedly popish in their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
after the Subjects had subscribed both Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to subscribe the first without the second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at
the will of a Jewish Magistrate, openly denying the
New Testament, to subscribe the Old alone, after that
they have subscribed both, were horrible impietie against
God, and treacherie against the Trueth: Right so,
for Us to subscribe the former a-part, as it is now
urged and framed, without the explanation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
thereof at this time, when ours is rejected;
and the subscribers of the former refuse to subscribe
ours, as containing something substantially different,
and urge the former upon us, as different from ours,
and not expressing the speciall abjuration of the evils,
supplicated against by us, were nothing else, but to
deny and part from our former subscription, if not
formally, yet interpretatively. Old <hi>Eleazar,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:150:11"/>
would not seeme to eat forbidden meat, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
and Martyres of old, who would not seeme by
delivering some of their papers, to render the Bible,
or to deny the Trueth, may teach us our duetie in
this case, although our lives were in hazard for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
this Subscription: And who knoweth, but the
<hi>LORD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> may bee calling His people now, who have
proceeded so farre in professing His Trueth at this
time, to such Trials and Confessions, as His
faithfull Witnesses have given of old; that in this
point also our doing may bee a document both to the
succeeding ages, and to other Kirks to whom for the
present wee are made a spectacle.</p>
            <p>12. If any bee so forgetfull of his oath (which
God forbid) as to subscribe this Confession, as it is
now urged, he doeth according to the proclamation
acquiesce in this declaration of his Majesties will,
and doeth accept of such a pardon as hath need to
bee ratified in parliament, And thus doeth turn our
glorie unto shame, by confessing our guiltinesse,
where God from Heaven hath made us guiltlesse,
and by the fire of His Spirit from Heaven hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of our service, And doeth depart from the
commandement of God, the practise of the Godly
in former times, and the worthie and laudable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our worthie and religious progenitours, in
obedience whereof, and conforme to which Wee
made profession to subscribe: for there is no particular
Act required of us, to whom the pardon is presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this proclamation, but this new Subscription
allanerlie.</p>
            <p>13, <hi>The generall band now urged to be subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
as it containeth many clauses not so fitting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="tcp:150:11"/>
time as that wherein it was subscribed, so is it
deficient in a point, at this time most necessarie,</hi> Of
the reformation of our lives, that we shall answerablie
to our profession, be examples to others, of all Godlinesse,
sobernesse and righteousnesse and of every duetie wee ow
to GOD and man; <hi>without which we can not now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
this</hi> Confession, <hi>least</hi> we loose the bands to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
seeme to repent of our former resolutions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and chose to have our portion with hypocrites,
professing and sweareing that we know GOD, but in our
workes denying him, being abominable, disobedient, and
unto every good worke reprobate.</p>
            <p>14. Since the narrative of the generall hand is now
changed, and some lines, expressing at length the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and their adherents to be the partie from whom
the danger to religion, and the Kings Majestie was
threatned, are left out, and no designation made of
the partie from whom the danger is now threatred, We
are made either to thinke, that our subscription at this
time is unnecessarie; or to suspect that we who have
supplicated and entered in Covenant, are understood
to be the partie; especially since the Lords of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
have in the act <hi>September</hi> 22. ratifiing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
found themselves bound to use their best
endeavours, that all his Majesties good Subjects may
rest satisfied with his Majesties declaration, since also
we have beene (although undeservedly challenged of
disorders, distractions, and dangers to religion, and
his Majesties authoritie, and since in the forsaid act
and in the missive directed to his Majestie, the Lords of
Councell offer their lives, and fortunes to his Majestie,
in repressing all such, as shall hereafter prease to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe
the peace of this Kirk and Kingdome, which
<pb facs="tcp:150:12"/>
being expressed in a generalitie is by many applyed
to us and interpreted of our adhereing to our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
We should therefore, by our subscription of
the Covenant, as it is now conceaved, both do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
against our owne mindes, in condemning our
selves, wherein we are innocent, and should consent
to our owne hurt to the suppressing of the cause which
we maintaine, and to the repressing mutually one of
us of another, directly contrare, to our former solemne
oath and subscription.</p>
            <p>15. The Subscribing of this Confession by the
Lords of his Majesties privie Counsell, who by their
place and high employment are publicke Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
and by others who have not subscribed the late
<hi>Confession</hi> will make the breach wider, and the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
division of this Kirk more desperate then ever
before; some haveing <hi>sworne to labour by all lawfull
meanes to recover the former libertie, and puritie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and others maintaining that for puritie, which
is already established, some believing and professing
that the evils supplicated against, are abjured in that
<hi>Confession of Faith;</hi> and others maintaining the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith,</hi> and these corruptions (although for
the present discharged by authority) not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent:
and beside this many divisions and subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
will ensue to the dulefull renting of the Kirk
and Kingdome, makeing way for the wrath and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
iudgements of God often threatned by his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
servants, which all the Godly ought to labour
by all means to prevent.</p>
            <p>16. Wee represent also to the honourable Lords
of privie counsell to bee considered, That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Discipline, and Vse of Sacraments are sworn,
<pb facs="tcp:150:12"/>
and the contrare abjured, according to the Word of
God, and the meaning of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the
books of Discipline, and Acts of Assemblies, And
that in the Oath there is no place left to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of any mans conception of the true Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
nor to any private interpretation, or mentall
reservation.</p>
            <p>For these and the like considerations, In our
own name, and in name of all who will adhere to the
late <hi>Covenant,</hi> subscribed by us, and sealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
We from our duetie to God, our King, our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
countrey, our selves, and the posteritie, least our
silence import a satisfaction of our desires, and a stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of our mouth, from necessarie supplication for
things yet to bee obteined from His Majesties just
and gracious disposition, are constrained to declare and
protest, First, That the cause and occasion of the
distractions of the kirk and commonwealth, are no
wayes to be imputed unto us, or our needlesse fears,
but to the innovations and corruptions of Religion,
which against the acts and order of this kirk, and the
lawes of the kingdome have beene pressed upon us
the people of <hi>GOD,</hi> and his Majesties loyall Subjects;
who, although under great thraldome, were living
in peace and quietnesse, labouring in all godlinesse
and honestie to do our duety to God and man. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
We protest, that all questions and doubtes
that arise, concerning the freedome of the Assemblie
whether in the constitution, and members thereof, or
in the matters to bee treated, or in the manner and
order of proceeding, be remitted to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the assemblie it selfe, as the only proper and
competent iudge; And that it shall be lawfull for
<pb facs="tcp:150:13"/>
us, being authorized with lawfull commissions, as at
other times when the urgent necessitie of the Kirk
shall require, so in this exigence to assemble our selves
at the diet appointed, notwithstanding any impediment
or prorogation to the contrare. And being assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
against all qualifications and predeterminations,
or presupposals, to propone, treat, reason, vote, and
conclude, according to the Word of God, Confession
of Faith, and acts of lawfull Assemblies, in all Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
matters; perteining to the assemblie, and tending
to the advancement of the Kingdome of Christ and
good of Religion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, since Archbishops and Bishops have no
warrand for their office in this Kirk, since it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
both to reason and to the Actes of the Kirk,
that any have place and voice in the Assemblie, who
are not authorized with lawfull commissions: And
seeing both in commoun equitie, and by the tenor
of this Proclamation they are made lyable to the
tryall and censure of the Assemblie, Wee protest,
that they bee not present, as having place or voice
in the Assemblie, but as <hi>rci</hi> to compeere, for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
tryall and censure upon the generall complaints
alreadie made; and the partiular accusations to bee
given in against them; And that the warning given
by His Majesties Proclamation, and this our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
bee a sufficient citation to them, to compeer
before the Assemblie, for their tryall, and censure
in life, office, and benefice.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We solemnly protest, that We do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
adhere to our Oath and Subscription of the
Confession of Faith and Covenant, lately renewed
and approven, with rare and undenyable evidences
<pb facs="tcp:150:13"/>
from heaven; of the wonderfull workeings of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in the hearts both of Pastors and people, through
all the parts of the kingdome, And that we stand
to all parts and clauses thereof, and particularly to
the explanation and application, containing both our
abjuration of, and our union against the particular
evils and corruptions of the time, a duety which the
Lord at this time especially craveth at our hands.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We also Protest, that none of us who have
Subscribed, and doe adhere to our Subscription of
the late Covenant, be charged, or urged, either to
procure the subscriptions of others or to subscribe our
selves unto any other Confession or Covenant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
any derogation there unto, especially that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Proclamation, without the necessary
explanation and the application thereof alreadie sworn
by us for the reasons above expressed: And because,
as we did in our former Protestation appeale from
the Lords of His Majesties Counsell, so doe we now
by these renew our solemne appeale, with all solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
requisite unto the next free generall Assemblie
and Parliament, as the only supreame nationall Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories
competent, to judge of nationall causes and
proceedings.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Wee Protest, That no subscription, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Lords of Counsell or others, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
mentioned in the Proclamation, and enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the maintenance of religion, as it is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or at this present time established, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
within this Kingdome, without any innovation
of religion or Law, be any manner of way prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to our Covenant, wherein <hi>we have sworne to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
the practise of Novations alreadie introduced, &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:150:14"/>
Till they be tryed in a free Assemblie, And to labour
by all lawfull meanes, to recover the puritie and libertie
of the Gospell as it was established and professed before
the foresaid innovations:</hi> And in like manner that no
subscription forsaid be any derogation to the true and
sound meaning of our worthie predecessours at the
time of their Subscription in the year 1581. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.
Withall warneing and exhorting all men
who lay to heart the cause of religion against the
coruptions of the time and the present estate of things,
both to subscribe the Covenant as it hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
and necessarely applied, and as they love the
puritie and libertie of the Gospell to hold back their
hands from all other Covenants, till the Assemblie
now indicted be conveined, and determine the present
differences and divisions, and preserve this countrey
from contrarie oathes.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, As his Majesties royall clemency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
In forgiving and forgetting what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
conceaveth to be a disorder or done amisse, In
the proceeding of any; So are we very confident of
his Majesties approbation to the integritie of our hearts,
and peaceablenesse of our wayes, and actions all this
time past: And therefore, We Protest, that we
still adhere to our former complaints, Protestations,
lawfull meetings, proceedings, mutuall defences, &amp;c.
All which as they have beene in themselves lawfull,
so were they to us, pressed with so many grievances
in his Majesties absence from this native Kingdome
most necessarie, and ought to be regarded as good
offices, and pertinent duties of faithfull Christians,
loyall Subjects, and sensible members of this Kirk
and Common-wealth, As wee trust at all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb facs="tcp:150:14"/>
to make manifest to all good men, especially
to his sacred Majestie for whose long and prosperous
government, that we may live a peacable and quiete life
in all Godlinesse and Honestie, We earnestly pray.</p>
            <p>WHereupon a Noble Earle, <hi>Iames</hi> Earle of
<hi>Montrose,</hi> &amp;c. in name of the <hi>Noble men,</hi>
Master <hi>Alexander Gibson,</hi> younger, of <hi>Durie,</hi>
in name of the <hi>Barons; George Porterfield</hi> Merchant
Burges of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> in name of the <hi>Borrowes,</hi> Master

the Ministers, and Master <hi>Archbald Iohnston,</hi> reader
heereof, in name of all who adhere to the <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> lately renewed within this
<hi>Kingdome,</hi> tooke instruments in the hands of three
<hi>Notars</hi> present, at the said mercat crosse of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
being invironed with great numbers of the forsaid
<hi>Noblemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Barons, Gentlemen, Borrowes, Ministers</hi> and
<hi>Commons,</hi> before many hundred witnesses, and craved
the extract thereof: And in token of their duetifull
respect to his Majestie, confidence of the equitie of
their cause, and innocencie of their carriage and hope
of his Majesties gratious acceptance, they offred in
all humilitie with submisse reverence a copie thereof
to the <hi>Herauld.</hi>
