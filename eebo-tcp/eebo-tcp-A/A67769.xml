            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>CYprian</hi> brings in <hi>Satan,</hi> triumphing over <hi>Christ</hi> in this manner; As
for my followers, ſaith he, I never laid down my life to redeem
them, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done for his; I never promiſed them ſo great
reward, as <hi>Christ</hi> hath done to his: and yet I have more followers then
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and they do far more for me, then his do for him. And indeed,
<hi>To whom we yield our ſelves as ſervants to obey, his ſervants we are to
whom we obey; whether of ſinne unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. 16. And in caſe we do <hi>the Devils works,</hi> we are <hi>the Devils
ſervants,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> affirms, <hi>John</hi> 8. 34, 44. Again, it is the abſtract
of Religion, to imitate him whom we worſhip. Neither are we worthy
to be called Chriſtians, except we <hi>imitate Chriſt,</hi> and ſquare our lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rules he hath given us, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. Who then ſhall compare mens lives with <hi>Chriſts</hi> life,
or thoſe <hi>rules</hi> ſet down in his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but muſt be forced with <hi>Lynacre</hi> to
confeſſe; That either the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is none of <hi>Chriſts,</hi> or very few amongſt
us are <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Obſerve it I pray, for it falls heavy on many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
that think they are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> beyond all exceptions.</p>
            <p>2 But to bring this point more cloſe, and home to mens conſciences.
We read, That <hi>the greateſt number go the broad way to deſtruction, and
but a few the narrow way that leadeth unto life,</hi> Matth. 7. 13, 14. That <hi>the
whole world lieth in wickedneſſe,</hi> 1 John 5. 19. That <hi>the number of thoſe
whom Satan ſhall deceive, is as the ſand of the ſea,</hi> Rev. 20. 8. That <hi>many
are called, and but few choſen,</hi> Matth. 20. 16. &amp; 22. 14. That <hi>though the
number of the children of Iſrael are as the ſand of the ſea; yet onely a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of them ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 9. 27. <hi>Sad predictions!</hi> How then does
it concern every man of us, to be-think our ſelves, whether we be of that
ſmall number, and to miſtruſt the worſt, as all wiſe, and <hi>ſound-hearted
Chriſtians</hi> uſe to do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 21, 22. And indeed, they are <hi>Texts of
Scripture,</hi> that would make the moſt in theſe dayes <hi>to tremble;</hi> Yea, they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101999:2"/>
could not (without <hi>Gods</hi> great mercy) but be ſwallowed up of their own
confuſion, were they not ſpiritually <hi>blinde</hi> and <hi>deaf,</hi> and <hi>dead.</hi> For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ſhews, that amongſt thoſe that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
ſcarce one of an hundred, whoſe <hi>knowledge, belief,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> is anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
either to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> their <hi>Chriſtian profeſſion,</hi> or the <hi>millions of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
they have received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, notwithſtanding the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> tels us in the <hi>word</hi>; and we hear
the ſame daily; That <hi>every man ſhall be judged according to his works,
be they good or evill,</hi> Rev. 20. 13. &amp; 22. 12. That <hi>we ſhall give an account
at the day of judgement for every idle word we ſpeak,</hi> Matth. 12. 36. That
there needs no other cauſe of our laſt and heavieſt doom, then <hi>Ye have
not given, ye have not viſited, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 25. 41. to 46. That <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 18. That <hi>many ſhall ſeek to enter in
at the ſtraight gate, and ſhall not be able,</hi> Luke 13. 24. That <hi>no unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſon ſhall inherit the kingdome of God; but ſhall have their part and
portion in that lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. Gal. 5. 21. Revel. 21. 8. That <hi>except our
righteouſneſſe exceeds the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> (who
were no mean men for outward and formal performances) <hi>we ſhall in no
caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Math. 5. 20. And that <hi>without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. (which <hi>Scriptures</hi> if they be
true, <hi>what manner of perſons ought we to be? in all holy converſation and
godlineſſe,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11.) Yet moſt men live, as if
the <hi>Goſpel</hi> were quite contrary to the rule of the <hi>Law:</hi> As if <hi>God</hi> were
neither to be <hi>feared,</hi> nor <hi>car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him,</hi> nor <hi>afraid of him,</hi> both out of his <hi>debt</hi> and <hi>danger</hi>; Yea, as if there
were no <hi>God to judge,</hi> nor <hi>Hell to puniſh,</hi> nor <hi>Heaven to reward,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think of it without aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>But to all theſe, let me add one <hi>thunder-bolt</hi> more out of <hi>Gods Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,</hi>
which you ſhall finde, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. where he expreſly tels us, that <hi>he
will not be merciful</hi> (I pray mark it) <hi>unto ſuch as flatter themſelves in
an evill way,</hi> but <hi>that his wrath and jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt them,
and every curſe that is writ in his Book ſhall light upon them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi>
19, 20. And that <hi>if we will not regard, nor hearken unto him when he cals
upon us for repentance: He will not heare nor regard us, when in our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
and anguiſh we ſhall call upon him for mercy; but even laugh at our
deſtruction, and mock when our fear cometh,</hi> Prov. 1. 24. to 33. Neither
is <hi>ſalvation</hi> more <hi>promiſed</hi> to the <hi>godly,</hi> in any part of the <hi>Bible, Old
Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>New,</hi> then eternal <hi>death</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> is <hi>threatned</hi> to the
<hi>wicked.</hi> For though to all repentant ſinners he is a moſt merciful <hi>God;</hi>
yet to all wilful and impenitent ſinners, he is <hi>a conſuming fire, and a
jealous God,</hi> Heb. 12. 29. Deut. 4. 24. Theſe are dreadful threats, from
the mouth of <hi>an Almighty,</hi> and <hi>terrible God,</hi> who is Truth it ſelf, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lie. Nevertheleſſe, mens obdurate and <hi>adamantine hearts,</hi> brawned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101999:2"/>
and hardned with the cuſtome of ſinne, will tremble and relent no
more at the hearing of them, then the <hi>ſeates they ſit on,</hi> or the <hi>ſtones they
tread on.</hi> Their ſupine ſtupidity is no more capable of excitation then
the <hi>Sea Rocks</hi> are of motion, or the <hi>billows</hi> of compaſſion. They are
like the <hi>Catadupans,</hi> inhabitants of the <hi>Cataracts,</hi> who hear not the <hi>roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Nilus.</hi> As <hi>Drums</hi> and <hi>Trumpets</hi> (we know) and that loud rupture
of the aire with <hi>Ordnance,</hi> is but like ſoft <hi>muſick</hi> to the <hi>eares</hi> of ſome
<hi>fleſhed ſouldiers, hardned</hi> with often <hi>ſucceſſe.</hi> And the reaſon is, they
will rather hearken to their own <hi>deceitful hearts,</hi> and <hi>believe Satan,</hi> that
would gull them of their <hi>ſoules,</hi> and plunge them into <hi>eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
then they will hearken to, or believe the <hi>God of Truth.</hi> And the

20. to 23. Yea, how could I here inlarge? as would you know, why
many men in this, and other ages before us, have been ſuch ſuperlavive

And others ſo reprobate, that their utmoſt endeavour is, to <hi>damn others

            <p>Others there are, that through a <hi>preſumptuous confidence,</hi> think they

            <p>Again, others you have, ſo <hi>civilly righteous,</hi> that they ſee no need

And how can it other, then cut the hearts of thoſe that have felt
the love of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> to heare him ſo <hi>wounded at home with</hi> oathes and
