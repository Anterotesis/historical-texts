         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout a Moneth ſince I received
ſome Papers from you by Mr <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon,</hi>
Bookſeller, together with
a Letter, full of reſpects, and ſuch
acknowledgments, which I ſhould
neither ſatisfie my ſelf, nor (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
you, to own, though you
were pleaſed to ſpread the ſnare in
my way. Nevertheleſs to deal freely with you (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I finde you a man of a far better ſpirit, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
then I have yet met with in any Antagoniſt)
my ſence is, that every mans eſtimate of himſelf for
Gifts and Parts, ought to be commenſurable to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47308:3"/>
Grace of God vouchſafed unto him in theſe things,
leſt by an undervaluation of himſelf, his hand be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
from ſuch ſervice, which God upon the account
of ſuch gifts expecteth from him. But Sir, neither my
<hi>genius,</hi> nor time, will ſuffer me to anti-complement
with you: onely I cannot but kindly reſent that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
diſpoſition in you, to put honor where it was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to help with your reſpects to fill up the pit,
which others have digged in the field of my reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to finde the treaſure of their own. I am ſorry that
my time, ſince the receipt of your Papers, hath been
from day to day, and from hour to hour, ſo drunk up
by other occaſions, that I could not, until now, compaſs
any convenient liberty for a peruſal of them. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have I now obtain'd it without the regret of ſome
other engagements on my hand.</p>
            <p>Concerning the weighty buſineſs diſcourſed in
your Papers, I greatly deſire it at the hand of my God,
both yours and mine, that I may be able to give you
ſatisfaction in it, or that himſelf will pleaſe to do it by
ſome other hand. For though I verily beleeve that
you have pleaded the cauſe of that which is not, with as
much ingenuity and ſtrength, as any other man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
could have done, yet I conceive withall, that
whatſoever you have ſaid to encumber the concluſive
validity of that Argument, about which you profeſs
your ſelf (and I confeſs, not without grounds worthy
a learned man) diſſatisfied, may be fairly taken off,
and to very reaſonable ſatisfaction, whether God will
vouchſafe to do it by me, or no. And ſorry I am for
your ſake, that I ſhould (at preſent) be ſo deeply and
indiſpenſably engaged in more publique employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that I am in no capacity of leaſure to follow
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47308:3"/>
you <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in your writing with thoſe particularities
of ſatisfaction, which every paſſage therein reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
requireth. The truth is, that (according to my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
concerning God) I am rather <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, then
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, more intent (of the two) to promote the
concernments of the good of the generality of men,
then the accomodations of my particular Friends;
though as far as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will extend, I am deſirous
alſo to obſerve the juſt Laws of Friendſhip as invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
as any other man: And though I very much
honor you (how ever unknown) for thoſe ſignal parts
of Chriſtian worth and ingenuity, which by the light
of your Papers ſent unto me I ſufficiently diſcern in
you; yet ſhould I ſcarce have been entreated to have
made you any ſo large return in writing as this, had
I not conceived, that what I ſhould draw up for the
ſatisfaction of your deſire herein (though probably
not of your ſcruple) might by the publiſhing of it turn
to ſome account of a more publique benefit and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The conſideration of the ſubject matter of
your Papers, will fall directly &amp; of courſe in my way,
if God ſhould judg it meet to ſpare me life and health
and liberty otherwiſe, for the compoſure of the ſecond
part of my Book of <hi>Redemption,</hi> wherof I give ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture
towards the latter end of the book already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed:
my purpoſe is there to diſcuſs the contents of
your Papers more particularly. In the mean time you
ſhall perform the part of a Friend to me (and it will be
no point of unkindnes, or ill conſequence to your ſelf)
to conſider, that the ſtreſs of my Judgement, ſtanding
as it doth about the extent of Redemption by <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
doth not lie, or lean, upon the demonſtrative clearneſs
or evidence of Truth in that Argument, about which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47308:4"/>
you are ſcrupled, nor indeed ſo much upon any other
of the Grounds or Reaſons inſiſted on in my Book for
the defence thereof, no nor yet upon them all; as upon
the expreſs pregnancy of the Scriptures themſelves
from place to place, which (to my underſtanding) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
by any congruous or rational Interpretation be drawn
another way; as alſo upon the ſcantneſs and defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of proof univerſally found in thoſe Paſſages and
Texts, which are with greateſt plauſibleneſs alledged
and argued (proof-wiſe) for the contrary Opinion.
So that though all my Arguments ſhould fall to the
ground and ſink, yet if the Scriptures argued by me
in favor of that my Judgment, will ſtand in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
ſences, wherein I interpret them, and (as I
judg) without any violation or breach (in the leaſt) of
the beſt, and beſt-known Laws of Interpretation, yea
and with the Obſervation of them all, the Doctrine
maintained by me will ſtand impregnable, and like
the good Word of God it ſelf, irreprovable. I do
not ſpeak this, as if I were either conſcious, or jealous,
of any weakneſs, or non-concludency, in any of my
Arguments propoſed and diſcuſſed in the 18. Chapter
of my Book of <hi>Redemption:</hi> but to let you know,
where, or in what, the firſt-born of my ſtrength and
confidence of Truth, in what I hold concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
reſideth: and what weapons of all others
they are, which you muſt take from me, before I can
ſurrender.</p>
            <p>But Sir, very briefly, and according to the ſhort
tedder of my time, to touch ſome of the more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Heads of your Diſcourſe, though (haply) not in
the ſame order, unto which I might be directed by
your Papers, but onely as they come to remembrance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47308:4"/>
ſome days after my peruſal thereof, as not having lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for a ſecond review.</p>
            <p>1. By your Judgment, which ſtands for a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Repentance (I preſume you mean that which is
true, and accompanying Salvation, becauſe otherwiſe
you ſhould not counter-argue me in my Notion) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Faith, I perceive you are a man of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
confederacy with me in leaving the road,
when you judg the Truth lies beſide it: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
at this turn I conceive you leave it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe. For if there may be a Repentance
found and ſaving without Faith, either it muſt
be a work or fruit of the Law (whether <hi>natural,</hi>
or <hi>poſitive,</hi> it varieth not the caſe we now ſpeak
of) or elſe of ſome third Covenant made by God
with Men in order to their Salvation, really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
both from the Covenant of Works in the Law,
and from the Covenant of Grace in the Goſpel. For
you cannot affirm it to be a work, or fruit, of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
becauſe you hold, 1. That it is required of thoſe,
to whom the Goſpel is never vouchſafed: And,
2. That there is no Law or Commandment given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch perſons, which are in no capacity of yeelding
obedience to it: (which latter Principle will do you
worthy ſervice at many turns, if you will work it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.)
That the <hi>Repentance</hi> you ſpeak of, is any
fruit or work of any third Covenant, is not (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume)
in your thoughts: however, I am not able to
comprehend what this third Covenant ſhould be.
That it cannot be any work of the Law, or of the
Covenant of Works, is evident from hence; becauſe
<hi>by the Works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this Repentance is judged by you to be both juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47308:5"/>
and ſaving. Beſides, it is the common and known
Opinion of learned Divines (and doubtleſs of good
accord with the Truth) that <hi>the Law knoweth no Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
For the Tenor of the Law is more diſtrict and
inexorable: <hi>Curſed is every man that</hi> continueth not <hi>in
all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do
them, Galat.</hi> 3. 10. By the way, your Notion that
<hi>Adam,</hi> during the <hi>interìm</hi> between his Fall, and the
Evangelical Promiſe of the <hi>womans ſeed</hi> made unto
him, was obliged to Repentance, is but a miſtake.
Such an <hi>interìm</hi> ſuppoſed, <hi>Adam</hi> was therein no more
obliged to Repentance, then the Devil is ſince his
Fall.</p>
            <p>The Premiſſes conſidered, when I argued the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God to Beleeve, from his Command unto
Men to Repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. you had no commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
cauſe of that falſe demand; <hi>Sed quid hoc ad Iphicli
boves?</hi> But I conſider how hard a thing it is for a man
not to be a little warm in a conteſt; and I could for
<hi>Iphiclus</hi> his <hi>Oxen,</hi> return <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs in exchange: but
I ſhall not go forward with the bargain. Certainly
when <hi>God commands</hi> Men <hi>to Repent,</hi> he doth in the
very ſubſtance and import of this duty, command
them alſo to Beleeve; in as much as that Repentance,
which he at any time commands, is Evangelical, and
of a ſaving tendency; and ſo can be no work of the
Law, unleſs it be the <hi>Law of Life,</hi> (I mean, the
Goſpel.)</p>

may be ſaid to have, and to have had, the

have been preached unto the ancient <hi>Jews, Heb.</hi> 4. 2, 6.

<hi>Moſes,</hi> or God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> gave them water to drink, is
ſaid to have been, <hi>Chriſt, viz.</hi> ſpiritually, in type, or

Repentance, (Rom.</hi> 2. 4.) and conſequently (the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes
evincing it) unto Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whether known,

againſt ſin; when notwithſtanding he ſhall expreſs
himſelf in goodneſs, and patience, and bountifulneſs

               </gap>, the effect or ſubſtance of the

places (which I have not leaſure at preſent to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

<hi>Heathen,</hi> yea in all men by the Light of Nature (I
mean, where this Light is given, and ſhineth) by ſuch
a regular and rational proceſs of diſcourſe, as that
mentioned, to attain or make out this Evangelical
Concluſion, That ſome Mediation, ſome Attonement
or other, hath been made, and accepted by God, for
the ſins of men. <hi>But I demand</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul,)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Have they not heard? Yes verily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>their
ſound went forth into all the Earth, and their words unto
the ends of the World.</hi> He had ſaid in the Verſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
foregoing, that <hi>Faith comes by hearing:</hi> In this
Verſe, he ſhews (in an Anſwer which he gives to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or queſtion put by him) what hearing it is, by
which Faith comes; or at leaſt what hearing is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to beleeve upon, or to produce Faith. This hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he ſaith, is the hearing of that <hi>ſound, and of thoſe
words,</hi> which the Heavens, and the Day, and the Night
ſpeak, and <hi>that are gone forth into the ends of the World,</hi>
(as appears by the place,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 4.</note> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. from whence
theſe words are cited.) If you ask me, but what is
the <hi>ſound,</hi> or what are the words which the <hi>Heavens,</hi>
and <hi>the Day, and the Night, i. e.</hi> the conſtant courſe
of the Providence of God, in the Government of the
World, ſpeak in the ears of all Nations, and of all
People, that <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould come by the hearing of
them? I anſwer: they are the <hi>words of Eternal Life</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47308:6"/>
too, as well as thoſe, which (as <hi>Peter</hi> acknowledgeth)
our Saviour himſelf had to ſpeak; yea and did ſpeak
upon all occaſions; onely they are not ſo plainly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as he was wont to ſpeak: their Parable is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more dark, and harder to be underſtood. But
the ſence and import of what the Heavens moving ſtill
in their natural courſe, and the gracious Providence of
God, joyntly ſpeak in the ears of all fleſh, is, that God
is taken off from the fierceneſs of his Diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſin, and that he holds forth his white flag, and
offers terms and conditions of Peace unto the World;
and that upon their coming into him by Repentance,
they ſhall be received into grace and favor. And what
is this but the very tenor, ſum, and ſubſtance of the
Goſpel? which yet is more plain from that of the
ſame Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 14. to the men of <hi>Lyſtra. Who</hi>
(ſaith he, ſpeaking of God) <hi>in times paſt ſuffered all the
Gentiles to walk in their own ways. Nevertheleſs he left
not himſelf without witneſs, in that he did good, and gave
us rain from Heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling our
hearts with food and gladneſs.</hi> In reſpect of what was it,
that God left not himſelf without witneſs amongſt the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> even then when <hi>he ſuffered them to walk in their
own ways? (viz.</hi> without admoniſhing and directing
them how to walk, and what to do, after any ſuch
manner as now he doth by the letter of the Goſpel
ſent amongſt them:) what did the <hi>witneſſes</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
here ſpeaks of, witneſs concerning God, or, on
his behalf? Doubtleſs he doth not ſpeak here of his
Godhead, nor of his Power, nor of his Wiſdom, as
if his meaning were, that God left not himſelf <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
witneſs</hi> of theſe (though it be true, that he did not
leave himſelf without witneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47308:7"/>
men, of theſe alſo,) but the Works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as diſtinguiſhed from the Works of Providence
(whereof he here ſpeaks) are ſufficient <hi>witneſſes</hi> of
theſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> according to the tenor of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
there are natural impreſſions of theſe in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and conſciences of men, which are <hi>witneſſes</hi> on
Gods behalf thus far. But doubtleſs, that in God,
or concerning God, which (as the Apoſtle here ſaith)
God intended ſhould be teſtified or <hi>witneſſed</hi> on
his behalf unto men, was ſomewhat, more ſecret,
more out of the way (as it were) of mens, common
thoughts or apprehenſions; and particularly it was
that gracious and good affection which he bears unto
the World through Jeſus Chriſt, his inclination unto
Peace with Men, upon their Repentance (which is the
ſubſtance of the Goſpel.) This appears, 1. By the
nature or quality of the witneſſes here ſpoken of,
which were, Gods giving men <hi>rain from Heaven, and
fruitful ſeaſons,</hi> his <hi>filling their hearts with food and
gladneſs.</hi> Such <hi>witneſſes</hi> as theſe, are onely proper to
teſtifie grace, and love, and deſire of the good of
thoſe, to whom they are given, in him that giveth
them. They plainly ſhew, that he that beſtows them,
is not extream, uſeth not extremity againſt thoſe that
do amiſs; and conſequently that he is by one means
or other, taken off from the rigor of his Juſtice, and
ſeverity of his Wrath againſt ſinners. And, 2. It
appears from hence; becauſe <hi>Paul,</hi> who was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a diligent and faithful Preacher of the Goſpel
where ever he became, but was in ſpecial manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to be an <hi>Apostle to the Gentiles,</hi> preached no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctrine but this at <hi>Lystra</hi> (a City of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles)</hi>
upon that great opportunity that was now offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47308:7"/>
him. We cannot think that he ſhould onely preach
a Philoſophical or Metaphyſical Sermon, concerning
the Eſſence or natural Properties of God onely; but
that which was Evangelical, and favoring of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
Now the Holy Ghoſt recording either the
whole, or (at leaſt) the ſum and ſubſtance of what he
preached in this place, reporteth nothing Evangelical
as ſpoken by him, except this be acknowledged for
ſuch. So that clear it is from the Scriptures, That all
the World, even thoſe that are moſt ſtraitened and
ſcanted in this kinde, thoſe that have not the letter of
the Goſpel, have yet ſufficient means of beleeving
granted unto them; of beleeving I mean, 1. <hi>That God
is, 2. That he is a Rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek
him:</hi> which is all the Faith or Belief that the Apoſtle
makes ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to bring a man
unto God,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11 6.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> into grace or favor with him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
There are ſeveral other Scriptures that ſpeak home to
this point, beſides thoſe argued; particularly, that
<hi>Rom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom, 2. 4.</note> 2. 4. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs,
and forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that
the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance?</hi> The
<hi>long-ſuffering and goodneſs of God</hi> are ſaid <hi>to lead Men to
Repentance,</hi> becauſe they teſtifie, according to a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
and clear Interpretation, a willingneſs and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in God, to receive all ſuch into grace and favor
with himſelf, who ſhall unfeignedly repent of their
ſins. There is no other conſideration, but this (at leaſt,
none without this) in reſpect whereof, the <hi>patience</hi> or
<hi>bountifulneſs of God,</hi> can be ſaid <hi>to lead, i.</hi> to perſwade
or invite, <hi>to Repentance.</hi> There is no motive or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive,
whereof ſinners are capable, <hi>unto Repentance,</hi>
without hope of Pardon upon Repentance. In the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47308:8"/>
mean ſeaſon, you ſee it clear from the Scriptures (and
the Scriptures, as ye have ſeen, run parallel with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and clear reaſon all along in this point) that even
Heathen men, and thoſe that want the Hiſtory of the
Goſpel, have yet a ſufficiency of means whereby to
beleeve, and ſo to prevent the wrath and indignation
which is to come: in which regard, they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unexcuſable, if they do it not.</p>
            <p>Conſonant unto theſe things argued from the
Scriptures, are the Judgments of our beſt Proteſtant
Divines, at leaſt when overſhadowed with the Spirit
of Truth. <hi>For-though</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin) there will be found
nothing in the World worthy the Favor of God, yet he

the letter of it, are yet called by God to it, yea and
may ſo beleeve, that by the Mediation of their Faith,
through the Ranſom payd for them, they may obtain
Salvation.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe we (for Argument ſake) that the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi>
to whom the Goſpel was never orally preached,
were not in an immediate capacity of beleeving it (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe terms of beleeving lately ſignified,) yet this
proves not but that they might be in a remote capacity
of beleeving it; ſuch a capacity I mean, which by a
regular and conſcientious exerciſe and acting of thoſe
worthy abilities, which God had conferred upon
them, might, by the ordinary bleſſing, and according
to the ſtanding courſe of the gracious Providence of
God in ſuch caſes, have riſen up and grown to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
capacity in this kinde. So that (for example)
an Heathen man, who never heard of the Name of

               </gap>,
i. e. <hi>the effect of the
Law written in his heart,</hi> quit himſelf to ſuch a degree
of well-pleaſing unto God, that God will not fail to
reveal or make known his Son <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto him, after
ſome ſuch manner and degree, which ſhall be ſaving
unto him. This is the expreſs Doctrine of learned
<hi>M. Bucer. Here</hi> (ſaith he, writing upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.) <hi>let us
obſerve two things: That God in no Age whatſoever left
Men deſtitute of the Doctrine of Salvation. Therefore
who ever at any time periſhed periſhed through their own
default</hi> [or neglect.] <hi>For God ſo bedeweth</hi> [or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkleth]
<hi>Nature with his Light, that they onely remain
ſtrangers unto Righteouſneſs, who willingly and of their
own accord caſt it from them. There are at this day Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47308:9"/>
not a few, to whom the Goſpel of Christ is not ſincerely
preached: others there are,</hi> WHO HEAR NOTHING
OF IT. <hi>But if theſe did not voluntarily put from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the deſire of Righteouſneſs, the Lord</hi> (QUESTION<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESS)
<hi>would ſo antmate</hi> [or enliven them] <hi>with his
Spirit, that they ſhould</hi> [or, might] <hi>perform the things
of the Law, commit themſelves wholy to his</hi> [grace, or]
<hi>goodneſs, and do unto their Neighbors what they would that
they ſhould do unto them. Hence it would come to paſs that
God would ſooner ſend an Angel unto them, as he did unto</hi>
Cornelius, <hi>then ſuffer them to remain ignorant of his
Christ. But whileſt through impious ingratitude, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

truſt the true riches? <hi>This place ſeems to hold out thus
much; That if a man improves the outward Mercies of
God, or the work of common Grace, God will entruſt that
man with better riches; God will finde out a way to do that
man good.</hi> Afterwards (in the ſame Sermon) thus:
<hi>Thou oughteſt to do according to the gift and power, which
God hath given thee in a natural way: and that God, which
hath given thee power to do it in a natural way, will</hi> (NO
DOUBT) <hi>aſsiſt thee with power to do things in a ſpiritual
way. For that man which improves his natural Talent,
God will one time or other entruſt him with a ſpiritual
Talent. For there was never any man went to Hell for,</hi>

               </gap>, pag. 69, 70, 71, &amp;c. you
ſhall finde the concurrent Judgment of ſome others
of no mean eſteem for Learning, Piety, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is called Orthodox amongſt us. And the truth
is, that in ſuch a Doctrine as this, they cleave to the
Scriptures themſelves, and are one ſpirit with them.
For when our Saviour, towards the cloze of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of the Talents, teacheth thus: <hi>For unto every one
that hath, ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance;
but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, even that
which he hath;</hi> he clearly avoucheth this for Truth,
That whatſoever a mans original ſtock, in gifts or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
in one kind or other, from Gods hand ſhall
be, be it never ſo weak, ſmall, or inconſiderable, yet
by a careful employment, it ſhall, through the grace
and bleſſing of <hi>God</hi> hereupon, improve to a ſpiritual
eſtate, which is therefore compared to an <hi>abundance,</hi>
becauſe the poſſeſſor hereof is enriched above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
by it. For that our Saviour by, <hi>him that hath,</hi> and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47308:10"/>
to whom he promiſeth, that <hi>more ſhall be given,</hi> doth
not mean a perſon already converted, regenerate, or
endued with true Faith, ſaving grace, or the like, ſo
neither, by him <hi>that hath not,</hi> him that wanteth ſaving
grace, is evident; 1. Becauſe by the <hi>ſervants</hi> who
received the <hi>Talents,</hi> as in a glaſs, is repreſented the
ſtate and condition, not of Beleevers onely, or thoſe
that ſhall be ſaved, but of the generality of Mankinde,
or (at leaſt) as well of ſuch who will periſh, as of thoſe
who ſhall be ſaved. This is evident from that which
the Parable relateth concerning the <hi>unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who went and hid his Talent in the Earth;</hi> for
which his Lord commands him to be <hi>caſt into outer
darkneſs, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
Now the words under debate were uttered by our
Saviour, upon occaſion of this ſevere award (as it
may ſeem) which the Lord paſſed againſt this unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
ſervant; <hi>Take therefore the Talent from him, and
give it unto him that hath ten Talents.</hi> Of the equity
of this order, he gives an account in the ſaid words:
<hi>For unto every one that hath, ſhall &amp;c.</hi> plainly imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that by him <hi>that hath,</hi> he meaneth, him that hath
upon improvement, or (which comes to the ſame)
him that ſheweth and declareth that <hi>he hath</hi> [ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
given him] by his employment and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it: for otherwiſe, he that had his Talent ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him becauſe of his hiding, or non-employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of it, <hi>had,</hi> as well as the other, by original gift.
And if by, <hi>him that hath,</hi> he ſhould mean, <hi>him that
hath,</hi> ſimply, or, in any conſideration, then he that <hi>had
received the one Talent,</hi> notwithſtanding his hiding it,
ſhould have had <hi>given</hi> unto him, and ſo <hi>had more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,</hi>
as well as the other. Again, 2. there is no
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47308:11"/>
ground, nor (I ſuppoſe) colour of reaſon, or ground,
to conceive, but that all the <hi>Talents</hi> (mentioned in the
Parable) the <hi>five,</hi> the <hi>two,</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> were all of one and
the ſame nature, or kinde; and that none of them ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
any ſupernatural, or neceſſarily-ſaving grace,
but onely natural gifts, or endowments, ſuch as men
unregenerate were capable of, as well as regenerate.
Nor do either <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, <hi>Muſculus,</hi> or any other
of our Proteſtant Expoſitors, give the leaſt intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their ſence to the contrary, in their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
upon the ſaid Parable; though <hi>Muſculus</hi> be
more aſſertive and expreſs in the point, then any of the
reſt that I have ſeen. Amongſt the ancient, <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>

which every perſon of Mankinde under

import and conſequence unto him. For that, by that
which is (in the Parable) promiſed to be <hi>given,</hi> and
that <hi>in abundance, to him that hath,</hi> muſt of neceſſity
be meant ſomewhat that is of a ſpiritual and ſaving
nature, is evident from the carriage of the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
where the ſervants, who had received the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
and employed them faithfully (by whom are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47308:11"/>
typified our Saviours, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>thoſe that have,</hi> as
was lately ſaid) are graciouſly invited by their Maſter
into his <hi>joy: Enter thou into thy Maſters joy:</hi> So to the
other; <hi>Enter thou into thy Maſters joy.</hi> Now if either
<hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be ſignified and meant by the Maſter
of theſe ſervants (as I ſuppoſe no man queſtions, but
that either the one, or the other, are typified hereby)
by, <hi>entering into their joy,</hi> cannot be meant a receiving
of a greater meaſure of natural gifts or endowments,
nor of receiving any reward which belongs to perſons
qualified onely with ſuch Endowments as theſe, but,
Salvation, or Eternal Bleſſedneſs and glory. If ſo, it
roundly follows, that by what <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſeth ſhall
be <hi>given</hi> to him <hi>that hath</hi> (in the ſence declared) is
meant ſomewhat of a ſaving conſequence, as regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
Grace, the ſanctifying Spirit of God, Faith,
and the like. And promiſing, not onely, or ſimply,
that <hi>to him that hath, ſhall be given,</hi> but further, that <hi>he
ſhall have abundantly,</hi> he clearly ſignifieth, that in caſe
men will provoke, ſtir up, and lay out themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
in the improvement of ſuch abilities and
gifts, which ſhall from time to time be vouchſafed
unto them, they may, by vertue of the Bounty and
gracious Decree of God in that behalf, attain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from <hi>God</hi> what proportion or meaſure of the
Spirit of Grace, and of <hi>God,</hi> they can deſire.</p>
            <p>What hath been argued, and (I ſuppoſe) demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively
proved from the Parable of the Talents,
and more eſpecially from this promiſe or engagement
of our Saviour, <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given, viz.</hi>
that upon a regular and reaſonable improvement of
thoſe principles or abilities (which we more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then properly, call, <hi>natural)</hi> vouchſafed by <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47308:12"/>
unto men, they ſhall certainly receive from him that
which is ſpiritual and ſaving, might be further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
and confirmed from many other Scriptures;
as from <hi>Mat. 13. 12. Mark 4. 25. Luk.</hi> 8. 18. (where
the ſame promiſe, almoſt in the ſame words, upon a
like occaſion, is made, and taught for ſound Doctrine,
by our Saviour;) ſo likewiſe from <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 11, 13.
<hi>Mark 12. 34. Luk. 8. 15. &amp; 11. 52. Joh.</hi> 6. 27, 45.
<hi>Eph. 5. 14. Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21, &amp;c. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6, &amp;c.
(beſides twenty more.) In all which places there
is a perfect eye of the Notion contended for,
viſible enough to him that ſhall narrowly look upon
them, and enquire into them. And indeed the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
or Doctrine it ſelf, which we now plead, is ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
ſo intimouſly comporting with, and ſuitable
to, the <hi>Genius</hi> and main Deſign of the Goſpel, which
is to advance Godlineſs, and all excellent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ways and works amongſt men, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be alledged againſt the truth of it, but what
upon due conſideration will be found manifeſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
and obſtructive to the practice of Godlineſs,
and of things worthy and honorable amongſt men.</p>
            <p>From theſe Diſcuſſions then it clearly follows,
That the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who onely have, or have had, the
benefit and help of the Light of Nature, together
with thoſe impreſſions of Good and Evil which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it, are, and have been, by means hereof,
in ſuch a capacity of having the Goſpel, if not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet (which is altogether as much, or rather more)
revealed unto them, and conſequently of beleeving
it, that were they, had they been, true and faithful
to the dear Intereſt of their own Peace and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
they may, and might beleeve it, If ſo, the want
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47308:12"/>
of the letter, or oral preaching of it unto them, doth
not excuſe them from ſin in their non-beleeving it;
unleſs we ſhall ſay, that the committing of one ſin,
excuſeth from the guilt of another, or that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of one duty, diſchargeth from the obligation of
another.</p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) Suppoſe and grant we yet further
(for Argument ſake) that the <hi>Heathen</hi> actually want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the letter and external Miniſtry of the Goſpel by
men, were in no capacity at all of coming to the
knowledg of it, either by the Works of Creation
and Providence, nor yet by any improvement of their
natural Abilities (poſſible unto them;) yet it muſt
needs be acknowledged that they were in a capacity
of being made Partakers even of the letter and oral
Adminiſtration hereof, in ſuch a ſence, as all Nations
are in a capacity of having and enjoying ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
or commodities, which are exportable from
any one Nation under Heaven, and may be had by
recourſe and equitable applications made to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for them. When God erected and ſet up, firſt
his Tabernacle, and afterwards his Temple, amongſt
the <hi>Jews,</hi> together with that entire ſyſteme or body
of his Ceremonial Worſhip, wherein, though under
Types and Figures, he diſcovered his gracious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
and Intentions by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> towards the world,
and (indeed) preached the Goſpel, though his intent
and purpoſe herein was to priviledg and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
this Nation above any other People and Nation
under Heaven, yet was it no part of his minde, that
theſe Diſcoveries of Himſelf, or the great Bleſſing
accruing thereby unto men, ſhould be ſo confined or
appropriated unto this People, but that all the World,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47308:13"/>
and all the Nations round about them, far and neer,
yea and every particular perſon, born or dwelling in
any of theſe Nations, might, if they pleaſed, have
had part and fellowſhip with them in all this Grace
and Bleſſedneſs, as many actually had, who became
Proſelytes to the Religion and Worſhip of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yea all the priviledg or prerogative which this
Nation had above others, in, or about the Word, and

that the ſaid Ceremonial Worſhip, or <hi>Moſaical</hi>
Goſpel, was committed, or depoſited in truſt with the
<hi>Jews,</hi> he calls it, <hi>theirs, (Rom.</hi> 9. 4.) So becauſe they

<hi>Moſes,</hi> for the nurture and training up of the <hi>World</hi>
(during the infancy and pupillage of it) in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God, and the things of their Eternal Peace.
In like manner, in that Spirit of Prophecy, which God
poured out ſo abundantly upon this Nation, in thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47308:13"/>
Prophets which he raiſed up and ſent unto them from
time to time, to inſtruct, admoniſh, reprove, declare
unto them things to come, &amp;c. he had reſpect, as well
to the Nations of the World, as to the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as appears by ſundry particular Prophecies,
which much more neerly concerned other States and
Nations, as <hi>Babylon, Egypt, Tyre, Edom, Moab, &amp;c.</hi>
then the <hi>Jews. Athanaſius</hi> (among the Fathers) very
excellently and fully to this point diſcourſeth in his
Treatiſe concerning the <hi>Incanation of the Word of
God:</hi> where, having affirmed that the Grace of that
Image ſtamped upon men according to the likeneſs of
God, is, and was, ſufficient to afford unto men the
Knowledg of the Word of God; and yet, that, in
caſe men ſhould neglect to know him, by looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themſelves, he had provided this remedy for ſuch
their weakneſs, <hi>viZ.</hi> That by the Works of Nature
they might underſtand him to be the Workman, &amp;c.
he advanceth his diſcourſe in words to this effect. <hi>But
when as the negligence of men by degrees grew worſe and
worſe, God yet again provided for this weakneſs alſo, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto them Laws and Prophets familiar with them</hi> [or,
which might be well known to them,] <hi>that in caſe it
were troubleſom unto them to look up towards Heaven, they
might receive inſtruction from their Neighbors,</hi> [or, neer
at hand.] <hi>For one man may learn of another that which
is excellent, neerer hand. So then they might by lifting up
their eyes to the vaſt magnitude of the Heavens, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the ſweet harmony of Nature</hi> [or, the Creation]
<hi>come to know the Word of the Father to be the Captain</hi> [or
Guider] <hi>hereof, and that by his Providence over all
things, he diſcovers and makes known the Father unto
all Men, and that he therefore gives motion unto all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47308:14"/>
things, that all Men by him may know God. Or if this
were grievous to them, they might converſe with Saints</hi>
[or, holy men,] <hi>and from theſe learn to know God the
Maker of all things to be the Father of Chriſt, and that
the worſhiping of Idols is impiety, and full of all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
They might alſo by the Knowledg of the Law abſtain

<hi>For the Law was not</hi> [brought into the world]

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47308:15"/>
then, how the Prophets following them, by the
ſpreading of their Sermons and Prophecies into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Nations far and neer, advanced the ſame ſervice:
which alſo he further ſaith was much promoted by
means of the Captivities and Baniſhments of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
in <hi>Aſſyria, Babylon,</hi> and over all the Eaſt. Having
hereunto added the Conſideration of the Tranſlation
of the Scriptures (then extant) or of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
into the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, procured by <hi>Ptolomy
Philadelphus</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> after the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
which (as he truly ſaith) was of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
for the Propagation of the Knowledg of the
true God through the World, he concludes that theſe
particulars did much facilitate and help forward the
Work and Labors of the Apoſtles in the Converſion
of the World. <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> likewiſe upon the ſame
place to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>The Field was broke up,
and brought into tilth, by the Prophets, who not onely in</hi>
Judea, <hi>but in many other Countries</hi> and Nations <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Gentiles, both by word and writing awakened
men to the Worſhip of the One God, which is the ſeed of an
Evangelical Harveſt, or Enereaſe</hi>

            <p>Thus then you ſee that it is not my ſence alone, but
the Judgment likewiſe of many wiſer and more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, That God in ſetting up that great Light of
the Knowledg of himſelf in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi>
which ſome conceive to be the Center or middle part
of the habitable World, and amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> as
upon a Candleſtick, did intend the benefit and bleſſing
of the ſhining of it throughout the great Houſe of the
whole World. And as many did partake of this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and Bleſſing, who inhabited Countries far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the <hi>Jews, joyning themſelves unto the people
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47308:15"/>
of the God of Abraham,</hi> ſo had all others the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of doing likewiſe. And though remoteneſs of
Country, or dwelling, from <hi>Judea,</hi> might haply be
ſome extenuation or mitigation of the ſin of mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
ignorant of God, his true Worſhip, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and of thoſe ſpiritual Myſteries, which were to
be learned in <hi>Judea;</hi> yet was it no adequate or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
excuſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Theſe things duly weighed and conſidered, the
particulars objected by you againſt that Propoſition
of mine, about which (it ſeems) you are at preſent
diſſatisfied, appear reconcilable enough to it, and
fairly anſwerable.</p>
            <p>For, 1. whereas you argue, that all Men have not
a legal tye or obligation upon them to beleeve on
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and upon this account cannot ſtand
bound to beleeve on him; I anſwer, by denying your
Antecedent, and affirm, That all Men <hi>[i. e.</hi> all men
not wholy diſabled, either through want of years, or
defect of natural capacity, to beleeve; though there
be a ſence, which the Schoolmen term, <hi>ſenſus diviſus,</hi>
wherein even ſuch perſons as theſe are under a tye of
beleeving,] but all others (I affirm) are ſimply and
directly under an obligation of beleeving on <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas you further argue; If ſo, then are they
under this obligation, either by the Law of Nature,
or elſe by ſome poſitive Law of God; and affirm,
that by neither; and hence conclude, not at all: I
anſwer; The obligation you ſpeak of lieth upon
them, by the force and authority of both theſe Laws.
Firſt, The Law of Nature requireth all Men, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all Men, 1. To ſeek and enquire after God, <hi>i. e.</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47308:16"/>
the Knowledge of his Nature, Attributes, Excellency
and Perfection of Being. 2. After the richeſt and
beſt Diſcoveries of his Will and Pleaſure concerning
men, which are any where to he found. 3. (And
laſtly) This Law requireth likewiſe of all Men, to
ſubmit unto every part of the Will and Pleaſure of
God concerning them, being any ways made known
to them. Otherwiſe we muſt hold, either that this
Law teacheth not men, to regard, minde, look, or
liſten after any Manifeſtation or Dicovery, which
God makes of himſelf in any part of the World, but
onely neer to them, and (as the ſaying is) under their
noſes, or within their own threſholds; or elſe that it
teacheth them to reſt ſatisfied with ſuch. Diſcoveries
in this kinde, which are imperfect, and unſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
or laſtly, that it doth not teach them to ſubmit to
the Will of God in all things, as far as it ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
unto them. None of all which can be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with truth, or likelyhood of truth. Firſt then, if
the Law of Nature requireth of all Men (except the
before excepted) to enquire after the beſt and fulleſt
Diſcovery, which God any where maketh of himſelf,
his Will and Pleaſure concerning Men; And, 2. if
the Goſpel be the fulleſt and richeſt Diſcovery in this
kinde, which he hath made, or which is to be found
(which I preſume is no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> mans Queſtion:)
And laſtly, if it be the expreſs revealed Will of God
in this Goſpel-Diſcovery of himſelf, That all Men
who hear of it, or come to the knowledg of it, ſhould
beleeve in his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> it roundly follows,
That by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> all Men of years and
competent underſtanding, ſtand obliged to beleeve in
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> either in <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> if they have,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47308:16"/>
or have had, the letter of the Goſpel, or live, or have
lived, under the found of the Miniſtry of it; or elſe
in <hi>ſenſu diviſa, viz.</hi> in caſe the Goſpel hath never yet
in the Letter or Miniſtry of it been revealed unto
them.</p>
            <p>Nor is that which you alledg concerning the <hi>inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Light of Nature to diſcover, that there was, or
ever would be, ſuch a Man and Mediator as Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
much conſiderable to your purpoſe, though it ſhould
be granted in as ample terms, as you propound it. For
what though the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> be not ſufficient to
make ſuch a Diſcovery, yet is it ſufficient to teach
men that it is their Duty to enquire and harken out
what Diſcoveries God maketh of himſelf in the
World: and when they have heard of, or found out,
the Diſcovery you ſpeak of (I mean of ſuch a Man
and Mediator as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> it is able to inform and
teach them that it is their Duty to beleeve in him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
The Light of <hi>Nature</hi> (probably) is not
ſufficient to inform every Member or Subject in a
<hi>State</hi> or <hi>Commonwealth</hi> what Laws or Statutes the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
or Legiſtative Authority of their <hi>State,</hi>
will enact, or impoſe upon the reſpective Members
hereof. Nor can it reaſonably or equitably be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the perſons inveſted with the Legiſlative
Power, that they ſhould cauſe all the Laws which
they enact from time to time for the due Government
of their <hi>State,</hi> to be proclaimed by an Officer of <hi>State</hi>
at every particular mans door, no nor yet in every
particular Village or Town, to oblige the Inhabitants
to a ſubjection unto them. It is ſufficient for ſuch an
end and purpoſe as this, if they be proclaimed, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
or promulgated in the Metropolis or head
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47308:17"/>
City of this State, where, or from whence all and
every the reſpective Inhabitants and Subjects hereof,
may and ought to receive information of them, what
they be. And they that live moſt remote from the
ſaid <hi>Metropolis,</hi> or place, where the Publication of the
ſaid Laws is made, are notwithſtanding as well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to the obſervation and keeping of them, as the
Inhabitants of this City it ſelf, though theſe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their dwelling, have a readier and better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to come to the knowledg of them. In like
manner God being the Abſolute Monarch of, and
Lawgiver unto, the World, it is ſufficient for him,
and as much as can reaſonably be expected from him,
onely that he ſhould take care and provide, that that
great Law of Life and Death, the Goſpel, ſhould be
publiſhed, and promulgated in ſome eminent place,
or places of the World, from whence all other parts
of the World round about might have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to receive the Knowledg of it. Nor are any of the
reſpective Subjects of this great Kingdom of the
World, priviledged or exempted from yeelding O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
and Subjection to their King in that great
Law of his Goſpel, becauſe of any remoteneſs of
their dwellings from thoſe places, where he hath made
any ſolemn Publication of it, or becauſe he hath not
ſent a publique: Officer of Heaven, an Authorized
Miniſter of this Goſpel home to their Houſes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
or publiſh it within their doors. So that (by the
way) the meaning of thoſe Demands of the Apoſtle,
on which you inſiſt, <hi>How ſhall they beleeve on him, of
whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Preacher? and how ſhall they preach, except they
be ſent?</hi> the meaning (I ſay) of theſe Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47308:17"/>
or any of them, is not, either as if no man could
poſſibly beleeve the Goſpel, but he that had perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
heard it preached by a Miniſter, or that men could
never come to hear it, but onely from the mouth of
ſuch a Miniſter; or that none could publiſh it upon
ſuch terms, as to cauſe it to be beleeved by men, but
ſome ſuch Miniſter onely; all ſuch ſuppoſitions as
theſe are palpably irrelative to the minde of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
in thoſe Demands. His meaning in them is onely
to imply, 1. That the World, having generally ſo
corrupted themſelves with all manner of wickedneſs,
and voluntarily eſtranged their hearts and minds from
God, were in no likely poſture or condition to be
brought to <hi>beleeve on him</hi> by means of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or on
<hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, without the opportunity and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of ſome declaration or report of the Goſpel
made in one kinde or other unto them. 2. That they
were not like to hear of God, or of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in
the Goſpel, had there not been ſome, one, or more,
to have preached, or publiſhed it in the World.
3. (And laſtly) That there was no likelyhood, that
any ſuch man, or number of men, would ever have
been found or heard of, who ſhould, or would,
have preached or publiſhed the Goſpel, or Name of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> up and down the World, had they not
<hi>been ſent, i. e.</hi> had they not received both inſtructions
from God concerning the truth, tenor, and ſubſtance
of the Goſpel, and how they were to proceed in the
preaching of it, as alſo a ſpecial charge and injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from him to preach it accordingly. None of theſe
particulars give the leaſt intimation, as if no man
were either in a capacity, or under an obligation, to
beleeve the Goſpel, but onely they to whoſe habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47308:18"/>
ſome Miniſter of the Goſpel was, or ſhould be,
ſent to preach it. It is ſufficiently known, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
granted by Divines, that there were, and are,
ſeveral Nations and Countries in the World, unto
which none of the Apoſtles ever came to preach the
Goſpel: yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> informeth us, and that
with an emphatical aſſeveration, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tranſlated,
<hi>verily,</hi> that <hi>their ſound went forth into all the Earth, and
their words unto the end of the World, Rom.</hi> 10. 18. How
can this aſſertion of his ſtand, but in the ſtrength of
this rational ſuppoſition, That their preaching and
publiſhing the Goſpel in ſuch parts and places of the
World, where they came and had opportunity to do
it, was vertually and conſtructively a preaching and
publiſhing of it throughout the whole World; and
that thoſe Nations, unto which the Apoſtles did not
preach it perſonally, had yet a gracious opportunity
to come to the Knowledg of it, by means of their
preaching and ſpreading of it ſo far, and in ſuch
Countries, as they did? And unleſs ſuch a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as this be admitted, we muſt fall hard and heavy
in our cenſures upon the Apoſtles, and conceive of
them as men unfaithful and defective in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that High Commiſſion, and moſt weighty
Charge, impoſed on them by the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the preaching of the Goſpel; the Tenor
whereof (as we know) was, that they ſhould <hi>go, and
teach</hi> ALL <hi>Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 28. 19.
And again (as another Evangeliſt draweth it up) that
they ſhould <hi>go into</hi> ALL <hi>the World, and preach the
Goſpel to</hi> EVERY <hi>Creature.</hi> No Interpretation of
what the Apoſtles did, in, or about the diſcharge of
this their Commiſſion (the equity of this Commiſſion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47308:18"/>
ſalved) can render them obedient and faithful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
unto their great Lord and Maſter, but onely that
which ſuppoſeth <hi>every Creature</hi> to have been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
Evangelized or taught by them, in the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of that party of the <hi>Creature,</hi> or of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Creatures,</hi> which were actually and perſonally
<hi>taught</hi> by them: and that all the World was put into
a ſufficient capacity of beleeving, or (which is the
ſame) into a way of having the Goſpel even in the
letter of it made known unto them, by their enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
thoſe parts of the World with the Knowledg
of it, in which they preached it. Nor can that of the
Apoſtle claim the honor of truth, where, ſpeaking
of the Goſpel, he ſaith, it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (the word ſo
emphatically urged by you) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
i. e. <hi>preached unto every Creature which is under
Heaven, (Col.</hi> 1. 23.) but upon the account and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of ſuch a conſtruction.</p>
            <p>But, 2. neither will my Principles allow me to
gratifie you with my belief of this your ſaying (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
very rigidly underſtood, and in ſuch a ſence
wherein it will little accommodate your cauſe) That
<hi>the Light of Nature, neither can, nor ever could, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to Mankinde, that there was, or ever would be, ſuch
a Man, and Mediator as Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> What the
<hi>Light of Nature</hi> hath <hi>de facto</hi> diſcovered unto Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
may much better be known and judged of, then
what <hi>it can,</hi> or could, diſcover. I confeſs my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
concerning the extent of the Power and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of <hi>the Light of Nature</hi> carefully preſerved, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
managed, and induſtriouſly improved and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
run very high: and I judg that the greateſt
part of what this <hi>Light</hi> hath hitherto <hi>diſcovered unto
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47308:19"/>
Mankinde,</hi> is not commenſurable to the leaſt part of
what it is, and hath been, <hi>able</hi> to diſcover. But what
if it be granted, That <hi>it neither is, nor hath been able to
diſcover, that there was, or ever would be, ſuch a Man
and Mediator, as Jeſus Chriſt, viz.</hi> in all particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
relating to his Perſon, wherein the Goſpel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
him to the World, yet may it be <hi>able</hi> ſo far to
diſcover him, that a man by the diſcovery may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
perſwaded, through, or by means of him, to
depend upon God, for the Pardon of his Sins, and
Salvation of his Perſon, yea and this to the real ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of both at the hand of God. I have no ground
at all to beleeve or think, that ſuch <hi>Jews,</hi> who before,
and under, yea and long after <hi>Moſes,</hi> did beleeve in
God unto Salvation, had <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> diſcovered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them in any ſuch Viſion of Particularities, as that
exhibited in the Goſpel. The ſum and ſubſtance of
what they (at leaſt the far greater part of them) appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
knew, or beleeved concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not (I ſuppoſe) to much more then this; <hi>viz.</hi> That
God had found out, and pleaſed himſelf in, a way or
means, how to ſhew Mercy and to forgive the Sins,
and ſave the Souls, of ſuch who ſhould put their truſt
in him, and live righteouſly and holily in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
World. For that God did not <hi>declare, [i. e.</hi> make
plainly and fully known in the World] upon what
account of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> or Juſtice, he pardoned ſin
committed in the World before the great Attonement
made by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> until this Attonement
was actually made, is evident by this paſſage of the
Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 3. 24, 25, 26. Being juſtified freely by
his Grace through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt;
whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation through Faith
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47308:19"/>
in his Blood,</hi> TO DECLARE HIS RIGHTEOUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS
FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS THAT
ARE PAST, <hi>through the forbearance of God;</hi> [mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that God through his great patience, or ſtrength
of forbearance, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, remitted ſin, even
long before any Satisfaction or Attonement made for
it;] <hi>To declare, I ſay; at this time [viz.</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſuffered in the fleſh] <hi>his Righteouſneſs, that he might be
juſt, and a Juſtifier of him that is of the Faith of Jeſus,
i. e.</hi> that he might appear to be, and to have been, <hi>juſt,</hi>
in <hi>juſtifying him [i. e.</hi> every one, or whoſoever]
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that was, is, or ſhall be a Beleever in
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> From this laſt clauſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that is of
the Faith of Jeſus, i. e.</hi> that beleeves, or depends, on
<hi>Chriſt</hi> for Righteouſneſs (relating in ſpecial manner to
the beleeving <hi>Jews</hi> before the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the
fleſh,) it is obſervable, that they are reputed by God
(and conſequently, ought to be ſo reputed by men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo)
Beleevers in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not onely who know him by
Name, or in the hypoſtatical union of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or the like, and beleeve on him under ſuch a
Notion as this (for thus the beleeving <hi>Jews,</hi> who were
juſtified by God before the Coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knew him, nor beleeved on him, as was formerly
ſaid,) but alſo they that <hi>beleeve on God by, or through
him</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21.) <hi>i. e.</hi> who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Grace purchaſed or procured by him, or by
any Providence, or Diſpenſation, one or more, iſſued
by God for his ſake, or upon his account, in the
World, are brought, or prevailed with, to depend on
God for the forgiveneſs of their ſins upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
And that the <hi>Jews</hi> I ſpeak of, when they
did beleeve on God unto Juſtification, did not expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47308:20"/>
or by Name, beleeve in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſeems to
me very apparant from thoſe words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his
Apoſtles, <hi>Joh. 14. 1. Ye beleeve in God: beleeve alſo
in me.</hi> If they had beleeved in him as explicitely, and
diſtinctly, as they did beleeve in God, there had been
no more ground, why he ſhould exhort or encourage
them to beleeve in him, then in God: nor why he
ſhould have owned them in their belief in God, more
then in their belief in himſelf. And that that their <hi>belief
in God,</hi> which our Savior here acknowledgeth in them,
was unto Juſtification, I ſuppoſe that you neither will,
nor reaſonably can, deny. Now then if ſuch a Faith,
which had <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> onely vertually and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively
in it, and none but God himſelf explicitely,
and directly, was notwithſtanding available to the
Juſtification of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had better opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of means for an explicite Knowledg of him, then
the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> much more reaſonable is it to conceive
that the like Faith will be accepted in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to
their Juſtification; eſpecially conſidering, 1. That ſame
Divine Attribute, which the Scripture calls, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a non-acceptation of perſons (ſo frequently
aſſerted and inculcated by the Holy Ghoſt in the
Scriptures:) and, 2. That the Juſtification of men,
is a judiciary act awarded, according to the Tenor of
a known Law, by God.</p>
            <p>Beſides, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is in ſuch a Faith, by
which men are actually enabled to come with accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
unto God, I preſume you will not deny, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſaith, <hi>No man cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Father, but by me, Joh.</hi> 14. 6. That by ſuch a
Faith, whereby a man beleeves, 1. <hi>That God is:</hi>
2. <hi>That he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:47308:20"/>
he is enabled thus to <hi>come unto God,</hi> is the expreſs Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6. And that the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi>
who never had the advantage of the letter of
the Goſpel, were notwithſtanding, partly by the
Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> partly by the Works of <hi>Creation,</hi>
partly by the patient and gracious Adminiſtrations of
God in the courſe of his Providence towards the
World, in a very ſufficient capacity of attaining ſuch
a Faith as this, if I judged it matter of queſtion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to your ſelf, or any other conſidering man, might
be largely demonſtrated, not onely from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but even by many pregnant Teſtimonies extant
in the Writings of the <hi>Heathen</hi> themſelves. Not to
impoſe any great tax upon you, though for your
own ſatisfaction, in this kinde, if you will pleaſe to
peruſe onely the fifth and nineteenth Chapters of the
<hi>L. du Pleſs is de Veritate Religionis Chriſtianae,</hi> you will
find by ſeveral paſſages drawn together by this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author from the Writings of ſuch <hi>Heathens</hi> as we
now ſpeak of, 1. That <hi>the Light of Nature</hi> was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to <hi>diſcover</hi> unto them ſomewhat concerning
<hi>Chriſt:</hi> And, 2. (and more clearly) That they did
(I mean, many of them, and conſequently, that more,
yea, that all, might) beleeve, both <hi>that God was,</hi> and
that <hi>He is a Rewarder of thoſe, who diligently ſeek him.</hi>
And I preſume you know that much more of this
latter import might readily be cited from the Books
and Writings of ſeveral others of them, not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by the late named Author. Again,</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Heathen</hi> we ſpeak of (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all Men without exception) had, and at this day
have, a tye upon them by the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is evident upon this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47308:21"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe this Law obligeth all Men to do
that, which is eſſentially conducing to their ſoveraign
Welfare and Peace, and without which it is unpoſſible
for them to eſcape ruine, and deſtruction. And if
men ſtand bound by the Law we ſpeak of, to uſe ſuch
means for the preſervation of their natural Lives and
Beings, without which they cannot reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
or judg that they ſhould be preſerved; much
more muſt they needs be obliged by the ſame Law
to provide things needful for their eternal ſafety and
well-being, and without which they cannot, upon any
reaſonable account, expect or look for theſe ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly-neceſſary
accommodations. Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſaith expreſly; <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any
other,</hi> [meaning, but in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,] for there is none
other Name under Heaven given among men whereby we</hi>
[men] <hi>muſt be ſaved, (Acts</hi> 4. 12.) and this by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
on this Name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. Theſe latter
words, <hi>There is no other Name</hi> UNDER HEAVEN <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
&amp;c.</hi> clearly overthrow two of the main Pillars
of your Diſcourſe, which are theſe; 1. That this
Law of Salvation, <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth, ſhall be ſaved,</hi>
reſpecteth onely ſuch, unto whom the Letter, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Miniſtry of the Goſpel is ſent, and that there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Law, Covenant, or Promiſe, by which others
ſhall, or may, be ſaved, (which by the way, I look
upon as a very adventurous Poſition, and of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conſequence.) 2. That ſuch a Repentance, which
neither includeth, nor ſuppoſeth Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in
one kinde or other, and whereof perſons unevange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
(in the ſence oft mentioned) are capable, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable
to theſe perſons unto Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For if <hi>there be none other Name</hi> [but that of <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47308:21"/>
Chriſt]</hi> UNDER HEAVEN <hi>given among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
&amp;c. i. e.</hi> no other method, courſe, way, or means
whatſoever vouchſafed by God unto men for their
Salvation, it demonſtratively follows, 1. That this
Law of Salvation, <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth on Jeſus Chriſt,
ſhall be ſaved,</hi> with that of Condemnation (oppoſite
to it) <hi>He that beleeveth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> doth not
reſpect onely perſons Goſpelized (in the ſence decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,)
ſo that theſe onely ſhall be either ſaved, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
according to the different tenor and import
of them; but the generality or univerſality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
where ever the Faculties of Reaſon, Judgment,
Conſcience, Underſtanding, &amp;c. are found in any
competent growth or maturity. 2. That no Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
whatſoever, which hath not <hi>the Name, i. e.</hi> the
vertue, grace, merit, influence (in one kinde or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in it, will avail any man unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Nor is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12. any ways
contradicting that which hath been now ſaid: <hi>For as
many as have ſinned without Law, ſhall alſo periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Law: and as many as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall
be judged by the Law.</hi> For the intent and purport of
this paſſage onely is to ſhew, that God in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Condemnation of wicked men, will have
reſpect to the different degrees of means and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
which have been vouchſafed unto them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively,
for the reſtraining of them from the ways
of ſin and wickedneſs; and to imply withall, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Letter and oral Miniſtry of the Scriptures,
or Word of God (frequently termed, the <hi>Law)</hi> ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
to the Law and Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantages (common unto all men) of the Works
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47308:22"/>
of Creation, Providence, &amp;c. are a means of greater
efficacy and a more potent tendency to reſtrain from
ſin, then thoſe other alone, and without theſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they, who ſhall be found to have lived wickedly
and ungodlily under theſe, ſhall receive a greater
Damnation, then thoſe who have lived ſinfully under
the want of them.</p>
            <p>If it be yet further objected (againſt the Argument
in hand) That the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> cannot oblige men
to things unpoſſible, no not in order to their own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
or Peace; and therefore cannot oblige
thoſe to beleeve in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to whom he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
preached, this being unpoſſible unto ſuch perſons,
as theſe: To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That the ſinews of this reaſoning have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
cut, where we proved, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is ſo,
ſo far, and upon ſuch terms, preached, or made known
unto all Men without exception, that no man lieth
under an impoſſibility of beleeving in him; I mean,
of beleeving in him upon ſuch terms, which will be
available to his Salvation, (as hath been formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.)
But,</p>
            <p>2. I anſwer yet further, That if the poſitive, or
written, Law, or Word, of God, bindeth men unto
that which is unpoſſible, what Reaſon can there be
given, why the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> may not do the like?
(eſpecially conſidering that this is the Law of God, as
well as that.) But that the poſitive or written Law of
God requireth things unpoſſible of men, is (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
your own Sence and Judgment; certain I am,
it is the general Sence of thoſe, who are Enemies to
the Doctrine of Univerſal Attonement.</p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) Were it granted that the Law of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47308:22"/>
               <hi>Nature</hi> doth not binde to things impoſſible, <hi>in ſenſu
diviſo,</hi> yet it may very equitably and well binde to
things unpoſſible, <hi>in ſenſu compoſito.</hi> As for example;
ſuppoſe I have a Childe, or Wife, lying ſick in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Chamber, or room in my Houſe, and at preſent I
am below; the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> in this caſe bindeth me
to viſit them, which yet is unpoſſible for me to do,
whileſt I remain below, and in my preſent poſture of
abſence from them. But becauſe I may very poſſibly
go and get up to them by the opportunity of ſuch
ſtairs or ſteps, which are purpoſely provided to make
the way into this Chamber paſſable for men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the tye which is upon me by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi>
to viſit them, is no ways hard, or unreaſonable. In
like manner, were it granted, that men who never
heard of the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are, in their preſent
condition, poſture, and frame, under an impoſſibility
of beleeving on him, and ſo not bound by the Law of
<hi>Nature</hi> to beleeve on him, during this incapacity; yet
this no ways proveth, but that they may ſtand bound
by this Law to beleeve on him, yea and that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
is poſſible enough to them, <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> (as
hath been ſaid) though not <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> that is,
by uſing ſuch means, and applying themſelves to
ſuch a courſe, whereof they are, actually, and <hi>de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti,</hi>
capable, and which have a proper and direct
tendency to enable them to beleeve actually in due
time. <hi>Sed de his, priùs.</hi> Nor do I beleeve that any
perſon whatſoever of Mankinde (ſuch only excepted,
who have ſinned <hi>the ſin unto death,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> expreſſeth
it, who, in and by the ſaid ſin, caſt in their lot with
Devils, and deſerve no longer to be numbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men) liveth under any ſimple, abſolute, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47308:23"/>
impoſſibility of being ſaved. Yea if it ſhall
be ſuppoſed, that any other perſon lieth under ſuch
an impoſſibility, it muſt needs take off from the hearts
and conſciences of men much of that fear and dread,
which are of a very ſoveraign conſequence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to preſerve them from the horrid guilt of that
ſin. And thus (I truſt) I have given a fair and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
account unto you of the truth of this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
That all Men ſtand bound by the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to beleeve on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> or at leaſt (in your
own phraſe) ſomewhat that ſeems to me very like to
ſuch an account. Again,</p>
            <p>2. That the like Obligation is impoſed by God
upon all Men (in the ſence explained, and avouched)
by a written, or poſitive Law, is (I ſuppoſe) of a like
ready and eaſie demonſtration. When the Holy Ghoſt
by the mouth of the Kingly Prophet admoniſheth and
calls upon the Kings and Judges of the Earth, thus:
<hi>Kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way,
when his wrath is kindled, &amp;c. (Pſal.</hi> 2. 12.) 1. By
<hi>the Son,</hi> evident it is (and Interpreters generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
that the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> is meant. 2. That by <hi>kiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
this <hi>Son,</hi> is meant ſuch ſubjection to him, which
includeth, or preſuppoſeth Faith (at leaſt) in him, is
ſo evident likewiſe, that I know no Expoſitor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
minded. And beſides, this clauſe, <hi>leſt he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and ye periſh, &amp;c.</hi> plainly evinceth it; in as much
as no <hi>kiſsing him,</hi> or ſubjection to him, without beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on him, will prevent his anger. 3. (And laſtly)
That by the <hi>Kings and Judges of the Earth,</hi> he doth
not (in the firſt place) mean ſome of theſe onely, as
(for example) thoſe who have the Goſpel preached
unto them, with an excluſion of the reſt; nor, 2. That
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47308:23"/>
by <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges of the Earth,</hi> he means the meer
perſons of men inveſted with theſe dignities, but (by
a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> and according to the frequent dialect of
the Scriptures) thoſe entire Bodies and Communities
of men, of which <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> are the Heads,
are things, both ſo rational in themſelves, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable
alſo from the firſt Verſe of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and
indeed from the whole carriage of it, that to give any
further proof of them, were but to light up a Candle
to the Sun. Or if it ſhall be importunely, and as it
were by the teeth, held and maintained, that none but
the perſons themſelves of <hi>Kings and Judges</hi> are here
meant; yet will it even from hence, and this with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriety
of conſequence, follow, That all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and conſequently, all the World, ſtand bound,
by vertue, as well of the ſame Command, as of the
ſame Caveat, or Threatening, to exhibit the ſame
Subjection unto the Son of God. <hi>Muſculus</hi> may be
conſulted upon the place<note n="h" place="margin">Expenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus etiam quanta ſitiſta Chriſti Filii hominis majeſtas, potentia, &amp; gloria, quod ad pedum illius oſcula Reges terrae, abſque ulla diſcriminatione, quanti quanti ſint, vocantur. Quis nam mortalium ab hac ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſione excipitur, quando illa ipſis quoque regibus imponitur? <hi>Muſculus,</hi> in Pſal. 2. Verſ. 12.</note>.</p>
            <p>Again, when the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> aſſerteth this to be
the <hi>Commandment</hi> of God, <hi>that we ſhould beleeve on the
Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23.) he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be conceived to ſpeak onely of Saints, or ſuch
who are Beleevers already, as if theſe onely were the
men, whom God commands to beleeve in the Name
of his Son: for then it would follow, that every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
in the firſt act of beleeving ſuper-erogates, and
doth more then God requires of him by any Law,
Precept, or Commandment of his. Nor, 2. can he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47308:24"/>
reaſonably be conceived to ſpeak of ſuch onely, who
have the Letter or oral Miniſtry of the Goſpel ſent, or
granted, unto them: becauſe then (in like proceſs of
conſequence) it will follow, that in caſe any of thoſe,
to whom the ſaid Priviledges are not vouchſafed, ſhall
beleeve in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he alſo ſhall ſuper-erogate, and do
more in a way of righteouſneſs, then God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him. Therefore when this Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is the
Commandment of God, that</hi> WE <hi>ſhould beleeve, &amp;c.</hi>
his meaning is not, either, 1. That <hi>WE</hi> Saints, with
the excluſion of all others; nor, 2. That <hi>WE</hi> who
have the Goſpel preached by men to us, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of all others: But, 3. (and laſtly) That <hi>WE</hi>
Men, with the incluſion of all other men whatſoever,
ſhould beleeve.</p>
            <p>If it be objected and ſaid; That ſuch men, who
have neither the Letter, nor oral Miniſtry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
are in no capacity, no poſſibility of beleeving:
and therefore to argue, that in caſe they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
they ſhould ſuper-erogate, is to argue, not onely
from an unſound, but even from an unpoſſible ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
and no better, then if a man ſhould argue,
thus; If a ſtone, or a brute beaſt, ſhould with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
or intelligible voyce, magnifie God, they ſhould
ſuper-erogate, becauſe there is no Commandment
impoſed upon them by God to do ſuch a thing: To
this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That it hath been already ſufficiently proved,
that the ſuppoſition which this Objection faulteth, is
neither impoſſible, no nor yet unſound; but that ſuch
perſons, who neither have the letter of the Goſpel, nor
yet the preaching of it by men, are notwithſtanding
in a capacity of beleeving. I add,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:47308:24"/>
2. That if there be an impoſſibility that ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhould beleeve, then their beleeving ſuppoſeth,
or includeth, ſome other thing which is unpoſſible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
For this is a true Rule, and of unqueſtionable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
<hi>Poſsibile eſt, quo poſito, nihil ſequitur impoſsible:</hi>
That is poſſible, upon the ſuppoſal whereof no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
followeth. Now in caſe it ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that a man without the Letter, or oral Miniſtry
of the Goſpel, ſhould, or might, beleeve, it cannot
reaſonably be imagined what impoſſibility would
follow (I mean, in argument, or ſuppoſal) hereupon.
Therefore there is no impoſſibility that ſuch a perſon
as we ſpeak of, ſhould beleeve.</p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) In caſe men deſtitute at preſent of
the Letter, and Miniſtry of the Goſpel by men, ſhould
not ſtand bound by ſome Law, or Commandment
of God, to beleeve, then, in caſe either the ſaid Letter,
or Miniſtry ſhall at any time hereafter be vouchſafed
unto them, they muſt either be ſuppoſed to remain
ſtill as much diſobliged from beleeving, as before
(which, I preſume, is none of your thoughts,) or elſe,
that there is ſome new Commandment impoſed upon
them by God, which was not impoſed on them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Now with God (the Scripture plainly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
<hi>there is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning,</hi>
[or, change, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17.] Nor doth he create, or
make new Laws to ſubject men unto upon emergent
or accidental occaſions: but all his Laws were made,
given unto, and impoſed upon, men, before any new
emergency, or change of circumſtance, or condition,
befalleth them. So that (for example) he that hath
formerly been very poor, but hath of late a great and
plentiful Eſtate caſt upon him by God, doth not now
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47308:25"/>
ſtand charged <hi>to distribute, to do good, to be rich in good
works, &amp;c.</hi> by any new Commandment of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on him ſince his advancement in the World,
which did not oblige him before, but by vertue of
ſuch a Command, whereunto he was ſubject all the
time of his poverty, as well as ſince his being made
rich, although he ſtood not bound by it to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the tenor of it, but onely then, or at ſuch a time,
when and in caſe he ſhould become rich; and now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
not continually, but upon due and regular occaſions
onely. This Commandment of God, <hi>Thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Lord thy God,</hi> obligeth a man as well ſleeping,
as waking, as well in the midſt of his lawful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as at times of liberty and convenience for his
actual worſhiping of him: otherwiſe God muſt be
ſaid to take off this Law from men, as oft as they go
to ſleep, or to the labor of their ordinary Callings;
and again to lay it on them anew, as oft as they awake,
or ceaſe from their labor; or rather as oft (and as oft
onely) as they have opportunity actually to worſhip
him. Yet doth it not oblige any man to worſhip him
at ſuch a time, when, or whileſt he is ſleeping (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his ſleep in reſpect of the time or ſeaſon of it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)
nor yet whileſt he is at the work of his Calling,
ſuppoſing that herein he doth but that which is his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to do. I make no queſtion but you have often met
with that common Maxim of Divines: <hi>Praecepta af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmativa
ſemper obligant, ſed non ad ſemper:</hi> Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Precepts always binde, but not unto always, <hi>i. e.</hi>
not to a perpetual or uninterrupted practice of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whereunto they binde. A rich man ſtands always
bound to diſtribute to the poor, but not to diſtribute
always, but onely upon all <hi>Christian</hi> Occaſions and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47308:25"/>
Opportunities. So a Miniſter ſtands always bound to
preach to his People: but he doth not ſtand bound to
preach always or continually to them. In like manner
ſuppoſe it were granted, that an <hi>Heathen,</hi> who never
heard of the Goſpel, nor of the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor
ever had opportunity to hear of either, doth not ſtand
bound to beleeve (formally, or explicitely) in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
whileſt he remains under theſe diſadvantages for ſuch
a beleeving; yet this proveth not, but that even ſuch a
perſon, ſtands ſimply and abſolutely bound to beleeve
in him, and this upon the terms ſpecified: or in caſe the
Goſpel ſhall at any time afterwards be ſent unto him
by God, that he now ſtands bound to beleeve by a
Commandment newly given or impoſed upon him
by God, and not by vertue of that Commandment,
wherewith he ſtood charged before.</p>
            <p>Nor is that Text <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. cited by me to prove
an univerſal Obligation poſitively impoſed by God
upon all Men to beleeve on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> diſabled by any
attempt made by you in that behalf; the words being
theſe: <hi>And the times of this ignorance God winked at:
but now commandeth all Men every where to repent, &amp;c.</hi>
For, 1. We have demonſtratively (I ſuppoſe) proved
already, That the Repentance here mentioned, and
commanded by God unto <hi>all Men every where,</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
or preſuppoſeth, Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that no
<hi>Repentance</hi> whatſoever, is, or can be, actually ſaving,
but onely ſuch, which is influenced or raiſed by Faith
in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of one kinde or other, either formal and
explicite, or elſe conſequential, implicite and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative.
2. It hath been in like manner proved,
that theſe Univerſals, <hi>all Men, every where,</hi> cannot
reaſonably, nor with that Reverence and Honor
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47308:26"/>
which are due to Scripture-expreſſions, be here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to ſuch, either perſons, or places, to whom, or
where, the Goſpel had been then actually ſent, and
preached, when the words were uttered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
or ſhould afterwards be thus ſent and preached;
but are to be extended to <hi>all Men</hi> ſimply, and to every
Nation under Heaven; in as much as there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for ſuch a cautionary, or reſtrictive Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Whereas you further argue from the <hi>Antitheſis</hi>
here made by the Apoſtle, between the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the <hi>times of ignorance,</hi> and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>preſent
times</hi> (when the Apoſtle ſpake the words) or times of
the Goſpel-Light, that how ever God in theſe latter,
<hi>commands all Men every where to Repent,</hi> yet under
thoſe other he did not; I anſwer, 1. That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
which you hence infer, fights directly (if I
miſtake not) againſt your own ſence (otherwhere aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
in your Papers) both concerning an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lying upon <hi>Adam</hi> to repent, in the <hi>interim</hi> between
his Fall, and the Promulgation of the Goſpel to him;
as likewiſe concerning the like Obligation lying upon
all his poſterity (without exception, unleſs onely of
ſuch, who either through defect of years, or of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
or through inexpiableneſs of guilt, are
uncapable of Repentance) whether the Letter or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
of the Goſpel hath been vouchſafed unto them,
or no. For by what Law perſons, who never heard
of the Goſpel, ſtand now, or whileſt the Goſpel
ſhines in other parts of the World, bound to Repent,
by the ſame they ſtood bound to Repent-likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the coming of the Goſpel into the World.
Therefore you cannot with the ſafety of your own
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47308:26"/>
Principles, but confeſs, that <hi>all Men every where,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, under thoſe <hi>times of ignorance</hi>
of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and before <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

the two differing times mentioned import any
ſuch different Diſpenſation of God, under the one,
and the other, as if he had left men free from all and
all manner of Command and Obligation to Repent,
under the former, and onely charged them with this
duty under the latter; but onely ſheweth, or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
that that Obligation to repent, which lay upon
men under the former, the <hi>times of ignorance,</hi> was but
weak, faint, obſcure, and with little authority upon
the Conſciences of men, in compariſon of that tye,
obligation, or engagement hereunto, which God by
an expreſs Command impoſeth upon the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the latter (the times of the Goſpel.) This to be
the genuine and true import of the ſaid <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
1. By the frequent and familiar uſage of the
Scripture in like caſes: 2. By conſideration of the
ſtate and condition of the <hi>Heathen</hi> throughout the
World in the Point in queſtion, before the times of
the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is a thing of frequent Obſervation amongſt
Expoſitors and Divines, that the Holy Ghoſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to mention and aſſert any conſiderable encreaſe or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47308:27"/>
advance of ſome former Diſpenſation, is wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it in ſimple, poſitive, and abſolute terms, and as
if it were a new kinde of Diſpenſation, and which
had not formerly been known, or heard of in the
World<note n="i" place="margin">Non enim muſitatum aut rarum eſt in Scriptura eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Premiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, vel Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictiones, vel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res alias ſemel jam datas &amp; commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, poſtea di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſis tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus tanquam novas denuo tradere &amp; commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <hi>Pererius</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 9.</note>.

and peculiar nature and conſideration, then his former
preſence had been; in as much as he was now in the
eſtate of the Reſurrection, whereas in his former being
with them, he was but in the ordinary condition of
men. When <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prieſts ſpake thus unto all
<hi>Iſrael; Take heed, and harken, O Iſrael, that this day
thou art become the People of the Lord thy God; (Deut.</hi>
27. 9.) their meaning was not to imply, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had been <hi>the People of the Lord</hi> until now, <hi>[i. e.</hi>
a People whom God had owned and countenanced
from Heaven, taken into Covenant with himſelf, &amp;c.]
but that God by the conſtant Tenor of his gracious
Adminiſtrations towards them from time to time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
that day, had made them now more his People,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47308:27"/>
then ever, had further declared himſelf to be their
God, and to accept and own them for a People pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to him, then formerly: and that upon this account
it concerned them more neerly, then ever, to harken
unto him, and obey his voyce. In like Notion our
Saviour promiſeth his Diſciples that he <hi>will pray the
Father, and that he ſhould give them another Comforter,
even the Spirit of Truth,</hi> when as in the very ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
or paſſage of ſpeech, he affirmeth that this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi>
or <hi>Spirit,</hi> was already given them, or (which
is the ſame) <hi>dwelt</hi> now with, or in, them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 15,
16. So that he mentioneth a larger Effuſion or Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſame Spirit, as if it were the primitive or
firſt gift thereof. In like manner, when being now
upon his Journey for the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the
dead, he ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>I am glad for your ſakes
that I was not there, to the intent that you</hi> MIGT BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEEVE,
<hi>(Joh.</hi> 11. 15.) he expreſſeth their beleeving
to a further degree, as if it were the firſt of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
and that they had not beleeved before.
Whereas it is evident from <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 11, 22. and other
places, that they had beleeved on him before. When
the Apoſtle affirms this to be Gods end in chaſtiſing
his People, That they might be Partakers of his Holineſs,
<hi>(Hebr.</hi> 12. 10.) he doth not ſuppoſe that they were in
no degree <hi>partakers of his Holineſs</hi> before their chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but he expreſſeth a fuller and richer participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereof, as if it were a ſimple, abſolute, or original
participation in this kinde. So again when the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt
<hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given,
becauſe Jeſus was not glorified, (Joh.</hi> 7. 39.) his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not, that the Spirit had in no meaſure been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
given, (for queſtionleſs all thoſe who under
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47308:28"/>
the Law beleeved, and ſo thoſe, who in the days of our
Saviours converſe on Earth, before his Glorification,
beleeved unto Juſtification, were led hereunto by
the <hi>Spirit</hi> here ſpoken of;) but he expreſſeth that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
and moſt remarkable Donation and pouring
out of it upon the Apoſtles and others, after, upon, and
by vertue of Chriſts Aſcention into Glory, as if it had
been the firſt, and only giving of it. And it is a good
rule or obſervation, which <hi>Teſtardus</hi> delivers hereupon.
<hi>Thoſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are ſaid not to be, or not to be done,

under debate) that God <hi>now</hi> [in the times of the
Goſpel] <hi>commandeth all men every where to repent,</hi> it
doth not neceſſarily imply, that God never till <hi>now
commanded</hi> the ſame thing. (I mean, <hi>Repentance)</hi> unto
them; but that <hi>now</hi> he <hi>commanded</hi> it upon other terms,
with more expreſſneſs and particularity of Command,
upon more lively and pregnant grounds, or motives,
with another edg of Authority, under greater ſeverity,
of puniſhment threatened in caſe of diſobedience, then
he had commanded it formerly. Many inſtances from
the Scriptures have been preſented unto you, (and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, I doubt not, upon a little further ſearch
might be added unto them,) wherein ſuch a conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as this muſt of neceſſity be admitted. And that
this is the true and genuine ſence of the place in hand,
appears yet further by the latter conſideration men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
which reſpects the ſtate or condition of all
Mankind under the <hi>times of that ignorance,</hi> of which
the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and before the days of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
For that the World was then under a <hi>Command</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:47308:28"/>
from God to Repent, is evident from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
otherwiſe their impenitency, and obdurate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in ſuch ways and practiſes, which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Law of God, yea and the Law of Nature it
ſelf, had been no ſin in them, nor obligatory unto pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
the Apoſtles aſſertion being expreſs, that it
is <hi>the Law that worketh Wrath, [i. e.</hi> that ſubjecteth men
unto puniſhment,] becauſe <hi>where no Law is, there is no
tranſgreſsion, (Rom.</hi> 4. 15.) meaning (as he expreſſeth
himſelf upon the account in the Chapter following,
verſ. 13.) <hi>that ſin is not imputed [i. e.</hi> charged upon
men, or puniſhed] <hi>where there is no Law.</hi> So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we ſhall ſuppoſe the World to have been abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lawleſs, and that the generality of men might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
contracting any guilt, or making themſelves liable
unto puniſhment, have committed all the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which they did commit, yea and ten times more,
until the times of the Goſpel, we muſt of neceſſity
make or ſuppoſe them ſubject to ſome Law, or other
of God, whereby he <hi>commands Repentance</hi> unto men.
Yea the Apoſtle himſelf, in the ſame Sermon, and a
very few verſes before the words in conteſt, plainly
ſuppoſeth the men we ſpeak of, even <hi>all the Nations of
men,</hi> to have been, all the time before the Goſpel, under
an engagement or obligation from God, to have <hi>ſought
him,</hi> which ſuppoſeth (at leaſt) their <hi>repentance. And
hath made of one blood all Nations of men, for to dwell on
all the face of the Earth, and hath determined the times
before appointed, and the bounds of their habitations, that</hi>
THEY SHOULD SEEK THE LORD, <hi>if haply they might
feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from
every one of us, &amp;c. Act.</hi> 17. 26, 27. His meaning is,
that God hath taken ſuch a wiſe and gracious courſe,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47308:29"/>
1. In the creation and forming of men. 2. In diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and governing them, that they might be in a good
capacity of <hi>ſeeking</hi> him, and this ſo as to <hi>finde</hi> him
(and conſequently to enjoy him, and to be made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and bleſſed by him) although their minds and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
were much darkened through corrupt
principles, which they had voluntarily drank in, and
ſinful practices wherein they had walked, in as much
as he was neer enough to them all, to have been <hi>found</hi>
by them, even by groping, or feeling, as men uſe to
ſeek for things in the dark; meaning, that by a very
low ſtrain of induſtry, an ordinary diligence and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
they might have diſcovered and <hi>found</hi> him out,
ſo far as to have worſhipped and ſerved him with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
and this under all thoſe great diſadvantages
for the finding him out, which they had brought upon
themſelves. Theſe things import much more then
their being under a ſimple Command from God to
Repent; though it is true, that a Command to Repent,
vertually and with interpretation, contains and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the whole duty of man.</p>
            <p>Nor do theſe words, which you urge and inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>And the times of this ignorance God winked at,</hi> import
any thing contrary to what hath been now argued, or
as if God had neither taken, nor meant to take, any
account at all of thoſe Heathen, who, before the times
of the Goſpel, had only the Books of Nature, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Creation, to inſtruct them, for their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors
in ſinning. The Apoſtle expreſly ſaith,
that <hi>as many as have ſinned without the Law, ſhall periſh
without the Law, Rom.</hi> 2. 12. And a little before: <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
and anguiſh upon every Soul of him that doth
evil; of the Jew firſt, and</hi> ALSO OF THE GENTILE,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47308:29"/>
(to omit much more that might be readily cited from
the ſame Apoſtle to the ſame purpoſe.) Therefore
when God is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to have over-looked, or
<hi>winked at the times of ignorance, [i. e.</hi> the ways and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of men under theſe <hi>times,]</hi> it is to be underſtood
in a comparative ſence, implying onely ſome ſuch
thing as this, That whileſt means for the Converſion
of Men from Sin to Righteouſneſs, and for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them to the true Knowledg and Fear of God,
were but low, ſcant, and weak in the World, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of what they are now advanced unto by the
ſhining of the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt
amongſt men, God was nothing ſo ſevere to mark
what was done amiſs, nothing ſo ſwift to execute
Judgment, or take Vengeance on Tranſgreſſors, as
now he is, and intends to be, under the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> the
vouchſafement whereof unto the World, is as the <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Ax to the root of the Trees,</hi> upon which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the <hi>hewing down, and caſting into the fire, every
tree, that bringeth not forth good fruit, Mat.</hi> 3. 10. This
ſence is both very agreeable to the Scripture-phraſe,
which frequently and familiarly expreſſeth a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
ſence in a poſitive and abſolute form, (ſee <hi>Joh.</hi>
6. 27. 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 17. Luk. 12. 4. Joh. 7. 39. Gal.</hi> 4. 9.
not to mention other places of like purport, without
number,) and likewiſe perfectly accordeth with that
Principle of Righteouſneſs and Equity, in and about
the puniſhing of ſin and ſinners, which the Scripture
from place to place aſcribeth unto God; and which
inclineth him to puniſh ſins, committed againſt greater
Light, againſt means and motives of greater Efficacy

where means and motives for the refraining

from God to <hi>Repent,</hi> even all along the <hi>times of

beſides what hath been already offered to countenance

conceive this paſſage of the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. Verſ.
8, 9, &amp;c. doth better the account: <hi>For finding fault
with them, he ſaith: Behold, the days come (ſaith

upon their Deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> how little

Towards the Concluſion of your Writing, you
make this ingenuous and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Promiſe (which
contains as much, as I can with Reaſon, or a good
Conſcience, expect from you) That <hi>if I can make it
appear (upon juſt, and carrying grounds) that Infants,
Naturals (to whom God hath not given the uſe of Reaſon)
and thoſe many millions in all ages, who never heard the
Goſpel, are bound to beleeve in Chriſt for Salvation, then
you ſhall grant my Minor, and admit my Argument to be
good; viZ.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt dyed for all without exception,
becauſe all without exception are bound to beleeve.</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
I have, and this upon no worſe or weaker grounds
then you require, made it fully apparant, that all the
three ſorts of perſons you ſpeak of, are, in a ſence,
which, I (with many others) call, <hi>ſenſus diviſus,</hi> and
which I have explained, bound to beleeve on <hi>Chriſt</hi>
for Salvation. As for the ſence, which (haply) you
mean, and which I have termed, <hi>ſenſus compoſitus,</hi> your
ſelf have in a former paſſage (and herein done nothing
neither, but what Reaſon and Ingenuity, together with
the Intereſt of your own Credit and Conſcience, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
you unto) acquitted me and my Doctrine from
intending it in reference to the two former ſorts of
perſons, <hi>Infants,</hi> and <hi>Naturals.</hi> Nor do I conceive
that your ſelf judg it any ways prejudicial to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of either of theſe by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they are, in
this ſence, utterly uncapable of beleeving on him;
unleſs you either judg them ſalvable by the Law of
Nature, and without Chriſt (which I judg you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reaſonably do) or not at all; which I ſuppoſe to
be further from your thoughts, then the other. So
that whether Infants, or Naturals, be capable, or
not capable of beleeving in <hi>Christ,</hi> yet if they be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47308:31"/>
ſalvable by him, it undeniably follows, that he dyed
for them.</p>
            <p>Concerning the third and laſt ſort, perſons who
though competent of underſtanding, yet never from
firſt to laſt taſted of the letter of the Goſpel, I have
proved at large (and I truſt, to your ſatisfaction, and
other mens) That ſuch men as theſe, ſtand bound,
both by the Law of Nature, and by poſitive Law
from God, to beleeve in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the letter of the Goſpel they are in a capacity of
beleeving in him, ſo, or ſo far, as to be accepted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
unto Salvation. Thus having performed your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
I truſt I may upon a legitimacy of claim de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the courteſie of your Promiſe, being nothing
but what is very lawful for you to grant, the <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of my Minor,</hi> and conſequently the concluding
validity of my Argument.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſomewhere in your Papers repreſent
it as a thing very irrational, and unworthy belief, that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould dye for thoſe, who he knew were in no
capacity, or poſſibility, of receiving benefit thereby,
as all thoſe were, who had periſhed in their ſins, and
were eternally condemned, before his Death: my
Anſwer is; That as at Chriſts riding into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
as well the multitudes that went before, as thoſe that
followed, cryed, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David, (Matt.</hi>
21. 9.) ſo thoſe that lived in the World before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
and Sufferings, were in a bleſſed capacity of
receiving Remiſſion of Sins, and the great Bleſſing of
Salvation, by his Death, by beleeving on him as then
to come, as well as thoſe, who take their turns
of Mortality after him, and beleeve on him as
already come. Otherwiſe how ſhould <hi>Abraham,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47308:32"/>
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> have been in a capacity of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down and eating bread in the Kingdom of God?
So that how ever the perſons you ſpeak of, who were
under an irreverſible ſentence of Condemnation for
their ſins, at the time when our Saviour dyed, and in
this reſpect were in no poſſibility of receiving benefit
by his death; yet there was a time, <hi>viZ.</hi> whileſt they
lived in the World, when they were under the ſame
poſſibility with other men of receiving the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and bleſſing of Salvation by him: and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
he may properly enough be ſaid to have dyed
for them; <hi>i. e.</hi> to have dyed upon ſuch terms, that
they beleeving on him, whileſt the day of Grace laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as intending, or as being to dye for them in time,
might have been ſaved by his death. And if this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
were of any force, neither can it truly be ſaid
that he dyed for <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Jacob,</hi> or for other
Saints, who had dyed in the Faith (as the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh) before his coming in the Fleſh, at leaſt it
cannot be ſaid that he dyed for the remiſſion of their
ſins, becauſe they having obtained already, and being
in full poſſeſſion of, this heavenly Priviledg, were in
no poſſibility of obtaining it by <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the time of
his death. Nor is it (nor can it reaſonably be imagined
that it ſhould be) the intent of the Doctrine, which
teacheth that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for all men without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to affirm or teach withall, that he dyed upon ſuch
terms for all men, that all men at any time, or in every
ſtate and condition, whether living, or whether dead,
whether free from, or whether inſnared with, the guilt
of the unpardonable ſin, &amp;c. ſhould be in a capacity,
or under a poſſibility, of being ſaved by him. The
intire and clear meaning of the ſaid Doctrine (as it is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47308:32"/>
in effect ſtated by me Cap. 17. §. 1. of my Book of
Redemption) is, That all perſons of Mankind whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
are, or were, put into ſuch a capacity of Salvation
by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that if their own voluntary
neglect, and notorious unworthineſs, do not intervene
and hinder, they may, or might, be all actually ſaved
thereby.</p>
            <p>And thus I have, in the midſt of many diſtractions,
and under much encumbrance of buſineſs otherwiſe,
faithfully, with a ſingle and upright heart, and as in the
preſence of God, endeavored to ſatisfie your requeſt
touching the clearing and removing ſuch ſcruples and
difficulties, which, as you ſignifie, rendered this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of mine, <hi>All men, without exception, ſtand bound
to beleeve on Chriſt,</hi> queſtionable, or rather unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
falſe, unto you. Whether any thing that hath
been ſaid will turn to ſo happy an account unto you,
as ſatisfaction, I cannot prophecy: only I find you a
man diſ-enſnared from the ſuperſtition of vulgar cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,
and that will not ſell the Truth for the gain or
price of that corruptible Crown of being reputed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox;
and this is a door of hope opened unto me,
that ſuch things, which are agreeable both to the
courſe and current of the Scriptures, and no leſs to
clear Principles of Reaſon, will over-rule you into
ſuch acknowledgments, which in the day of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> will (I queſtion not) be your honour, and peace.
I confeſs I was extreamly unwilling to have been
taken off from ſome other engagements lying upon
my hand, by ſuch a diverſion, as the drawing up of
this Anſwer to your Papers, muſt needs occaſion: but
God having over-ruled that inclination in me, I have
ſo much the more hope that he hath ſomewhat of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47308:33"/>
to do with his Providential interpoſure in
this kind. I may very truly ſay, that the Work, in
reſpect of the undertaking of it, was very ſignally and
emphatically, His, having ſcarce had ſo much of my
will in it, as in that reſpect, to bear that denomination
of being called, mine. Notwithſtanding being engaged,
it was once in my thoughts to have made ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
attempt upon your Judgement by ſome other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
to evince an Univerſal Obligation upon all
Fleſh to yield the Obedience of Faith unto the Goſpel,
and to beleeve in <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> But upon conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
judging you ſo propenſe in affection to the
Truth, as to be ready to meet it half way in its advance
towards you; and being a little unwilling too far to
anticipate my intendments for a larger Diſcuſſion of
the Particulars diſcourſed in your Papers, I reſolved
rather to contain my ſelf at preſent within the narrow
bounds of this Anſwer. The excreſcency whereof to
prevent, I forbare the printing of your Papers with it;
and this the rather, becauſe I had no commiſſion from
you to publiſh them. If your deſire yet be to have
them publiſhed, my beſt aſſiſtance ſhall be yours for
the procuring, and beſt ordering of it. The God of
all Grace and Truth, break up the Fountains of the
great Depths of Spiritual Knowledg, and Heavenly
Underſtanding in his Word, before both you, and me,
and all others, who love the Truth at a better rate,
then to fear the ſhame of being counted erroneous for
the profeſſion of it; that the Waters of Life may flow
out abundantly from us, for the watering and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the dry and barren root of the World round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us.</p>

            <p>THat <hi>Adam,</hi> during the <hi>interìm</hi> between his Fall,
and the Promulgation of the Evangelical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
unto him, was under no Obligation to Repent, is
evident from hence; becauſe if ſo, this tye (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your diſtribution) muſt be upon him, either by
vertue of the Law of Nature, written in his heart, or
elſe, of ſome poſitive Law of God. But, 1. For
any poſitive Law, there was none made or given unto
him by God, during the time we ſpeak of: nor was
there any of this import given unto him before; I
mean, whereby he was commanded to repent, in caſe
he ſinned, or rebelled againſt God. 2. If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
we ſpeak of, was required of <hi>Adam</hi> as due by
the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> then was it required either in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his Salvation, and as ſufficient and available
hereunto; or elſe as matter of meer Duty, without
any reference to a Reward. If it were required of him
in order to his Salvation, then was there a Principle
veſted by God in the Nature of Man, whereby he was
enabled to recover and ſave himſelf, in caſe of ſin and
diſobedience: yea and this Principle muſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to have been carryed over by <hi>Adam,</hi> unmaimed
and in ſufficient ſtrength for action, out of his eſtate
of Righteouſneſs or Innocency, wherein he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
into that eſtate of Sin and Miſery, wherein he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47308:34"/>
plunged himſelf by his Fall. And if ſo, then muſt it
be ſuppoſed alſo to remain in the ſame vigor and
ſtrength in all his poſterity, (for there is no reaſon
to imagine a difference in this point between <hi>Adam</hi>
fallen, and his poſterity:) And if ſo, then all, and
every Perſon of Mankinde without exception, muſt
be ſuppoſed to be in a capacity of Salvation, yea to
be in an immediate capacity of doing ſuch things
which accompany Salvation. And if ſo, then Chriſt
muſt of neceſſity be ſuppoſed to have dyed for them
all, in as much as without ſhedding of Blood there is
no Remiſſion, and conſequently no Salvation, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
or poſſibility of being ſaved.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, That that Repentance which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after, was required of <hi>Adam</hi> as meer matter of
Duty, and not in reference to any Reward intended
to be given unto him by God thereupon; 1. This (I
preſume) is contrary to your own ſence, who (if I
miſtake you not) conceive, That the <hi>Heathen,</hi> without
Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are in a capacity of ſuch a Repentance,
which, in reference to them, is available unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
2. It ſeems contrary to the courſe and current
of the Scriptures, that God ſhould require ſervice or
obedience from his Creature, otherwiſe then in order
to their Happineſs. See to this purpoſe: <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7.
<hi>Deut. 6. 24. &amp; 10. 12, 13. Pſal. 19. 11. &amp;</hi> 81. 13,
