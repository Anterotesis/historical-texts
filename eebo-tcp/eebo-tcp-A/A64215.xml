            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Elishaes</hi> Servant also was afraid:</l>
            <l>Alas Master, How shall we do said He,</l>
            <l>The Prophet said, feare not, for with us be</l>
            <l>More then with them; Then did the Prophet pray</l>
            <l>His mans Mindes Blindnesse might be tooke away,</l>
            <l>And presently Such Sight did Him Inspire</l>
            <l>He saw his Master Compast Rownd with fire,</l>
            <l>And all the Mountaine full of wondrous forces</l>
            <l>Of Heavenly Soldiers, Charets, men and Horses.</l>
            <l>Elishaes Prayer did such favour find</l>
            <l>That all the Aramites were Strait Strooke Blind</l>
            <l>And <hi>so Captiv'd,</hi> their mighty Host did bring</l>
            <l>Into Samaria, unto Israells King.</l>
            <l>Againe the Prophet praid unto the Lord,</l>
            <l>And presently their Sights were all Restor'd,</l>
            <l>With feare,<note place="margin">V. 20.</note> they saw themselves environd Round,</l>
            <l>By those, whom they had purpos'd to Confound.</l>
            <l>Th' <hi>Assirians</hi> Being in this piteous plight,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Quoth</hi> Israel's <hi>King (twice)</hi> Father, shall I Smite,</l>
            <l>The Prophet Answerd, I say Smite them not,</l>
            <l>Those with the sword whom thou hast Captive Got;</l>
            <l>Although they're foes they're men, opprest with greif,</l>
            <l>Give Bread and Water to'em, <hi>for Releife.</hi>

            <l>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37847:4"/>Then did the King Great preparation make,</l>
            <l>And (on his foes did much compassion take,</l>
            <l>He fed them, and in peace he sent them back</l>
            <l>Who came to be his Ruin and his Wrack.</l>
            <l>So, thus th' Almighty pleased his foes to tame,</l>
            <l>And Arams Bands no more to Israell came.<note place="margin">V. 23.</note>
            </l>
            <l>Thus unto <hi>Israel</hi> was deliverance given,</l>
            <l>Miraculously by the hand of Heaven.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Ammon</hi> Joynd with <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Mount Seir,</hi>

            <l>Good King <hi>Iehosophat</hi> to overbear<note place="margin">2 Chr. 20.</note>
            </l>
            <l>With Multitudes of Horse, and men of war,</l>
            <l>So that all Humane Hope, and Helpe was far.</l>
            <l>God then a Prophet rais'd who truly said,</l>
            <l>Stand Still Iehosaphat, be not dismaid,</l>
            <l>Behold the Lords Salvation, <hi>he hath spoak,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The feild is thine, thou shalt not strike a stroake.</l>
            <l>Strait the mistakeing <hi>Ammonite</hi> (pell mell)</l>
            <l>Together by the Eares with <hi>Moab</hi> fell,</l>
            <l>Each, thought the other <hi>Iudah's</hi> force to be</l>
            <l>In Bloudy Battaile deadly blows did flee.</l>
            <l>At last <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> (or th' warlike <hi>Edomite</hi>)</l>
            <l>Came in, and on them both, Renew'd the fight;</l>
            <l>The slaughter was so Great, that death was Cloyd,</l>
            <l>And thus Gods foes, themselves, themselves destroyd.</l>
            <l>Thus whilest they did each other overthrow,</l>
            <l>The King had victory and strooke no blow.</l>
            <l>My application of all this, is this,</l>
            <l>That <hi>God</hi> that ever was, for ever <hi>Is,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He sav'd <hi>Samaria</hi> from the <hi>Aramites,</hi>

            <l>And Just Jehosaphat from <hi>Ammonites,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And from th' Incestuous brood of <hi>Moabites,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And <hi>Esaus</hi> Rough-haird seed, the <hi>Edomites.</hi>

            <l>And he doth know, King <hi>Charles</hi> his heart is right.</l>
            <l>By Miracles of old 'tis Manifest,</l>
            <l>Th' Almighty hath his wondrous power exprest;</l>
            <l>And Sure, the Miracle, God shew'd of late</l>
            <l>Is Admirable, Loving, Gracious, Great.</l>
            <l>The Kings own Subjects, His own servants too</l>
            <l>Payd, and gave Ayd, their Soveraigne to undo:</l>
            <l>With His own Weapons, Armes, and every thing</l>
            <l>They, (in the Kings Name) warr against the King.</l>
            <l>Then, in that Low, unworthy exigent</l>

            <l>Have Clear'd their Blear'd Eyes from Erroneous Mists,</l>
            <l>The Nose-wise <hi>Brownist</hi> Grauely doth begin</l>
            <l>To see the foolerie he hath liv'd in,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Anabaptist</hi> likewise hath found out</l>

            <l>The <hi>Papist</hi> (as I hope) is quite past Hope</l>
