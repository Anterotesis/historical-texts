            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>When life and ſin one common tombe had found,</l>
            <l>The firſt ſmall proſpect of a riſing hill</l>
            <l>With various notes of Joy the Ark did fill:</l>
            <l>Yet when that flood in its own depths was drownd</l>
            <l>It left behind it falſe and ſlipp'ry ground;</l>
            <l>And the more ſolemn pomp was ſtill deferr'd</l>

            <l>Thus (Royall Sir) to ſee you landed here</l>
            <l>Was cauſe enough of triumph for a year:</l>
            <l>Nor would your care thoſe glorious Joyes repeat</l>
            <l>Till they at once might be ſecure and great:</l>
            <l>Till your kind beams by their continu'd ſtay</l>
            <l>Had warm'd the ground, and call'd the Damps away.</l>

            <l>But this untainted year is all your own,</l>
            <l>Your glory's may without our crimes be ſhown.</l>
            <l>We had not yet exhauſted all our ſtore</l>
            <l>When you refreſh'd our joyes by adding more:</l>
            <l>As Heav'n of old diſpenc'd Caeleſtial dew,</l>
            <l>You give us Manna and ſtill give us new.</l>

            <l>Time ſeems not now beneath his years to ſtoop</l>

            <l>Soft weſtern winds waft ore the gaudy ſpring</l>
            <l>And opend Scenes of flow'rs and bloſſoms bring</l>
            <l>To grace this happy day, while you appear</l>
            <l>Not King of us alone but of the year.</l>
            <l>All eyes you draw, and with the eyes the heart,</l>
            <l>Of your own pomp your ſelf the greateſt part:</l>
            <l>Loud ſhouts the Nations happineſs proclaim</l>

From your brave train each ſingles out a prey,</l>
            <l>And longs to date a Conqueſt from your day.</l>
            <l>Now charg'd with bleſſings while you ſeek repoſe,</l>

            <l>Next to the ſacred Temple you are led,</l>
            <l>Where waites a Crown for your more ſacred Head:</l>
            <l>How juſtly from the Church that Crown is due,</l>
            <l>Preſerv'd from ruine and reſtor'd by you!</l>
            <l>The gratefull quire their harmony employ</l>

            <l>Wrapt ſoft and warm your Name is ſent on high,</l>
            <l>As flames do on the wings of Incenſe fly:</l>
            <l>Muſique her ſelf is loſt, in vain ſhe brings</l>
            <l>Her choiſeſt notes to praiſe the beſt of Kings:</l>
            <l>Her melting ſtrains in you a tombe have found,</l>

            <l>He that brought peace and diſcord could attone,</l>
            <l>His Name is Muſick of it ſelf alone.</l>
            <l>Now while the ſacred Oyl annoints your head,</l>
            <l>And fragrant ſcents, begun from you, are ſpread</l>

Which in one bleſſing mixt deſcends on you,</l>

            <l>Not that our wiſhes do increaſe your ſtore,</l>

            <l>We add not to your glory, but employ</l>
            <l>Our time like Angels in expreſſing joy.</l>
            <l>Nor is it duty or our hopes alone</l>
            <l>Create that joy, but full fruition;</l>
            <l>We know thoſe bleſſings which we muſt poſſeſſe,</l>

            <l>The jealous Sects that dare not truſt their cauſe</l>
            <l>So farre from their own will as to the Laws,</l>
            <l>You for their Umpire and their Synod take,</l>

            <l>Kind Heav'n ſo rare a temper did provide</l>
