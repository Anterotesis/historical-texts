            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mr. <hi>WOOLLASTON'</hi>s
CASE,
In Relation to a Breach of PRIVILEGE Committed
by Mr. <hi>ROBERT THOMPSON,</hi> and others.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Woollaſton</hi> in <hi>October</hi> 1697. came to an Agreement with
one Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> to Hire of him <hi>Woodhall-Park,</hi> and
other Lands in the County of <hi>Hertford;</hi> being the Eſtate
of one <hi>Philip Butler,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> an Infant. He the ſaid <hi>Thompſon,</hi> being
then Tenant to the Premiſſes, and was to Pay 60 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>
Rent, beſides ſome Veniſon and Rabbits; and was to give the ſaid
<hi>Thompſon</hi> Twenty Guineas to procure him a Leaſe of the ſaid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes
for Five Years. And in purſuance of the ſaid Agreement,
the ſaid Mr. <hi>Woollaſton</hi> entred upon the Premiſſes, and was thereof
Poſſeſſed, and Paid all Pariſh Duties, and other Taxes and Charges
in Keeping and Maintaining of the Deer all the Winter long, and
alſo in Keeping and Repairing the Houſe and Gardens: And that
he made little or no Benefit or Advantage of the ſame, although
in quiet Poſſeſſion until the Sixth of <hi>July</hi> laſt; being the laſt Day
but one of the laſt Seſſions of Parliament. At which time, when
the Profit was to be made of the Premiſſes by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſton,</hi>
then Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Robinſon, John Plummer,
John Crane, Samuel Seagins, Joſeph Biggs, John Crabb, Richard Naſh,
James Pendrid, Nicholas Bickerton, William Anſell, Thomas Waller,</hi>
and <hi>Edmund Chambers,</hi> with divers others, came in a Riotous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with Clubs, Staves, and other Weapons, when they knew
Mr. <hi>Woollaſton</hi> was Abſent, and in the Service of the Houſe the laſt
Seſſions of Parliament, and Entred the ſaid Premiſſes, kept his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
Priſoners all that Day and the next Night, and while they
kept his Servants Priſoners, they went and Killed the Deer in the
Park; and then came and Entred the Houſe with a great Rabble,
and turned the ſaid Mr. <hi>Woollaſton</hi>'s Servants out of Poſſeſſion of
the ſaid Houſe, and ſeized upon his, and his Servants Goods, and
his Cattle in the Park, as alſo upon a Gentleman's Goods that
was then in the Houſe, a Friend of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Woollaſton;</hi> and
that in ſo Inhumane and Barbarous a manner, that they would not
ſo much as leave a Bed for him or his Wife or Children to lie on:
And likewiſe ſet on ſeveral Men to Mow down the Graſs, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all this was for Arrears of Rent, whenas indeed there was no
Rent due.</p>
