            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Deplorable Condition of the Aſſignees of ſundry Goldſmiths, Entitled by the Letters-Patents of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Sums out of the Hereditary Revenue of Exciſe.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS his ſaid Majeſty being Indebted to Sir <hi>Robert Vyner, Edward Backwell,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and others, Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, near Thirteen hundred thouſand Pounds, which he ſtopped in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> in lieu thereof and to Enable them to pay their Debts, in <hi>April</hi> 1677. by his ſaid Majeſty's Letters-Patents were Granted to the ſaid Goldſmiths, reſpectively, Rents, or Annual Sums, after the Rate of Six Pounds <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> to be paid Quarterly out of the Hereditary Revenue of Exciſe for ever, unleſs Payments ſhould be made of the Principal Money and the Arrears of ſuch Annual Sums.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Letters-Patents were Printed by Order of his ſaid Majeſty in Council, for information of the ſaid Goldſmiths Creditors; and by the ſaid Patents were Granted, Directed and Appointed, that Tallies ſtruck for the ſaid Quarterly Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould be preſerable before any other Warrant, Order, or Direction of any after Date, excepting neceſſary Sums for Management of the ſaid Revenue, and 12209 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d½. per Anum</hi> to the then Queen Conſort, alſo 24000 <hi>l.</hi> to the then Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe of Peers were pleaſed on the 10th of <hi>July</hi> 1678. to paſs a Bill for confirming the ſaid Letters-Patents, but that Seſſion ſoon ending, the ſaid Bill was not Read in the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>All which Encouraged many of the Creditors of the ſaid Goldſmiths to deliver up their other Securities, and to take Aſſignments under the ſaid Letters Patents of the ſaid Annual Sums for what was due to them, and for the ſaid Sums Tallies were ſtruck in the ſaid King's Reign, for Five years and a half, and no more; and by reaſon of ſlow Payments thereof, ſome of the Proprietors by Courſe of Law recovered their Money on the ſaid Tallies. Whereupon the Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the Treaſury, by their Letters to the Officers of the Exchequer, did forbid their ſtriking more Tallies, without their particular Directions; which cauſed one of the Proprietors to bring his Petition before the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> but before their giving Judgment, his ſaid Majeſty died, and his ſaid Suit abated.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of K. <hi>James</hi> II. the ſaid Letters-Patents were ſo well approved of, that Tallies were ſtruck for three Quarterly Payments of the Arrears remaining in the former Reign, and the Lord Treaſurer, and after, the Lords Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, by their ſeveral Letters alſo forbid the Officers ſtriking Tallies without their particular Directions, whereby Payments were made to and for <hi>Lady-Day,</hi> 1683. and no longer, and the Proprietors durſt not then hazard their Title to the Cenſure of the Judges.</p>
