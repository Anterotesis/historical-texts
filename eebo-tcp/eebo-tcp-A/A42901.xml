            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of Man being come, a <hi>time,</hi> when
all things were in quiet ſilence, and
the Night was in the midſt of her ſwift courſe,
the <hi>Omnipotent Word</hi> of the Eternal Father deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45545:3"/>
from his Royal <hi>Throne,</hi> and took up
his lodging in a <hi>Stable</hi> of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> No ſooner
was he arrived there, but he preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
an <hi>Angel</hi> to carry the news of his
<hi>Birth</hi> to certain <hi>Shepherds,</hi> who were at that
time keeping the watches of the night over
their Flocks in the Fields adjoyning. The
Meſſenger, to ſhew that he was the Miniſter
of the <hi>Sun</hi> of Juſtice, clothed himſelf with a
glittering Robe of <hi>Light,</hi> and ſo great was the
Brightneſs which enlightned the place, that

                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 138. 11.</note> and thoſe words of <hi>David</hi> may
be ſaid to have been then literally fulfilled,
<hi>Nox ſicut dies illuminabitur,</hi> that the <hi>Night</hi> ſhould
be as <hi>light</hi> as the <hi>Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Shepherds terrified as well with the
preſence of the Angel, who ſtood beſide them, as
with the unuſualneſs of the <hi>Light,</hi> which ſhone
round about them, were ready to fall to the
ground for fear, when the Heavenly Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
bid them be of good cheer, for that he
came not to bring them tidings of <hi>dread</hi> and
terror, but of <hi>joy,</hi> and great joy to them, and
to all People, that on this Bright day there was
born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World.
And that their own experience might further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them of the truth of what he had ſaid, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45545:3"/>
gave them a <hi>Sign,</hi> by which, if they would
take the pains, they might find the New-born
Infant, <hi>Hoc vobis ſignum, This,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhall be
to you a Sign; you ſhall find the Infant wrapped
in Swadling-clothes, and laid in a Manger:</hi> O King
of Glory! Is not this the day in which the
Angels invite the Daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> to go forth,
and behold thee in the <hi>Diadem</hi> with which thy
Virgin-mother <hi>Crown'd</hi> thee in the day of thy
Eſpouſals in her pureſt Womb? And muſt a
<hi>Manger</hi> be thy <hi>Cradle?</hi> O Treaſure of Heaven!
who would have ſought for thee in a little
Hay or Straw? Who would have thought to
have found thee in a <hi>Manger</hi> of Beaſts? Surely
the Shepherds, who were terrified with the
Light, muſt have been much more ſurprized
with the ſeeming <hi>diſproportion</hi> of the <hi>Sign,</hi> had
not a multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyned themſelves with the Angel, praiſing
God, and ſaying, <hi>Gloria in altiſſimis Deo, Glory
be to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace to men
of good will.</hi>
               </p>

King, <hi>Loquebantur ad invicem, They ſaid one to
another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and ſee
this word which is made, which our Lord hath made
known unto us.</hi> And the reſolution was no
ſooner taken, but preſently put in execution.
But give me leave, devout Shepherds, to ask
you, whither away ſo faſt? Were not you
keeping the watches of the Night over your
Flocks? And will you now <hi>leave</hi> them in the
open Fields? Are you not afraid, that they may
go aſtray in your abſence, or the <hi>Wolves</hi> break
in and devour them? No, we are going to find
out the <hi>Lamb,</hi> which is come to take away the
ſins of the world: This <hi>Lamb</hi> will take care
both of the Shepherds and the Flocks; And
ſhould we ſuſtain any <hi>loſs</hi> for his ſake, it would
ſtill be our greater <hi>Gain.</hi> Piouſly reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
But have you forgotten what hapned
of old to another of your Profeſſion, when God
appearing to him in the <hi>Buſh,</hi> he ſaid as you
do now,<note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>I will go and ſee this great Sight?</hi> Have
you forgotten, I ſay, how he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to draw near, but to ſtand at a diſtance,
and put off his Shoes; and how he turned away
his Face, that he might not ſee? And are you
not afraid to meet with the ſame prohibition
he did? Nothing leſs. The Scene is now
changed. God in a <hi>Burning Buſh</hi> is an Object
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45545:4"/>
of <hi>Terror</hi> indeed; but God in <hi>Swadling-clothes</hi>
and laid in a <hi>Manger,</hi> is ſo great an Attractive
of <hi>Love,</hi> that we fear nothing but to loſe time
to go to ſee it. They went therefore <hi>with
haſte,</hi> and being admitted by the Sacred <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi>
(whoſe leave no doubt they would ask)
to <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> their New-born <hi>Saviour,</hi> the
Evangeliſt ſays, That <hi>they returned glorifying
and praiſing God for all that they had heard and
ſeen, as it had been ſaid unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Summ of what is contain'd in the

have made choice of for the <hi>Subject</hi> of your

of the Shepherds to go to <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> That we
may <hi>enter</hi> with like Devotion into the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration

                     <note place="margin">Sum. 22. q. 82. a. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</note> by which a man prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and readily, <hi>tradit ſe,</hi> gives himſelf up, or
(as we uſe to ſay) devotes himſelf <hi>to execute
the things which belong to the ſervice of God.</hi>
Some of theſe things are expreſly <hi>commanded</hi> by
God himſelf, others <hi>intimated only</hi> or <hi>commended,</hi>
as pleaſing to him. And whereas there is this
difference between them, that every <hi>Command</hi>
of God is a <hi>ſign</hi> of his Will, but every <hi>Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
of his good pleaſure is not a <hi>Command,</hi>
'tis manifeſt, that as the Perfection of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on conſiſts in a readineſs to comply with both,
ſo it ſhews it ſelf chiefly in the Execution of
the latter. And ſuch was that of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
of my Text. They went to find out
the New-born Chriſt, without being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
The Angel, as you have heard, gave
them a <hi>Sign,</hi> by which, if they would take
the pains, they might find him, which was
that they ſhould find him <hi>wrapped in ſwadling-clothes,
and laid in a manger.</hi> But it is no where
expreſſed in the Goſpel, that he bid them go.
We do not read that the Angel ſaid unto them, <hi>Ite
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45545:6"/>
Paſtores,</hi> Go to <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> but only, <hi>Hoc vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
ſignum: This ſhall be to you a ſign,</hi> and yet
they preſently reſolv'd to go. And we need
not go far to ſeek the Reaſon. The Angel in
the Proclamation he made of Peace upon
Earth, when he return'd to Heaven, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſignified them to be men of <hi>good will,</hi>
that is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.</note> as holy <hi>David</hi> deſcribes ſuch Perſons,
Men, whoſe <hi>Wills are in the Law of God: In
lege Domini voluntas ejus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 31.</note> and <hi>the Law of God
in their wills. Lex Dei ejus in corde ipſius.</hi> And
where the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> are thus recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
in each other, in order to the Service of
God, a <hi>Command</hi> ſerves but for a <hi>Sign,</hi> and
a <hi>Sign</hi> becomes a <hi>Command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. To Men of Good Will, a <hi>Precept</hi> ſerves
them but for a <hi>Sign,</hi> to point out what they
are to do. And this is what the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us to underſtand,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 9.</note> when he
ſays, that <hi>Lex Juſto non eſt poſita. The Law is
not made for the Juſt man,</hi> but for ſuch as are
<hi>unjuſt and refractory.</hi> And why not for the
<hi>Juſt Man</hi> alſo, if he cannot be juſt without
the Obſervance of it? But becauſe, as you
heard before, the Will of a Juſt Man is <hi>in</hi> the
Law,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>St.</hi> Aug. <hi>in</hi> Pſal. 1.</note> and not <hi>under</hi> the Law. 'Tis on thing
ſays St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to be <hi>in</hi> the Law, and another
to be <hi>under</hi> the Law. He whoſe <hi>Will</hi> is <hi>in</hi> the

to the Law. But He whoſe <hi>will</hi> is
<hi>under</hi> the Law, <hi>Secùndum legem agitur,</hi> is driven
or forced by the Law. The <hi>Law</hi> like a ſevere
<hi>Adverſary</hi> ſtands over him with threats and
menaces to compel him to the performance
of what it commands; and therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,

In a word,<note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 8.</note> ſuch is the force of Love,
that if it poſſeſs the Heart, that which is a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>
to the unjuſt and refractory, ſerves but for
a <hi>Sign</hi> to men of <hi>Good Will.</hi> But this is not all.
'Tis the Property of Love to <hi>dilate</hi> the Heart it
poſſeſſes, and render it ſo pliant to the motions
of Grace, and ready to execute what is pleaſing
to God, that,</p>
                  <p>2. To men of Good Will <hi>a Sign</hi> becomes a
<hi>Command.</hi> Their hearts like that of <hi>David</hi> are
doubly ready, <hi>Paratum cor meum, Deus, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
cor meum,</hi> ready to do what God <hi>commands:</hi>
And again, Ready to do what he <hi>ſignifies</hi> only
to be his Good will and Pleaſure. Their Will
(as I ſaid before) is in the Law of God, and the
Law of God in their Will. And what is the
Product of this Happy Union, but that the
<hi>Will,</hi> as conſider'd in the <hi>Law</hi> changes a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:45545:8"/>
into a <hi>Sign,</hi> becauſe it performs it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly;
and the Law, as conſider'd in the Will,
improves that which is but a <hi>Sign</hi> into a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi>
becauſe the Will performs it exactly.
This is the Happy State of Men of <hi>Good Will,</hi>
Let them but have a <hi>Sign,</hi> an Intimation of
what they are to do; Their Hearts are ready,
and they preſently ſet themſelves to put it
in execution.</p>
                  <p>What moved the <hi>Wiſemen</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
ſo long and <hi>dangerous</hi> a journey, to find
out, and adore the New-born <hi>King of the Jews?</hi>
All the Account they give of it, is, <hi>vidimus

his <hi>Sign,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> They had heard, if not

                     <note place="margin">Num. 24. 17</note> They expected
the riſing of this Star; and no ſooner did it
appear, but, as the Church repreſents their
devotion in one of her <hi>Antiphons,</hi> they ſaid one
to another, <hi>Hoc ſignum Magni Regis eſt,</hi> This

enquire him out, <hi>&amp; offeramus ei munera, Aurum,

more Parallel to the <hi>devotion</hi> of the <hi>Shepherds</hi>
in my Text? No ſooner had the Angel given

them a <hi>Sign,</hi> by which they might find out the

<hi>Devotion</hi> both of Kings and Shepherds!
How happy ſhould we be, would we follow
their Example, and not neglect, or (which is yet
worſe) reject ſo often as we do the Holy Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
which God is pleaſed from time to time
to give us for the amendment of our lives, and

theſe Kings and Shepherds? A <hi>Sign</hi> is to them,

And by whom may we think were they

as I may, to expreſs what my own low
Thoughts have been able to conceive of this
Gracious <hi>Concurrence</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> with the Good
<hi>Pleaſure</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> in relation to the great
deſign of his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and perhaps in words
not reaching my own Conceptions, your <hi>Pious</hi>
and <hi>Charitable</hi> attention, will, I hope, help to
<hi>ſupply</hi> the defect of the one, and make <hi>allowance</hi>
for the other.</p>
                  <p>The Eternal <hi>Father</hi> (whoſe Goodneſs is
equal to his Knowledge,) fore-ſeeing from all
Eternity the <hi>Fall</hi> of Man, out of the Bowels

and that by the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of his Son. This
amongſt many other means, which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to his Infinite <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> he was pleaſed to
make choice of, as moſt conducing to his own
Honour, and the redreſs and advantage of man.
But how was this <hi>Great Deſign</hi> to be brought
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45545:9"/>
about? By laying a <hi>Command</hi> on his <hi>Son</hi> to take
our Nature upon him?<note place="margin">St. Tho. 1. p. q. 43.</note> No, For, (as St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
obſerves,) a <hi>Command</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>Inferiority</hi>
in the Perſon to be commanded; and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Faith tells us, that in the moſt Holy <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
there is no <hi>Inferiority</hi> or <hi>Subjection:</hi> No one
of the Perſons <hi>Higher</hi> or <hi>Lower, Greater</hi> or
<hi>Leſs</hi> than another, but as they are All <hi>Co eternal</hi>
in Duration, ſo are They <hi>Co-equal</hi> in Dignity
and Authority. There could be no place for
a <hi>Command,</hi> where there was no <hi>Inequality;</hi> Nor
even for <hi>Counſel,</hi> as ſuppoſing an <hi>Advantage</hi> of
<hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the Giver, in reſpect of the Perſon
to whom it is given. What then remain'd,
but (if I may be permitted to ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our imperfect and incompetent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of conceiving in this Life) an <hi>Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Fathers Good Pleaſure to his Son;
preſenting him in the Comprehenſive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which he communicated to him of all
things both Future and Poſſible, together with
his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> a Proſpect (as I may call it) of a
Humane <hi>Body,</hi> ſo to be framed, as might ſerve
for a decent <hi>Tabernacle</hi> for the <hi>Divinity</hi> to dwell
in, and a fit and proper <hi>Inſtrument</hi> for <hi>Him,</hi>
who was the <hi>Word,</hi> to accompliſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of man, by <hi>uniting</hi> himſelf to it.
How readily he concurred with his Conſent to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45545:10"/>
this Gracious <hi>Intention</hi> of his Father, thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to him, is ſeen by the Bleſſed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in the Unity of one and the ſame Will in
Both; but can be diſcern'd only by us in this
ſtate of Obſcurity in it's <hi>Effect,</hi> as in a <hi>Glaſs</hi>
which <hi>reflects</hi> rhe Beams that are darted upon
it. And ſuch is the <hi>account</hi> which the Royal
Prophet gives of <hi>its Execution</hi> in his 39th <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
where he repreſents the <hi>Son</hi> at his coming into
the World, addreſſing himſelf to his <hi>Father</hi> in

ſee, O my Eternal Father, that <hi>Sacrifices and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
are rejected by thee, as inſufficient to make
<hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for the ſins of men, and to appeaſe
thy wrath ſo juſtly enkindled againſt them.
But withall I ſee, <hi>Corpus aptaſti mihi,</hi> that thou
haſt framed a <hi>Body fit for me,</hi> and me alone,
as the means thou haſt made choice of for this

                  </p>
                  <p>Nor was a like <hi>concurrence</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>

a <hi>Command</hi> from his <hi>Father</hi> to lay down

(of which, as conſider'd ſubſiſting only

<hi>concurr'd</hi> with this gracious deſign, (but in
a manner infinitely tranſcending what the
underſtandings of the Higheſt Angels are able
to <hi>comprehend;</hi>) So as ſoon as he was born
into the world he inſpir'd the Shepherds
to do the like: He only gave them a <hi>Sign</hi> or

which his Father framed for him, and he gave to

by which he declares the Faith of the

to be the <hi>ſame</hi> which the <hi>Catholic</hi> Church
profeſſes at this day.</p>
                  <p>And now, dear Chriſtans, that this Divine
Lover of our Souls has left us ſo great a <hi>Sign</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45545:12"/>
and Pledge of his <hi>good Will</hi> and Love, ſhall we
not make haſt with the devout Shepherds to
go to <hi>Bethlehem? Bethlehem</hi> in Engliſh ſignifies
<hi>The Houſe of Bread.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">St. <hi>Greg.</hi> Hom. 8. in Evang.</note> And St. <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves,
that our Lord would have the <hi>Place</hi> in which
he was to be <hi>born,</hi> to be called long before by
<hi>this name,</hi> to ſignifie to us, <hi>That He who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

came down from Heaven to nouriſh the Souls of his

that he has given us ſo incomparable a <hi>Sign</hi>

make <hi>haſt</hi> with the Shepherds to <hi>Bethlehem?</hi>
Shall we let this <hi>Holy Time</hi> paſs over, or rather
ſhall we Trifle it all away in <hi>Paſtime</hi> and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
without ever approaching to this <hi>Holy
Table?</hi> Such was the Fervour of the <hi>Firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
that they were wont to <hi>communicate</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

of Cruel <hi>Perſecution,</hi> to arm themſelves daily
with the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> againſt the fear of
<hi>Death.</hi> But no ſooner was <hi>Peace</hi> reſtored to
the Church in the beginning of the fourth Age,
but <hi>Piety</hi> began to languiſh; (So much more
hard is it for <hi>Virtue</hi> to bear up againſt a <hi>Proſperous,</hi>
than an <hi>Adverſe</hi> Condition) which gave St.
<hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> before that Age was ended, cauſe
to inveigh ſo frequently as he does, againſt ſuch
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45545:12"/>
as were preſent at the Divine Myſteries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
communicating. But the <hi>Malady</hi> went
on increaſing, and Chriſtians grew ſo <hi>tepid</hi> in
the performance of this Duty, that the Council
of <hi>Agde</hi> in the beginning of the ſixth Age,<note place="margin">Conc. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gath. An. 506.</note>
thought fit to declare, that <hi>thoſe who did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
at the Three Great Feaſts of the year,
Chriſtmas, Eaſter and Whitſontide, were not to be
believ'd to be Catholics, nor reputed for ſuch:</hi> And
the Council of <hi>Tours</hi> in the beginning of the
Eighth Age,<note place="margin">Conc. Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. 3. An. 813.</note> found it neceſſary to admoniſh
them anew to communicate, <hi>if not oftner, yet
three times at leaſt in the year,</hi> viz. at the three
aforeſaid Feaſts. And if the Church in theſe
later times, as ſtill more remiſs, have thought
good to lay no farther obligation upon all
the Faithful of both Sexes, than of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
once a year, and that at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> yet
the Addition of the words, <hi>ad minus,</hi> (that it
muſt be done then <hi>at leaſt</hi>) ſufficiently ſhows
the deſire ſhe has that they would do it oftner,
and that a <hi>Command</hi> were not at all neceſſary
to compel, where there is ſo great an <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive</hi>
of Bounty to invite. <hi>Lex Juſto non

for men of Good Will, who are led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Love, but for ſuch <hi>ſervile</hi> and degenerous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45545:13"/>
Spirits, as are acted only by <hi>fear</hi> of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And it is much to be feared, that thoſe
who in this matter, will do no more than
juſt what the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Law obliges, would
not do that neither, but for fear of the <hi>Cenſure</hi>
annexed.</p>
                  <p>O the Prodigious <hi>ſloth</hi> and negligence of
ſuch careleſs <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom ſo great <hi>Signs</hi> and
Pledges of their dear Saviours Goodneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>draw,</hi> without the neceſſity of a <hi>Precept</hi> to
<hi>drive</hi> them to him! What will they pretend
for their <hi>excuſe?</hi> That they cannot, that is,
will not leave their Sins? Few will be willing
to own this, but ſuch as have loſt all <hi>fear</hi> of
God's Juſtice, and care of their own Souls.
Will they ſay they have no <hi>time?</hi> But has God
then given us 365 days in a year, and ſhall

all that may conduce to the <hi>gratifying</hi> of our

Is it, I ſay, by doing theſe things, that
we can think at laſt to arrive at <hi>Heaven?</hi> O
no; we are convinc'd of the contrary both by
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himſelf <hi>made
Man</hi> for our ſakes. And when ſhall we put
an End to this <hi>fatal Cheat,</hi> if we do it <hi>now?</hi>
Let us then no longer ſuffer our ſelves to be
deluded with the <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>tranſitory</hi> things of this
world. But <hi>tranſeamus uſ<expan>
