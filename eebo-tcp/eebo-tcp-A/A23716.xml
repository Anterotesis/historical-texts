            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

them, and they will needs be <hi>Martyrs</hi> when they suffer for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their vices; and, if this Argument be good, <hi>AEgypt</hi> was <hi>blest</hi> with all her <hi>Plagues,</hi> and the <hi>consuming fire</hi> that ran upon the ground, was the <hi>light of Gods countenance</hi> upon them. Yet both these Arguments have been made use of lately, by each several party of us, in the variety of Gods dispensations to us: now this each could not do of <hi>right.</hi> Some parties of us made <hi>false</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi> pleas to them both. Now to decide which did so, not <hi>à priori,</hi> from the <hi>cause;</hi> though that alone does guild prosperity, and <hi>that alone too makes the Martyr, not the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> But men will never be agreed of that, while whatsoever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> happens (whether their cause prosper or be opprest) still proves them in the <hi>right.</hi> But I shall do it from a plain <hi>notorious</hi> effect: nor do I know what else can be more seasonable than while some men seem to stand <hi>candidates</hi> for sufferings, and choose <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> rather than lose the reputation of not being <hi>afflicted</hi> with their party; and while others plead the merits of <hi>affliction,</hi> and Trumpet out their having <hi>suffered,</hi> as a pretence for the <hi>ambition</hi> and the <hi>covetousness,</hi> the <hi>luxuries</hi> and <hi>intemperance,</hi> and all the other vices of <hi>prosperity,</hi> which their late <hi>sufferings</hi> have before hand expiated; while <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it is thus on each side, to give both a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> whereby to judge the Case, which my Text here presents; for, <hi>He that hath suffered in the Flesh, hath ceased from Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words make a single <hi>Proposition,</hi> and therefore cannot well be taken asunder, nor indeed need they; the Terms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well understood. The Subject every one is willing to assume to himself; no one I believe that hears me, but will say he <hi>hath suffer'd in the Flesh.</hi> Therefore we have no more to do, but to see whether the other Term agree as universally, which certainly it must, if our Proposition here hold good, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if <hi>He that hath suffered in the Flesh, hath ceased from Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in order to this, I shall offer at Three things.</p>
                  <p>First; Discourse of the truth of the <hi>Proposition</hi> in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and see if we can discern how necessary, and how effectual this Instrument of <hi>Reformation</hi> is, whether it be such as may build a confidence of asserting; That <hi>He who hath suffered, hath ceased from Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; Because discoursing in General, is not so <hi>practical</hi> and <hi>usefull,</hi> I shall endeavour to discover in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, By what Artifice of method the <hi>Flesh</hi> engageth men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> into courses of <hi>sin,</hi> and how it works them up to the <hi>height</hi> of it, and then see how <hi>sufferings</hi> blast that method, and make the <hi>Arts</hi> of the <hi>flesh</hi> either unpracticable, or too weak.</p>

                  <p>When it appear'd that <hi>Eden</hi> had too much of Garden for <hi>innocence</hi> to dwell in, and although man were made <hi>upright,</hi> yet amidst such delights he could not be so a whole day, but of the many <hi>inventions</hi> he found out the first was to <hi>destroy</hi> himself immediately, and under the shadow of the Tree of <hi>life</hi> he wrought out <hi>death,</hi> and made the Walks of <hi>Paradise</hi> lead him towards Hell: God saw himself concern'd to take another course: He sets a guard of <hi>fire</hi> about <hi>Eden,</hi> about the place of <hi>pleasure,</hi> as well as in the place of <hi>torments;</hi> and there was as much need of <hi>flame</hi> to keep man out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>the world will learn righteousness, Esay</hi> 26. 9. and S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Text, <hi>they that have suffered in the flesh, have ceased from sin.</hi> Which calls me to my second Task;</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To shew first, by what arts the flesh engages men into courses of sin, and by what methods it does work them up to the heights of it. That I may Secondly declare how suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings blast those methods, and make all the arts of flesh either unpracticable or too weak.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the carnal appetite should reach after, and give up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it self to sensual delights is so far from strange, that it is its nature; 'tis the law of the members, the very signature of flesh, an inclination imprinted into it, of which it can no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest it self, than the heated Deer can restrain it self from <hi>thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109439:6"/>
and panting after water brooks:</hi> But when Reason and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Religion have set bounds to this appetite for it to scorn these mounds; for that <hi>Law in the members</hi> to fight with and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against the <hi>Law in the mind,</hi> those original dictates born in it, and Christian Principles infused into it, this is the Fleshes aim and sin. Now this it does by exciting to ill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being sauc'd with pleasures and contents, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposing to good actions, as being troublesome or not at all delightfull to the sense, and as for all other delights it hath no apprehension of, but indisposeth for them perfectly. So that this it does, it engages too much in Pleasures here, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it takes off all cares or thoughts of any joyes hereafter; both these I will shew you, and thus it works;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It prevails with us to indulge our selves the fall use of lawful pleasures, and for this the Flesh will urge, it is the end of their Creation, to do otherwise were to evacuate Gods purpose in the making; Did he give us good things not to enjoy them?</p>
                  <p>Thus every sort of sin insinuates it self at first: Youth will not deny it self converses with temptations, although he have reason to fear they will commit a rape upon his warmer pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which are chaf't by such encounters. But God has not forbid him Conversation; and why should he be an <hi>Anchoret</hi> and recluse in the throngs of Cities and of Courts. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that would not by any means be luxurious or intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet goes as near them as he can, and contrives to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all those delights that do indeed but sauce Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and make Excesse palatable: And truly why should he restrain himself from meats and drinks, and be a <hi>Jew</hi> again? All these believe they live righteously, soberly, and Godly enough. This resolution works in every recreation, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, honour, and advantage of this World, men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to make as near approaches to the sin as they can; and indeed believe they have no reason to be morose unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; I will deny my self nothing that God hath not denyed me, but enjoy as far as possibly and lawfully I may: But then, by doing thus it</p>
                  <p>Secondly, does oft take in somewhat of the immoderate and unlawful, which cannot be avoided, both because it is hard to set the exact bounds and limits of what is lawful: The <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Line that meers out Vertue from its neighbour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Vice is not so plain in every place as to chalk out exactly to this point thou mayst come, and no farther; hence the man sometimes mistakes himself into a fault; however the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of lawful is, we know the confines and very edge of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109439:6"/>
vice: And then to him that playes upon the brink of sin, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is a very easie step into it, and indeed unavoydable, when a man is rusht and hurried on, not onely by his inward stings and incitations, but by the practise of the World, which makes use of that holy Name of Friendship, to bring vice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our acquaintance, and to befriend us into everlasting Death (of such Friends I can have legions in Hell; and the God of this World will serve me, upon this account, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for my Sin and my Destruction:) but howsoever when the Appetite is heated, they are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this happening therefore sometimes proves a Snare and bait still to go on, both as it takes away the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and the a versation of the sins which at the first seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, till a man be experienced in them; and also as it smooths the way, for such beginnings do nurse up an Habit and prepare a Custome, and make vice very easie, which at first it is not, while the Appetite is modest and not able to digest full Doses, till use enlarge and stretch it.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Mind,</hi> which by these means tasts diverse Pleasures, and the Degrees of them, and finds a gust in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them, yet not being satisfied in any one (as 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should be) stirs up the Appetite to vary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; that that contentment which single pleasures could not afford, diversified might make up; Wretched Nature using that as an Attractive, which should repell; for who would hugg a Cloud? embrace that which does not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not satisfie? but onely Flesh which for that very reason, hunts on and follows the scent: And by doing so a while, it brings upon it self,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Something like a necessity of doing so: Thus Continence would be some mens Disease, and the Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cannot live without his Vice, but gapes as much as Thirst and Feavour do, and if he have not satisfaction, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers as many qualms and pangs as his riot used to cause in the Apprentisage of his sin; so that there is a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the practise, and he wisely seeming to make a vertue of necessity, begins to think them the onely happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, at least of this life, freely without reluctancy embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the Flesh is <hi>Callous,</hi> and if you doubt how it could so harden it self, as not to be pervious to any stings of Conscience, but Proof against all Pricks, though Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment may perswade you; yet I will shew you the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:109439:7"/>
As all Appetite you know is blind, so the Guides also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Carnall appetite; The senses are very short sighted, they cannot look forward to the next Life, to the hopes of Heaven, or the pains of Hell, to bring them into the ballance with the present pleasure, and see which does over weigh: The Flesh onely lives <hi>extempore,</hi> looks but upon that which is before it, scarce on that: We have sufficient experience of this, for when one vice will not look forwards a year or two to the penury and rottenness some courses do pull down: And when another vice, as if it had learnt to fulfill our Saviours command, and <hi>take no care for the morrow,</hi> will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not think of the next mornings pains and Headach; Nay, when the ambitious Usurper will not look just before him, to see where he does place his steps, on Precipices and Sword points, to note how the Pyramids he does climb are made slippery with blood; Pyramids, did I say? pointed Reeds rather, things that have not strength to bear, but onely sharpnesse to stab; and where the mans own weight makes his Upholders fail and wound him both together, at once sink under him and pierce him thorough. Nay, we see many whose sins inflict themselves, who may be truely said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to <hi>bear their Iniquities,</hi> yet choose those sins that bring their Plagues along with them; for we see men with most exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive difficulty practise a vice onely that they may have the vice, swallow sickness, drink Convulsions and dead Paralyses, foaming Epilepfies, onely that all this may be easie to them: And this is but one instance of the many that might be made; just as the King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> that ate Poyson that so he might be used to it: Strange! that a man should torture himself with all those deadly symptomes that Poyson racks the body with, onely that he might eat Poyson; yet just such is the Sinners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Design, and all the ease and pleasure he acquires at last in sinning, is but familiarity of Poyson, custome of Danger, and acquaintance of Ruine. Good God! that men should train and exercise themselves so for perdition! that they should go through a discipline of torments to get an Habit of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves! that they should work out their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation with hardships and agonies! that as if 'twere too easie to goe down the hill to Hell, the descent shall be made craggy, and they force breaches into it, and great headlong Precipices to make the way more painful, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> more dangerous, to make the fall more wounding and more irrecoverable! And what shall give a check where difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty does provoke, and torments do ingratiate?</p>
                  <p>Well: But though Flesh be so short sighted and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109439:7"/>
the mind might trash it by suggesting other sorts of punishments that do await transgression. Why truely if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> rude unmannerly Conscience do sometimes thrust in the thoughts of Hell, the Flesh, which I told you, is not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with any thing but what it feels (now Conscience presents Hell as a thing of hereafter, not till Death be past) it satisfies Conscience with a Repentance of Hereafter, <hi>before Death come I will be sorry for my sins, and God is merciful.</hi> Conscience being thus quieted, and both Raines and Spur given to the Flesh, it takes its full carier, and leaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind all thoughts of Repentance, and indeed, of God, or Heaven; the hope and joyes of which, are the onely possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> method that is left to take off the Man from his eager pursuit, or to divert him in his course. But as to that also, that I may shew you the next heat.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mind</hi> that is immerst in body, and hath been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to tast no pleasure but the carnal ones, its fancy fill'd with those <hi>Ideas,</hi> it does imbibe such a tincture of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, receives such an infusion of Flesh, and is so impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the fumes of Carnality, which clog the Spirit, that its complexion and temper is quite altered, it is diluted and deprest, and so grown stupid and unactive to all higher <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> things: Heaven and all after things, it may be, are the prejudice of such persons, not their perswasions; some thin conceptions of such things have been thrown into them, but never were improved; for their Mind hath otherwise been employed, and they can have no appetite to them, because they have never had any tast or relish of any thing but sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual: And indeed that both longings after, and thoughts of a better Life should be altogether dead in the carnal man, is but a natural and necessary effect of the verge of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. For what motive is there in Heaven to stir up his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> appetite, to whom Heaven it self would not be a place of Joy? For I am verily perswaded, were the Carnal man in those Eternal Mansions compast with streams of Glory, it were impossible for him to take delight in them, and he would grope for Paradise in the midst of Heaven: As much impossible as for the most unlearned Ideot to satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the pleasures of a Mathematical demonstration: Let him have the <hi>Hecatombe,</hi> and let <hi>Pythagor as</hi> be an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure on the <hi>dimensions of a Triangle,</hi> the other hath no palate for these pleasures; and indeed how could the unclean lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> person please himself in the enjoyment of those Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities that have no Sex, <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 22. 30.</note>

Nay, I would this unhappy Age, and an unlucky <hi>axiome</hi> of <hi>Aristotles</hi> did not convince that they do think there are no such things; <hi>Sensual pleasures, are corruptive of Principles,</hi> saith he; and indeed where Damnation is the conclusion, 'tis a much quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more easie thing for Men of Wit and Understanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to deny the Principles, than granting them, to lye under the torture of being lyable to such an inference; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that resolve to love this Life and all the sinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of it, at the next step resolve there is no other Life. And now this pamper'd and puft Flesh is got into the <hi>Psalmists</hi> Chair, <hi>the Chair of Scorners;</hi> and 'tis one of the <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 1. 1.</note> Luxuries of their life to scoff at them who are so foolish as to be Religious, and to deny their flesh its present appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and pleasures on such thin after-hopes; here their <hi>Wit</hi> also is an <hi>Epicure,</hi> and Feasts and Triumphs, distates, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and professes in that chair; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Fleshes first art was by immersing it self in the full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Lawfull use of Pleasures, and by consequence, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate; to prevail with the Soul to find a gust in them, and from a continued enjoyment to conclude them necessary; and so from the importunities of a perpetual tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> this life. Now it is plain Affliction made this Art unpracticable, for that it did do so, was every ones complaint; it rob'd them of the immoderate, and even of the lawful use of Pleasures, it took off those customary Delights by which the mind was habituated and glued to them, by not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them; and made them so far from being necessary, that they were not acquirable; Thus by denying us even the Lawful use of them, it stabs the Flesh in its first onset:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109439:8"/>
Indeed it does that for us which every man in every state <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of life in his most plentiful prosperity must sometimes do for himself; that is, Deny himself what he desires, and might enjoy without offence: Which he that does not do, but constantly gives his Appetite every sort and degree of lawful thing it asks, does teach it to crave on, and be importunate, and insolent, and not endure to be resisted, when it did alwayes find him to be so obsequious to it. If <hi>David</hi> never checkt <hi>Adonijah,</hi> did not at any time displease him, saying, <hi>Why hast thou done so?</hi> he easily takes confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to say <hi>I will be King,</hi> and step into the Throne. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 5. 6. But he that mortifies sometimes, that does <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> acquaint even his most innocent desires with a denyal, how can unlawful ones assault him? For can my Appetite hope to betray me into superfluities, who have taught my self not to wish for necessaries? Will he be tempted with Excesses, or hearken to the invitations of Luxury, that will not hear his bowells when they croak for bread? Or he gape for intemperate satisfactions, who will not let thirst call, but shuts his mouth against it? Why should he covet more that hath learnt to give away, and want that which he hath? Now Sufferings inflict this temper on us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> us with the necessity of all this, and in a while with the liking of it, teach us Content without Lawful Delights; yea, by degrees make that content appear better than an assured enjoyment; for were I offered the choice either of an <hi>uninterrupted Health,</hi> or of a <hi>certain Cure</hi> in all Diseases, sure I had rather <hi>never need a Potion</hi> than drink <hi>Antidote</hi> and <hi>Health</hi> it self. And even so the lawful good things of this life are at the best but <hi>Remedies</hi> and <hi>Reliefs,</hi> never good but upon supposition: Therefore while Affliction taught us to want, it hath destroyed this art <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the Flesh.</p>
                  <p>As for the Second, Then the lulling asleep all sense or thoughts of any Life hereafter, neither minding the fear of one, or hopes of the other; Affliction surely met with this too: For Sufferings bring both the <hi>hereafters</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the Sad one while every Punishment was an Essay and tast of that which is prepared for those that live after the Flesh, and the more insupportable our <hi>Firey Tryal</hi> was, the more it caution'd us to beware of <hi>that Fire which is never quenched.</hi> And for the other Life, surely when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our Condition was such, that if we lookt unto the Earth, behold nothing but <hi>Darkness and dimness of Anguish, and darknesse as of the shadow of Death,</hi> we could not choose
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109439:9"/>
but turn away our Eyes and lift them up to Heaven. When <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Soul is thrown down by Oppression, it mounts by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siliency, and with the force of pressure is crush'd Upwards; or if the Load be heavy, so as to make it grovel and lie prostrate, it is but prest into the posture of Devotion: When she's disseised of all, turn'd out of every possession, then she begins to think of an <hi>abiding City, and eternal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi> For the Soul that is restless, when it sees nothing here below to stay upon, but all is hurried from her, roams about for some hold to rest on, and being able in that case to find nothing but God, there she does grasp and cling; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and when the storms splits all enjoyments, and devours Friends which make enjoyments comfortable, all perish in one wrack, then she sees she must catch at him that sits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Water-Floods. I told you out of <hi>Job,</hi> Affliction did discover better than Revelation, and in the dimnesse of Anguish we might see more than by Vision; and truely of two Visions which our Saviour gave to his most intimate Apostles <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the one of Glory on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> the other of Sufferings in <hi>Gethsemane;</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the one <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Himself transfigured,</hi> a glimpse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> beatificall vision; and in the other <hi>Hell transfigured,</hi> and a sad Scene of all its Agonies, he thought this a more concerning sight, for when they fell asleep at both, at his Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 32. <hi>Peter, and they that were with him, were heavy with sleep;</hi> yet he does not rouse them up to behold his Glory, when they did awake, indeed they saw a glimpse of it, but <hi>straight a Cloud did overshadow it. verse</hi> 34. But at his Passion he bids them <hi>Watch with him, Mat.</hi> 28. 38. and when he findeth them asleep, he sayes, <hi>What, could ye not watch with me one hour? v.</hi> 40. and bids them <hi>watch</hi>

So much more necessary vvas it to behold his <hi>Agonies,</hi> than to see his <hi>Felicities:</hi> Glory does not discover or invite to Heaven, so much as Sufferings drive to it; and we are more concerned to take a view of that <hi>Garden in Gethsemane, than that of Paradise,</hi> and the going down from the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Olives</hi> does more advantage us in climbing the Eternal hills, than all <hi>Mount Tabors</hi> height. Nor do Afflictions onely drive us toward heaven, but they beget an <hi>hope</hi> of it. <hi>Knowing that Tribulation worketh Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>

he that rides at <hi>Anchor of this Hope</hi> though his Anchor lye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> buryed under Waves, yet those rouling Hills of Sea, swell'd by storms of Affliction, and raised too by his Tears, do without <hi>Hyperbole</hi> mount him to Heaven: He that hath entertained these Expectations in earnest, how will he slight temptations here below? What will he not sacrifice to <hi>Christs</hi> Command? See, <hi>Abraham</hi> that did but hope for <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that far off too, to be possest by the Posterity of his Son <hi>Isaack,</hi> yet when God commands him to flay <hi>Isaack</hi> before he had any posterity, and so to dash all his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and quite cut off the very motive to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> yet he hopes and obeys even to a contradiction, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Does both against hope:</hi> And had we but the shadow of his hope, as he had but the shadow of our promises, how would we sacrifice a sin at his Command, and think a Fleshly lust a good exchange for the hope of Heaven, which Tribulation worketh? and <hi>he that had suffered in the Flesh would certainly cease from sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now my last work is to view our own Concern in this, and surely that must be all Exultation and Triumph, and this not so much that our <hi>sufferings are ceast,</hi> as that our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>sins</hi> are so; not that our Enemies are sunk, but that our flesh is vanquisht, that <hi>sub hoc signo ninces</hi> is thus also come to passe, with the Standard of the Crosse, that Cross on which our selves were Crucified, we have overcome; and with this Christian banner we have put to flight the Armies of our Heathen Vices. For thus it must be, if my Text be true; and sure it is not possible it should be otherwise: For look upon the Muster-roll of these our Foes which S. <hi>Paul</hi> does produce, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. 20, 21. and see which of them could escape; it runs thus, <hi>Adultery, Fornication, uncleanness, lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Heresies, Envyings, Murder, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Revellings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin with the great Commanders, those that lead the Van and bring up the Reare, <hi>Uncleannesse,</hi> and <hi>Revellings;</hi> They that consider how they not onely suffered <hi>for,</hi> but <hi>by</hi> these Vices, which did misplace mens watches and attendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; sins that were not onely like <hi>Achans</hi> in our Army, and ruin'd it by bringing the accursed thing into it, but were like <hi>Hannibal's Numidians</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, that did at once <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> betray to, and inflict Ruine; sins that did merit and effect Destruction, and made as well as provok'd, overthrows; and sins that by Gods goodnesse did cut off themselves, whilethey did bring men into a condition that would not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109439:10"/>
bear such Vices: These are the guilts of Wealth and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that do attend Felicity and Pomp; it is not onely hopeful that men did resolve to be reveng'd on these great workers of their mischief, and will no more resett such trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in their bosoms; but sure these sins are ceast that did put out themselves.</p>
                  <p>Then for <hi>Seditions;</hi> They who consider when they broke the <hi>Scepter,</hi> they left us nothing but the <hi>Rod of God</hi> instead of it; a Rod that turned straight into a <hi>Serpent,</hi> that chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our <hi>Seas</hi> into <hi>Blood,</hi> or rather made <hi>new Seas</hi> of our own <hi>blood;</hi> that brought <hi>Locusts</hi> over the Earth, and <hi>Frogs</hi> into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the <hi>Temple</hi> also, to croak there; that struck <hi>Lights</hi> here worse than <hi>Egyptian Darkness,</hi> and <hi>destroyed all the first born</hi> of the Nation, all the Nobles of the Land, these will easily believe that we have felt this Rod too much to seize upon it hastily again; the <hi>Scepter</hi> is restored, and this <hi>Rod</hi> like to that in <hi>Israel,</hi> laid up, I hope, within the <hi>Ark</hi> together with the <hi>Tables of the Law,</hi> never to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd from Gods Commands, nor taken thence against them.</p>
                  <p>Next for <hi>Heresies;</hi> Truely we have left us none to revive, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or to make new; the mischief both of them and their Cause, the want of Government in the Church, is now discerned and remedied: And for <hi>Divisions</hi> and <hi>Schismes,</hi> they who reflect on the sad issues of them, how well meaning soever all their Causes were, will certainly avoid them: To see how while we quarelled for the Fringes of Religion, we tore the seameless Coat of Christ to pieces; yea, and the body too: How when we first dislikt a Liturgy, the daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Prayer was made to cease, and then the House of Prayer was demolisht; next, <hi>Christs,</hi> our <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> was rejected, that Liturgy of his own framing, thrown away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the Rubbish of his Temple, and then it was a sin to pray at all. His Table we must have remov'd, and then his <hi>Supper</hi> was so too; and that Great Mystery of our Religion, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of our Redemption, was buryed in the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of his Altar. To see how thus out of heats of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we destroyed all Religion, because that some adjacent Circumstances did not please us, and fetcht a Coal from the Altar to set fire to and burn down the Temple, because the building of some out-court was, we thought, irregular; is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Document enough not to attempt this any more for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sake: For now it would be in despite of Christ, who hath almost verified the <hi>Jewish</hi> accusation of him, <hi>Destroy this Temple also, and in three dayes he will build it up again;</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:109439:10"/>
and hath built it up we hope, as he did that of his own Body, never to fall again by us: Surely we will not kill this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Body of his out of Love to him, and make his <hi>Temple</hi> his <hi>burnt Offering.</hi> When God hath set our sins in order thus before our eyes, shewed them us in their sad effects, there is no fear that we should fall in love with them.</p>
                  <p>But where it is not thus, where Gods last and most work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Method hath been able to produce no good, I must, to keep my word,</p>
                  <p>Apply the Danger: In that case what remains but the <hi>Curse of the ground, Heb.</hi> 6. 8. which, if after all the Husband-mans methods of Care and Art, it bring forth only <hi>thorns</hi>

                     <hi>Plowers plowed upon our backs and made long furrows,</hi> and the Iron teeth of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors as it were harrowed us; if we bring forth onely the fruits of the Flesh, we are rejected, reprobated, God will bestow no more arts on us, we are not far from his curse, and there <hi>remains onely a fearfull looking for of Judgment and ficry Indignation.</hi> If any did continue refractory to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Rod, sinn'd under and against Judgment, and did commit with an high hand even while the Lords hand was stretcht out against them, what shall reform, what can express their guilt? To have beheld that tragical iniquity we read of <hi>Lyons,</hi> where when the City was so visited with the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that scarce any were free, that the Dead without a figure buried their dead, falling down one upon another, each being at once a Carcass and a grave; the Souldiers of the Cittadel would daily issue forth and deflour Virgins now giving up the ghost, defile Matrons even already dead, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> committing with the dust, warming the grave with sinful heats, and coupling with the Plague and Death; would not this have seemed the Landskip of Hell to us, when they suffer and sin together? yet when a Church and State were on their death-beds, Gods tokens on them, visited with the treasures of his Plagues, and our selves sinking in that our Ruine, if any went a whoreing after their own flesh, still fulfilling the lusts thereof, and in the midst of Deaths searching for sins; what was this but to do the same things whose story <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> does affright us, while the actions please? and in this case what method will be useful? do we think our selves of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous kind that will do nothing by compulsion, but will for kindness, and though we would not be chained, yet we will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109439:11"/>
be drawn to Vertue by the cords of Love; and now God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hath shewn mercy on us, we will return him service out of gratitude. Truely I make no question but most of us have promised some such things to God, how if he would but <hi>save us from our Enemies</hi> that we might <hi>serve him without fear,</hi> that we would do it <hi>in holinesse and Righteousness before him:</hi> And if he would restore his opportunities of Worship, how we would use them. Thus we did labour to tempt God, and draw him in to have compassion; and this was <hi>Ephraims</hi> Imagination just, <hi>I heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himself,</hi> saith the <note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 31. 18.</note> Prophet <hi>as a Bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, turn thou</hi>

                     <hi>me and I shall be turned;</hi> turn my Captivity, and I will turn my life: But this was as a Bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, that did not like the straitness and pressure of it, and would promise any thing to get it off, thought it more easie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form than bear Affliction: But is this hopeful think you? The Souldiers of <hi>Lyons</hi> that would ravish Death, and break into the Grave for Lust, it may be would have been modest, and retired from the fair Palaces that are prepared to tempt and entertain that vice: Cold and insensible of all those heats that Health and Beauty kindle; but remember it was the <hi>taking off Gods Hand</hi> that <hi>hardned</hi> Pharaohs <hi>heart,</hi> and a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>release from punishment</hi> was his <hi>Reprobation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for those that were humbled under the Rod, and when God had retrencht from their enjoyments, did put re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints upon themselves, gave over sinning; I have a word of Caution for them, that they examine well and take a care it be a ceasing from fin like that in the Text, a <hi>dying</hi> to it, that <hi>they no longer live the rest of their time in the flesh to the lusts of men:</hi> For if this Old Man be onely cold and stiff, not mortified by the calm and sunshine of peace, likely to be warm'd into a recovery, if thou owe all thy Innocence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to thy Pressure, wert onely plunder'd of thy sins, and thy Vertue and Poverty hand in hand as they were born, so they will dye together, thy Vices and Revenues come in at once: What is this but to invite new Desolations, which God in kindness must send to take away the opportunities and foments of our ruining sins? 'tis true, when God has wrought such most astonishing miracles of mercy for us, when he did make Calamity contribute to our Happinesse; when we were Shipwrackt to the Haven and the Shore; when rains did advance us and we fell upwards; it is an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> argument God would not do such mighty works on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to undo them, we have good ground of confidence that he will preserve his own mercies, and will not throw away the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109439:11"/>
issues of his goodness in which his bounty hath so great an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> interest and share. But yet if we debauch Salvation, and make it serve our undoing, if we order these opportunities of mercy so, that they onely help us to fill up the measure of our sins, if we teach Gods long suffering onely to work out our eternal sufferings, these Mercies will prove very cruel to us, and far from giving any colour for our hopes: When the <note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> Prodigal was received into his Fathers house and arms, had a <hi>Ring</hi> put on him, and the <hi>fatted Calf</hi> killed for him, if he should strait have invited the companions of his former riot to that <hi>fatted Calf,</hi> and joyn'd his <hi>Harlot</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him with that <hi>Ring,</hi> he had deserved then to be disinherita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both from his Fathers house and pitty, who would have had no farther entertainment, nor no bowells for him. To prevent such a fate, let us make no relapses, but quite cease from sin; which if we do not do, a little Logick will draw an unhappy inference from this Text; if <hi>he that hath suffered hath ceast from sin,</hi> then <hi>he that hath not ceast</hi> from sinning <hi>hath not suffered,</hi> and then what is all this that we have felt and so layn under? what is it if it be not <hi>suffering?</hi> If this be but preparative, then what is the full potion, the Cup of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Indignation, when all his Violls shall be poured into it? If such have been the beginnings of sufferings, what shall the issues be? If the morning dew of the day of punishment have been so full of blood, what shall the Storm and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest be? the deluge and inundation of Fury? Take heed of making God relapse, 'tis in your power to prevent it, your Reformation will be his preservative and Antidote: That is the way to keep all whole; to settle Government and Religion both; at once to establish the <hi>Kings Throne and Christs:</hi> For notwithstanding mens pretensions, these Thrones are not at all inconsistent: For that there must be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>no King</hi> but <hi>Christ,</hi> that there cannot be a Kingdome here of this world, because there is a Kingdome that is not of this world is such another Argument, as that there cannot be an Earth because there is an Heaven. Indeed if we fulfill my Text, then we shall reconcile these Kingdoms, and bring down Heaven into us; for that's a state where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sin, nor suffering, where there shall be no tears because no guilt to merit them, and no calamity to make them: Now Reformation does work this here in some degree, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our comforts that are checker'd with some sufferings, and our piety which is soiled with spots, shall change into Immortal and unsullied Glories; to the Throne of which Glories, he prepare us all <hi>Who washt us from our sins in

                  </p>
                  <p>The words need not much explication; By <hi>Israel</hi> is meant the Church of God, and by his <hi>goodnesse</hi> to it, all his exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall mercies also and protections, as the Psalme evinces; and by <hi>such as are of a clean heart,</hi> those that to the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Religion and Holiness of outward conversation, do add internal purity and sincerity; for some translate it, <hi>such as are of a clean heart,</hi> some, <hi>such as are true-hearted and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere:</hi> And it signifies both. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words thus explicated give me these Subjects of Discourse. First, a generall Proposition, <hi>Truely God is good to Israel,</hi> to his Church. Secondly, an assignation of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109439:13"/>
under which that general Proposition holds, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 9. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>All are not Israel that are of Israel,</hi> it holds <hi>onely in such as are of a</hi>

                     <hi>clean heart.</hi> And in this we have, first, a quality appropriate to the Church, <hi>Cleanness.</hi> Secondly, with its subject, <hi>the Heart;</hi> and there I shall enquire why that alone is mention'd; whether the cleanness of the Heart suffice, and having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that, shall proceed, Thirdly, to consider them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in both the given senses as they mean, <hi>a sincere heart,</hi> and a <hi>pure undefiled heart:</hi> In each of which Considerations, because the latter part of my Text is a limitation of the former, shewing where that generall Proposition is of force, where it is not; I shall as I proceed, view all the several <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> guilts opposed to either notion of Cleanness, and see how far each of them does remove from any interest in the Lords goodness to his Church, which is the natural Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of each part, and shall be mine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Truly God is good to Israel,</hi> his Church. And sure this Proposition is evident to us by its own light, to whom God proved his goodnesse to astonishment, by exercising it to Miracle; while he at once wrought prodigies of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and conviction; to which we have onely this proof to add, That God hath been so plentiful in Bounties, that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are weary of the very mention of them, and have so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited on Goodness that we do nauseate the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that his kindness in sustaining his Compassions does vie with that which did effect them, who as he will not be provokt not to be good by such prodigious unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, so neither will he by the most exasperating use of his Favours: God did complain of <hi>Israel,</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 17. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou hast taken thy fair Jewels of my Gold and my Silver which I had given thee, and madest to thy self Images: My meat also which I gave thee, my fine floure, mine Oyle, and Hony wherewith I fed</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>thee, and hast even set it before them for a sweet savour.</hi> And if men now do offer things, in which God hath the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, to baser Idols, to their vices; if they do sauce his meat, which he hath given them, to sacrifice to Luxury, take his silver and gold to serve in the Idolatry of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, and use his Jewels to dress Images also for sowlest adorations. If Atheism grow against Miracle and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness too, and men do most deny God now when he hath given greatest evidences of his kind Providence; I know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not by what argument encouraged, unless his in the Poet,
<q>
                        <l>—Factum quod se dum negal hoc videt beatum,</l>

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:109439:14"/>
because they see they fare best now, though they deny him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> most; teaching his <hi>goodness</hi> to confute his <hi>being.</hi> If they do look upon the wondrous restitution of Gods Service as but a shifting of the Scene of Worship, only another and more gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy draught and Landskip of Religion shot on the Stage; and do accordingly esteem it as a variety and entertainment for their senses onely; for nothing higher is engag'd, I doubt me, in those offices: If they assist in them not out of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, but meer indifference to all, and therefore these at present; It is not <hi>halting betwixt God and Baal this,</hi> it is the bowing of the knee to both, which they can do to each alike, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when either is the uppermost, and truely count them Deities alike, I fear. Nay, when the onely Ordinance, the <hi>Sermon,</hi> is but a prize within the Temple, the Preacher but <hi>Rhetor dicturus ad aram,</hi> that comes to do his Exercise before the Altar, in which men are concern'd no farther than to hear and judge, not to be sentenc't by: If God endure all this, and do continue still his Church, his Worship, and his other Mercies, then I may well conclude that <hi>Truely God is good to Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I will not be this fastidious Remembrancer: These <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> arguments may prove his goodness, but sure these qualities will not preserve it to us, the <hi>limitation,</hi> my next part, must suggest them; which tells us who they are God is good to: <hi>Even to such as are of a clean Heart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Clean.</hi> Clean, Pure, and Holy, are so essential attributes of the <hi>Israel</hi> or Church of God, that though I must not say the Church does take in none but such: For there are <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 13. 28, 29, 30.</note>

                  <p>In the first <hi>Israel</hi> almost the whole Discipline of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was <hi>purity in type,</hi> and all the Ceremonies of their Worship were but <hi>figures,</hi> rather <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Cleanness,</hi> when they came first to enter Covenant with God at <hi>Horeb,</hi> and to receive their Law, they were to <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 19. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>sanctifie themselves and wash their cloaths.</hi> What purity do those Commandements require, which they must not hear with any thing that was unclean about them? which they must wash all to receive? and indeed nothing with them was enterprized without it; they were to cleanse themselves from the impurities of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> meer Contingency; yea, they were bound to wash their Dreams and purifie their very sleeps, and all this is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 1. 16. 17. <hi>Wash ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings, cease to do evil, learn to do well.</hi>

And in our <hi>Israel</hi> by our Covenant there is as much of this required, for we were all initiated into our profession by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Washing, <note n="b" place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Such, among others, are the obligations, such the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of cleanness in a Christian: Let us inquire next into the importance of the quality, and the degree that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.</p>
                  <p>And here I need not say that it stands in direct opposition to the licenti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ous practices of vice; this Scripture calls <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and pollution.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19, 20. and the sinner is there stiled <hi>the servant of corruption;</hi> sure a worthy relation this, a Servant is we know, meaner than whom he serves, at least <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he is in that consideration as he serves; and then I pray you, in what rank of things is Re or she who is below and baser then Corruption? <hi>David</hi> does also call such <hi>open Sepulchres;</hi> things all whose horrour does not lie in this that they enclose rottenness and putrefaction, but open Sepulchres are gaping frightfull noysomness; and they do also shed a killing stench; a man that is ingaged in conversations with impure sinners, is in a like condition with him who hath no air to draw into him, but that of Funeral Vaults, and does suck in onely the breath of Pestilence. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is a small thing to say the cleanness of a Christian does abhor such licentious impurities, for it is such that though it may consist with those little stains that come by slips

members to consummate them, requires no accessary organs to work them out; so neither does it require any outward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> accessary guilt to make them liable to condemnation: we know 'twas one sin of the spirit onely that made Angels De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. If a foul body be abominable to the Lord, shall a foul spirit be less odious? he that defiles his Soul offends God in a much neerer concern of his, because that speaks neerer relation to him then the body: this was only his workmanship, made out of Earth, the Spirit was created out of himself; a foul body is but filthy Clay, but he that does pollute his Soul does putrefie the Breath of God, and stains a beam of the Divinity. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other sort of things that are said to come from the Heart, and to Defile, are those which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls works of the Flesh, such as if they be committed must be committed outwardly, <hi>Murders, Drunkennesse, Revellings, Revenge, Wrath and Contentions, Seditions, Factions, Schismes, all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesses, &amp;c.</hi> In these indeed the Heart can be but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Actor, the utmost it can do, is to desire and to intend them, and to contrive and manage the designs of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, which yet Providence or the Innocence of others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> may put out of the reach of mans power, or his own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral fears may make him not dare to set upon them, though he do cherish the desires. Now if they beobstructed from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, most men use to conclude gently of their guilts while they do keep within the Heart; the Execution of them is the onely thing that does look mortal; and till the <hi>sin be perfected there is no death in it.</hi> And truly I confesse that, as it happens many times, on a sudden surprize of soul, when a bright gilded temptation strikes the heart, and dazles the mind, we see that the Will rushes on it instantly, consents and wishes heartily; yet within a while the Spirit does recover <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> out of the surprize, puts by the thrusts of fancy, and the stabs of the temptation, and that Will languishes and dies like a <hi>vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leity,</hi> as if it had been nothing but a woulding; and now the man would not by any means consent to the commission: In this case though there be a guilt to be repented of, and cleansed with many tears, yet this is Innocence in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; but if the Will purpose, contrive, and do its utmost, it is the same to the man as if he had committed. Twere easie to demonstrate this, that whatsoever evill thing a man intends and does fixedly resolve, he is guilty of, though he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> do nothing, or though the thing he chance to do be never so much lawful. Those sayings of S. <hi>Paul, I know, and am perswaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is no meat unclean of it self, but

                     <p>And now I need not tell those who are still designing sin, or mischief in the heart, although it never dares come out of those recesses, how far they are removed from the <hi>goodnesse of God to Israel.</hi>

Instead of that same Cleannesse which the Text requires, we may find Purity indeed of several sorts, but 'tis either <hi>pure Fraud,</hi> or <hi>pure Impiety;</hi> the one of these does make a strange expression very proper, <hi>pure Corruption,</hi> for so it is, sincere and without mixture, nothing but it self, no spots of Clean to chequer it, but all stain: The other is pure white indeed, but it is that of <hi>whited Sepulchres;</hi> a Life as clean as Light, a bright pure Conversation, but it shines with that light onely which <hi>Satan</hi> does put on <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 14.</note>

And yet thus is the world, we do not onely see men serve some one peculiar vicious inclination, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish their own wickednesse, but they make every vice their own, as if the Root of bitterness branch't out in each sort of Impiety in them, such fertile soyls of sin they are, here insince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were to be wisht; and where there is not <hi>cleanness</hi> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there were a <hi>Mask,</hi> that there were the <hi>Religion of Hypocrisie.</hi> We may remember God was good to <hi>Israel</hi> of old by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and performance; the one a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I need not draw resemblances, shew how Gods goodness <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to our <hi>Israel</hi> does equall that to them; applying to our selves their Raptures; how <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 126. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>when the Lord turned the Captivity of our Sion, we also were like them that dream,</hi> surprized with Mercy. Indeed as in a Dream; <hi>Ideas</hi> are not alwayes well connected, there is no chain or thread of fancies, and the thoughts are not joynted regular and even; but there are breaches and disorder in them still, the Images of sleep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's,</hi> made of such things as do not well unite. So there is something I confess, like this in our condition, for with our <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver,</hi> our precious things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that are restored, there is <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> not onely meaner mixtures, but such things as will not close, or be soder'd, but do incline to part asunder, and would moulder and tend towards dissolution; and just as in a Dream, the composure
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109439:20"/>
of things is not so undisturb'd, but that there is some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedness; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> neither our affections nor practises do perfectly cement; but yet I hope it is no <hi>dream of mercy,</hi> 'tis not a <hi>Phantasme</hi> or an <hi>Apparition of Gods kindness,</hi> but the Lord will be truly good to us.</p>
                     <p>Yet if we do proceed as <hi>Israel,</hi> and equal it in provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:—</p>
                     <p>But I will make no parallels, publique clamors do that too loud; these do display the factions of iniquity among us, and muster up the several parties of our vices too; and each man is as perfect in the guilts of all sides that he is not of, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if their memories were the books that shall be opened at the Day of Judgment; some men can point you out our <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Zelots;</hi> others can shew you our <hi>prophane licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Professors,</hi> Lay and Clergy both; and indeed we need not go far to seek any or all of these, nor do we want our <hi>Sadduces.</hi> Now if all this be true, then as those were the signs of the Son of Man's coming to them in Judgment, so we may fear they are his Harbingers to us.

                     <hi>meat for their Souls;</hi> not to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Hunger of their Body, that they had before; but to indulge the Lusts of their mind; they did not want food, but variety; Festival diet, and a Table furnisht they would have; and this luxuriancy and wantonness of Meat the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Scripture calls <hi>meat for the Soul:</hi> Such as God sayes in other places <hi>the Soul lusteth after.</hi> Indeed forc't meats, and things that please meerly by being rare and dear, or by being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, these do not feed the Appetite but opinion, and the mind; it is the Soul onely that hungers after these: Thus when I look after Wine in the glasse, and make my Eye a Critique of its accidents, and by the mode and fashion of it teach it to please or displease my judgment, I do not here thirst after the cool moysture of it, but the sparkling flame, and do not drink the wine, but the flavour and colour, and this is all but notion. Now certainly these are not proper <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> objects for our appetites, <hi>meat for the Body,</hi> sayes the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and it is the Stomack and not the Imagination that is hungry; nor is it Fancy or the Soul that thirsts, but 'tis the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, so that these are unnatural and monstrous satisfactions and appetites.</p>
                  <p>And yet to bring mens selves to this, is one of the great masteries of Wit and Art, to force themselves to find a relish in these things, and then contrive them is a piece of skill which the advantages of parts and fortune are desireable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mostly, as they are useful to: And a well studied Epicure, one expert in the mysteries of Eating, is a singularly qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and most grateful person.</p>
                  <p>It were in vain to ask what else such men can be good for?
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109439:22"/>
that being their Profession, they are out at most other things: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Indeed the Soul that dwells in Dishes, and is stew'd in its own Luxuries, grows loose and does dissolve, its sinews melt, all its firmness of mind forsakes it, the man is strong for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but for Lusts, his faculties are choak'd and stifled, they stagnate and are mir'd within him, and there corrupt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefie. And then what Cranes will force out thence, and wind up such a Soul into the practises and expectations of Plety? will make it mind and entertain the hopes and Duties of Religion? what macerations, what Chymistry will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecate a Spirit so incarnated, and rectifie it into such a fineness <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as befits that state where all their blessednesse have no sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al relish, but are sublimed into Divine and purely Spirituall.</p>
                  <p>Lord God! that thou shouldst shed a Rational Angelick Soul into us, a thing next to the Being of thy Selfe, and We make it employ it selfe to animate onely the organs of Intemperance, and Gluttony, and their appendant lusts: Only inspire us how to be but more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious, indeed but more luxurious Bruits, when thou hast set us here to train and discipline our selves for a condition of such glorious Joyes as are fit to entertain Souls of Reason <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with, and to make them blessed; which to enter upon, our Bodies must drop from us, our Souls must be clarified from Flesh, and Flesh it self re fined into a Spirit; that we should make our selves Antipodes to this, walk contrary to all, and so debase our spirits as that they are qualified for no other satisfaction, but those of dull sense and carnality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> fell his great Fall by Eating, but ever since men fall further by riotous intemperate Eating. He fell from Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, and they from Reason; the Man sinks into Beast, and the Soul falls into very Flesh, and hath no other faculties or appetites but fleshly ones. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such people of all others are not to be raised up by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; their fulness gives no place to that, but does exclude it. God did complain of this of old, 32. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. <hi>Je surun waxed fat and kicked;</hi> that we may see they want no bruitish quality, who do allow themselves the appetite of Bruits; they that <hi>pamper themselves like to fed Horses,</hi> will also <hi>neigh</hi> like them and <hi>kick</hi> even him that fed them; <hi>thou art waxen fat, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God that made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> When they came once where they did <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 32. 13.</note>

                     <hi>out of the Rock, and Oyl out of the flinty Rock,</hi> they could not mind <hi>the Rock of their Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed this sensuality as it consumes Estates, eats Time,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109439:23"/>
and all the faculties of the Mind, so it devours all Religion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> too, it hath not onely a particular opposition to some one duty as the other Vices have, but by a direct influence it destroyes the whole foundation of Virtue and obedience to God; I mean subordination of the lower appetite to Reason and Religion, which it renverses quite, and breeds an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal cachexy of the Soul as well as Body.</p>
                  <p>For ever since <hi>Adam</hi> did eat of the forbidden Fruit, <hi>the carnal mind</hi> we know <hi>is neither subject to the Law of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can be,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. because Gods Commands are restraints upon those things which Flesh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eagerly. Now therefore while that Mind is unsubdued, it must needs lust against the Spirit for those things that are forbidden, nor endure to be limited; which he that feeds it, is so far from working towards, that he does give it still more provocation and more power, and makes the Flesh more absolute; for it is clear that Plenty does encrease all its desires and their unruliness; it ministers both vigor to it by which it is enabled to fulfil its lusts, and it ministers aptness and incitation also, both by custome of satisfaction, and by adding heat which makes it more prone to rebell, and more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> impossible to be kept under. The progresse of this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in the Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 6. <hi>The People sate down to Eat and Drink and rose up to Play:</hi>

But if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and we our selves have any sins to be repented of, and we design this season for that use (as sure some season must be so employed, and why not this as well, rather indeed than any other;) if we be not of those that would be glad to see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all thrown again into Confusion; glad to see a return of the same Vengeance, as indeed a return of the same sins, and the abuse of Mercies seem to call for it, while men do live as if they thought God had wrought all these Miracles meerly to give them opportunity to serve their Vices or their other ends, to put them in a way to get Places, Estates, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; and by uncharitable gains, hard hearted griping, yea by false unworthy treacherous arts, to heap up Wealth, to raise their Families, or feed their lusts: These, these cry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> out to God to renew his Commission to the Sword, to passe through all the Land again, and embowel it self in Church and State; these call for it as loud as the harangueing prayers of Seditious Men; and the Lord knows there are too many

hands that would unsheath it, if God do not interpose to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hinder, and well we have deserv'd he should. But if we would endeavour to engage him by Repentance, that will require the Afflicting of the Soul by some severities. Do not mistake your selves; Repentance, as it cannot be wrought out amidst our courses, that were contradiction to return, and yet go on; so also it will not be wrought out amidst the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as we call the jollities, of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> is very pleasant with those who did dislike that in their Penitencies, they were by the Church prescrib'd to put off Mirth and put on Sackcloth, and take Ashes for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Bread; <hi>Come,</hi> sayes he, <hi>reach that Bodkin there to braid my Hair, and help me now to practise all those Arts that are in Mode to attire it; give me the washes of that Glasse, the blushes of that Paper, the foyles which that Box hath to beautifie and dress my Cheeks; come and set out and dress my Table too, let me have Fowl with costly forc't and not a natural Fat; or let me have cramb'd Fish, and cramme my Dishes also; get me chearful Wines too: and if any one ask why I do thus indulge my self? why I will tell him, I have sinn'd against my God, and am in danger of Perdition, and therefore I am in great trouble; I macerate (do you not see the signs of it?) and excruciate my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> self, I take these fearful careful wayes that I may reconcile God to me whom I have offended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas to <hi>humble</hi> ones self thus in <hi>fulnesse,</hi> and to <hi>afflict the Soul in chearful plenties,</hi> is such a thing as none but he that sinks under the surfeit of those Plenties understands. I'm sure the Lord, when he required his People to repent, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them then to discipline, and use severities upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; they were to <hi>fast</hi> or <hi>dye:</hi> God took the execution, <hi>for whatsoever Soul it be that shall not be Afflicted that same day shall be cut off from among his People,</hi> 23. <hi>Levit.</hi> 29. Even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cut off by God himself.</p>
                  <p>And I do verily perswade my self, that one great cause, why men that have sometimes thoughts to reform their lives, and do resolve against their Courses, yet repent of their Repentance, their resolutions untwist, and become frail as threads of Cobweb, the first assault of a temptation does break through them, is, they do not use mortifications to work their aversations high and strong against their sins, and fix their resolutions. The universal sense of the whole Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church does give me confidence in this perswasion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> who for that very reason in their penitential Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did inflict such severities, as 'tis almost incredible that Christians would submit to; yet they beg'd to be censur'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109439:24"/>
into; and those had S. <hi>Paul</hi> for their precedent. But now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Repentances are but dislikes, little short unkindnesses at our sins, and wouldings to do better: On some moving occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if Gods hand or his Spirit lash, it may be Tears will gush out of the Wound, and we in angry sadness do intend against our vices; but when that fit is over, and the Flesh by indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences prepared to make or answer a temptation, we fall again, and then it may be shake the head and curse the sin; but yet again commit it, if the invitation be fair: And then are very sorry, account our selves unhappy, who lye under such a violent infirmity, but act it still. Now if we consider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> how it comes to passe that we go round like men inchanted, in a Circle of Repenting and of Sinning, we shall find it is for want of Discipline upon our selves; for had we strove to make our humiliations more low and full of pungent sorrow, the Soul would start and fly at the first glance of that which cost it so much anguish; but who would fear to act that sin which puts him to so little trouble to repent of? as a sad thought, a sigh, a wish, and a loose purpose, thin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and thats all.</p>
                  <p>Do not complain of the Infirmity of the Flesh for this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and say thou wouldst live Spiritually, but the frailty of thy sensual part betrayes thee; its stings and incitations make thee start from duty, and goad and force thee into actions which otherwise thou neither shouldst or wouldst commit. 'Tis thou thy self that arm'st thy Flesh with all its stings; thou givest it strengths, whereby it does subdue the Spirit; thou waterest thy desires with Wines; thou feedest them with strong meat and teachest them to crave; thou cocker'st them with thy indulgence, and thou dost treat Temptations to sin, dost invite wickednesse, and nourish the occasions of Ruin; and then it is no wonder if thy resolutions be not strong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> enough, there is no way but by Austerities to mortifie all inclinations that stir against the Spirit, and by denying satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions to thy Appetite, to calm and moderate thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to every thing below, and then Temptations will have neither Aid nor Avenue.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, <hi>You shall Afflict your Souls,</hi> cannot be meant onely <hi>that ye shall Afflict your Bodies;</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> also must be troubled, and we must <hi>rent the Heart as well as Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> that is indeed a Sacrifice fit for a Propitiation day, for it is such a one as God will not despise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 17. and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> without which all others are but vain Oblations.</p>
                  <p>God may call <hi>safting</hi> the <hi>Afflicting of the Soul,</hi> because it is the most appropriate and natural means to work it; but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109439:25"/>
when he calls it so he does intend it should produce it. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are <hi>humilificandi hominis disciplina,</hi> as <hi>Tertull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> sayes, <hi>Humiliation discipline;</hi> but yet they have not alwayes that effect. The <hi>Pharisee</hi> that fasted twice a week did not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie at all, but his Humiliation made him lofty, his empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse filled him with wind, and puft him up, and the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> was <hi>more justified</hi> than he. And late experiences have taught us, that Fasting does not alwayes humble, when it did gape for Soveraignty, and did afflict them into Power onely, when there attended it a <hi>sacra fames,</hi> an hunger after Holy things, and such as all the relicts of old Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> could not allay, but it devoured Church and State, and yet crav'd still: And <hi>the throat</hi> of these fasting men <hi>was an open Sepulchre indeed;</hi> open to bury, and that could no more be satisfied than the Grave.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis not onely these demure impieties, and those that are devont in wickednesse, and act it in Religion and the Fear of God, I have to speak against:</p>
                  <p>But in the generall, If Fasting do not humble, and those severities that wear the Flesh break not the heart too and make it contrite, then they are lost upon us, and do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us. All these strictnesses of <hi>bodily</hi> and outward <hi>exercise,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, are acts of discipline prescribed to make the Sorrowes of Repentance more severe and operative, and so to be the Correctives of the distempers of the Soul, to quell the risings of the Appetite and Passions, and bring the sensual part of us under obedience to Reason and Religion; to make all calm and even in us, and put us in the frame of Men and Christians, of Rational and Pious Creatures. And if they do not work this in us, if the Soul do not meet in the performances, they are not acceptable in themselves at all: These are onely the <hi>mint anise</hi> and <hi>cummin</hi> of our Pieties; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and as <hi>Origen</hi> sayes, the <hi>condimenta actuum</hi> the sauces of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, not the main standing parts of it, which he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that offers solitary gives God <hi>a Sacrifice of Sallads,</hi> and thinks that will be a Sin-Offering. They do mistake themselves who cherish any hope from having spent a day, or <hi>Lent</hi> of abstinence; if the Excesses of their vices be not made over, and evacuated by it; if they continue still full gorg'd with their iniquity; or who think all is well, they have atton'd by having bowed down the head like a bulrush; if the Soul were not also humbled in them; for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> does say, <hi>I may give all my goods to feed the poor, yet have no Charity,</hi> and <hi>I may give my body to be burnt,</hi> yet in those <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr-fires</hi> there may be no heats of Love to God, and then all

these profit me nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. So I may chasten my self too, and yet not receive correction or be disciplin'd, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then Gods punishments are still due to me.</p>
                  <p>That Church indeed which hath found out the easie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of Indulgences, that hath the treasure of Christ's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and all the supererogations of the Saints at her dispose, and by Commission can issue them at pleasure out, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply those merits to mens uses not by <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but by a <hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Brief,</hi> and not require <hi>Gospel conditions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> in the persons that receive them, but <hi>visiting a Church in</hi> Rome, <hi>ascending the steps in such a Chappel in the</hi>

But though there be all the reason in the world they should let men out of Purgatory on what condition they please, when themselves onely put them in, and make the breath of a few <hi>Pater noster's</hi> quite blow out those flames which burn no where but in their Doctrines: Yet when without any commission from Christ they make <hi>Attrition</hi> able to secure men from <hi>Hell,</hi> and an <hi>Indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

too, our little outward strictnesses, unless the soul be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'd, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> &amp; except there be inward life of religion, all those will not avail: If I deny my self my <hi>meals,</hi> &amp; give my self my sins, that is so far from expiation that it aggravates, I am an argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my self that my crimes are incorrigible, when I will have them though I cut off the instruments &amp; foments of them, and though I meddle not with the temptations, yet I seize the sins.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, What this Day was the Verse before the Text informs us, it was their Day of Expiation or Atonement. Now that the <hi>Jewes</hi> esteem Fasting and Humiliation expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Sacrifices, appears from a Form of Prayer which even yet they use on such a day where he that fasted sayes, <hi>O Lord the Governour of all the World, I have now finished my Fast before thee, thou knowest that when we had a Temple standing, the man that sinned was bound to expiate it by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the Blood of which was poured out, and the Altar consumed the Fat to make amends for his Offence; but now by reason of our many wickednesses, we have neither a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>

But though these sayings assign not the Power and just Efficacy of that discipline in it self, yet they do the acceptance and effect of it by virtue of Christs Satisfaction: A Fainting Body cannot bear indeed the weight of our iniquities, nor will lowest prostrations in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dust bury them in the dust, or Tears alone blot out our Guilt; but Christ having done that which is effectual to all this, and requiring no more of thee to make that thine (as he does every where most solemnly avow) but faithfull humbling of thy self in an afflictive sorrow for what's past, and so to mortifie as to work out Repentance; the doing this is doing what he does require, and consequently will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: These satisfie the <hi>Command,</hi> and therefore <hi>God,</hi> though not by a <hi>condignity of performance,</hi> yet as <hi>Conditions</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which his <hi>Covenant of Grace hath set us,</hi> which when they are fulfilled then God is satisfied, thy sins are expiated, and thou art pardoned: And so in this lower sense these are thy Satisfactions with which God is well pleased.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:109439:27"/>
And thus these self Afflictions of the Sinner supply Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Indignation and divert it; <hi>They leave no place nor businesse for it, and by these short severities upon himself he does make void, he does expunge the Sentence of eternal Torments,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian: As thou becomest severe against thy self, so will the Lord abate of his severities, and he will spare, and he will pitty thee in that he sees thou wilt not spare thy self.</hi> How can he choose but be appeased towards thee when he shall see thee executing his Sentence even upon thy own self? and punishing his Enemies although they be thy Members? so that by this means thou dost censure thy self into Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Absolutions, afflict thy self into his Pardons, and dost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thy self into eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>Our Church sayes the same thing; <hi>That in the Primitive Church there was a Godly Discipline; that at the beginning of Lent such persons as were notorious sinners, were put to open Pennance, and punished in this world, that their Souls might be saved in the Day of the Lord;</hi> and <hi>she does wish</hi> (if her wishes be of any force and value when her Orders and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions are not:) <hi>that Discipline could be restored.</hi> But this I shall not presse; if all those whom the Primitive Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Condemned, or S. <hi>Paul</hi> sentenced were so used, if every Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick that lyes tearing himself and others off from the Lords Body were rejected, and if the Fornicator that joyns himself to his unclean Accomplice were disjoyned from Christ, and not suffered to make <hi>his members be the members of an Harlot;</hi> if every scandalous debauching offender that lyes corrupting Christs Body, spreading contagion, thrusting the gangreen forward, were <hi>cut off,</hi> and these and all the rest <hi>delivered up to Satan,</hi> alas what part would Christ have left of his own Body? <hi>Sed illos defendit numerus junctaeque um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>phalanges,</hi> and that I fear too in more senses than the Poet means. Therefore I shall not urge the Churches Wish, but only see whether the Statute in the Text sayes any thing to this, and whether the <hi>for ever</hi> do reach us: Which is my third and last Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Divers of the <hi>Jews</hi> Rites are said to be, and be prescribed <hi>for ever</hi> although those very Rites and the whole oeconomy of their Covenant were to be chang'd and cease; among other reasons, <hi>as the Fathers say,</hi> because they foresignifie and point at things in the new Covenant, which were to last till Covenants and Rites shall be no more, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so their meaning and signification was to be for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now truely that their Expiation Performances, those which I am upon, did so, the whole Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:109439:28"/>
is employ'd to prove; the Margent of your Bibles in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Chapter so refer you to the places, that I shall not need to make it out. Christ did fulfill the Temple and the Altar part, yea and the refuse outcast part of the Atonement, satisfied the Religion and the contempt of that dayes offices, He was the whole true Expiation.</p>
                  <p>Now does this Expiation as theirs did, require afflicting of the Soul in its attendance, or was that but a Ceremony of their Rite? and though a <hi>Jew</hi> must mourn and Fast to see his sin killing a Beast, and when he does behold his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse eating up a Goat for a Sin offering, he must deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his daily bread, and suffer thirst if his Iniquities drink but the blood of Bullocks; yet when we behold ours em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew themselves in the Blood of the Son of God, not onely lay hands and confessions on his head, but drive Thorns into it, make him cry out, almost despair and Dye; we need not be concern'd so much as to do ought of that either in order to the better Celebration of that Expiation, or on the very day of it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if we consider most mens practises, it would appear most probable that if we were to expiate our sins as the <hi>Jews</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> did by sacrificing of our Flocks not of our <hi>Jesus,</hi> those satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions would more afflict our Souls, and more restrain our vices than that which was made for us by the Death of Christ, and how can this be rectified, unlesse by some severities upon our selves, we give our selves a piercing sense of what our sin deserves, and grateful apprehensions of what our Surety suffer'd for us? When in sad private earnest I have thought fit to Afflict my Soul with some austere mortifications, and when my fainting Spirits are scarce able to sustain my Body that sinks under the load of it self, then I may have some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> tender apprehensions of that weight that sunk the Son of God, and 'twas my weight that he fell under. But he that cannot think fit to revenge a year of follies and of vices with a few weeks severer life, sure thinks his Saviour suffered much in vain; <hi>quorsum perditio haec?</hi> why must the Blood of God be paid for sin, when I cannot afford a little self-denyal for it? Why such great Agonies of the Holy <hi>Jesus,</hi> when I cannot find in my heart to bear a little strictnesse for it?</p>
                  <p>But I could easily deduce (were I not to suppose it done before) that sure as if the Church had thought a Statute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <note place="margin">By Dr. <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> Paschal or Lent Fast.</note> had annext these two for ever, they have been joyn'd from the beginings of our Christianity; it was the Fast that did attend our Saviours sufferings that in part caused the Contest about Easter, which <hi>Polycarpe</hi> S. <hi>John's</hi> Disciple
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109439:28"/>
manag'd; and then there was a Fast so soon: and he that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> tells us this, <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> Schollar to that <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> sayes some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd it <hi>many dayes,</hi> some <hi>forty dayes</hi> also, if we can take the Antient <hi>Ruffinus</hi>'s authority but for a Comma. And if the Antient Fathers do expound aright, Christ himself thought that men were interested so much in his Death, that they would Fast by reason of it; <hi>When the Bridegroom is taken from them, then shall they Fast in those dayes:</hi> Upon which words they say <hi>the Season was determin'd to this Duty by the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they may say so, who knew how to perswade men to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> take up restraints of strictest discipline and of severest Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But we cannot engage them into order or from Scandal; they made them <hi>fast,</hi> we cannot make them <hi>temperate. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour!</hi> what kind of Christians didst thou hope for thy Disciples, of whom thou wer't so confident they would so concern themselves in thy Passion as to Fast because of it? when in our times Christians will not be kept from their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses by it? not in those dayes of Fasting which thy Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive followers did Celebrate with abstinences, that did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most mortifie indeed and slay the Body of Flesh as well as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Sin, and we in imitation of them, in answer of thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, will not abate a <hi>Meal,</hi> nor an <hi>intemperance,</hi> will <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>Riot</hi> too, and make <hi>a Lent of Bacchanals:</hi> Thus we prepare load for thy Day of <hi>Passion,</hi> sin on to add weight to thy Crosse, and yet we our selves will not be humbled under them. It is in vain to tell men thou expectest they should mortifie, that it will spirit their Repentance, for they will have no kind of Penitence for sin, but such as will let them return to sin again, suffer no discipline with which their vices too cannot consist, for they can scarce live if they make not themselves chearful with them, even in this time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Sadnesse, and in sight of the Memorial of thy sufferings for them.</p>
                  <p>Indeed when I consider how this Season is hedg'd in from Vice by all Gods Indignation, <hi>threatned</hi> at <hi>first, suffered</hi> at <hi>last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> pronounc't in <hi>Commination,</hi> executed in <hi>Passion: Ash-wednesday</hi> gave us all Gods Curses against Sinners, all which <hi>Good Friday</hi> shews inflicted on our Saviour. Thus we began, <hi>Cursed are the Unmerciful, the Fornicators, and Adulterers, the Covetous persons, Worshippers of Images, Slanderers, Drunkards and Extortioners;</hi> and we shall see <hi>the Son of God</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>made this Curse</hi> for them; yea we our selves said <hi>Amen</hi> to all, as testifying that that Curse is due to all. When I consider this I say, I cannot choose but be astonish't to behold how
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109439:29"/>
men can break through all <hi>Gods Curses</hi> and <hi>their own</hi> to get <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> at Vice, first seale Gods Maledictions, then provoke and incur them instantly, as if they lov'd and would commit a Rape upon Perdition; as if because men have so long in <hi>Oaths beg'd God to damn them,</hi> and he hath not done it yet, they would now do it in their <hi>Prayers</hi> too; make their <hi>Devotions</hi> as well as <hi>Imprecations</hi> consign them to the wrath of God. He that does <hi>love cursing</hi> thus in the <hi>Passive sense,</hi> surely as <hi>David</hi> sayes, <hi>it shall come unto him, it shall be unto him as the Garment that covereth him, it shall enter into his bowels like Water, and like Oyl into his Bones, Psal.</hi> 109. 17, 18, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 19. And truly amongst those things which we did Curse, there are that will fulfill all that most literally; the Ryots of thy gaudy bravery that make thee gripe, extort, spend thy own wealth and other mens, undo thy self and Creditors, be sordid and in Debt, meerly to furnish trappings to dresse thy self for others eyes and, may be, sins these bring a Curse to cover thee as does thy Garment, yea and they gird it to thee. The draughts of thy Intemperance carry the malediction down into the Bowells like Water, yea like Wine into the very Spirits: There is another of them too that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Curse like Oyl into the Bones, till it eat out the marrow, and leave nothing but it self to dwell within them, yea till it putrefie the bones, till it prevent the Grave and Judgment too, while the living sinner invades the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the one, and torments of the other; and then the <hi>Lents</hi> and <hi>abstinencies</hi> that the <hi>sin</hi> prescribes shall be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved exactly, onely to qualifie them for more sin and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, may be, at the best but to recover them from what it hath inflicted; when yet alas! they are too soft and tender, the Lord knows, to endure any severities to work out their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Repentance and Atonement: And yet sure these the sinner does go through have nothing to commend them which these other do not much more abound with. If those are not grievous to thee because they are so wholesome, and though it be a miserable thing to go through all their painful squalid methods, yet, how disgustful so-ere, by the benefit of their cure they excuse their offensivenesse, and ingratiate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent injury they do the Flesh, by the succeeding health they help thee to, and by the Death they do secure thee from: Why sure (to omit, that the other have all these advantages, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> none have so calm and so establisht health as the abstemious and continent, and their mind is still serene, their temper ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver clouded, but besides this) the Christians bitter po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The first thing that offers it self to our consideration, is the Relation, <hi>Friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a known common-place truth, that a Friend is the most useful thing that is in whatsoever state we are: It is the Soul of life, and of content. If I be in prosperity: We know abundance not injoy'd, is but like <hi>Jewells</hi> in the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> uselesse while they are there: It is indeed nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but the <hi>opinion of Prosperity.</hi> But 'tis not possible to enjoy abundance otherwise than by <hi>communicating</hi> it: a man <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth</hi> plenty onely <hi>in his Friends,</hi> and hath <hi>fruition</hi> of it meerly by <hi>bestowing</hi> it. If I be in <hi>adversity;</hi> to have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whom I may intrust a trouble to, whose bosome is as open and as faithful to me, as 'tis to his own thoughts, to which I may commit a swelling secret; this is in a good measure to <hi>unlade,</hi> and to <hi>pour out</hi> my sorrow from me; thus I divide my grievances which would be insupportable, if I did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> my self of some part of them: Now there is no bosome so safe as that where <hi>friendship</hi> lodges; take God's opinion in the case, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6. <hi>If thy Brother the Son of thy Mother, or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy bosome, or thy Friend that is as thine own Soul.</hi> This is the highest step in the Gradation. And there is all the reason in the world; for though <hi>Parent</hi> and <hi>Child,</hi> are as neer one to other as any thing can be to part of it self; <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> are but two different names of the same one, yet these may become bitter and unkind: A <hi>Parent</hi> may grow <hi>cross,</hi> or a <hi>Child refractory,</hi> a <hi>Mother</hi> may be like the <hi>Ostrich</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Wildernesse, throw off her <hi>bowels</hi> with her <hi>burthen;</hi> and an ungracious Son is <hi>constant pangs</hi> and <hi>travail</hi> to his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> his whole life gives her <hi>after-throws</hi> which are most deadly: Dislikes also may rest within the <hi>Marriage-Bed,</hi> and lay their heads upon two wedded Pillows; but none of these unkindnesses can untie the Relation; that ends not where the bitternesse begins, he is a <hi>Parent</hi> still though fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and a <hi>Child</hi> though stubborn; but a <hi>true Friend</hi> can be nothing but <hi>kind;</hi> it does include a <hi>deerness</hi> in its essence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which is so inseparable from it, that they begin and end to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: A man may be an <hi>Husband</hi> without <hi>loving,</hi> but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a <hi>lover,</hi> that is a <hi>Friend,</hi> without <hi>loving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And sure to have no one <hi>friend</hi> in this Life, no one that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109439:31"/>
is concerned in any of my interests or me my self, none that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hath any cares or so much as good wishes for me, is a state of a most uncomfortable prospect. The <hi>Plague</hi> that keeps Friends at a distance from me while I live, out of the sphere of my infection, and after gives me Death, hath yet lesse of Malignity than this; that leaves me the Compassions, the Prayers, all the solitary comforts, all indeed but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward entertainments of my Friends; that, though it shut the Door against all company, yet, puts a <hi>Lord have Mercy</hi> on the Door: But this I now described hath none of that, hath no good wishes, nothing else but hate, is worse than a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

good words, but parts with nothing, that entertains onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with Garbs and Civilities, is but the <hi>pageant</hi> of a Friend: They that own having but <hi>one Soul,</hi> and seem to clasp as if they would have but <hi>one Body</hi> too, cannot keep such <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>separate proprieties</hi> in other little things, as not to have communication one from the other. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>friendship</hi> of these benefits is rated by the measures of our <hi>need</hi> of them. When <hi>Midas</hi> was ready to dye for hunger, his God was kinder to him in a little bread, than in making all that he touch't turn into Gold: Great things engage but little where there is but little use of them: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And all these,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Are endeered by the <hi>Affection</hi> they are given with. Good turns done with design, what need soever I have of them, are <hi>hire,</hi> and not <hi>friendship;</hi> it is the kindness onely that obligeth, the gift without the love does but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid and scorn my want.</p>
                  <p>Now to measure the <hi>Friend</hi> here in the Text, by these, were an impossible undertaking, whose Friendship did exceed all bounds and measures. I shall do no more towards it but read the words before my Text, which were the occasion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it, <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his Friends,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>Ye are my Friends.</hi> The <hi>token</hi> therefore of his Friendship, the <hi>gift</hi> he gave them was his <hi>life,</hi> rather that was the least he gave: He gave his <hi>glory</hi> first, that so he might be qualified to give his life, for <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. He <hi>lessened himself</hi> from the condition of being Lord of all, into that of a Servant, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. being <hi>diminished, made lower, meaner</hi> than his Creatures <hi>for the suffering of Death.</hi> Now with the price of such Divine essential glory to buy onely a life, rather onely a possibility of Death, that after he might give that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> life for us, and with his Death purchase us an immortal life, is such a gift as no <hi>Romance</hi> of friendship ever fancied or did aim at: We may have heard of two Companions that would dye for one another, that never quarrelled in their lives, but for this, who should suffer first to save the other, and strave onely for Execution: But for a Person of the <hi>Trinity</hi> to leave his Heaven to come down to us; to dwell with agonies that he might be at one with us; and be tyed to the Cross, that he might be united to us; this is a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship fit for <hi>Ecstasies</hi> of <hi>apprehension.</hi> Of all the things that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> court thy kindness here below, that spread snares, and lay baits for thy friendship, if any bid so fair, so temptingly, if any will give such a price, in Gods name let it have thy love,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109439:32"/>
I shall not blame him that engageth his Affection there: But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sure <hi>Heaven</hi> cannot give a greater gift than this; for what can God give greater than himself? Yea I may say God could not give so much, for he must be <hi>Man</hi> too, to give his <hi>life,</hi> and this, saith he, <hi>he gave for his Friends,</hi> even in our stead, who must have perisht else eternally, which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the second thing, the <hi>need</hi> we had of this.</p>
                  <p>A need great as the gift, necessity invincible, that could break into Heaven, rifle the <hi>Trinity</hi> to serve it self, throw Death into those Regions of Immortality, and which would not be satisfied but with the <hi>Blood of God.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now is not the kindness and the condescension of Friendship in his expressions too, when he saith, <hi>greater love than this hath no man?</hi> which was the third endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>There never were such <hi>wounds</hi> of Love as those that tore this Heart; never such meltings of Affection as dissolv'd this Lover into <hi>sweats of Blood.</hi> There was no motive to all this, but his meer love: For all this he designed to us <hi>before we were,</hi> and therefore sure <hi>before we were deserving:</hi> And O our God! thou that from all Eternity didst lay Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to give thy Life for us, so to redeem, and then to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie us; what were we then that thou shouldst do this for us? what were we then when we were not? and yet that thou from the Abysse of Everlastingness, shouldst think thoughts of such kindness to us, and such blessedness for us, who then <hi>were not,</hi> and <hi>deserved nothing;</hi> and who since we were, have <hi>deserved nothing but Damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as there was no other motive to all this design but <hi>love,</hi> so neither was there any thing but <hi>love</hi> in the fulfilling. Look on your <hi>Saviour</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> and upon Mount <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and you shall find him there in as great agonies of <hi>Affection</hi> as <hi>Torment,</hi> and hanging down his head upon the Cross with languishments of <hi>kindness</hi> more than <hi>weakness.</hi> His Arms stretched out and rack't, as if on purpose to the posture of <hi>receiving you to his embraces,</hi> and his side opened not only to <hi>shed Blood</hi> for you, but to make you a <hi>passage to his very Heart.</hi> Look on him offering up his Tears, his Prayers, and his Soul for Sin, and in the midst of all, projecting happiness to you, as it were praying, O my Father, here I charge my self with all the guilt of those my Friends, I thy onely Son God, one with thee, am content to suffer Torments that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all may be acquitted; Here I lay down my Life that they may have eternal Life, let me be Crucified, so they be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.

                     <p>I shall not urge, that Great-men upon Earth will not take any to their Friendship but upon these terms; nor will I plead the reasonablenesse of this in <hi>Christ,</hi> there being no cause why he should be a Friend to any that will daily disoblige him and dishonour him: Nor will I press the whole Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Scripture, which sayes, all the advantages Christ ever gave or meant us, and all the acts of Friendship that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ever did for us were with this design.

                     <p>But I shall wave all this, and bound my self within the present words, <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his Life for his Friends.

                     <p>And then is it not matter of Astonishment, to see men fancy they have a right in all Christ's Actions and Sufferings, presume upon his favour and their own happy condition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> though they do nothing, or but very little towards this, and the main of their life be disobedience, as if all <hi>Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> appointed them to do <hi>no commands,</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> were but a <hi>liberty</hi> from <hi>virtue.</hi> To pass by those that do nothing but Evil, that which the Devil does suggest, or their flesh dictate, and to consider the Demurer sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that pretend a respect to Christ, and to Religion, and see what they will do.</p>
                     <p>Why sometimes you may find them troubled at their vices and themselves; and those troubles breath out in <hi>Sighs,</hi>

Alas Christ does not tell you that you are his <hi>Friends</hi> if you <hi>wish well</hi> to him, and his <hi>Commands,</hi> but he requires that you shall <hi>do them.</hi> These are but vapours of a troubled Soul, which howsoever they may chance rise warm, catch a strong suddain heat, breath up in flashing thoughts.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the fire is not strong nor does it live enough, to melt and work away the filthinesses of the Soul: No, though they grow to <hi>aversations;</hi> For you may find such men, when wearied with the pursuite of their sins, <hi>hating</hi> their customes, and the engagements to the practise of them; complaining thus, <hi>I know 'tis ill, and 'tis against my heart, that I obey the motions of my passions or Lusts: The incitations of my Appetite, the usance of the World, the obligations of civility or mistaken honour do indeed prevail upon me, but 'tis with</hi>

                     <p>I know, and do approve of better things, but cannot choose but follow these that are the worser; strange, that this <hi>Fury</hi> that had the <hi>Devil for Familiar,</hi> should make <hi>Christ a friend;</hi> that this should be the state of <hi>Gospel Saints,</hi> and of <hi>Gods favourites.</hi> 'Tis possible some therefore go yet further to good purposes towards <hi>Obedience,</hi> and have <hi>holy Intentions,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but this is not sufficient neither, if to <hi>do</hi> his Commands be necessary: for to purpose and intend to do them, is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to do them.

                     <p>Yet is it hard to find a ground of this their confidence, unlesse it rise from the unhappy use they make of Gods <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Mercies,</hi> and his kindness to them in the concernments of this life. They see without their cares, and upon very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> weak intreaties indeed against all provocations both of God and danger; yet his protections secure them, although they neither mind the asking them, nor mind the walking worthy of them. The man whose Sins, not Prayers, prepare him for his Bed, he sleeps well; perhaps more soundly than he who at his Bedside throws himself on his face into Gods arms, and there bequeaths himself to the Securities of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: And he, whose Sleeps onely refresh him for returns to Sin, does often live as long, as safely, and as merrily, as he that daily most Religiously does beg Protections from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And others that afford the Lord some <hi>little homages,</hi> themselves some <hi>Prayers</hi> when their pleasures or occasions permit, God hath a care of them, and their <hi>desires flow</hi> into them, all does succeed well with them. Now they take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence hence to conclude, these are the tokens of Gods <hi>friendship,</hi> and all his mercies will come in at the like easie rates; that such <hi>a short<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> petition</hi> as committed them to the refreshments of the <hi>night,</hi> and after which they wak't into renewed strengths and pleasures, <hi>such another</hi> shall lay them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> down in safety, to the sleeps of that <hi>long night,</hi> that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards will break in <hi>happy Resurrection:</hi> For why? God will not sure fail his own mercies, but be as friendly to their Souls as he is to their Bodies.</p>

And thus God's Preservations here, in meer defiance of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> our provocations, which are the <hi>arts of his long suffering,</hi> his <hi>strivings</hi> of Compassion, meerly to give us opportunities of being reconciled to him, and to <hi>invite</hi> us to be so, while we make them occasions of carelesness and security, they are so far from being pledges of his <hi>Friendship,</hi> that they have all the aggravations of affronted goodnesse, become <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and degrees of Ruin. 'Twere fine indeed if Christ's eternal preparations for his Friends, would come in to us, without care or doing any thing, as an accession to our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; if when we had lived many years as in a <hi>Garden,</hi> our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dayes all <hi>flower'd</hi> with delight; we might expire into <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi> and in soft airs of Musick breath into <hi>Hallelujah's.</hi> But alas! the smooth <hi>easie way</hi> leads <hi>down the Hill,</hi> and the must strive and <hi>pant</hi> that will get <hi>up</hi> into the Mansions and the Bosome of his Saviour, and whosoever will be <hi>his Friend,</hi> must <hi>do what he commands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But is there nothing lesse indeed will qualify? The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saith, <hi>that Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for Righteousness, and he was called the Friend of God, James</hi> 2. 23. and then, is Christ more inaccessible, and <hi>harder</hi> to be made a <hi>Friend?</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why, truely <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> both are so much <hi>Friends</hi> to all <hi>true Believers,</hi> that the Life of Christ was given for them, <hi>for, God so loved the World that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, John</hi> 3. 16. Nor are there any qualities more signally peculiar to <hi>friendship,</hi> more engaging than confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and trust, dependance and relying, embosoming my self in him: Now these are but the excercise of Faith; and 'tis most certain if we heartily endeavour to do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, there is employment then for all this work of <hi>Faith,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> place for its applications and assurances. My Text does make this good. But when his friendship is made over on Conditions, as 'tis not onely in these words, but every where in Scripture; (there being not one promise absolute that does concern <hi>Gods favour, justification,</hi> and <hi>eternal Life:</hi> he does not once offer Remission of sins, but to those that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their lives; nay, does express as if he could not give it otherwise, <hi>peradventure they will repent that I may forgive them, Jer.</hi> 36. 3.) The promises therefore being conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nali, Faith must be answerable to the Promises that it does <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> rest on and apply; and at the most, can be but <hi>an assurance that you shall be partaker of what's promised,</hi> that is to say, partaker of the <hi>favour</hi> and the <hi>life of Christ, if ye do his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109439:35"/>
commands.</hi> But then if I perform not this condition, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> trust upon his friendship which I am not qualified for; to think by Faith to receive a Pardon, which in that case I am, was never offered me; to apply to my self promises which were never made me, for none were ever made to them that do <hi>not do;</hi> and to assure my self Christ will transgress his everlasting Covenant for my Vices sake, meerly to give me leave to enjoy my sins; will do that which <hi>God may not do, forgive</hi> one that <hi>will not repent:</hi> If I believe thus against promise, and against Decree, am confident whether Christ <hi>will or no,</hi> and will <hi>rely</hi> upon him in <hi>despite of him,</hi> if such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a faith will make us friends, affronts do reconcile. This is indeed <hi>to lay violent hands on his favour,</hi> and to invade his friendship, and without metaphor, <hi>take Heaven by force.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But sure I am, that this is not the Faith made <hi>Abraham</hi> be called the <hi>friend of God</hi> in that place of S. <hi>James,</hi> but <hi>a Faith that was perfected by doing, v.</hi> 22. of that Chapter, a Faith that made him <hi>offer up his onely Son upon the Altar, v.</hi> 21. 'Tis true, <hi>he did in hope believe against all hope, Rom.</hi> 4. 18. So that his faith was stronger than a contradiction, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but yet his resolutions of obedience seem stronger than his faith; for he did that even to the cutting off the grounds of all his faith, and hope. He trusted God would make his promise good to him, make <hi>all the Nations of the Earth be blessed in the seed of Isaac;</hi> though <hi>Isaac</hi> had no seed, nor could have, if he should be slain: And he resolved at Gods command himself to slay that <hi>Isaac,</hi> so to make him have no seed. His Faith indeed did not dispute the great impossibility; but his obedience caused it. He did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, how can God perform with me when I have offered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> up my Son? I cannot look that a large <hi>Progeny</hi> should rise out of the Ashes on the Altar; nor will those Flames that devour all my Seed at once, make my <hi>seed numerous, lasting,</hi> and <hi>glorious as the Stars in Heaven,</hi> which he <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 15. 5.</note> promised me: But much less did he question, why should I obey in this? He that does his commands, can but expect what he hath promised; but if I should do this Command and slay my Son, I make his Promise void, and destroy my own expectations: And if I disobey I can but suffer what he bids me do; my own obedience will execute all that his Indignation would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> threaten to my disobedience. Though <hi>Abraham</hi> had <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 22. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>three dayes time</hi> and journey to the Altar, that Nature might have leisure the mean while to reason with the Precept thus, and his Affection might struggle with his Duty; yet he goes on,

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it seems she is a friend that takes most <hi>irreversible dead hold,</hi> she is not onely as <hi>insatiate,</hi> but as <hi>inexorable</hi> as the <hi>Grave,</hi> and the Eternal Chains of <hi>Fate</hi> are in those her <hi>embraces.</hi> But God keep us from making such strict <hi>Covenants with Death;</hi> from being at <hi>friendship with Hell;</hi> or in a word, that I say all at once, with any that are <hi>good Companions</hi> onely in <hi>sinning.</hi> Such men having no virtue in themselves, must needs hate it in others, as being a reproach to them, and therefore they are still besieging it, using all arts and strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems to undermine it: and having nothing else to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them into mens affections, but their <hi>managery of vice,</hi> no way to Merit but by serving <hi>iniquity,</hi> they not onely comply with our own evil Inclinations, that so they may be grateful, and insinuate into us, but they provoke too and inflame those tendencies that they may be more useful to us, having no other means to work their ends. And then such friends by the same reason, must be <hi>false</hi> and <hi>treacherous,</hi> and all that we declaime at, and abhor in Enemies, when that shall be the way to serve their ends; because they have no virtue to engage them to be otherwise: And to be such, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be constant to their own designs, their dispositions and usances. These are the <hi>Pests</hi> of all Societies, they speak and live <hi>infection,</hi> and friendship with them is to couple with the <hi>Plague.</hi> These do <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> what the <hi>Devil</hi> but <hi>began</hi> in <hi>Eden:</hi> Nurse up <hi>Original sin,</hi> chafe inclination into appetite and habit, suggest and raise desires, and then feed them into Constitution and Nature: In a word, are a <hi>brood</hi> of those <hi>Serpents,</hi> one of which was enough to destroy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise and Innocence. 'Tis true, a man would think these were our Friends indeed, that venture to <hi>Gehenna</hi> for us: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Alas they are but more <hi>familiar devils,</hi> work under Sathan to bring us to Torments, and differ nothing from him, but that they draw us into them, and he inflicts them. And when sinful contents come home in Ruine, and pleasures dy into Damnation; then men will understand these treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous loves, and find such Friends are but <hi>projectours</hi> for the Devil; then they will hate them as they do their own Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, discerning these are but the kindnesses of Hell. Nay it is possible, I may slander that place in speaking so ill of it. <hi>Dives</hi> will let us see there are affections of a kinder and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> more blessed strain in Hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. from the twenty seventh verse; you find he did make truce with Torments, that he might contrive and beg onely a message of Repentance for his Brethren; he did not mind at all his own dire Agonies,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109439:37"/>
he minded so the reformation of his Friends. Good God! <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when I reflect upon these <hi>pieties</hi> of the Damn'd, together with the practises of those who have given their names in to <hi>Religion,</hi> when I see Fiends in Hell do study how to make Men <hi>virtuous,</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> upon Earth with all their art debauch them into <hi>vice</hi> and ruine; I cannot choose but pray, <hi>Grant me such Friends as are in Hell.</hi> Rather grant us all the <hi>Friendship</hi> in the Text. But then, we must have none with any vice. Friendship with that, engageth into enmity with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> I shew'd you. And to pass over all those after retributions of Vengeance Christ hath studied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for his Enemies, when he, that now courts us to be our friend and we will make our <hi>Adversary,</hi> must be our <hi>Judge:</hi> For were there none of this, and should we look no further than this life; yet sure we of this Nation know, what it is to have God our Enemy; who for so many years lay under such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, as had much of the character of his <hi>last executions;</hi> they had the <hi>Blasphemies</hi> and the <hi>Confusion,</hi> the <hi>dire Guilts,</hi> and the <hi>black Calamities,</hi> and almost the <hi>Despair</hi> and <hi>Irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verableness</hi> of those in <hi>Hell.</hi> And though He be at Peace with us at present, at least there is a Truce; yet I beseech <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> you in the presence and the fear of God, to think in earnest, whether the present provocations of this Nation do not <hi>equal</hi> those that twenty years ago engaged him into Arms against us, and made him dash us so in pieces: Whether those Actions of the Clergy be reformed, that made the People to abhor their <hi>Function</hi> and their <hi>Service,</hi> the <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Lord, and made God himself spew them out. 'Twere endless to go on to the <hi>prophanness,</hi> to the <hi>loose impieties</hi> and the bold <hi>Atheismes</hi> of the <hi>Laity,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>better sort;</hi> in short, what one degree, or state or Sex is better? Sure I am, if we are not better, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are worse beyond expression or recovery; who have resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every method, and conquer'd all God's arts of doing good upon us, been too hard for his Judgments and his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies both.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, when we lay gasping under his severe revenges, we then pretended to be humbled, begg'd to be reconciled and be at peace with him, and vow'd to his conditions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising obedience, and aliened our selves from our old sins, his Foes.

And being thus affronted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, his Enemy preferr'd, <hi>not this God, but Barrabbas,</hi> any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the vilest thing for Friend, rather than Christ, must he not needs be more our Enemy than heretofore? And if he be, that question will concern us, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 22.</note>

And if you read the 25. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> you will find there a rich Bill of <hi>Fare,</hi> which his Revenge upon his Enemies does make; view the sixth verse.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Words are part of a Debate which God had with the sinful House of <hi>Israel,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in which there are <hi>three</hi> things offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be considered.</p>
                  <p>First, The Sinners <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>choyce:</hi> He will <hi>Dye;</hi> That's his End, yea, 'tis his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, he will <hi>dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; Gods inquiry for the Ground of this, he seems astonished at the Resolution, and therefore reasons with them about this their so mad choyce, and questions <hi>Why will ye dye?</hi> Which words are also, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The debate of his Affections, the reasoning of his Bowels, and a most passionate Expostulation with them on account of that their Resolution, <hi>Why will ye dye?</hi> Which as it is adrest by God directly to the House of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:109439:40"/>
so it would fit a Nation perverse, as that; which Mutinies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> against Miracles and Mercies, is false to God, Religion, and their own Interests; led by a Spirit of <hi>giddyness</hi> and <hi>srenzy,</hi> unsteddy in all things but resolutions of Ruine, that would teare open their old Wounds, to let out Life, and they will dye. And though the Lord be pleased to work new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of mercy for us, and to say unto us in despite of all our Enemies both Forreign and Domestick, <hi>Live:</hi> The use we make of all is onely to debauch the Miracles, and make Gods Mercies help to fill the measure of our Judgment; live as if we would try all the wayes to Ruine; and since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> God will <hi>thus deliver</hi> us from dangers, we would call for them some other way. But to prescribe to these is above the attempt of my endeavours: May the blessed Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Holynesse and Peace, and Order, breath on their Counsels whom this is committed to. I shall bend my Discourse to the Conviction of Sinners in particular, and treat upon the words as if they had been spoke to us under the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>The first thing which my Text and God supposeth, is the Sinners Fate and Choyce: He <hi>will dye.</hi> Even the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>Death,</hi> for <hi>it is appointed for all men once to dye, and then cometh the Judgment</hi> which shall sentence him to another death that is immortal, in which he and his misery must live for ever; that is, he must dye Everlastingly: Such is first his <hi>fate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> are of so <hi>near,</hi> so complicated a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as that though they were Twins, the birth and Issue of one Womb and moment, yet they are also one anothers Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, and beget each other, while <note n="a" place="margin">James 1. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Sin bringeth forth Death,</hi> as S. <hi>James</hi> saith, and is the Parent of Perdition, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> yet the <note n="b" place="margin">2 Thess. 11. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Man of Sin</hi> is the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, and Iniquity is but destruction's birth, onely it self deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And that this Death and Perdition is Eternal in the most sad sense of the word there are a thousand Texts that say. This is the Message of God in the mouth and Blood of his Son, who useth all the artifice of Words affirmative, and negative, to tell us so, as if on purpose to preclude all doubt and <hi>subtersuge,</hi> calls it <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 25. 41. 46.</note> 
                     <hi>Eternal fire,</hi> and <note n="d" place="margin">Mark. 9. 43, 44.</note> 
                     <hi>Eternal punishment,</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Rev. 14. 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>where their worm dieth not, their fire is not quenched, Torment for ever and ever,</hi> and the like. Your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Faith and certainty of which is as strong as your Christianity, and therefore by attempting any farther proof of this, to imply there is reason and necessity for doing so, were to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my Hearers infidels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:109439:40"/>
But then this being granted that such is the sinners <hi>fate</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> lay down positively that it is his <hi>Choyce,</hi> and that he doth resolve for Death, is to suppose them worse than Infidels, more than irrational and brutish; Beasts cannot so desire against the possibilities of appetite, break all the forces and instincts of Nature, as to <hi>will destruction,</hi> and <hi>choose misery.</hi> Yet that the sinner does so is the ground of Gods Expostulation here, <hi>Why will you dye? David</hi> inquires as if it were a prodigy to find, <note n="b" place="margin">Psa. 34. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>What man is he that lusteth to Live?</hi> And sure the <hi>vicious</hi> man does not, for <hi>Wisdome</hi> that is <hi>Virtue,</hi> sayes, <hi>He that sinneth against me woundeth his own Soul, and all they that hate me love</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>death, Prov.</hi> 8. 36. And 'tis most evident, that they who eagerly, and out of vehement affection pursue and seize those things to which they know destruction is annext inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably, they love and choose destruction, though not for it self, yet for the sake of that to which it clings. He that is certain such a Potion, howsoever sweetned and made palat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is compounded with the juice of deadly Nightshade, if notwithstanding he will have the Poysonous draught, it is apparent he resolves to dye.</p>
                  <p>And that I may evince this is a setled obstinate incorrigible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> resolution in him, and by what wayes and steps it comes to be so, I will lay before you the violent courses he does take to break through difficulties, and obstructions that would trash and hinder him: And when the avenues to Death are strongly guarded, how he storms and forces them, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all resistance possible that he may seize on Sin and Death.</p>
                  <p>And First, When such persons have entred the Profession of Christianity in Baptisme, and by early engagements tyed themselves to the observation of its duties, if principles of probity in Nature, fomented by others, instil'd with Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> have made impressions of duty on the mind, and wrought a reverence and awe of God and of Religion, which is a fence about them, and does keep off Vice, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it seem strange, uncouth and difficult, while these fears and aversations are rooted in them; why then the first thing that they do, as soon as Youth and the Temptations do stir within them, is to poyson these their own Principles by evil Conversation, and from that and Example take infusions, which shall impregnate them with humours of being in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fashion of the World: Thus they labour to strangle the <hi>then</hi> troublesome modesties of Nature and of Virtuous breeding; thus they look out ill Company to infect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And surely they that seek the Plague and run into infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109439:41"/>
we have cause to fear they have a <hi>Resolution to dye.</hi> But, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If notwithstanding this in the first practises of Vice, their former Principles stir, and ferment within, and fret the Conscience, set that on working; why then if the sin sting gently, do but prick the heart, and make an out-let for a little gush of Sorrow, then in spight of <hi>Scripture,</hi> they do teach themselves to think that grief Repentance, and by the help of that conceit this sorrow cools, and doth allay the swelling of the mind, washes away the guilt and thought of the commission, <hi>they have been sad,</hi> and they believe, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented;</hi> as if those stings opened <hi>the fountain for transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and those little wounds did flow with Balsom for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And by this means that sting of the old Serpent fin, while it pretends to <hi>cure</hi> by hurting thus, proves indeed the <hi>Tempter</hi> to <hi>go on.</hi> For if this be all, why should a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all the Contents and satisfactions of his Inclinations, and mortifie and break his nature to avoid a thing which is so easily repented for? No, if it be no worse they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Serpent in their bosome, dare meet his sting, and run upon these wounds, and they do so till the frequent pungencies, and cicatrices have made the Conscience callous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and insensible, the heart hardned.</p>
                  <p>But if their first essays of sin were made unfortunate by <hi>Notoreitie,</hi> or some unhappy circumstance, and so the wound were deep, and the Conscience troublesome and restlesse, because this is very uneasie, these inward groans make dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in their cheerful aires, make their life harsh, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore find it necessary to confront the shame with Courage of iniquity, go boldly on that so they may outlook it, sear their own Conscience that its wounds may not bleed. And as those Fiends of Men who Sacrific'd their Children in the fire to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that they might not hear their Infants shreek, nor their own Bowels croke, had noyses made with Timbrels to out-voice them: So these to drown the cryes and howlings of their wounded mind, put themselves in perpetual hurry of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement and vice, make <hi>Tophet</hi> about themselves, and with the noyse of Ryots overcome all other, because they will not hearken to those groans that call for the Physician of Souls, and then sure these <hi>resolve to dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay if this will not keep them quiet, you may see them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> sometimes ruffle with their own Consciences, defie present Convictions in the very instant of Commission, men so set on Death, that they <hi>Condemn themselves in that which they allow.</hi> And though a man would think there should be little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109439:41"/>
in those pleasures which Condemnation thrusts it self <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> into, and which have an alloy of so sad apprehensions; yet such are it seems the satisfactions of sin: For while it stabs and gashes, He brave <hi>Hero</hi> of Iniquity, can charge the wounds and take the Vice.</p>
                  <p>Yea Thirdly, though the Lord himself appear, and take part in the Quarrel, joyn with our Principles and Conscience against the fin, and with importunate calls alarm us, give us no rest, ordain a Function of men by whom he does beseech us, dresses their Messages with Promises of that which God is blessed in, and arms them too with Terrors such as Devils <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> tremble at, and joyns his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> too, that <hi>Power of the Highest,</hi> sends him in Tongues of Fire, that he also may Preach this to our very Hearts, and fright us with more flame: And yet the sinner breaks these strengths, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishes the Arts and strivings of Divine Compassion. If these Embassadors speak Charms, it is but what God tells our Prophet in this Chapter <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>And lo thou art unto them as a very lovely Song of one that hath a pleasant voyce, and can play well on an Instrument.</hi> And it does dye like that, as it there follows, <hi>They hear thy words but they do them</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>not.</hi> And if they flash in Hell against their vices, in torrents of threatning Scripture, they concern themselves no more than they would in the story of a new Eruption of Mount <hi>AEtna</hi> or <hi>Vesuvius.</hi> Yea they do <hi>quench the Spirit</hi> and <hi>his fires,</hi> do not <hi>like the deaf Adder, stop their ears</hi> against his whisperings, and the charms of Heaven (that were a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and less valiant guilt) but are Religious in hearing them, curious that they may be spoke with all advantages to make it harder not to yield and <hi>live,</hi> that so they may expresse more resolution to perish, and with more courage and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> may sin and dye.</p>
                  <p>Nay more, when God hath found an Art to draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a <hi>League and Combination against their vices,</hi> bound them in <hi>Sacraments</hi> to <hi>Virtue;</hi> made them enter a <hi>Covenant of Piety,</hi> and <hi>seal</hi> it in the <hi>Blood of God,</hi> and by that foederall Rite with hands lift up, and seizing on Christ's Body, and with holy Vows oblige themselves to the <hi>performances,</hi> or to the <hi>Threats</hi> of Gospel, which they see executed in that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before their eyes, see there <hi>death is the wages of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> they shew themselves its damned consequences, while they behold it <hi>tear Christ's Body, spill his Blood,</hi> and <hi>Crucifie</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>the Son of God;</hi> yet neither will this frightful spectacle, nor their own <hi>ties</hi> hold them from sin and ruine, they break these bonds asunder to get at them.</p>

The <note n="a" place="margin">Wisd. 1. 16.</note> Wiseman sayes that <hi>wicked men seek death</hi> and <hi>make</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>a Covenant with it,</hi> and so it seems: But sure they are strange wilful men, that seek it at <hi>Gods Table</hi> in the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> that will wade through an <hi>Ocean of mercy</hi> to get at Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and find it in the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> will drink <hi>Damnation</hi> in the <hi>Cup of Blessing;</hi> men that <hi>poyson Salvation</hi> to themselves: They that contract thus for Destruction, and tye it to them at the Altar, with such sacred Rites and Articles, are sure <hi>resolv'd and love to dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God had provided other Guards to secure men from sin and Death, the <hi>Censures of the Church;</hi> of which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>this Time</hi> was the great Season, and the discipline of absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence we now use is a piteous relique, all that the world will bear it seems: But as the Lord appointed them they were so close a sence, that our Saviour calls them <note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 16. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> as if they lockt us in the Path of Piety and Life; and we must pick or break all that the <hi>Key of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> can make fast, burst <hi>Locks</hi> as well as <hi>Vows</hi> before we can get out, have liberty to sin. God having bounded in the Christians race as that among the Grecians was, which had a River on one side, and Swords points all along the other, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so that Destruction dwelt about it on the borders: And God hath mounded ours with the River of Hell the Lake of Fire, and with these spiritual Swords (as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome</hi> call the Censures.) But yet a Mound too weak alas! to stand the Resolution and assaults of Vices now adayes; which do not onely make great breaches in the Fence, but have quite thrown it down, and <hi>slighted</hi> it; and the Church dares not set it up again, should she attempt it they would <hi>scoff</hi> it down. Men will endure no bar in the way to Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they will have <hi>liberty of Ruine;</hi> will not be guarded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> from it; so far from brooking <hi>Censures</hi> they will suffer no <hi>Reproof,</hi> nor <hi>Admonition,</hi> not suffer one word betwixt them and death eternal.</p>
                  <p>But Fiftly, Though we will not let Almighty God restrain us with his <hi>Censures,</hi> yet he will do it with his <hi>Rod,</hi> and set the sharp stakes of <hi>Affliction</hi> in our walk, to keep us in; thus he makes sins sometimes inflict themselves, and then we straight resolve to break off from them; and while we suffer shame, and feel destruction in the vice we shrink and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling: And now the sinner <hi>would not dye,</hi> especially if his Precipitance have thrown him to the consines of the grave; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and while he took his full careers of Vice, the fury of his course did drive him to the ports of Ruine, and Death seemed to make close and most astonishing approaches, when stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109439:43"/>
on the brink of the Abysse, he takes a prospect of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dismal state that must receive him and his Vices, then he trembles and flyes, his apprehensions swoon, his Soul hath dying qualins, caused as much by the Nausea of sin as by the fear of Hell; he is in agonies of passion and of prayer both against his former courses, he never will come near them more; and now sure God hath catch't him, and his will is wholly bent another way, now he will live the <hi>new life</hi> if God will grant him any: But alas! have we never seen when God hath done this for him, stretch't out his Arm of Power, hal'd him from the brow of the Pit, and set <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him further off, how he does turn and drive on furiously in the very same path that leads to the same Ruine, and he recovers into death eternal?</p>
                  <p>And now this Will is grown too strong for the Almighty's powerful methods, and frustrates the whole Counsell of God for his Salvation, neglects his Calls and Importunacies whereby he warns him to consult his safety, to make use of Grace in <hi>time,</hi> not to harden his heart against his own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and perish in despight of mercy. And when he can reject Gods Graces and his Judgments thus, defie his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and his own Experience too, there is but one thing left wherein this Resolution can shew its courage, and that is,</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>His own present Interests;</hi> All which the sinner can break through and despise, to get at Death. It is so usual to see any of the gross wasting Vices when it is once espoused, murder the Reputation, and all those great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns that do depend upon a mans Esteem, eat out his Wealth and Understanding, make him pursue pernicious wayes and Counsells, besot him, and enslave him, fill his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> life with disquiet, shame and needinesse, and the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of that, Contempt, and all that's Miserable and unpittied in this Life; and yet the sin with all these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages is lovely, not to be divorc't nor torn off from him, that I were vain should I attempt to prove a thing so obvious. I shall give but one instance of the power of the Will, the violence and fury of its inclimations to ruine.</p>
                  <p>The man who for anothers inadvertency, possibly such as their own rules of Honour will not judge affront, yea sometimes without any shadow of a provocation, meerly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> because he will be rude, does that upon which they must call <hi>one another to account,</hi> and to their <hi>last account</hi> indeed at Gods dread Judgment feat; whither when he hath

Neither doth this man stand alone, the <hi>desperate Rebel</hi> would come into the <hi>Induction,</hi> that without any hopes sets all on fire, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to consume all here, and to begin his Flames hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>But I have said enough to prove the <hi>Resoluteness of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Will,</hi> which is so great indeed that it is this especially which does enhance the guilt of sin into the merit of an endlesse punishment, this persevering obstinacy does deserve Hell and make it just.</p>
                  <p>For whatsoever inequality there is betwixt the short liv'd pleasures of a sin, which dye while they are tasted, and put out themselves, and those eternal never dying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Vengeance, (As sure there is also betwixt <hi>the life of Man,</hi> and several of those <hi>petty felonies</hi> that <hi>forfeit</hi> it) yet the Law <hi>does</hi> not <hi>murder</hi> when it <hi>Executes.</hi> (I might have instanc't in the <note n="a" place="margin">Num. 15. 32. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>gathering sticks upon the Sabbath day in Israel.)</hi> For since the preservation of publique safety and propriety is valuable with the lives of many men, and to secure that and affright the Violation, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to affix such punishments to such offences; they that know the penalty, and wilfully, meerly to feed their other vices, run upon it, justly suffer it: So that Man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> might not rob himself of that immortal Glory which God had ordain'd him when he did see it absolutely necessary, thus to hedge Vice with Eternal Death: And as he set Angels and Flaming Swords to keep him out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> so to set Fiends and Flames to guard Hell from him, and to entail those Torments on Man's sin, which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil, and sealed the Deed in the Blood of his Son. If notwithstanding men renounce the blessedness, and against all their Interests and Obligations, in spight of all the arts and Powers of Heaven, they will have the Torments; and, (what they never would attempt for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> invade those flames to get to Hell, 'tis very just that God should let them have it; should not break his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, dispence with Holy Laws so confirm'd, meerly to

gratifie those that are obstinate for ruine, and against his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whole Gospel quench Hell fires because men are resolv'd to run into them. <hi>This Will</hi> does, as it were, <hi>even the Scales</hi> betwixt the <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>Damnation,</hi> equal the <hi>pleasure</hi> to the <hi>punishment,</hi> and fill the distance from a <hi>moment</hi> to <hi>Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though this <hi>Will</hi> do clear Gods, Justice, yet it does not satisfie his Reason, he seems astonisht at the choyce; God himself cannot find a Ground for such a Resolution; and therefore does enquire, <hi>Why will ye dye?</hi> Which is God's question, and my second part.</p>
                  <p>Is it the present pleasure sin does tempt your sensuality <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> withall, whose agitations are so quick and strong that they surprize or break the forces of your Reason, and your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, put the Mind in disorder, and then seize it with such violence as to lead it captive to the Law of Sin and Death? 'Tis true indeed thus both of them had their original, so they prevail'd in Paradise, for <hi>when the Woman saw the Tree was good for food, and pleasant to the eye, and a Tree to be desired to make one wise, she took thereof and she did eat,</hi> although she knew that God had said, <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dye, Gen.</hi> 3. But there was generous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> here, such as tempted the Soul, assaulted it with the appearances of Wisdome, and divine Knowledge: <hi>Te shall be as Gods. Gen.</hi> 3. 5. And sure 'tis no great wonder if the proper pleasures of the mind ingage it, therefore when God would give a Precept liable to a Temptation of being broke, he laid it in the sphere of those things that delight the <hi>Soul,</hi> of <hi>Knowledge;</hi> but far be it that those of sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should ever have prevail'd; Man may yield to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of being <hi>like God,</hi> but for pleasure to <hi>make himself a Beast</hi> is contradiction to Nature. For pleasure is but satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our appetites, and the more natural the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is, the higher and more powerful that nature, and the desire eagerer, so much the more delightful is the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now it is certain that the reasonable faculty, the Soul or Spirit is the highest and most proper nature of a man: In all the rest he's not a step remov'd from Beasts, unlesse it be in shape, but in the accurateness of his senses is below them far; and therefore must be so in sensual satisfactions; but in his Soul he borders upon Angels, and does come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then that Soul being mans peculiar nature, the highest part of him, It follows its delights, Spiritual reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Joyes must needs be the most natural and most proper for it, most conform'd to it, and therefore the most
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109439:45"/>
taking with it. This may be cleared most irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Beast hath several ingredients of Nature in his making, he is an heavy body, and a Vegetable, and he hath also sense which is his highest nature. Now though the only inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heavy bodies be to fall down to the Earth, and this be also natural to a Beast, we do not find that 'tis his greatest pleasure, sure he had rather feed than tumble in the Pasture; his chief delight lyes in the satisfaction of his chiefest facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein he does excell, his <hi>Senses;</hi> and as Beasts differ and transcend in these, so do their pleasures also differ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and exceed. A man also, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayes, does live a threefold Life: At first he is but a <hi>Plant-man,</hi> a growing span of living Creature, and he's born only into Animality, a Life of Sense, and at last <hi>Educated</hi> into <hi>reasonable.</hi> Now the delights of his first Stages, whilst onely Vegetation and Sense live, although proportioned to those states, yet have no savour to the mind; he grows through Nuts and Rattles to the use of Reason, and the pleasures of it also; these must keep even with the growing faculties and become higher, rational, and manly: Which if they do not, but the man still dwell upon the satisfactions of sense, he does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Stages, contradict the progresses of Nature; he hath the age and strength of Reason but to play the Child with, to exert it in those things that are but a Man's Rattles; hath the sagacity of an Intelligence meerly to find out how to be a brute with greater luxury and rellish.</p>
                  <p>Come therefore, shew me now the sins which the delights of Reason do betray you to, and I'le admit the plea: But if you live your own <hi>reverse</hi> that you may dye; renounce all your own pleasures first, that so you may renounce the joyes of God and Heaven; and fall from Nature that you may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> fall into Hell, this case hath no pretence; those pleasures cannot <hi>toll man</hi> on to death, which till the man be dead, and the brute onely live within him cannot be his pleasures; and it is plain they are not pleasures to a Sober man that lives the life of <hi>Reason,</hi> not to say of <hi>Grace:</hi> Nor are they such to any man till he have train'd and exercis'd himself into an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of enduring them, and by a discipline of Torment made himself experienc't for Vice and for Damnation. Nor is there ever any pleasure in some vices, what is there in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> dismal Wishes of mans imprecating passion? there cannot be musick in those harsh horrours, and yet these sinners <hi>will destruction</hi> so as that they <hi>call to God</hi> to pour it on them, and tear it down from Heaven, so that Pain and Disease seem to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109439:45"/>
sauce those delights, and Death to be the tempter to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 'tis evident mens reasons and their Practises must be first debauch't, that they may count them Pleasures, and therefore pleasure cannot be the first mover in the sinners race to Death.</p>
                  <p>But I will grant, that the Spirit and Flesh of Man by their so strait alliance and perpetual converse, may grow to have the same likes and dislikes, have but one appetite, and this alas! be that of flesh, to whose only satisfactions the man useth himself, by long Custome of which, the Soul doth so imbibe the Inclinations of the Body, that nothing of another kind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> can possibly be relisht: In this case sensuality hath pleasures, yet such as cannot answer Gods inquiry; for do but consult mans other Choyces and you find a present satisfaction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work his Resolutions to forgo great after-hopes, or run upon a foreseen ruine. Who will exchange his right to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of a Crown, which from his Father he shall certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit and succeed to if he do out live him, for a present Scene of Royalty, and choose a painted Coronet, the pomps and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorations of a Stage, and the applauses of a Groud before the reall Glories of his Kingdom, the love and the obedience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of his Subjects? And yet my Soul, the disproportion of the sinners terms is infinitely greater; and there is no hazzard, which to make his choyce of present things more flattering, the others hopes are liable to: For that Heir of the Crown may dye before the Crown fall to him; but it is impossible that we should misse of ours except we put our selves by, by such choyces; except we change it thus. And on the other side we know, men will adventure the Sentence of the Law by Robberies and murders to provide for lusts while they hope to be undiscovered: But sure a Prison made delightful by all arts of pleasure, and all plenties of it, will not hire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a man to own those actions which shall forfeit him to certain shameful Execution the next Sessions, and yet this is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners state exactly, he is ti'd and bound in the chain of his sins, they are it may be chains of Gold and softned with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, but they reserve him to the Judgment of the great Assise: And yet he chooses these and puts them on as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of delight and honour.</p>
                  <p>Once more; Do not men choose a present Agonie to keep off an after evill, they teare their bowels with a Vomit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a Surfeit, they cup and scarifie, and with all artifice of pain upon themselves kill a Disease, yea they are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to prolong torment so they may but prolong life; and though the preservation of it prove onely continued pangs,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109439:46"/>
and all they can effect is onely this, that they are longer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dying, yet they are glad to be so in all cases, except where the prescription is <hi>virtue,</hi> and the <hi>death</hi> prescribed against <hi>Eternall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now why do you choose thus onely in Sin and Hell? 'Tis clear the very pleasure you change Heaven for, cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you from this Life, and then you that will suffer any thing rather than you will dye, <hi>Why</hi> against all resistance <hi>will you dye for ever?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it Secondly, because you know not what it is to dye the second Death? at least your notions of it are so slight and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> easie, that they cannot fright you from a pleasure or cope with a temptation to it; and so though present satisfactions are not able to engage you upon present ruin they can upon the after-death.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Sinner would have reason if it meant no more than hath been taught of late by one that hath gained many Proselytes among the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> of Religion; <hi>After the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection the Reprobates shall be,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the state that Adam and his Posterity were in after his Sin</hi> (i. e.) <hi>the state we are now in, Live as we do, Marry and give in Marriage,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>and cease to be when they have got some heirs to succeed them in Tophet.</hi> Poor unhappy Souls these! that never had any sin to merit being there, nor any Sentence to condemn them thither but this mans: Who must put them there succssive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one after other, to find employment for Everlasting-fire. A Doctrine such as had an Angel Preacht from Heaven by S. <hi>Paul's</hi> award he must have been <hi>Anathema;</hi> when the Devil made Religions, and Theology came from the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pit, he never found out such an Engine to conveigh men into it as this pleasant notion of the punishment of sin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as if <hi>Leviathan were made to take his pastime in that Lake also,</hi> by such interpretations, which surely were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to make out the Assertion of that <note n="a" place="margin">Tho. de Alb.</note> 
                     <hi>Romish</hi> Priest, who sayes, <hi>that those in Hell love to be there;</hi> nay more, that <hi>'twas impossible for God to do a kinder thing for them than to put them there.</hi> Doctrines to be abhorr'd as Hell it self; and yet upon these grounds he builds their Church by demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so strong as that <hi>the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against it;</hi> and in truth they have no reason to assault it on these terms. But to passe by such dolages and frenzies, you will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be able sure to check all those presumptions which grow from <hi>sleight impressions</hi> of the second Death, if you but take that prospect of it which the close of this time gives; look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through this season, which is designed for you to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

                  <p>If you behold him coming to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with <hi>Hosannas</hi> and <hi>Palmes</hi> about him, as if Death were his <hi>Triumph,</hi> his Passion so desirable, that he rode to meet it, which he never did at any other time; and then complaining he was <note place="margin">Luc. 12. 50.</note>

                     <hi>his Face to pray against it.</hi> See how he sweats and begs, his very Prayer is a Passion, the zeal of it is agony! and canst thou choose that he so dreads and deprecates? and when he durst not meet the apprehensions, wilt thou stand the storm? see what a <hi>sting death</hi> hath, when it makes outlets for such clots and globes of blood, and stings the Soul so too, that it pours out it self in Sweat. And then he sinks again under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation of it, and prayes that <hi>that Cup may passe from him.</hi> Blessed Saviour! when thou hadst just now made thy Death thy Legacy, thy Sacrament, dost thou intreat to scape this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> death? if <hi>this Cup passe from thee,</hi> what will the <hi>Cup of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> profit us? thou hadst but now bequeathed a Cup to us which was <hi>the New Testament in thy Blood,</hi> and now wilt thou not shed that Blood? But dost thou refuse thy Cup? Oh 'twas <hi>a Cup of deadly Wine,</hi> red with Gods Indignation, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd with Sin! And can the sinner thirst for the Abysse of this, the Lake that hath no bottom? and when <hi>he goes again, and prayes the same words the third time,</hi> be yet not only so supine as not ask to scape it, seldom and very sleight in any prayer or wish against it, but also so resolv'd to have it, as to gape that he may swill it down to everlastingness? Follow him from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that Garden and you see him even dying under his Cross, he cannot bear that when it is laden with sin, who yet <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note>

And can the sinner hope to stand this shock? will the courage of his Iniquity make his heart harder than those Rocks, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible than the Grave, and better able to endure than he that was a God? and will you dye into this state eternally? which it was necessary for him to have the assistance of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity in his person, that he might be able to endure one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> day, and which yet notwithstanding made one day intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>The sum is this, a person so desiring death and yet so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and sinking under the essayes of it, and this person the Son of God, and that dread meerly because there was sin in the Death, (for if this were not in the cause, no Martyr but had born death with more courage but that Son of God) all this as it does leave no Reason for the sinners choyce of death Eternal, so neither doth it leave a possibility of bearing it: And if so, give me leave in God's Name to Expostulate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the last imployment of these words, <hi>Why will ye dye?</hi>

                  <p>After this killing prospect, while the damp of it is on you, let my Bowells debate with you, which yearn more over you than they did over my Beloved Son in whom I was well pleased; when I have sent my onely Son, God, one with my own Self, to be made Man, that he might suffer what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be suffer'd to preserve you from eternal sufferings; when I have laid on <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 8. 30.</note>

Why will you seize that Indignation which you are redeemed from, and force those sufferings on your selves, which have been laid already and inflicted on another? 'Tis a small thing that you refuse me, the return of my Expence, that which I gave my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Son for; but do you renounce Happinesse because my Love and Blood is in it? and will you dye because you may, and I desire you should live? when my Son went from the essential

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Text is the result of the Pious man's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Audit, the foot of the account in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up his whole that he hath either in Possession or Desire; and instead of nice Division of the Words I shall observe in them these Subjects of Discourse.</p>
                  <p>First, the different tenure, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Estates in the two different Countreys we relate to, this here is a Land only of <hi>desires,</hi> the other is a place of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, Have in Heaven, Desire on Earth.</hi> Yea <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though our estate here in this Earth be present, and that other seem removed far off, yet the possessions of that are present and in hand, but the most native satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth are still at distance, onely the object of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109439:49"/>
our aims and expectations <hi>I have, now I have in Heaven, on</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>the Earth I but desire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Here is the matter of both these desires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments to the Pious man; <hi>No Person</hi> or <hi>no thing</hi> (for so it bears also) <hi>but God: There is nothing upon Earth that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire besides thee.</hi> And as to <hi>Heaven</hi> the negation is exprest emphatically by a Question, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet least this Question should look like an Expostulation, and he that asks it seem unsatisfied with his portion, we will therefore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, see the Importance of it to the Christian, since our <hi>Saviour</hi> is gone up into Heaven, see whom the Christian hath there: And if the Psalmist could find none but <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> (if he were the Author) could not see the <hi>Son of David</hi> there, yet since <hi>Christ is set at the Right hand of God,</hi> the Christians present Interest in Heaven is such, that looking with contempt on all that worldly men applaud themselves in the enjoyment of, rejecting all but <hi>thee O Christ,</hi> he justly triumphs in resolving of this question to himself, and being satisfied in <hi>having thee,</hi> he does renounce even the <hi>desiring any thing but thee.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of these in their order beginning here on Earth, where our tenure even of earthly things is but <hi>desire,</hi> this World does give no satisfactions in hand, but still they are onely the objects of our Expectations and wishes.</p>
                  <p>When God hath given Man an erect Countenance, Eyes that do naturally look towards him, and the very frame of him is such, that Heaven is his constant object; it were no wonder if his looks and thoughts were alwayes there, since both the duty and necessity of that does seem imprest upon him in his making, and to <hi>desire things above,</hi> is, as it were, <hi>the</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>Law in his members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when he swims in delicacies here upon the Earth, is immerst in the plenties of all kinds, that these should give him nothing but <hi>desires of themselves,</hi> that the delights should not be present to him, but he should still pursue and need that which he is encompast with, that while with open mouth and in a most intemperate current he swills down the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, yet his open mouth should gape onely with thirst, and he be sensible of nothing but the want of these, is strange <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> even to astonishment: Yet such it seems the nature of them is. When S. <hi>John</hi> would enumerate all that is in the World the particular that he gives in is thus, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>All that is in the world, the lust of the Flesh, the lust of the Eyes, and the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109439:49"/>
Pride of Life.</hi> He does not say, the objects of these Lusts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that are to serve and satisfie them, for there's no such thing as satisfaction, but onely lust; and if we make enquiry into the particulars we shall find it.</p>
                  <p>To begin with that of the Eyes, <hi>Covetousnesse,</hi> or <hi>the love of Money:</hi> 'Tis evident that where an object is not useful to the faculty, it cannot satisfie, for satisfaction is fulfilling of our needs and uses, but money is not useful to the sight, nor indeed does it prove useful to, or serve any of the Covetous mans occasions or faculties; rather the contrary in every kind, he does bereave himself of good because he hath it: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> He is in agonies of trouble and sollicitude, least he should need, and not have that, which when he hath acquir'd he will still need, and will not have enjoyment of. Nor is it possible it should be otherwise, for since there is no natural original or cause of this his Appetite, for 'tis not emptiness that makes him hungry, who is more ravenous the more full he is, whose most empty bowells shrink and cling together, as having learnt not to expect repast, while his baggs and desires stretch, and are enlarged by being stuff'd.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it fear of future want that makes him eager to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> provide so, for why should he be so unsatisfied in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding against want, that will want more the more he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided?</p>
                  <p>And since as there is no natural cause, so there is also no natural measure for this Appetite of his; for Natures mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is our reall uses of the object. But this man heaps up useful things that he does never mean to use: Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath neither bound nor cause in Nature, 'tis monstrous, and must needs be an unlimited lust, uncapable of satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And all this man's Wealth does purchase nothing for him but <hi>desires,</hi> and is not the <hi>content</hi> but the <hi>Lust of his</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>Eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the same reasoning will conclude the next, <hi>the Pride of life,</hi> which is the Lust of a Sense as wholly unconcern'd in all the Pomps and garnishes of Pride, as the Eye is in Wealth: 'tis a Lust of the Eare, all is but the man's passion to hear himself, his trappings, or condition commended. The Learned man that's proud, does think of no return for all his toyles and watches, all the present racks and tortures of his mind, and all the after-ones that he does <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> pull upon his body, but to be spoken well of: He fasts, mortifies, and denies himself more than the Covetous man can do, meerly to fill himself with wind; he reconciles the <hi>Babel</hi> of all Languages, and Sciences too in his own head but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109439:50"/>
for a word, onely to hear an <hi>Euge,</hi> and this with such solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that if the breath of mens Applause should fail him he would straight expire, as if his Soul <hi>breath'd</hi> onely at his <hi>Ear.</hi> If my pride lyes in gayeties, all Natures Wardrobe must be rifled, the beauties of the Universe defloured, the Art and Sweat too of all Nations employed to attire my person, or to dress my Room, rather indeed to dress the tongues and furnish out the talk of other persons, who must entertain mine ears with the discourse of my own splendors? which is all the use I can make of it; the Eastern Rocks must send me Diamonds, meerly to dart a line of light into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eyes, which may return to me in a report that I have such fine Jewels, and I have nothing else of all my sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous glories but the meer <hi>Eccho</hi> of their shine, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected and beat back to me in commendations. With so much expence anxiety and sin, I do provide onely for other mens discourses, or, it may be, envyes. Now these are none of my enjoyments, and therefore I have nothing of them but the <hi>Lust</hi> and the <hi>desire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>those of the flesh,</hi> the third remaining kind, they seem indeed to be exempted from this reasoning; the sensual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> gorges his desires, and in <hi>Solomons</hi> phrase <hi>makes his Soul enjoy good:</hi> Yet the same <hi>Solomon</hi> salves that appearance too, in saying <hi>when provisions encrease, they are encreased that eat them,</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 5. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?</hi> My broad and my cramb'd tables do not more enlarge or serve my appetite, give me no satisfaction but only that of seeing many Dishes full, and many men consuming them, as if <hi>Luxury</hi> also were <hi>a lust of the Eye.</hi> It hath been said indeed, that the Eye is the Gluttons most unsatisfied and greedy part, and it must needs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be so if its lust lye to all that other men devour, and if it crave not onely for the mans own stomack, but for throngs of clients, parasites, and attendants. And 'tis too plain the other Twin <hi>Intemperance</hi> lusts by the same rules and laws: It does not onely claim its seat in the <hi>Eye,</hi> which makes it self a Judge of Liquors for the palate, and does not choose them by the uses of their moisture, but by their body, by their <hi>air,</hi> and by the <hi>mode,</hi> and other <hi>Rules of the authentick stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Drinkers;</hi> as if men thirsted in the fashion onely: But this Eye also, as the Ryotous mans did, gapes for company, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and thirsts to see the Vice go round, it drinks in nothing with so much delight as the Wine, when a weaker Companion returns it back again in Vomit, at that foul horrid spectacle it sparkles and triumphs. Now 'twere in vain to ask <hi>Solomons</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:109439:50"/>
question, <hi>What good is there in this?</hi> or what enjoyment? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to urge that meats and drinks cannot give satisfaction to the Eye that hath no palate, and then cry out <hi>Oh Prodigy</hi> that it should Lust thus! As for the other kind of Ryots, where with arts of Epicurism men contrive to feast and entertain their private Appetites, and put a Patrimony into sauce for their own palates, men sordidly Luxurious. 'Tis evident that these are studied to provoke, men choose such VVines as they may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>gest drink, and with elaborate condiments make forc't <hi>hunger</hi> as well as <hi>dishes,</hi> so that the Ryotous <hi>design onely to Lust,</hi> and the whole mystery of Luxury is to <hi>create</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>desires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, for that one that hath ingrost the name of <hi>Lust,</hi> it gives in a full Evidence against it self. For the <hi>Adulterer,</hi> much more irrational than the most <hi>greedy Miser;</hi> is insatiate in <hi>desiring</hi> what he <hi>hath,</hi> and his Lust will not use his reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, least so it should allay and quench the Lust: And whil'st with so much feaver of desire, he courts nothing else but the <hi>change,</hi> and values that alone equall with all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of this life, all the miseries of that to come, and will <hi>go to the Devil</hi> meerly for <hi>variety,</hi> as it is plain: Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hath nothing <hi>proper</hi> to it self but the <hi>desire,</hi> is a meer loosnesse of the Fancy, which ranges in wild lusts, and which hath no enjoyment that's peculiar to it but the lusting only; so 'tis also plain that this Lust must be endless, for that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Change which gives it all its incitation must never let it rest; for then 'tis not variety. S. <hi>John</hi> said therefore most expressively, <hi>All that is in the World is Lust;</hi> men only can <hi>desire here,</hi> pursuing their <hi>desires</hi> just as they do their shadows, no eagerness or hast can bring them nearer, still they onely pursue, yea like him that would hugg and force <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a Cloud, his empty arms return upon his breast with strokes; and while they seek to catch the object wound his bosom: And thus it must be till we fix our passion there, where only there is satisfaction even on <hi>God;</hi> the object of the pious mans desire, and my next part.</p>

                     <p>Had he said, <hi>Nothing without thee,</hi> the emptiness of every thing below which the Lord and his Blessing is not in, had made this his determination just and necessary: But sure when God hath put other needs in my making, and hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> provided supplies for them, those also are as just and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry objects of desire, while they are with and under him: But yet, he that had brought all his affections into <hi>Davids</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> nothing <hi>with God;</hi> for he had weaned his very Flesh and all the craving appetites of sense from their own objects, and had fixt them upon God in all their strength and vigour. <hi>My Soul,</hi> saith he, <hi>thirsteth for thee,</hi> (elsewhere, <hi>my Soul gaspeth unto thee, even as a thirsty Land,) and my flesh also longeth after thee, Psal.</hi> 63. 1. How! My Soul thirsteth for thee? <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 36. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>with thee indeed is the Well of Life:</hi> But Thirst is an Appetite, gasping a consequent defailance and impatience of the Body; to both which the Soul is a meer stranger, as it is also to the wayes by which the Body does desire; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Soul is drawn by moral engagements, by perswasions and motives, there is place for deliberation and Choyce in her Desires, she can demur in her pursuits, divert her Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and quench a Desire with a Consideration; but the Flesh pursues in a more impulsive manner, is drawn and spurr'd on by such impetuous propensions as are founded in matter: You can no more perswade a thirsty Palate not to thirst, than you can woo a falling Stone to stay its hast, or invite it to turn aside from its direction to the Center. Yea but the Soul also exerts it self in all these appetites of flesh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and matter, and with all their violence when it looks on God, when we have once had a taste, or when indeed we but discern our needs of him, whether our Temporal, or Spiritual, those of the Soul or Flesh, all the desires of both then fly at him, and with a tendency most close and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable, then nothing besides him. For all the appetites of Body croud into the Soul that they may catch at God, that <hi>Thirsts</hi> and <hi>Gaspes.</hi> And the Soul does put on the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent impetuous agitations of the Bodys Appetites; <hi>My Soul thirsteth for thee,</hi> and <hi>my Flesh also longeth after thee.</hi> What <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                        <hi>Longing</hi> is, whether an Appetite or Passion of the Flesh or Mind, whose signatures are more expresse indeed upon the Flesh than those of any other, yet whose impulses are so quick and so surprizing, as they were Spirit; I shall not now enquire: but sure if the Flesh long it should be for some carnal object, for that is proportion'd to it; Flesh and the Creature use to close indeed, and they imbibe each other as if they knew to fill and satisfie each other; yea some there are that have brought down their Souls to the propensions of Flesh, have given to their very Spirits an infusion of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, for <hi>they mind onely fleshly things.</hi> But by the rates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of <hi>David's</hi> practise it should seem the pious man does the just contrary; sublimes his <hi>Flesh</hi> into a <hi>Soul,</hi> drains all the carnal Appetites out of it, weans it from all its own desires,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109439:51"/>

                     <p>But notwithstanding this <hi>exalted temper,</hi> though we should arrive at this <hi>Seraphick constitution of desires,</hi> and though God hath now made himself to us the proper object of these appetites, for since God struck the Rock for us <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 4.</note>

                     <p>But yet while this Soul so journs in this earthly tabernacle, the man will still want other supplyes, and may be not desire them; or can he choose indeed?

                     <p>This is the Touchstone of a Pious mans desires; 'tis not unusual for inclinations to things below, more to possesse our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thoughts, employ our faculties than any other, and we are far more sensible of their impressions, more busie in the pursuit, and more tender in our cares of them: But if upon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109439:52"/>
contest betwixt God and our Inclinations, upon debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a Pleasure and Command, we can decree for God and for Obedience, pass Sentence with the Precept, we are safe, here the desire is not inordinate. 'Tis a known instance, and you may have seen, a tender Mother spending almost her whole time in caressing her little Infant, you would think she had Eyes for no uses but to view it, and that she had her Arms and Breasts but to embrace and suckle it, to whom these are so wholly given up as if they had no part for any other, as the Husband, had no share in her entertains and caresses of whom are far more sleight and not so pressing: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> But should it come to this pinch once, that she must straight resolve to part with one of these, however close her Arms would grasp her Child to rescue him (to force whom thence were like the tearing of her bowells from her) yet would she give those bowells to redeem her bosom guest, &amp; the husband would be the Choyce; so that although the other inclinations were more expressive, these are the stronger and the better set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. So it may happen, we may be more sensibly affected to some dear things here below, our thoughts, and Eyes, and our embraces cling and fasten more to these; but if it come to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this that we must leave one, break with the Duty or the Passion; if we resolve however not to part with God, but lay hold there and let the other go, then our affections are not only regular when we <hi>desire nothing in comparison with him,</hi> but our <hi>desires</hi> are <hi>enjoyments, seize and take possession</hi> of him, and <hi>we have him:</hi> So my Text implies here, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> importing that <hi>we have him:</hi> Which brings me to the other parts that yet remain to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courst of.</p>
                     <p>Three things are here to be considered: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Heaven is the place of Possessions</hi> in opposition to this Land of <hi>Desires.</hi> 2. That <hi>God is the possession there.</hi> 3. That <hi>the Pious man hath this possession in present.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first of these is so much common place, I shall not stay upon it; those onely qualities that make this World to be a Land of Desires, have no place there, to wit, the <hi>instability</hi> and <hi>emptinesse</hi> of all things in it, he that lays hold on them does but grasp <hi>Mercury,</hi> which the more he clasps the more he forces it to slip away, and he retains onely the soyle and the defilement of it, like Lightning which but passes by, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> stayes not to cherish, onely dazels, and, it may be, scorches: So the shine of Earthly glorys startles the mind, amuses us, inflames desires of them, and goes out. But then above the tenure is Eternity, and that assures immutability; yea, if
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109439:53"/>
it be <hi>nunc stans,</hi> an indivisible Infinity of permanent dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whose every poynt does coexist to every poynt, <hi>a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire possession, all at once, of an interminable life that never can be all possest;</hi> then nothing can passe by us, or cease from us, but we shall alwayes every moment have, what we shall have in every any moment: Our enjoyment also being like him that we enjoy, <hi>all in the whole and all in every part;</hi> being not onely endlesse in the mass, but every moment of it is immortal: And then there can be nothing but enjoyment; no place for desire there, where there is nothing absent, where all past and all futurity is alwayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> present; and where also the Infinite and all sufficient God is the Possession; which is my next Proposition, and that God himself affirms.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now here my last Consideration will come in.</p>
                     <p>If while my Soul lyes grovling under fearful Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of its Forfeiture, casting about for help and finding none upon the Earth, if it look upwards and enquire <hi>Whom have I in Heauen?</hi> have I none there but my offended Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary God? it may resolve it self with comfort he hath other interests there. For,</p>
                     <p>First, I have an <hi>Intercessor</hi> there, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. a Master of Requests, one that will not onely hand in my Petitions, get accesse for my Prayers and my tears to God, but will make them effectual: For saith S. <hi>Paul, Seeing we have a great</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                        <hi>High Priest that's passed into the Heavens, let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace in time of need, Heb.</hi> 4. 14. 16. For though my supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have not strength nor ardour that can mount them into Heaven, and are too impure, however washt in my repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tears, to draw nigh to the Lord, yet being put into the High Priests Censor with the Altar coals to give them holy flame, and wrapt up in his Cloud and Smoak of Incense that will cover all the failings of my Prayers, they may get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> into his Ears and his Compassions. Indeed how can they choose when Christ does joyn his Intercessions? for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests will go where the High Priests do go; he carrys them, now He himself doth <hi>sit at the right hand of God:</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109439:54"/>
that are made for me are made upon the Throne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and therefore cannot be repulst from thence, and such desires command and they create, effects.</p>
                     <p>But should my Prayers fail, and should God <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 55. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>hide himself from my Petitions,</hi> withdraw himself and <hi>hide his face</hi> from them, although they be even before his face. Yet</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I have an <hi>Advocate</hi> there too, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins;</hi> one that not onely <hi>pleads</hi> for me, but brings the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of my Forfeiture in his hands, makes the <hi>just value plead;</hi> appears <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there with his Blood, and proves a recompence.</p>
                     <p>'Tis <hi>Jesus Christ the righteous Advocate,</hi> that does <hi>propitiate</hi> and <hi>atone</hi> for, what he <hi>pleads</hi> for; <hi>purchase</hi> what he begs. 'Tis true, that poor Worm, saith he, hath provokt thee often Lord! but thou didst <note n="b" place="margin">Zech. 13. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>smite the Man that is thy fellow</hi> for it; Behold my Hands, and look into my Sides, see there thy Recompence; wilt thou refuse that Satisfaction thy self didst contrive, and thy beloved Son did make? why did a Person of the blessed Trinity descend from Heaven and Divinity to be made Sin and be a Curse; but to Redeem him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from the Curse and Sin, and to entitle him again to the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of Heaven and God? Why was I Crucified but that thou might'st be aton'd and he be pardon'd? Thus he soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites for us there, presents himself in our stead, as our Attorney. He was not a publique person onely on the Crosse, but he is so at the right hand of God; as he was there our Representative and bore our sins, so he is here our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative and bears our wants; was there our Proxey to the Wrath of God, is here our Proxey to his Mercies and Compassions. He looks upon himself as in our case, whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Cause and Persons he supplyes, and so is prompted to desire and beg for our poor sakes, and he looks upon us as on himself, and so obtains as for his own beloved sake, pleads as our selves, and then as to himself he does decree Sentence and grant: For</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I have there a <hi>Judge,</hi> and this is he, <hi>who sits at the right hand of God to Judge the quick and dead;</hi> I might have said a <hi>Saviour,</hi> for he was exalted to a <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 5. 31.</note>

                     <p>And it is strange that they who can look upon Hell, and charge Fiends in a sin, should tremble at a Lamb, and fly

                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, we have our <hi>first fruits,</hi> for so <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 23.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> does call our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and then in whatsoever sense that which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> done to the first Fruits is applicable to the Harvest (all this being hallowed in their Consecration) in that sense we our selves are raised to the right hand of God together with this our first Fruits. And now O Lord! <hi>whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> I have <hi>my self</hi> in <hi>pledge</hi> and <hi>earnest</hi> there.</p>
                     <p>And then they that rather than have these Interests, these Heavenly possessions in present, will have onely desires here on Earth, are certainly of a perverse and Reprobate choyce. Sure it would make Consideration sick to think of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison betwixt the after-expectations of a Pious man, and those things which our worldly persons call present Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> how for the little spangles of their pride, they are so taken with its rustling Pomp, they reject Glory that can never wither, fade, or sully; forfeit the being cloath'd upon with Immortality. How they lose all that everlasting Heaven means, for little things that go by in a Whirlwind; come in storm and so they passe away; refuse immortal <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs</hi> for a Song, cast away solid Joyes, and an Eternal weight of Blessednesse for froth, for the shaddow of smoak. Perchance this may be said for them, the nearness of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject does impose upon them, they choose something in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> rather than dry future hopes. But then when that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage too lyes on the other side, their Choyce hath no Temptation; when the Pious mans possessions are in hand, the others onely in desire; in view indeed they may be, he does catch at and pursue them still: But the hinder Wheel of the Chariot that presses and with larger turns and rowlings hastens after, may as soon hope to overtake the first, as that man reach a satisfaction; still it removes, and he does onely heat his appetite in posting after it, onely get more desire. Now 'tis prodigious that these great Men of Sense should be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> men of such Faith and Expectation as to trust and hope in things that have so constantly, so daily mockt their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and desires, yet be not only Infidels to all Gods blessed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109439:55"/>
preparations which they have nor reason nor Experience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> against, but also have no sense nor rellish of himself in present: <hi>Not tast nor see how gracious the Lord is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis said, that the desires of Earthly sensual things do make the greatest part of the Torments of Hell: Now though this Doctrine be false and pernicious, yet 'tis plain that Torment must attend strong passions, and most infinite desires which are radicated in the Sinner's heart, and which he carries hence and cannot there deposite, and to which yet satisfactions are impossible, against his knowledge to be mad, to have what he knows all the world cannot make it possible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for him to have, this tears his Soul. Affections, these that may be said in some sense to fulfil some of the expressions of the Torments of that place, their Envy makes the <hi>gnashing of their teeth,</hi> and their <hi>Desires</hi> are their <hi>Uultures.</hi> Thus <hi>Tantalus's</hi> ryotous hunger that does gnaw his bowells, is his <hi>Worm that never dyes;</hi> and his intemperate thirst his <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnings;</hi> and his Water that he cannot reach or tast of, is his <hi>Lake of fire</hi> without Metaphor; So that desire alone without its satisfaction, is so much of Hell, and yet this is the worldly sensual mans estate exactly here on Earth; for he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hath nothing but <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>lusts;</hi> and his condition is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at all, for how is <hi>Tantalus</hi> more wretched than a <hi>Midas,</hi> or than any covetous wretch, who in the midst of affluence and heaps, hungers as much as <hi>Midas</hi> did for <hi>meat</hi> and for <hi>Gold</hi> too, and can touch neither for his uses? so that the Worlds delights are very like the miserys of Hell, and men with so much eager and impatient pursuit do but anticipate their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and invade Damnation here.</p>
                     <p>And if the case be so, sure there is no great self-denyal in our <hi>Psalmist</hi> here, when he resolves to <hi>desire nothing upon</hi>

                        <hi>Earth in comparison of his God:</hi> 'Tis no such glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of my Appetite to make it not pursue a present Hell, and an eternal one annext to it before a Saviour: Yet the world does so.</p>
                     <p>Some there are that desire Money rather; and although when <hi>Judas</hi> did so, this desire could not bear it self, but cast all back again; and though it did disgorge, it burst him too; the Sin it self supply'd the Law, and his guilt was his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

To others the deservings of the partner of an unclean moment, are much greater than all that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> knew to merit at their hands or purchase for them. And it is no wonder they are so ungrateful to their Saviour, when they are so barbarous to themselves, as to choose not to have present Divine Possessions rather than not suffer the vengeance of their own Appetites; choose meerly to desire here, though that be to do what they do in <hi>Hell,</hi> rather than <hi>have in Heaven.</hi> O thou <hi>my Soul!</hi> if thou wilt needs desire, propose at least some satisfaction to thy Appetite, do not <hi>covet</hi> onely <hi>needs thirst</hi> for a <hi>feaver,</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> meerly to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame</hi>

In pressing which I do not mean to urge you to do that which none but God can do, <note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 10. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not in man to direct his own wayes,</hi> much lesse the <hi>Lords;</hi>

                     <hi>The very preparations of the Heart are from Him.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Therefore supposing the preventings of his Graces, I shall

subjoyn, that the Comporting with those graces, the using <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of his strengths to the rooting out of our selves all aversation to Virtue, and all love of Vice; and planting other incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, even Resolutions of good life, is the onely thing that can make way for Christ and for his benefits.</p>
                  <p>Now of those Advents, the</p>
                  <p>First was, when he came Commission'd by God to reveal his Will, to propose the Gospel to our belief, the coming of <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> which particularly is intended in the Text. <hi>The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Second was, that coming which the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, and in the astonishment of Vision askt, <note n="a" place="margin">Isay 63. 1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Who is this that comes from Edom? with dy'd garments from Bozrah, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the greatness of his Strength? Why is he red in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, and his garments like him that treadeth in the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat?</hi> And it was the prospect of him when he came to tread the <hi>Wine press of the Wrath of God,</hi> to Sacrifice himself for us upon the Crosse, his coming as a <hi>Priest.</hi> The</p>
                  <p>Third is, when he comes to visit for Iniquity, coming coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cively as a <hi>King</hi> with his <hi>Iron Rod,</hi> to execute his threats on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the rebellious; those <hi>that will not have him reign over them:</hi> This coming also was considered in my Text; for in the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel place of S. <hi>Matth.</hi> it is said, <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 3. 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, for this is he of whom it was spoken by the Prophet Esaias saying, the Voyce of one crying in the Wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For each of these in order, I shall shew you what prepares his way, beginning with the first, His coming as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> appearing in the World to reveal his Father's Will, the Gospel. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Preparative for this Appearance is discovered easily; we find both in this Chapter, and the parallel places, that <hi>John</hi> came to make way for it by the <hi>Baptism and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Repentance;</hi> and it was Prophecied of him, <hi>that he should go before him in the Spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the Fathers with the Children, and the Disobedient to the Wisdom of the Just,</hi> (to the minding of just things) <hi>so to make ready a people prepared for the Lord, Luke</hi> 1. 17. And this is a preparative so necessary, that the Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> affirm, it is meerly for the want of this that he does yet deferr his coming: And though the appointed time for it be past, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> yet because of their sinfulnesse and impenitence he does not appear; adding <note n="c" place="margin">Talm. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros. Jaanith f. 64. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>If Israel Repent but one day presently the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias cometh.</hi> And it is thus far true, that though it hindred not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109439:57"/>
his coming, yet it hindred his receiving; although it did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not make him stay, it made him be refus'd. I may lay all down in this Proposition.</p>
                  <p>Where there is not the preparation of Repentance, where there are not inclinations and desires for Virtue; if Christ come with the glad tidings of the Gospel, He is sure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, his Religion disbeliev'd.</p>
                  <p>If the Word of the Son of God might be taken in his own case, this would be soon evinc't, for when <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 1. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>He came unto his own,</hi> they were so far from <hi>preparing his way,</hi> that <hi>they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not,</hi> but did reject and would not entertain him as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> one sent from God; of all this he onely gives this account, that he found no other opposition but from vicious humours, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8, 43, 44, 45. <hi>Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot bear my Word: Ye are of your father the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and the lusts of your father ye will do; and because I tell you the truth ye believe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>ye hate the light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your deeds are evil.</hi> Neither do you love to hear that which you have no mind to practise; and you will not be perswaded to believe that is your necessary duty, which you are not willing to perform; but will rather choose to think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> I do my Works by a confederacy with <note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 12. 24.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>And is it not strange when nothing can be acceptable to the Understanding but as it hath appearance of Truth, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> when truth comes with evidence and demonstration, though it be but speculative uselesse truth, yet it does seize and force assent, that yet Christ's truths, which did not want con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, for they came to them with that infallibility which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109439:58"/>
Miracles can give, should be therefore not believ'd because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they were truths? not strange at all; for his truths were not for their turns, nor humours.</p>
                  <p>And therefore he sayes to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 32. <hi>Ye repented not that ye might believe</hi> them. As if they assented not with their Understandings but their Appetites: And we our selves have seen too much unhappy evidence of men, whom <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinisme</hi> hath made <hi>Antimonians,</hi> whom a desire of being <hi>loose from duty</hi> hath made <hi>Solifidians,</hi> of them whom <hi>sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> hath made <hi>Atheists;</hi> men that become Proselytes to: their Lusts, the converts of their base affections. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we cannot expect it should be otherwise. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that men who are averse to the dutys of Christianity, and cannot bend their minds to the observance of that which Christ commands, should not care to believe they are his Precepts or their duty is but very natural, they were unwise should they do otherwise, it being far more reasonable to deny the duty and obligation, than granting both, to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on that obligation which they do acknowledge, and to renounce that Duty which they do confesse. Is it not far more prudent to believe that there is not a God that does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our foolish actions here below, (which are not more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> worthy or more likely to enter into his considerations, than the buzzings of flyes into the notices and observations of a Statesman;) then if we do believe one does severely mark, will take a strict account of, execute a vengeance for them, yet not incline our minds to leave them? if we did suffer this belief to creep into our minds, to lye close unto our hearts, sure it would fret off our aversness to Piety and inclinations to sin; we durst not entertain them both together, these thoughts would prove very ill company; they would distract and tear the mind, our Souls would tremble and disjoynt, and we be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sure to put one of them off.</p>
                  <p>Covetous and Adulterous <hi>Felix</hi> when he began to think that <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 24. 25.</note> S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Sermon of a <hi>Judgment to come</hi> might be true, straight he began to <hi>shake,</hi> and then immediately to turn the Sermon off, <hi>bid S. Paul depart till another time.</hi> Nor can there any other reason be assigned for this; for in the Systeme of Christs Religion there is not any thing but is so suited to the very Constitution of a rational being, that the Soul would instantly imbrace and suck in, if the prepossessions of vices, which the mind will not resolve to part with and repent of, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> did not infect, taint the palate with prejudices, did not keep out the belief. For the morality which it injoyns did long before the birth of this Religion make its way into the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109439:58"/>
and the Faith of every Sect of whole Mankind, it broke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> through all the oppositions of corrupted Nature and deprav'd habits; nor could all the Devils arts (who then govern'd the World) stifle or quench the Light of Reason, which through all that darkness did discover such deformity in Vice, such strict agreement betwixt that which we call Virtue, and a rational Creature, that they accounted it, and truly, the essentiall duty of his nature; he that was wicked was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted false to his own being; as great an aberration from, and contradiction to Nature, as an <hi>Animal</hi> that were <hi>insensible,</hi> or as <hi>cold fire.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this all the most distant Factions conspir'd in despite of Principles. The <hi>Stoick,</hi> who by fettering all Events, all Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Designs in the lines of inexorable Destiny does seem to make all Virtue worthless, all endeavours towards it uselesse, yet requires it with a strict necessity as his Fate prescribes with; his reasons are as ineluctable as her Laws. Nay he does seem to break his <hi>Adamantine Chain,</hi> to make way for this <hi>Chain of Virtues,</hi> though his <hi>Jupiter</hi> were bound by that, yet for the sake of these he leaves <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that so there may be place for doing well while it is in our choyce, and we are free to do it. And on the other side, the greatest enemies to their necessity and to choyce too, the Sect that made all actions and things in the whole world to be, not effects of any Agent that intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, but meerly <hi>sports of Chance and matter;</hi> who taught that their own souls were but the concretion of some Atomes casually met together without any direction and to no end; yet the great Master of it in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> would not suffer any of this blind Contingency to have to do in Humane actions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> regulating them by strictest Rules and Laws, and in plain contradiction to his tenents (from which our Age derives the most of their impiety) although he held there was no God lookt on, nor after-life attended, none that did see, or would reward or punish any of his actions, yet requires highest Virtue, yea, and liv'd such too they say. In a word, many of them rais'd Morality to such a pitch, as if it had arriv'd at the same heights from whence our Christian Revelation did pretend to come. And there is nothing so peculiar to Christs Doctrine in the poynts of Morality, but you may find it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by the Heathen as a thing which no external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation did impose, but the Law of their making did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, which they read in themselves, and Christian Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is but a fairer and more perfect Copy of the impressions
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109439:59"/>
of Reason on our Soul, clear'd from the blurs and defects <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which they had been tainted with; but <hi>Naturales Tabulae</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Decalogue, wrote by the Finger of the Lord: So that to quarrell with Christ for requiring it, is the same thing as to be angry with our Saviour because <hi>the nature of the Fire is such as does require that it should burn.</hi> Nay many of them were so sensible of the unhappy state of their Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sound so great pressures in themselves from the weights of their vicious inclinations, discerned so perfect an antipathy betwixt their being and their actions, that when with all the arts of Reason and the practise of their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they could not ease themselves, they went to <hi>Sorcery</hi> and <hi>Magick</hi> for a Cure, receiv'd Catharticks, and a discipline of purity from Hell, the Region of uncleanness; the Devil mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them believe he would assist in casting out himself: Such were the stresse, the restlessness, the groans, the cry of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be rid of its impurity. These poor Souls were mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their Method; but if the Devil by those worships of his which they were us'd to, had not stopt the avenues, sure one would judge they had <hi>prepar'd the way for Christianity;</hi> there being no obstruction to it, nothing that can hinder its <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> acceptance, but the low esteem and aversation of Virtue: For if men believe the Moral truths, they have no reason in the world to doubt the Supernatural, these being intended for the most part as encouragements to those other, as God's last attempts to kindle in us love of Virtue by such strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives; that, that wherein <hi>Philosophy</hi> was <hi>ignorant,</hi> and the <hi>Law weak,</hi> as having neither Promises nor Terrors equal to the force of our Corruptions, that the <hi>Gospel</hi> might effect, as having both to the utmost possibility of Divine Contrivance: Now this requires us to believe those Supernaturals mostly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for this reason, by believing them to make us perform what it enjoyns. And it is apparent that because men would not do this, therefore they will not believe those. Shew me but any one that is sincere and strict in Christian dutyes that does doubt the Principles; if there be such an one he cannot doubt them long, not onely for <hi>Christ's</hi> Promise sake, <note n="a" place="margin">John 7. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man will do my Will, he shall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God,</hi> he will soon know that Doctrine is from God that does prescribe such Godlike lives; nor onely for the <hi>Churches</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which did make <hi>Synesius</hi> a Christian Bishop before he did believe the Resurrection, upon that confidence they had of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> him by reason of his Piety: But in reason why should he that does embrace the Piety, disbelieve that which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to his belief onely to urge him to embrace, onely to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109439:59"/>
crown that Piety? Indeed he that accounts his Vices but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sleight tricks of wit, or folly; onely pleasant satisfactions to the desires of his Nature; (for he understands no nature but his carnal one) he hath no reason to believe there was a Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Son of God, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>by making him a Sacrifice for sin so to to condemn sin in the flesh;</hi> is not prepar'd to think that there is an Eternal weight of Indignation due and ready for it. He that hath but mean thoughts of Virtue, counts it onely <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry,</hi> or as it were the <hi>Flatus of the Mind,</hi> making the <hi>Soul Hypocondriack,</hi> it is impossible that he should think <hi>God</hi> was <hi>Incarnated</hi> and <hi>dyed</hi> to teach it by his Doctrine and Example, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and to purchase graces to enable us to live it; or that there is a Resurrection to reward it, a Trinity engag'd in working out Salvation for it. I must confesse I would believe, that men perswade themselves that the reason of their disbelief is onely this, that these things are not testified sufficiently; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I find <hi>the Man in Hell would have one sent to his Brethren from the Dead, to testifie unto them of that place of Torments, Luc.</hi> 16. 28. as if those Truths did want witnessing. But this is not because enough hath not been done for their conviction in the truth of Christ's Religion; for there is hardly any thing besides in the whole world that men believe, but they believe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> upon lesse grounds. The whole World was convinc't in such a manner, as that millions chose to dye rather than not confess it; that many Ages prov'd but Centuries of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unto that Truth; all Torments were more eligible than the disbelief of this Religion, which was confirmed so, that against all arts and power of Opposition, against the Wit and Fury of the World, though all the Subtlety, and and all the Strength of Earth resisted it, yet it overspread the Universe. Besides it is most prudent to believe it too, for <hi>if there be another World what then?</hi> There was enough done therefore; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but Corruptions suffer them not to attend to that which hath been done. And 'tis no wonder they should do so at this distance, for they contrasted with Christs Miracles when present; and they were so uneasie under the conviction of them, that rather than be prest so by the mighty power of his Works, they did design to rid themselves of him that wrought them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 47. you may find them strugling with his demonstrations to keep off the Evidence, <hi>What do we? for this man doeth many Miracles.</hi> Yea, they do conspire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Miracles themselves, and would put <hi>Lazarus</hi> also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to <hi>death,</hi> because he was <hi>raised from the dead;</hi> they could not let the Evidence and the Conviction live, but they must murder that too. Nay more, as if the pertinacy of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109439:60"/>
could do mightier Works than Christ, and could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and were above the power of his Miracles, it is said to have bound his hands, and <hi>he could do no mighty Works at Nazareth because of it, Mar.</hi> 6. 6. At least as saith <hi>Theophylact,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Solemn dayes approaching will discover to you this Way, namely, the Passage <hi>from the Garden in Gethsemane to Golgotha;</hi> There you will see he does begin his Journey <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with the Amazements of an Agony, and ended it in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the horrors and the outcryes of Despair; he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed under such a load as made his life gush out through all the parts of his whole Body, the weight of it did make his Soul faint by the way; and when he was upon the Tree, crusht it out, made it expire sooner than the stress of Nature would have done, and forc't it to burst out away <hi>in Prayers and strong Cryes,</hi> that so he might sooner escape from under that sad pressure.

This as it was formally done once for all, so in its virtue, influence, and blest effects, 'tis still in doing, as to thee, and me, and all of us; and the approaching Season is to represent it so. Now sure we need no motives to prepare the way for him <hi>who runs that he may obtain our Salvation,</hi> who though he laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a dismal burden, yet still presses on to catch us, so to rescue us from sin and Hell: If he think fit, and can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> endure to strive thus, I will make all ready, and stand fair to have my guilt seized from me, and to be laid hold on for my Blessednesse, to be the Prize, the Crown of all Christ's Agonies, that which he thinks worthy with so much strugling to contend for.</p>
                  <p>Now the same Preparation is required here, that made way for his other coming, that is, Repentance, in one word, a disposition and sincere desire of heart to part with every evil and corrupt affection, to quit every sin.

                     <hi>that walk after their own lusts, and say, where is the promise of his coming?</hi> For except that the Fathers fell asleep, some men are dead and others risen in their place, all things else continue as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were from the beginning, there alwayes were vicissitudes of Flourish and Decay in every Nation, and in these things there are no footsteps of a Providence or Judgment: In dayes when men resist and deny thy Hand because they do not feel it; and since thy Judgments are removed out of their sight, defie Thee too, and dash thy self out of the world; in such dayes 'tis but just that thou shouldst come to their conviction, and confute them with thy Judgments into Ruine. And truely since it must be horrid provocation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that makes him come beyond the compass of his Covenant to Revenge, the executions are mostly very fatal, as if they were what they seem to prevent, the last Day, and the final Doom upon such Nations. For to the <hi>Jews</hi> they look as if they

had fulfilled all that the Prophecy was mistaken to foretel, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and were as irreversible and utter as the Sentence of the Day of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Now to prepare for such Approaches of the Lord our King, there is one onely means, that is, resolving Fealty and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him, and that not formall onely, or but idle Homage, but renouncing all Confederacy with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Sin, and the Devil, and serving him with all the heart and all the strength. For he is that King in the 19. of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> who did not onely cause his contumacious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>such as would not have him to reign over them</hi> to be slain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> before him, <hi>v.</hi> 27. making his way over their Necks whose Hearts he could not set up his Throne in; nor did onely cause those Servants who were so far from preparing his Way, that upon confidence <hi>he delay'd his coming they smote their fellow Servants, and did eat and drink with the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en;</hi> were unjust to others, and indulg'd themselves in all licentious living, cause them to be <hi>cut asunder, and to have their portion in the Region of weeping,</hi> where these intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate should have onely tears to drink, and for their ryots onely gnashing of teeth, Teeth ready to revenge their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> former Luxuries on themselves, gnashing as to devour one another, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 48. But he is that King too that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted <hi>Sloth</hi> as well as <hi>Treason,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 30. who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given one a Talent, trusted him with abilities of doing service in the station he had put him, which for his not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to do, though he corrupted not his faculties, because he buryed them and did not use them, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd to idlenesse, condemn'd him therefore to <hi>utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> to the proper Mansion of the slothfull, all whose time can be nothing but <hi>night,</hi> since his whole Life is but as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sleep. But in a word, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath said all, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand; as it is written, prepare ye the way of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here to stop, and to reflect at once upon our selves and this which hath been said: And first, on this <hi>last way</hi> by which he comes as a <hi>King</hi> in Executions.</p>
                  <p>Here I cannot but take notice, that we have some that do design and act among us as if they were <hi>this King's Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> his <hi>Pioneers</hi> rather, to prepare the way for his invasion on us; or were his <hi>forlorn hope</hi> sent out to give the onset of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his Executions, and were sure of <hi>Him</hi> in the <hi>reserve</hi> to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond them: Truly their Threats and their Attempts are big and Insolent, and most mens expectations are not very comfortable.</p>

                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:109439:62"/>
To say with some, this Confidence of theirs is built on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the non-execution of the Laws (which seems sleighter than in the old Comparison of Cobwebs) for notwithstanding their fine close contexture, there are holes left for spiders to creep through; and not the great Flyes onely, every rufl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and befriended sinner whether by his Money or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the lesser too, now they have learnt to fly in Swarms, break through, to say that were a Complaint out of my sphere.</p>
                  <p>And truly when I think on the temper of their fury, how it is hardned in the fire of Execution, charges Death not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> onely in the Field, but on the Scaffold too; I must needs think it hath some stronger Ingredients, and there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Religion in it.</p>
                  <p>Now really there can be nothing else of that but an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the great defection of Vertue in their Enemies: Open Prophaness, publique Licence, living without fear of God or Man, makes them look upon them as men design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for excision. <hi>Achior</hi> is said to give this counsel to the Captain of the Host of <hi>Babel,</hi> when he went against <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea.</hi>

                  <p>When in that fatal race, and under all that load he did stretch and presse on so to lay hold upon us, to seize our sins and Sacrifice them in himself, that then we should retain them, should not let him have them, but cling to them still; that when he was upon the Crosse with naked Breast and open Arms, as it were ready to receive all wounds sin could inflict, and every wickednesse of ours had a stab at his Heart, that we should still reserve the envenom'd Ponyard, keep the malice of the wickednesse to Crucisie Him to our selves afresh, and kill our selves also for ever! That we should suffer him to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> swoone and Dye under the burden of our guilt, yet we our selves resolve to keep and not to quit the guilt! For do not you deceive your selves, Christ did not take away the guilt of any one sin, from any man that does not part with it, but still retains the sin; that would imply a contradiction: Such men are so far from preparing the Lords way to his Cross, that that whole Journey was to them in vain: They will not let him have their sins to bear upon the Tree, deny their Priest a Sacrifice for them when he was going to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

The Hypocrites either to God or to their Brethren, that have onely the Ceremonies, the Civilities of Honesty or Religion, make shew of both, but yet are false to God, and insincere with Man, cruelly betraying or deluding, yea enraging those necessities which with fair speeches they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to smooth and salve; they act over again the treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous malice of his Persecutors, who under the kindness of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Cup of Consolation which was given to them that were Condemn'd to Dye, namely, <hi>Wine mingled with Myrrhe</hi> to cheer the Heart and cloud the Understanding, and so lessen sense of Suffering, in scorn and mischief gave him <hi>Vinegar and Gall,</hi> which though it counterfeit the other taste, serves onely to prolong life for more future Torment.

                  <p>But why stand I thus to enumerate particulars?

indifferent and unconcern'd in that (as in the rest) whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there were such a procession in earnest, or whether he did come at all indeed; which casts me on his other coming, the last thing, his coming in the first Revealing of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>And here I hope I shall have no reflections to make as to preparing for this coming. Christ certainly did find his Way prepared so to this Nation, that we believe he was more early entertain'd in it, than almost any where in the whole <hi>Gentile World:</hi> And ever since his cares for it were so particular, that they, who would fulfil the Revelation in this Church, seem to err with some reason, when as his regards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> were so peculiar for this, as if he had not concern'd himself in any other. And sure none other ever had so long, such opportunities and advantages; so that I cannot press you to <hi>prepare the Lord's Way,</hi> since <hi>he is among us. Righteous art thou O Lord!</hi> and <hi>wonderful in thy Mercies! yet if I might plead with Thee concerning them,</hi> I would enquire what hast thou done here all this while after thy so long abode among us? what are we the better? The last attempt of God to reclaim Man, when he had shewed the world all other means were fruitlesse, was by <hi>Thee His Son!</hi> by whom he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all the full measures of his Graces; and now what effect of these is there in us? Shew me how all this care and cost hath made <hi>us</hi> be <hi>more just, sober,</hi> or <hi>chast;</hi> in any way <hi>more virtuous</hi> than those <hi>Heathens</hi> whose <hi>Religion came from Hell?</hi> We find Thee saying, <note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 10. 18.</note>

Thirdly, <hi>The Enemy</hi> which he must have no Peace with, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but must vanquish, <hi>is the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith is sufficient forces to assist him in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Faith where it is rightly made use of is a certain Victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I shall not handle these in <hi>Thesi</hi> thus, but for the more practical treating of them shall make and answer three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</p>
                  <p>First, What the way is that the World does wage War in? where its Strength lyes? and how it manages that force <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> so as to get advantage over men? and how it does improve each such advantage till it gets a perfect Conquest?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what the strengths of Faith are? how it char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, breaks the forces of the World, and does enable the Believer to overcome?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how far the Believer must pursue his Conquest? what must be the measures of his Victory? that he may know how to vanquish it so as that the World may not rebell again; not do like <hi>Joash</hi> smite three times, then leave, but Smite untill he make an end of danger: Having answered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> these, I shall endeavour to apply all to our selves.</p>
                  <p>Now for the better handling of the first of these, I must shew you how the Will of Man may be attaqued and taken.</p>
                  <p>To which purpose I observe, that whatsoever liberty there is in humane choice, yet every appetite seems in some sense determin'd in its tendencies to fix on that which appears sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply best for it, for that instant which it chooseth in; I do not say that whensoever Reason peremptorily concludes a thing is best that the Will is determined instantly to that; for by a too unhappy evidence we know, that if the lower Soul <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> does but becken the <hi>Will</hi> another way, she can suspend and stop her prosecutions, and too oft finds cause to go along with that against the dictates of the Mind: But this I say, that in her last Executive Determinations she alwayes tends to that which hath the fairest and most vigorous appearances of being best for her at that present time. If it seem strange how, since the Understanding can account the certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of an happy everlastingnesse much better for the present, than a momentany worldly satisfaction; (for we have our Rules and our proportions by which we rate and choose Reversions rather than Possessions, and those of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> other World exceed these beyond all the measures of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and the Understanding does inform impartially of this:) How then if the <hi>Will</hi> can let those go and take these
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109439:67"/>
it can be said alwayes to choose the better for the present? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> if it may be said to do so though it let those go, then by what wash or Chymick Artifices does she blanch or paint these so as to make them look better for the present? Now we may discover how these both may be, if we onely reflect upon the manner of the actings of our own Souls. Where the things that stand in competition for our choice are both of the same kind, and have one common measure of their good or ill; (as for example, are both painful, or both profitable, or delightful) and no consideration of any other motive comes into the Ballance; here the <hi>Will</hi> must needs choose the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> best, refuse the worst. For meerly out of aversation to pain to run into the stronger Pain, avoyd the lesse; or out of Covetousnesse to refuse greater Wealth; or for delights sake onely to preferr that which is lesse delightful; are practical contradictions. Where the objects are of different kinds. one for example, profitable or delightful, but not without sin; and the other Vertuous, and spiteful Reason taking Vertues part, suggests the motives to it, Gods Commands, his Promises, and Threats; here, though the inferiour facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties prostitute all their baits, they cannot equal those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals to the <hi>Will</hi> 'tis true; yet by their importunacies still <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> pressing her, goading her by their stings, they can and do prevail with her to call the Understanding off from her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to those other motives, and employ the thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the present object that does importune her so, and which by the agitations it does cause within the sensual part, puts the mind in disorder presently, distracts the thoughts, then seizes them; so that the Understanding being now intent to this, the better motives are let go and sink, and then the onely ones in view are those of sense, which straight the <hi>Will</hi> rushes into the imbraces of, and the other being vanisht and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> no better than appearing, 'tis plain in those she fixes on the best. But if the mind will not be taken off, but Conscience fly in the Man's Face and will not let him rest, nor his <hi>Will</hi> fix, why then in this unquietnesse of hers she sets the thoughts: on work and will not let them fix till they find out some <hi>salvo</hi> that can satisfie Carnality and Conscience too, that will let the Man have the sin and not deprive him of Gods favour: And if either <hi>application of Gods Decrees</hi> and <hi>Promises with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Condition</hi> absolutely to himself, and <hi>the assurances of Faith and trust</hi> will do it, (as we may know it will in some) or if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not that, then if <hi>hopes of mercy, resolutions of repenting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards</hi> and <hi>leaving off</hi> the sin, (as this does do with most) then it is evident in choosing to obey his inclinations, with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109439:68"/>
such <hi>salvo</hi> the man chooseth that which does appear best for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the present. But if the mind unsatisfied with these, and not daring to trust such rotten planks against the very face of storm, object the uncertainty, at least, of these Principles, and the unsafeness of those after hopes, not fit to be security against God's Threats, and would convince the man that conscience of resisting a temptation, and by that keeping himself free from the clutches of the Devil, and the fears of Hell, together with present assurance of God's favour, are more satisfying at the present than the pleasures of the sin: Yet those pleasant apprehensions of the Conscience of resisting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> re-encountering with the seeming impossibility of resisting alway that which presses so, and will sometime or other seize upon him, and finding the temptation to have sharper stings than his Religious fears of things which are not present, and of which he hath had no experience: And besides, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never had any great sense of God's favour and rewards, the Landskip of them is but dim and faint upon the mind like those representations blind men have of Beauty (to whom if you discourse of exact features, perfect harmony of colours, of a graceful presence, chearful aire, and a good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> mine, and all those other know not whats, that being seen commit a Rape upon mens faculties, yet his conceptions of them are but very dark, who never hath had any notices of these but such as his Ears give) and though the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chance to be positive and resolute in its determinations concerning them, yet still the apprehensions of them are not cleer; futurity, which is one sort of distance, making ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as all things afar of do, look but confused, and their <hi>Ideas</hi> not distinct, nor bright or brisk, therefore they move the <hi>Will</hi> but very coldly: Whereas the other pleasure being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> known, the apprehensions of it are more vigourous, the draught is strong and lusty on the Fancy, there is force in every line, the very image of it lives, and therefore is more efficacious, and by that prevails, that looking fairest and most tempting at that present, so that from this experience of our selves in every sort of instance thus deduc't, the <hi>Will</hi> does seem alwayes to fix on that which appears simply best for it, for that instant which it chooseth in; the man still takes what he likes better at that present, and he likes better that which lookes better for that present: And things are made to look better by these arts which I have shewed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> you.</p>
                  <p>This being now the temper and the disposition of the <hi>Will,</hi> and such the method of her actings, this is the thing the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:109439:68"/>
world makes use of, here's its strength, namely, in making <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> things look better for the present. Which how it manages so as thereby to get advantages upon us, how it does improve each such advantage till it get a perfect Conquest, I shall give you in few words; by shewing you how the World gets first possession of our Souls, and there raises in us passionate desires that expect present satisfaction, which it hath at hand to serve them with, which by these arts are made look better than any other expectations.</p>

Now all that while he is incapable of being affected with any other things, but such as strike the senses, things of this present world; and by that means onely such possesse his mind and inclinations too, the uses and advantages of every thing about him are those he is first sensible of, and those alone: and so the world does make the first impressions on our Souls, it does prevent all other in our inclinations, hath our first love and enjoyes our first embraces, from which it must be with great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> reluctancy that we are torn; and whereas these impressions should be weakened and defac't by the infusion of other notions and Principles, and the Soul should be weaned from too great liking of these sensitive satisfactions by the cares of those which should be as <hi>assistant souls</hi> to us, denying us every thing that was not very requisite or very moderate, that we might learn to want them, and be taught not to desire them. The contrary alas! is practis'd every way, as soon as ere the mind is capable of being trained into the World's snares we betray it into them, we teach it how to understand and be affected with the bait, and those pomps which we but just <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> before made them renounce, we make them before any things know, and be pleas'd with; and the first blossom of the mind wherein the Soul exerts it self for the most part is Pride: And for the rest the old complaint is true, <hi>ante pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum eorum quàm os instituimus,</hi> we teach their Palates sooner than their Tongues, and they can cry for what they cannot name; and yet among their first half words they can name Day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

propensions into temper: And as Understanding grows <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> up, we impregnate it with Principles and arts of serving them, turn Reason into a sagacity and skill of catering for those Inclinations, making them live <hi>Aristotle's</hi> observation backwards, educating them into Creatures of meer sense, teaching them to be <hi>rationall understanding Bruits.</hi> Yet the world thinks <hi>sic fiunt homines,</hi> this is call'd <hi>making them Men betimes:</hi> And when they are thus made, when the age of satisfying all their inclinations is come, and when temptations are understood, and multiply by Conversation, and the World hath objects for them all at hand; objects, that what every way they turn their Eyes are still before them and thrust <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> themselves into the mind and the advantages that do attend them, and by constant importunacy stirr and work desires and serve them too; then we are in that state in which the World hath those advantages I told you of, whereby it does not onely war against the Principles of Reason and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in us, but it also leads the Will into Captivity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaves her to it self. For it is plain the world hath got pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the heart, and hath a strong party of heady passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which whensoever a temptation does alarm them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently are up, raise a mutiny, and with the heat of Fancy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and commotion of affections they disorder the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, that it cannot rally up considerations against the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, but either it concludes, or disputes very faintly: If it do make an effort and struggle, it is but with a slender company of thin weak notions of things afar off, which the man hath had no proof of, nor hath any great confidence in; which while it is in recollecting and enforcing, the world hath its powers ready, seizes on the Will by the means of a corrupted fancy that does give it earnest, foretast, even the possession of the well-known pleasures that it does invite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to, and so melts him down into the sin. Now while the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Profits, Pleasures, Honours that I have from the World fill me, while they feed and cloath me, and provide me all that my necessity or wantonnesse can wish, and furnish me in hand with whatsoever any of my natural or my forc't Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites does gape for, and lull me with that constant variety of those delights which it procures, the use of which hath so drunk up my Spirits, and my Soul hath so imbib'd the joyes that I know not how to retrench from them, nor from that which is to furnish them. Must I leave all these for things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that I have had no tast nor rellish of? leave all in present for some future hopes which I have no great confidence of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing if I should try? and which I also see that very few

venture for? Whereas Mankind is swallowed up in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of these, and to be stor'd with them does not onely serve my needs and Luxuries, but it is the onely state of Reputation and Honour. 'Tis not from a rich stock of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous qualifications, nor from great and glorious Actions that Esteem and Dignities do generally grow, but from worldly advantages, these constitute conditions, and these are their onely Characters. And being it is so, they that are in a Sphere above the ordinary ranks of people, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive those things that are become essential to their condition; and they must have worldly Pomps although with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Piety, or Charity, and Justice, yea, of every Christian Duty; of Morality indeed, and Heathen vertue, of Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it self: They will extort, be ravenous and cruel, will be false and treacherous, cheat and betray to get, and purchase at the price of the most difingenious, sneaking and unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sins: To undermine another they will dig to Hell, as if they meant to give fire to their Mine with the flames of that place whence they have the malice and the arts to do it: And as if they did not care to sink him thither who stands in their way to stop their rise; they are content to dye their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> purple with their own most guilty blushes, and the blood of any one that is their Rival or Competitor.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, that when these pretences of condition have got footing in the heart, besides those passionate desires which they stirr for themselves, they work out most unquiet Emulations, Envyes, Discontents at others. In whatsoever any other does exceed me, his Abundance is my want, straight I am in necessity, not from my own needs, but from his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, and I suffer his enjoyments; I labour, fret, and sink under the burden of his Honours, and his greatnesse is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on me. Nor can I ever be at rest till I am got from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> under the sad pressure of that deep necessity of having what I see another have. And thus it will be, till Ambition have no further object, till there be no greater heights to mount: And now this Lust is in its pride, and the victorious World in its Triumphal Chariot.

                  <p>It seems a prejudice to this Assertion of my Text, that the great pretenders to Faith, the men that lay the whole stresse of their Everlasting Being on believing onely, have been branded to be very Worldly; and the Factions of Godlinesse were the mysteries and arts of Thriveing; as if their <hi>Faith</hi> laid hold <hi>indeed upon the Promises of that Life;</hi> and if it <hi>over came the World,</hi> it was for them to <hi>seize</hi> and be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

                        </gap>et</hi> to make: And while Christian Votaries do onely mind such Conquests, and are candidates of <hi>Turcisme,</hi> do they not call it in, and make way for their Sword and their Religion? But the Faith that layes hold on Christ's Promises cannot confist with any such affections. For since Christ's Promises are made onely to those that overcome all such desires, and that do it to the end, and none other can be safe; It is impossible for him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that does not overcome to trust upon those Promises, and to apply them to himself by Faith: For at once to believe I shall be saved, and yet believe those sayings which affirm none such can be saved, these are most inconsistent. It being then as easie to make contradictions be at peace, as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worldlinesse,</hi> they cannot suffer one the other; it follows: He that hath this Faith in sincerity must needs overcome the World. And to shew you in a word how it is done, you need not but to consider, that Faith is as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen, Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Which as the <hi>Syriach</hi> translates, does say, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that Faith is such a certainty of those things that we hope for, as if we actually had them; and it is the revelation of those things are not seen, it hath so strong a confidence in God, that the Believer assures himself of all Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and Threats, as much as if they were in fight; and though <hi>we see them through a glasse but darkly,</hi> yet we see them by it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. it being <gap reason="foreign">

is present to it. Now by this alone it is of force to break <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the powers of the World, which as we saw while the things of the other World were lookt upon as at a great distance, afar off, taking advantage of their absence storm'd the mind with present forces, and had supplies at hand for fresh as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, so overcame it. Whereas, had the powers of the World to come been present (now by Faith they are made so we see) the other which are so inferiour that there is no more comparison than of immensity to a point, a moment to Eternity, could not stand before them. 'Tis too notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that this is the case: For should a man cry fire in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> House, how it had seiz'd the strengths of it, were blotting out the glories of it in thick Smoak, devouring all their shine in flame, we would leave our Devotions, our most eager pleasures to prevent this, and no speed were swift enough to serve our cares and fears. But though a Prophet of the Lord cry <note n="a" place="margin">Isai. 30. 33.</note>

                  <p>To see my self trampled upon by pride and malice, or worse yet, begging of him whom my blood it may be helpt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to streams of plenty, begging like <hi>Lazarus</hi> the portion of his <hi>Dogs,</hi> Dogs that are taught to <hi>snarle</hi> and <hi>bite, and make more sores, not lick them;</hi> this is a state more killing than my want, able almost to tempt a man to any courses. But then if with the Eye of Faith I do but look beyond the gulph, and there behold the Rich man in his flames begging for water, and although it be the Region of eternall weeping, yet not able to procure one drop of his own tears to cool his Tongue. O then I see 'tis better to be <hi>Lazarus</hi> although there were <hi>no Abraham's bosome!</hi> But if my Faith look <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> through that bosom also into that of God, and there behold the <hi>Son of God</hi> leaving all the essential felicities of that Bosom to come live a life of Vertue here on Earth, and to teach us to do so; choosing to do this also in a state of the extreamest poverty, consecrating want and nakednesse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and scorn, making them thus the ensigns of a divine Royalty.</p>
                  <p>And to encourage us not to sink under any of the Worlds assaults, he hath proposed Rewards of Vertue, such as God is blessed in; did my Faith give me but a constant view of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> all this, sure the paint and varnish of these little things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the twinkling exhalations of the glories of this World could not dazle my mind and captivate my Soul, I should burst these entanglements to catch at those.

and 'tis acknowledg'd, that when our belief shall be all visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our expectation possession, when our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> shall become all sense in Heaven; and we see and tast and have those glories, then we cannot sin, cannot be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from them: And therefore by the measures of the nearness of these objects, of our sight, and of our interest, so are our strengths to stand and overcome temptations.

But he whose Faith mounts him to Heaven his Birth-place, where he nestles in the secret Bosom of his Father, he needs not be concern'd in any of the carriages of this World, he is above them all, without the sphere of their attraction or magnetisme, without the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of temptations from them: The World is but as his slave, and it hath no command upon him, he treads it all under his feet, and therefore certainly hath overcome it; the <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of which Victory is the next and last thing we are to enquire into. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                  <p>If you ask the <hi>Stoick</hi> who is this great Conquerour that overcomes the World, he will answer somewhat to this purpose.

                  <p>Should we now cast an eye at once upon our selves and that which hath been thus deduc't tracing all back again; then First, it would appear so evident that I were vain, if I should stay to prove that those which have such desires to any of the profits, heights or pomps, or any dear thing else whatever of this World, as that they are impatient if they miscarry in them, and full of strange complacencies if they do answer their desires, these have not <hi>overcome the World</hi> to any such degree. For had I overcome and Crucified it, sure I should not be so affectionate as to desire, court, and pursue what I had Executed; I should as soon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> adore the Paintings of my Enemies Tomb, embrace and make love to his Carcasse: And were <hi>I Crucified to it,</hi> had I but one Thorn of my Saviour's Crown struck through my head, but one Nail in my Foot of those that nayled him to his Tree; were my Soul fastned to a Crosse, how were it possible I should run gadding after the gay follies of the World, hasty in my desires of it: Nor could I be impatient if the World do not answer my desires and expectations, disquieted and discompos'd, if I be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, when any thing in it is not subservient to my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> heights, and I misse of those respects I lookt for; were the World vanquisht, Crucified to me, should I look for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from my dead Enemy whom I had slain? or be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled if the person on the Crosse did not do fitting reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to me? or be impatient if I had not respects and the Attendances of Pomp from one upon the Gibbet? or if <hi>I were Crucified to it,</hi> certainly these heats would not warm the dead; these are none of the troubles of an Executed person when he is rackt upon that instrument of Death, he is not grieved because the Nayles were not of Silver, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Spears head not bright, or the Crosse was not hung with Arras: And suppose it were, sure I were very weak if I should please my self with that, and let Such poor
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:109439:73"/>
contents thrust out all the just sadness of my Sentence and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> demerit: And yet it is as strange to find delights in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any of the Worlds advantages, and pride my self in the possession if <hi>I be Crucified to it.</hi> But much lesse is it Crucified to them that will do actions of injustice for the sake of any of the pomps or profits of the VVorld; there are that grind, and screw, and rack all that they have to deal with; others that deceive and rob in Vizours, plunder in the disguises of fair words and of false arts; Some that dresse their Pomps in none of their own trappings, such as they never mean to have a right to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they never mean to satisfie for them if they can avoid it; they furnish the grandeur of their own condition with the goods of others which they never care to make their own by any recompence, at least not in such wayes and seasons as the needs of those that own'd them, and the rules of Justice do require; they cramme and sauce their Dishes with the vital Blood indeed of those who starve for want of, and who own all that which does provide them their exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Now would a man do this to entertain, and feed, and dresse the Carcasse of his vanquisht, his dead Enemy? would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he be so vain, so guilty to provide to deck the Crosse on which he Crucified his Foe? least of all would he retrench from the proportions of Charity or Piety, deny the calls of Mercy and compassion or Religion for his profits sake, or to furnish out the trains of Pomp, take <hi>the Lords portion</hi> to serve the dead World with? If it were <hi>overcome and Crucified,</hi> they would not feed it with <hi>hallowed things</hi> (and the Poor's portion is such,) nor rob the Altar to give it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, take Consecrated things to make a cursed Carcasse gay and proud, strip Christ's Body, starve their Saviour (so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

but for thirty Silver pieces did betray him up to Death; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that of this Age proceeds, and will not let him be in <hi>Heaven</hi> neither, but it <hi>scoffs him thence,</hi> and his <hi>Faith from the Earth:</hi> And because they like this VVorld so well, they will not suffer there should be any other. It is not my part to Combat these; I undertook onely to shew a way to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the World,</hi> if they will not use it let them enjoy their Bondage. And yet without all doubt these candidates of Infidelity and Atheisme have faith enough to do the work in good degree; for certainly ther's none of them but does believe but he shall dye, and it is easie for his Faith to look <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> through that <hi>thin vapour</hi> which our life is stiled by, to the end of that <hi>small span,</hi> and there see a <hi>Bed,</hi> though gay now and soft as the sleep and sins it entertains, then with the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains close, the gayety all clowded in a darknesse, such as does begin the desolatenesse of the Grave; if you draw the Curtain to his Faith it sees a languishing sad Corps which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world can help or ease, foreshrowded in his own dead hue, himself preluding to his winding-sheet, in which within a little while he shall be cast from the society and sight of men, and shall have nothing else of all his VVealth and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Pomp: To see all this is no great monstrous difficulty for his Faith. Now though while he is in his prosperity and health, and the world serves every of his desires, and if I should tell him all his superfluities, all that is beyond a meer convenience are but empty things, meer shadows of delight, that onely mock his fancy; should I tell him that the silver furnitures of his Tables, and those more wealthy shining ones those in his Cabinet, and the Silken ones of his Rooms, and the more exquisite pieces of rich Art which people must have skill to understand the pomp of, must have been the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Disciples of the Pensil to discern how they do serve Pride; tell him these are phantasmes, onely dreams of pomp, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages no where but in imagination, I shall not perswade him, but he will despise me. But then if he will ask his Faith how all these will look to him in the state which is now before his thoughts, what his opinion of them will be then? he knows he may as well go to his pictures now, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Mirth and Luxuries with them, and hearken to their painted sounds, and dine upon the images of Feasts, as hope in that sad hour from all his VVealth to find content or ease, though his hand sweat under the weight of winter jewells <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they will not heal one a king joynt: His plate the greatest Ryot of his Table will not make one morsell tast savory; yea more, he knows that then all the worldly uses of these
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109439:74"/>
superfluities such as <hi>satisfying curiosity,</hi> and <hi>emulation,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the <hi>estimation of the World, to be the talk of people,</hi> and the like; these will appear most evidently to be insipid things, meer conceits of delights; things of which there can be no reall enjoyment or advantage any time. And if it then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear evidently that in themselves they are so, then they are so alwayes; and a constant Contemplation of that time will make them alwayes seem so. So that a Faith that cannot see into another World, that will but look through this, must needs take off our hearts from the entanglements of those advantages, when it appears how small a thing can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dash them all so as that we cannot enjoy them while we have them, and that the enjoyment of them while we do is but imaginary.</p>
                  <p>And really when we consider how unquiet and disturb'd a thing man is, except he raise himself above the power of all these, how till the mind escape out of the whirle and circuit of the Worlds allurements, it cannot but be in perpetual agitations; at every ebb or flow of things without, there is a tyde within of swelling or sinking affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; every change abroad does make a change of thoughts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and of designs, crosse Accidents have crosse Passions, and I am as much an Universe of various thwarting contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affections, as the world is of motions.</p>
                  <p>How the Beasts are free, serene and quiet Creatures in comparison, for they not understanding many objects, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have few inclinations, and their satisfactions very obvious; whereas the Comprehensive mind of Man that looks into a world of things, and out of them creats a world of temptations, finds out varieties of Pleasures or of Profits, and then starts as many eager affections in himself to pursue them; his copious understanding does but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him various lusts, and his reason does but make him sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious in searching out occasions of disquiet. Nor is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should be otherwise, for while my inclinations are chain'd to those external movements, and my slavish mind attends upon those inclinations, I must needs suffer as many servitudes as the world hath changes of temptation: And then putting these two Considerations together, how unsatisfying and how uneasie too it is to be engaged in the Advantages of this World, which are meerly Dreams of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good things that disturb our rest and make our sleep unquiet, with the working of Imagination, yet do but delude the Appetite, and we find we have had nothing when we awake; sure if I thought there were no other World, yet
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109439:75"/>
would I not be greedy after the great things of this, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 'tis more easie far to want them; here would I indulge my self the sensuality of a Contented mind, the luxury of an ataraxie, of an indifference as to all these things, of being quiet and untroubled by not having them, free from the hurry and disorder of them. The <hi>Moralists</hi> did so account it certainly, when they call'd this living according to our Nature, as if all the other were a Violence upon us; and upon the same ground they accounted it not hard to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Alurements of this World, it was onely not to invade and use a force upon themselves and vanquish their own natures: And sure we that are <hi>Christians,</hi> and are so no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> farther than as we have <hi>this Faith</hi> here in the Text, we must not count it hard; we who have the Revelations and Example of the <hi>blessed Jesus,</hi> all that he hath done to make it easie, now saith he. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Which calls me to the next Enquiry, to the nature of the duty here intended, I am <hi>Crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is design'd by it S. <hi>Paul</hi> does perfectly declare <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Our old man is crucified with Christ that the body of Sin might be destroyed, that we should no longer serve sin:</hi> So that it means a through Repentance, and abandoning of former evil Courses: A Duty which there are few men but in some instants of their life think absolutely necessary, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and perswade themselves they do perform it. At some time or other they are forc't to recollect and grow displeas'd and angry at their sins, and have some sad reflections on them, beg for mercy and forgiveness, and do think of leaving them; and when they have return'd to them again, they shake the head, and chafe, and curse at their own weaknesse, and renew their purposes it may be; and do this as oft as such a Season as this is, or other like occasions suggest it to or move them: And with this they satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and hope if God do please to take them hence in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> some such muddy, gloomy fit of their Repentance, all's well. Now shall we call this being Crucified? are there Racks and Tortures in this discipline? hath a Spear prickt them to the heart, and no blood nor no water, no tears gush out thence? hath it made no issue for some hearty Sorrow to purle out?</p>
                  <p>Indeed I must confesse, the Scripture does sometimes word the performance of this duty in expressions that are not so sower, but of an easier importance; as first, <hi>put off the Old Man,</hi> as if all were but <hi>Garment;</hi> put it off I say, not as <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22.</note> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they stript our Saviour in order to his Scourgings and his Crosse, but intimating to us what an easie thing it is to cast off Sin for them, who do begin with it betimes, before it get too close to the heart. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> &amp;c. saith <hi>Theophyl.</hi> even as easie as putting off thy Cloaths, and thy Repentance is but as thy Shift, thy change of life like changing thy Apparel.</p>
                  <p>But alas! for all the easienesse which this expression hints, where the sins also lye in the Attire, as besides emulation, pride, vainglory, great uncharitablenesse and inhumanity, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cruel injustice and oppression often do, when many are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done through want of those dues which do furnish other men with the excesses of this kind: when the sins therefore lye in the attire, and they may <hi>put them off</hi> without a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:109439:79"/>
yet it is so hard that it cannot be done; sometimes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the worth of a whole Province hangs upon a slender thread about a neck, a Patrimony thrust upon one joynt of one least finger, and these warts of a Rock or a Shell-fish with the appendages eat out Estates and starve poor Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; for whom indeed they should command <hi>these stones to be made bread;</hi> but that's Miracle too stubborn for their Vertue. And then how will they proceed to the next ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of this duty? <hi>Circumcise your selves to the Lord, and take away the foreskin of your hearts, Jer.</hi> 4. 4. These are harder and more bloody words, they differ in the pain and anguish that they put us to, as much as to <hi>uncloath</hi> and <hi>flea</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And truly should we trace him through all the stages of his Passion, we should hardly find one passage but is made to be transcribed by us in dealing with our sins.</p>
                  <p>First he began it with <hi>Agony;</hi> when <hi>his Soul was exceeding heavy,</hi> for it labour'd with such weight of indignation as did <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 37.</note> make the Son of God to sink under the meer apprehension: And he was <hi>sorrowful unto Death,</hi> so as that his whole body <note place="margin">v. 38.</note> did weep blood. The Sinners passion, his Repentance is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> exactly like it, it begins alwayes with grief and sense of weight, whoever is regenerate was conceiv'd in sorrow, and brought forth with pangs, and <hi>the Child of God</hi> too is <hi>born weeping.</hi> And for loads, the Church when she does call us to shew forth this Death of Christ, as if she did prescribe that very Agony, requires that we should find that <hi>Garden</hi> at the <hi>Altar,</hi> makes us say <hi>we are heartily sorry for our misdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the remembrance of them is grievous unto us, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them is intollerable.</hi> So that the <hi>Sinner's Soul</hi> must be <hi>exceeding heavy</hi> too. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There he is betrayed by his own domestick, sold for the poorest price imaginable, as a <hi>Slave</hi> for <hi>thirty pieces of silver.</hi> I shall not mind you what unworthy things the love of Money does engage men to; to sell a <hi>Christ,</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and a <hi>God!</hi> and rather than stand out, at such a base rate, as we scorn to buy a <hi>sin</hi> at; every single act's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to Damnation, costs more than the Ransom of the world is sold for; and the Blood of God is purchas'd cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any one opportunity of vice does stand us in! But I onely mind you here, that he shall have a better hire that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> will but be a <hi>Judas</hi> to his own iniquities; do but betray thy Regent sins, deliver them up and thou shalt have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Heaven.</p>

triumphing in the Blood of God: To see those dire instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the deservings of a Sinner, those amazing prelusions to his expectations; and consider it was easier for God to execute all this upon his Son than suffer sin to go unpunisht. Indeed they make all that is real in the whole account they give of satisfaction made to God for sin to consist in this, that <hi>the temporal Death of Christ</hi> (which God by vertue of his absolute Dominion may inflict on the most innocent, taking away that which himself had given, especially since Christ who had that right over his own life, which none else had, did of his own accord submit to it; and he <hi>laid down his life,</hi>

                     <hi>against Sin, and then might be accepted in the stead of their death, who were warned by that example; and affrighted from committing sin.</hi> And truly there is colour for it, for all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction seems either of a losse sustain'd, which is acquired by compensation, or the satisfaction of our anger, which is commonly appeased by the sufferings of the injurious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or else the satisfaction of our fears and doubts, that we may be secure not to sustain the like again, which is most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> likely to be best provided for by punishment: For sure one will not venture upon that which he must suffer for the doing.</p>
                  <p>Now of all these the first, the satisfaction of <hi>compensation,</hi> as it cannot properly be made to God who could sustain no real diminution by Man's sin: For <hi>though thy wickednesse</hi> saith <hi>Job, may hurt a man as thou art, yet if thou sinnest</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so also it were easie to demonstrate that this one example does exalt more of Gods attributes, and to a greater height, than either if his Law had been obey'd or executed, if that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were our business, or if this sort of satisfaction did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong onely to the offended party, not the supreme Judge or Governour as such, under which notion God is here to be considered. As neither does the second satisfaction, that of <hi>anger,</hi> the Judge being to be like his Law, that hath no passions or affections. And truly since the things that do satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our angers and revenges are no real goods, the satisfactions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of them are unnatural, and therefore surely not Divine: Monstrous appetite that hath learnt to desire mischief, hath also taught us to delight in misery, and be satisfied with the griefs of others, which being nothing to us cannot be our

good: And although we are stil'd Children of Wrath, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> if our portion were to be onely plagues, our inheritance perdition, and the fearful issues of Gods Fury: Yet since to be angry signifies in God no more than this, to testifie what great abhorrency he hath to sin, how contrary to him, how not to be indur'd it is: It was impossible for God when he had once resolv'd to pardon sin, to testifie that more than by resolving not to pardon it without such an example; so that it did satisfie his anger perfectly. But all true satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lyes in the <hi>provision that is made by punishment against future offences.</hi>

                  <p>This is that which the <hi>Magistrate</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> requires, <hi>nec enim irascitur, sed cavet;</hi> for by Punishment they cannot call back the offences that are past, undo or make them not have been: but they can make men not to dare to doe them again, nor others by their example.</p>
                  <p>This is the end why they annex Penalties to their Laws, expresly said so <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 20. Which end therefore when they attain by Punishment, the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Magistrate</hi> is <hi>satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> For it is not so much the Death of the Offender that is satisfaction of the Law, as the Example of Terror that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> gives; and therefore humane Lawgivers have oft thought fit to change the Penalty; and where Death was appoynted, to assign other sufferings that consist with Life, and prolong Misery and Terror, as Proscription, and the Gallies <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Accordingly to propose an Example of Terror to us, God laid all the severe inflictions of the Passion-day upon his own Son. Now it is evident that the example of a Man suffering for the breach of Lawes does certainly hedge in those Lawes, keep them more safe from violence; therefore we see those Laws are best observ'd which the Magistrate's Sword does most guard; and Experience would quickly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> make it good, a Land would prove but a meer Shambles, and a Man's life cheaper than a Beast's, if <hi>Murtherers</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellists</hi> shall get impunity more easily than he that <hi>steals an Horse</hi> or <hi>Sheep.</hi> When on the other side, that Nation from whom we most receive the <hi>fashions</hi> of our <hi>vices</hi> also, whom the <hi>honour of that sin</hi> is most peculiar to; though they seemed to value it above Estate, and Life, and Family, and Soul, yet we know could be beaten from it by some sharp examples. And then when our Lawgiver, as he spoke his Laws at first with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Thunder and with Lightning, as if they brought their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence along with them, and the very promulgation was a copy and example of their Execution: So also he did write those Laws in Blood, to let us see what does await transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:109439:82"/>
how he that spar'd not his own dear Son, will certainly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not spare any impenitent, this could not choose but have some influence, if 'twere consider'd. Should we call to mind the kindnesse God had at this time to lost Man, how he so long'd to pity him, that he resolv'd not to pity himself; how yet in all those turnings of his bowells within him, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings over Man, when his Compassion was at such an height as to give his well beloved Son to satisfie for our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions; in the midst of all those inclinations to us, at that very time how yet he did so hate our sins, that nothing else could satisfie him, but <hi>the Blood of God:</hi> How he made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Son of God <hi>empty himself</hi> of his Divinity and of his Soul, and all to raise a sum onely to purchase one example of that Indignation that attends a Sinner; it will be easie then to recollect how insupportable that Wrath will be to the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent in the Day of his fierce Anger; when he shall have no kindness left for them, but the Omnipotence of Mercy will become Almighty Fury: Who shall be able to avoid or to endure the issues of it? shall I think to scape them when he spared not his Son? or shall I venture upon bearing that to all Eternity which that Son was not able to support <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> some hours? Thus as S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses, <hi>God sending his own Son in the likenesse of sinful flesh,</hi> a Sacrifice <hi>for sin, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sin in the flesh,</hi> that is he shewed what did await iniquity, that men by so great an example of his Wrath, might be frighted from the practise. <hi>Et si quis morte Christi admonitus paniteat, iste per mortem Christi peccato mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And now though I propose not this as if I thought this Reason were sufficient of it self, which seems to give no good account how any could be ransomed e're Christ suffered: (which yet certainly they were, the vertue of his Death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to all former Ages, as is proved most evidently <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 25. a place which <hi>Crellius</hi> himself does give no satisfaction to) if the satisfaction of his Death consisted onely in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Example, it could no more satisfie for the sins of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Ages, than it could be an Example e're it was in being: If that Death were accepted in the stead of their death, who by that Example are frighted into Repentance, what was accepted for their sins, who had no such vision of it, as that

Yet to them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that have beheld it in its vigour, they that can controul this check to vice, and when to shew us an Example it cost God the life of his own Son, after the prospect of whose Cross he hath not any Terrour to propose, this being the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Divine mind, and the stresse of all his most Almighty Attributes conjoyn'd in one compounded Miracle, can yet make all this vain and fruitlesse and have no effect, are nor feared nor warned by it; but as if it signified no peril to their sins, they can come once a year to entertain themselves with the Example and go from the Agonies uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the sins that inflicted them, and that shew forth themselves in them: Who act as if those were the onely soft and pleasant things that crusht his Blood and Soul out, as if those which did make the Son of God cry out as if he did almost despair, were the onely fit things to make men jolly: And do thus as they did it in despite to this great method of Salvation, as if they did <hi>enjoy the indignation and the wrath of God,</hi> as if those <hi>Agonies</hi> like the other <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> of their sins did more provoke to them, or like the <hi>Paschal bitter herbs</hi> that typified them, were as <hi>sawce</hi> to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Ryots of their vices.

                  <p>By <hi>Spirit</hi> here is meant that disposition and complexure of Christian Piety and Vertues, that course and Method of Religion which the Spirit does prescribe to Christ's Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and does guide them in; or in a word, <hi>the temper of the Gospel</hi> is so called: And this in opposition to <hi>the Law,</hi> the difference of these being exprest by a diverse manner of <hi>Spirit;</hi> the one is called <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note>

                  <p>First, To destroy Mens lives, or other temporal rights on this account meerly, because they are <hi>Apostates, Schismaticks,</hi> or otherwise <hi>reject the true Religion,</hi> or <hi>Christ himself,</hi> is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the temper of the Gospel. This is that which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Christ reproves here, telling them that would do so, <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because the <hi>Spirit of Elias,</hi> which the <hi>Gospel Christian Spirit</hi> here is set in opposition to, oppos'd the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,</hi> destroy'd those that came commission'd from the Prince, and Christ designedly does say ye must not do now what <hi>Elias</hi> did, therefore, to attempt upon or against the Magistrate, on the account of <hi>Christ,</hi> or of <hi>Religion,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the <hi>Spirit of the Gospel.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, of the first that to destroy mens lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here I must observe, that since these fiery Disciples that did give occasion for our Saviours rebuke, here were no Magistrates, nor did Christ himself that gave the rebuke
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109439:87"/>
assume, but <note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 12. 14. Joh. 18. 36.</note> renounce openly all such Authority; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> no observation grounded on these words can controul the Magistrates just power in punishing offences done against his Laws, although pretences of Religion and Conscience give colour to those offences; the Gospel does diminish no rights of the secular Powers: Now Supreme Magistrates, though as such they have no right to <hi>judge in Articles of Faith,</hi> to define what is true Religion, what not; for then the Pagan Princes who had never heard of Christ, and yet are as much Magistrates as any, would have right to judge what Doctrines Christ delivered down to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But certainly when Christ Commission'd his Faith to run through all the World not onely independently from all the powers of it but in perfect opposition to them, they can have no right to judge in that, which whatsoever they shall Judge we are a like bound to receive (the Faith of Christ) without any the least difference to their judgment. But though they have no right to judge of this, they have <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to determine what Faith shall have the priviledges of their State and what shall not; which shall be publiquely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>and which they will inhibit with Penalties:</hi> For sure the Priviledges of the State and power of Penalties are the proper rights of the Supreme Power, and therefore none but that can judge and determin of them. In a word, since it is most evident that the tranquility of a State does depend upon nothing more than the profession and priviledging of Religion; it follows that those Powers to whose Judgment and Decrees the care and Tranquility of the State is committed, must have the power to judge and to determine what Faith shall be publiquely profest and priviledg'd by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the State: In which Judgment and administration if they erre, and priviledge a false Faith and inhibit the true; they use their Powerill, and are responsible to God for doing so, but they do not invade or usurp a Power that is not their own. Rather 'tis most certain if the Principles of any Sect, or else if not they, yet the pursuance of any Principles do tend directly towards, or are found to work Commotions and Treasonable enterprises, the Supreme Power hath as much right to restrain, yea and Punish them, although with Death according to their several merits, as he hath to punish those effects in any other instances wherein they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> themselves.</p>
                  <p>Nor must Religion secure those practises which it cannot <hi>sanctifie,</hi> but does <hi>envenome.</hi> For by putting an everlasting
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109439:87"/>
concern into mens opinions and actions their undertakings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are made by it more desperate and unreclaimable. What wounds and what Massacres must the State expect from them that stab and murder it with the same Zeal that the <hi>Priest</hi> kills a <hi>Sacrifice?</hi> that go to act their Villanies with <hi>Devotion,</hi> and go to their own <hi>Execution</hi> as to <hi>Martyrdom?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twere easie for me to deduce the practise of this Power from the best Magistrates in the best times, if that were my businesse; who had onely this temptation to say thus much, that I might not seem to clash with the Magistrates Power of coercion in Religious causes when I did affirm, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that <hi>to destroy mens Lives or other temporal Rights on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count meerly because they are Apostates, Schismaticks, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise reject the true Religion, or Christ himself, is inconsistent with the temper of the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you would discover what the temper of the Gospel is, you may see it in its Prophecy and Picture in the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Isai. 11. 6, 7. &amp;c. &amp; 65. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lye down with the Kid, the sucking Child shall play on the hole of the Asp, and the weaned Child shall put his hand on the Cockatrice den, and the Serpent shall eat the dust.</hi> Whatever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> mischief these have in themselves, there's nothing of devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or of hurt to one another in this state; 'tis like <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise restor'd,</hi> the prospect of the Garden of the Lord.

                  </p>
                  <p>But to speak out of figure, the Gospel in it self requires not the Life of any for transgression against its self, it calls all into it, and waits their coming; those that sin against it, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> useth methods to reform, hath its Spiritual Penalties indeed, whereby it would inflict amendment and Salvation on offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors: But because final impenitence and unbelief are the onely <hi>breaches</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of this Religion, therefore it does wait till life and possibilities of Repentance are run out: and then its Punishments indeed come home with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, but not till then.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The temper of the Gospel is discovered in its Precepts. I shall name but one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 43, 44. <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour and hate thine Enemy: But I say unto you love your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c.

But, as the <hi>Jews neighbour</hi> was <hi>every one of his Religion,</hi> and he liv'd neer him that lived in the same Covenant with him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so <hi>enemy</hi> being oppos'd to that, must signifie one <hi>not of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> an <hi>Alien,</hi> an Idolater, with any of which they were indeed to have no exercise of love or friendship, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and to some Enemies, the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> no mercy, but they were to hate them to destruction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. If so, then our Saviours addition here, <hi>But I say unto you love your Enemies,</hi> does say that <hi>we must love even these;</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> hath no <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but the most profligated adversaries of his Religion he must love, and pray for them although they persecute him: (Which makes appear it does at least include <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Enemies of Religion, for Persecutions seldome were on any other ground, and Religion which should have nothing else but Heaven in it, as if it had the malice and the Flames of Hell, breaths nothing else but Fire and Faggot to all those that differ in it.) But whether it be an addition and mean thus or no, since it is sure that both they and we are bound to <hi>love the Neighbour,</hi> and Christ hath prov'd, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. that the <hi>Samaritane,</hi> he whom our two Disciples would consume, that <hi>Schismatick</hi> and <hi>rejecter of Christ</hi> is yet a <hi>Neighbour,</hi> therefore <hi>him</hi> also we must <hi>love</hi> and <hi>pray for.</hi> Now 'tis a strange way of affection to destroy them, to <hi>love</hi> them <hi>thus</hi>

                  <p>And now it is not hard to know <hi>what manner of Spirit</hi> our Church is of, even that <hi>Spirit</hi> that <hi>anoynts the Lords Anoynted,</hi> that is, which <hi>Commissions them, Gods Spirit,</hi> as we find it phras'd in Scripture: And 'tis obvious to each eye that there is much more resemblance betwixt present <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Image of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as S. <hi>John</hi> hath drawn it in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the <hi>Revelations,</hi> than there is of <hi>Babel</hi> and the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as to those Confusions which seditious Doctrines make, as the Romanists pourtrai'd her.</p>
                  <p>But far be it from me to conclude hence that all of their Communion do allow their Doctrines: Though they stand on the same bottom that their Faith of <hi>half Communion,</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> do; even <hi>Acts of the same Counsels,</hi> yet I doubt not multitudes of loyal Souls of this our Nation do abhorr the Tenents, by what Rule of theirs I know not I confesse.

                  </p>
                  <p>The words do willingly suggest occasion for several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, and some of those of the nicer and more curious kind, but truly I shall not attend to those suggestions, but shall choose to handle a few of the most obvious and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Considerations that the words break into, and they are three.</p>
                  <p>First, the Rich man's Charity to his Brethren, his unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied desire and care that they may be brought to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, expressed in these words, <hi>Nay Father Abraham,</hi> though <hi>they have Moses and Prophets,</hi> yet let them have <hi>one method</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, we have here his choice of that <hi>method,</hi> that which he thought would do though nothing else would; in these words, <hi>If one went unto them from the dead they will repent.</hi> In the handling of which, we shall examine what the grounds were upon which this Rich man was so confident that that would work upon them; and here we find he chose with several advantages.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>One from the dead;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That one <hi>Lazarus;</hi> and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, One <hi>out of Abraham's Bosom:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, One that had seen him also in his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and could <hi>testifie</hi> of them, <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have here these fancied hopes all dash't in <hi>Abraham's</hi> answer, <hi>And he said unto him, if they believe not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be perswaded though one rose from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First of the first, the Charitable, careful contrivances this Rich man in Hell had for his Brethren upon Earth: <hi>Nay Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is commonly reported of men who know themselves infected by the Plague, that they desire to infect as many others as they can; they contrive to spread the Contagion, and love society of Ruin; and we are sure it is so in that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:109439:95"/>
Plague of the Soul, <hi>Sin.</hi> This humour did not content it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> self to debauch <hi>Heaven,</hi> and unpeople <hi>Paradise,</hi> but all the Ages of the world make up its Triumph, and every sin that ever was, and misery that shall be, is its issue. <hi>Lucifer's</hi> pride would have a train of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Mankind</hi> to wait upon him in destruction: And in such an attendance, though to his everlasting cost, he does still pride himself; he feeds upon that envy that devours him, and cheers himself with adding fewel to his flames that do torment him; and upon this account <hi>enjoyes</hi> his <hi>own Agonies</hi> and <hi>God's Indignation:</hi> And then it is no wonder if his Agents upon Earth enjoy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the sport; and if the Devil does not more please himself to see his Dominions enlarg'd and the business of Hell go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than wicked men do in having others become like themselves; as if they did derive to themselves, and possess the pleasure; as they do the guilt of those whom they draw in; and the delight like the sin, were <hi>all in all, and all in every part</hi> of the whole Company that joyn in wickedness. But it should seem 'tis otherwise with the Sinners in Hell. Our Rich man here when he saw his own estate remedilesse, so vast a <hi>gulf</hi> betwixt him and the Bosom of Comfort, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not the least drop of refreshment, no not the hopes nor wishes of it could passe thence to him; but Torment sealed upon him by an irreversible Decree; he begins then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive for his Brethren, how their falling into the like estate with him might be prevented, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28. Nor satisfied with this, when <hi>Abraham</hi> replyes, they are provided well enough, <hi>they have Moses and the Prophets,</hi> the one Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law to them, whose <hi>Rules</hi> they have made as fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to them as their <hi>dresse,</hi> they <hi>put on</hi> daily Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and their duty; make his Precepts their <hi>front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi> and their <hi>wristbands.</hi> And the other the <hi>Prophets,</hi> are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Commissioned from God to lay before their eyes the issue of transgression, give them a <hi>vision</hi> of the Judgments that await their sins, and come to them burdned with the fore-knowledge of the sinners expectations; so that except they will resolve to choose destruction wilfully to assault their own perdition, there is no fear they should come thither; those tell them as much as any from the dead can do: Ah! but thinks he, all those methods I had, yet I am here; and then let them have one other; for as now after this little tast of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Torments were I to live again, I should most certainly avoid this place, and lead another kind of life than that which does expire into this <hi>Tophet;</hi> So if one went to tell them how it is with me, sure then they would repent and not come
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109439:96"/>
hither; therefore I pray thee send, <hi>Nay Father Abraham,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot here assent to Cardinal <hi>Cajetan's</hi> account that all this earnestnesse was onely pride in our Rich man, and a desire to have the glory of his Family advance'd; which as he laboured to raise here by Wealth, so now finding by sad experience that was but a weak foundation to build a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing House upon, and that all the shine of it was but false treacherous light, such as did end in flame with him; and having made discovery of other greater glorys, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> possest, he would have his Family as high <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and bright as they; and this their Repentance, which he took such care for, was but in order to that exaltation.</p>
                  <p>If it were so, truly it is the first pride I ever read of that would content it self with no meaner a dress than the Robes of Immortality, and was ambitious of the Throne of Glory. I have heard I confesse of a proud lowlinesse, where the humility is but the manage and the art of being lofty, is onely assum'd condescention whereby men but descend to be extol'd, and stoop to take advantage for their mount: But never heard of any pride that aimed to raise it self by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the humiliations of Repentance, that laid its groundwork in that dust and ashes, cloath'd it self in the sackcloth and neglected rudnesses of a pious penitent sorrow: The prides of this side Hell are of a different garb I'm sure, if theirs be such; if they design by those just means to settle the inheritance of Heaven in their familys, sure the <hi>vices of Hell</hi> may be fit patterns for our <hi>Religious performances,</hi> and 'twere to be desired that all Christians had this mans ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies and flames in their affections to their houses.</p>
                  <p>Yet neither can I from this one particular instance draw <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> any general proposition concerning the kindness of that place to sinners upon Earth, although all those that make this History not Parable would give me colour for it: But waving that, since Christ hath so framed the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (which is a relation of such words as they would have spoke had they spoke on this occasion) I shall take that as ground enough to apply it to the conviction of those who are so far from these Charitable designs to the Souls of others, that they contrive nothing more than how to have the company of their friends in those wayes that lead to this place of Torment; prevail with them to joyn in sinning, and shew a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vice how to insinuate into them.</p>
                  <p>The kindnesses of our man here in the flames were divine God-like Charities compared to these. Our Saviour sayes,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:109439:96"/>
                     <hi>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>unto you that in Heaven their Angels do alwayes behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven, Mat.</hi> 18. 10. Which one expounds, <hi>if we neglect to do what shall be in our power to preserve the meanest Christians from vice, and sleight their sinning, their Tutelary Angels that have continual recourse to God, and are high in his favour, will make complaints of us in their behalf,</hi> at least they will if we <hi>offend them,</hi> and any action of ours prove an <hi>occasion of their sins.</hi> And if a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Heaven shall accuse us to the Lord for that, Then how will he complain of us when we <hi>tempt?</hi> when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he shall have to say against us, that we have ensnared and drawn such a Soul into a Custome that will ruine it eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and when he shall bring against us an instance out of <hi>Hell</hi> here, and the kindnesses of one among the Devils shall come in Judgement against us; where we see the Rich man thought not of his own condemnation so much he thought of the averting that of his Brethren. We might suppose a man in his condition could not consider any thing but his own Tortures. O yes, to preserve others from them; yet, when the man in Hell does so, the men on Earth do think of nothing more than to entice others into them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> And is it not a strange Age then! when to tempt is the only mode of kindnesse, and men do scarcely know how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse themselves civil to their Friends but by pressing them to sin and so be sick with them? as if this were the gentile use of Societies, to season Youth into good Company, and bring the Fashionable Vices into their acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis well if they stay there; it happens so that Parts and Wit, Faculties and Acquisitions do ingratiate men into these treacherous kindnesses, and qualifie them for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and friendships of such persons as entertain them by softning them into <hi>loosnesse</hi> and then into <hi>prophannesse;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch their <hi>manners,</hi> and then their <hi>Principles;</hi> teach them to sport themselves with <hi>Vice,</hi> and then with <hi>Holy things,</hi> and after with <hi>Religion it self;</hi> which is a greater <hi>Luxury</hi> than that their Ryots treat their Appetites withall, the <hi>Luxury of wit.</hi> And thus they educate them into <hi>Atheisme,</hi> and these familiar Devils are call'd Acquaintances and Friends: And indeed the Companions in sin a man would think should be dear friends, such as pour an heart into one another in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> common Cups, shed Souls in their Lusts, are friends to one another even into ruine, and love to their own Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are kind beyond the <hi>Altar-flames,</hi> even to those <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fires;</hi> such communications certainly cement affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109439:97"/>
so that nothing can divide them: And let them do so, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but <hi>Lord send me the kindnesse of Hell rather,</hi> one that will be a friend like this man in his Torments, that with unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied cares minded the reformation of his Friends, <hi>Nay Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent;</hi> which brings me to the <hi>Choice,</hi> the second part.</p>
                  <p>If a Ghost should indeed appear to any of us in the midst of our Commissions, it would certainly hurry us from our enjoyments; and there are no such tyes and unions by which the advantages of sin do hold us fixt and joynted to them, but the shake and tremble we should then be in, would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> loosen and dissolve them all, and make us uncling from them, if we may believe discourses that tell us such a sight is able to startle a man however he be fixt by his most close Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for what the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to say, <hi>we shall dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have seen an Angel of the Lord from Heaven,</hi> most men do fear if they should see the <hi>Spirit of a dead man from the Earth.</hi> Indeed the affrights which men do usually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at the meer apprehension of such an apparition, do probably arise from a surprise, in being minded hastily of such a state for which they are not then prepared so as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> would wish or hope to be, to which they think that is a call, for <hi>we shall dye</hi> said the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not to ask the reason of this now, but find the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why our Rich man thinks when <hi>Moses and the Prophets</hi> cannot make a man repent, such a <hi>Ghost</hi> should: We have it <hi>v.</hi> 28. they do but <hi>discourse</hi> to us, but one from the dead could <hi>testifie,</hi> he could bear witnesse that it is so as they say, speak his own sight and knowledge, and therefore though <hi>they hear not Moses and the Prophets, yet if one went unto them from the dead they will repent.</hi> For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, one from the Dead could testifie that <hi>when we dye we do not cease to be;</hi> and he would make appear that our departing hence is not annihilation, and so would dash the hopes of <hi>Epicures,</hi> such as I was, and I may fear they are; who as they live like Beasts do think to dye so too; and who are <hi>rational</hi> in this alone that they desire to be but <hi>Animal.</hi> And all the rest of men whether worldly or sensual, that enclose their desires and enjoyments within this life, and above all the <hi>Atheist</hi> that dares not look beyond it, all these would be convinc'd by such an evidence. Indeed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this would take away the main encouragement of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse, which upon little reasonings how thin soever, that there's no life after this does quicken and secure it self,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109439:97"/>
                     <hi>Wisd.</hi> 2. and therefore every Sect of men that did prescribe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Morality did teach an after life, nothing was more believ'd among the Heathen; Their Tribunal below, where three most severe Judges were appointed, meant the same thing with our <hi>last Assize,</hi> and their <hi>Elizian fields</hi> were but <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Paradise,</hi> their <hi>Phlegethon,</hi> River of Fire, was set to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse our <hi>stream of Brimstone flame:</hi> Thus <hi>Resurrection in fable made them vertuous;</hi> the ghesse at it made <hi>Socrates</hi> dye chearful, and though his hopes had <hi>faint</hi> weak Principles they had <hi>Heroick</hi> almost <hi>Martyr resolutions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on the other side, of those that among them deny'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> an after life, though we are told that <hi>Epicurus</hi> was a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, yet his Sect did give name to Vice; and is still the expression for it, and all that did espouse the Tenents of it, did the vices too; the <hi>Sadduces</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> are call'd <hi>Epicures,</hi> not onely for opinions sake, because they did make <hi>God a body,</hi> and totally <hi>denyed his</hi>

And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> very probably it might have taken; for upon such Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'tis hard not to resolve to change, for who is he that can resolve thus with himself, <hi>well I will now content my self with everlasting Condemnation and this sin, for I see they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, now this I cannot leave therefore let the other come;</hi> they that were once affected with the apprehensions of the greatnesse and the certainty of that Damnation cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve thus, and therefore we see fewer men adventure to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress <hi>Man's Law,</hi> whose Punishment is neer and most assur'd, than <hi>God's Commandments.</hi> And when their fears of the Lords <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Judgments stare them in the face, they quickly tremble into the terrours and the agonies of Penitence. For who dares sin, and who does not repent upon his Death-bed? he sinks at the remembrance of his former draughts, when he does apprehend his next is like to be in the Infernal Lake, he hath the frost of the Grave on him when he but thinks of his lascivious heats, and does think too that his hot lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bed will turn him off strait into <hi>Tophet:</hi> And then if <hi>Lazarus</hi> could raise these apprehensions in them, <hi>sure they would repent.</hi> 'Tis plain these were the grounds our Rich <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> man built this his request upon, I do not lay them as infallible, I make no question but that men are able to defie their knowledge, and charge through their own belief to sin and to destruction; but commonly men do not lay things deep

                  <p>I should now make reflections on this and our selves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and truly all this would bespatter fouly such as go on in a vice, for it does conclude concerning them that they do not believe Gods Truths, but in the midst of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of Religion are Infidels; 'tis plain they are so in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> acknowledgments of one of their own tribe, who in the anguish of his Torments does confesse this of them from his own experience: But worse things will appear when we have seen that God hath done all this to us with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage than this man in Hell did think sufficient, or indeed desire; which was my next undertaking, and I shall manage it in the same order.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>If one went unto them from the dead,</hi> sayes he, <hi>they will Repent.</hi> And now to answer that, <hi>Christ is come from the dead;</hi> an Article this is that made its way through all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Swords, and all the Racks, and torturing Engines that the powerful witty malice of a whole World could find out and execute: And shall it find its death among the softs and glories of its own victorious profession? when it was instant Ruine to acknowledge the belief of it, then myriads ran into the flames, at once to own and to partake <hi>Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:</hi> but now they that professe it are so well here in this Life, that in defiance of their own profession, they will not think there is another Life. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not out of Principle they doubt (as it were easie to demonstrate) but out of improbity: They have an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to severe Piety, and are uneasie under any thing that does engage to it, and must therefore work themselves out; and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109439:99"/>
here they storm; Unkind men to themselves! not onely in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> imprudence, who adventure all upon such hazards; but in disparaging themselves, who being men of reason, and that set it up to such an height as to make it contend with God, and dispute out his Power of raising them again, yet can think such a reasoning Soul was given them for no other end but to procure for, and to animate the organs of their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality. But this is dasht if <hi>Christ be risen,</hi> because <hi>His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection did make Faith that he would Judge the World in Righteousnesse, on purpose to make them Repent; Acts</hi> 17. 30, 31. So that this his first expectation is most fully answered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to us.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, if <hi>Lazarus</hi> would go, one out of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Bosom</hi> then <hi>they would Repent.</hi> And hath there not a <hi>greater</hi> than <hi>Lazarus</hi> been with us? one not out of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> but <hi>Gods Bosom?</hi> even the Son of his Bosom, one that himself prepar'd those Joyes for them that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him and obey him; one that from all Eternity <hi>enjoy'd</hi> them in the Bosom of the Divinity. And who could better reveal them to us than the Authour and the God of them? who knew them more than he that did create them and possess them? Yea when this Son of God would be Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and take Flesh, and was to carry it through all the Miseries that Sin deserv'd and God's Wrath could inflict, he thought these Joyes encouragement enough to do it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, these Pleasures were worth agonies which none but a God could suffer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. Now sure he that prepar'd these Joyes did understand them, and he that is the <hi>Word of God</hi> knew best how to reveal them too. And now how poor a wish was that of our Rich man? Let <hi>Lazarus</hi> go tell them: why a <hi>Person of the Trinity</hi> hath told us; indeed how could God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> do more than come himself to reveal the truth of them, and himself dy for them to reveal the greatness of them? Good God! that no body could serve thy turn to tell us of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of thy Bosom but the Son of thy Bosom! that thou shouldst think it worth an Incarnation to reveal them, and we not think it worth a little Reformation to have them; that he should part with Blood and give his Life for those Joyes, and we not be content to forsake a Custom, to give away the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of a Lust, the neither pleasures nor profits of an Oath, the sick delights of an Excesse, nor the vexations of a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in exchange for them! what will <hi>Hell</hi> say to us when one there said, if <hi>Lazarus will go they will repent?</hi> If</p>

in the deprecation of them? such a passion could not be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> prayed against with earnestnesse enough, but that that very earnestnesse will prove a passion: Yea and he <hi>goes again the third time and prays the same words,</hi> as if, if nothing else, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity should prevail, and when we shall consider that the Person doing this is the Son of God, to whom nothing could be truly insupportable, yet that he should not be able to bear sin; the weight of that we see makes him cry out <hi>My God, my God, why host thou forsaken me?</hi> as if God could forsake that person in whom the Godhead was of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Or indeed as if the condition did even separate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him and himself.</p>
                  <p>And now could any <hi>from the dead</hi> have given us such a frighting account? is there not as much warning in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, as if our selves had tasted all of it? for is it not more that these Torments should be so terrible to him than that they should be insupportable to us?

one would think we should take notice of their message, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hear them when they passe so near us, when they seem to call out to our selves, <hi>when a thousand do fall besides us, and ten thousand at our right hand;</hi> wherefore should not <hi>an Army of such Carcasses</hi> become as moving as one <hi>Ghost?</hi> should <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> come forth with all <hi>his sores,</hi> they would not be so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible as these <hi>carbuncles</hi> and <hi>ulcers of the Plague:</hi> And the <hi>destroying Angel</hi> out of <hi>Heaven</hi> with his Sword drawn, one would expect, should be as efficacious as a <hi>Preacher out of Abrahams Bosom.</hi> And yet men do not seem to hearken any more to these than they do to us, when we either Preach, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or which they think much lesse, when we read Scripture to them, that is, when <hi>they hear Moses and the Prophets.</hi> Men have the same security as to their sins which they had in the freest times, whatever fears possess them, they are not the fears of God, <hi>those that make men depart from evil,</hi> none of those that fright into Repentance; we have no Religious cares upon us now more than at other times, but Vice as if that also had a Sanctuary under <hi>the Lords wings,</hi> and might retire <hi>under his feathers to be safe,</hi> dreads no <hi>Terrours of the Night,</hi> nor <hi>Arrows of the Day,</hi> but walks as open and as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as ever. And now should we behold a mad man on his death-bed spending his onely one remaining minute in execrations; the paleness of a shrowd upon his face, but Blood and crimson Sins upon his tongue; the frost of the Grave over all his parts, but a lascivious heat in his discourse; in fine, one that had nothing left alive of him but his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; would not an horrour seize you at that sight? and the same frost possesse you but to hear him? and yet his madness is his excuse, and his disease his Innocence. Should we see one that had no other madness, no other sickness but his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sin do thus, would it not be more horrid? and is it not the same to see a Nation as it were upon its Death-bed, visited with all the treasures of Gods Plagues, his tokens on it, and every place and man in fearful expectations, and yet no allay of Vice? Wickednesse as outragious as ever? while it is thus, with what face can we beg of God to <hi>keep from us this Plague and grievous sicknesse?</hi> when we do onely mean to make this use of such indulgence, to cherish ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plague in our own hearts? What can we say to prove it would not be a mercy to us to be suddenly cut off, even in the midst of our iniquity? when by our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> going on in sin in the midst of Destruction, we make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if he should let us live, yet we would onely live to finish our iniquities: And longer time would have no
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:109439:102"/>
other use but to fill up a greater measure of sin. What <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> answer do we make to all these Messengers of Death that come so thick about us? what do we that may justifie Gods care in sending us so many warnings? But 'tis no Wonder if the onely neighbourhood of Death have not been able to prevail upon us; have you not seen one whom his own iniquity, or Gods immediate Hand, hath by a Sicknesse, or by some sad Accident cast to the very brink of Death, so as the Grave seemed to begin to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of him? and all his hopes sickned and dy'd? so, that recovery from that condition may be well, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 'tis in Scripture often called a Rising? have you not seen him in that state, when he supposed that sinning was now done with him, and the next thing was Judgment, when God's Tribunall seemed to be within his view, and Hell to gape for him as wide as the Grave, both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to receive their parts of him at the same time, and himself ready to divide himself into those two sad Habirations? With what effectuall Sermon will he then Preach to himself against his sins? and that you may be sure shall work upon him; he instantly resolves against his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Vices, he will not carry them along with him out of this Life, but cast them off as too sad dangerous Company, nor yet if God shall lend him life will he retain them, but it shall be a New Life which he will lead: And yet when God hath rais'd him up, after a while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his vomit, his Sins recover with his Body; he owes his Innocence but to his Weaknesse, nor is it more long liv'd; his holy purposes decay as his strength grows, and dye as soon as setled health does come: And he who never would commit the Sin again when he was Dying, mends into it again: And then what hopes is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> there in this mistaken Method? when we see men come themselves from the Dead unto themselves, yet cannot make themselves Repent. But if we are not all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, take a more spreading and more visible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. If ever one came from the Dead, this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> came thence: And by as great a Miracle of <hi>Resurrection.</hi> But where is the Repentance such a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle may have flattered our Expectations with, as I am confident the resolutions of it did in that sad dying state? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are not some men as violent in those <hi>wicked practises</hi> that <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited</hi> our former Ruine? and others in those cursed <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> that did <hi>inflict</hi> it, as they ever were? 'tis said by many that <hi>have evil will at Sion</hi> (and it is our concern to take a
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:109439:103"/>
care they speak not truth) that in the Church some that are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> risen up again have still the <hi>silence of the Grave upon them,</hi> and are as dumb, as if their mouth were yet full of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument Earth: And yet as if it were not full of Earth, nor had been satisfied with it in the Sepulchre, they gape still like the Grave that never can be satisfied. And we see others who as if this Resurrection were but a start out of a sleep, or lucid interval of former madnesse, have their hands rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy not onely to tear off the hair, the unessential accessary beauties of the Body of the Church and State, but to scratch the Face, pull out the Eyes, and tear open those Wounds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which their last fit of Fury did inflict, so to let Life out again. And as for the Community of the Nation, 'tis true we are as it were risen from the Grave, but have we not brought up with us the Plague sores? are not the Spots upon us still? the venome, ulcer, and infection about us? Yea more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Stench and Putresaction? such as Death and the Grave do add? and coming from the dead we will not yet part with these, but dresse our selves in those infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defiled grave-clothes, and <hi>rise into corruption,</hi> and so confute Gods Method of a Refurrection. 'twere happier <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if we would so far confute the Text, that coming our selves from the dead, we would renounce communion with all Deaths adherencies; begin the <hi>incorruptible,</hi> which shall be consummated when we shall rise again a Church triumphant: when <hi>Death shall be swallowed up in Victory,</hi> and neither <hi>Sin</hi> nor <hi>Repentance</hi> shall be any more, but Holinesse, and Life, and Glory too shall be Immortal and unchangeable.</p>

                  <p>First of the first Effect, <hi>This Child is for the Fall of many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I shall but onely name that way whereby many men set this Child for their own Fall, while they make his holy Time to be but a more solemn opportunity of sinning: We know many celebrate this great Festival with Surfeits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and Excesses, the usual appendages of Feasting; Oaths and Curses the ingredients of Gaming; Dallyance and Lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse the attendants of Sporting; of all which this seems as it were the <hi>Anniversary,</hi> a set time for their return. Thus indeed the <hi>Israelites</hi> did solemnize the Birth of their <hi>Idol-Calf, They sate down to Eat and Drink, and rose up to Play.</hi> And must we celebrate <hi>this Child</hi> too like that <hi>Calf,</hi> because <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 6.</note> he was born among <hi>Brutes?</hi> And must his Votaries also be of the <hi>Herd?</hi> And he live and be worship'd alwayes in a <hi>Stable?</hi> Because <hi>God</hi> became <hi>Man,</hi> must <hi>Men</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>Beasts?</hi> Is it fit to honour that Child with Iniquity and Loosnesse, that did come into the World upon designs of Holinesse, to settle a most strict Religion? Nothing can be more incongruous than this; and certainly there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Gods Counsel in it. But to you whose time seems no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a constant Festival, always hath the Leisure, and the Plenties, and the Sports of one, who as to these things keep a <hi>Christmass</hi> all your life, this Season as it does not seem to challenge those things to it self peculiarly, so I shall not now insist on them; but proceed to those ways by which <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> did Prophecy, <hi>This Child would be for the fall of many in Israel.</hi> And they are three,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This Child</hi> whom I but now declar'd <hi>God had prepar'd</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">v. 31. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>to be the Glory of his People Israel,</hi> yet his Birth was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, and his Life answerable to it shall be so mean and poor, and his Death so full of shame and curse, that these shall prove a <hi>scandal</hi> to his People, who shall be <hi>offended</hi> at them; and being prepossest with prejudices of a Pompous Royal <hi>Messiah,</hi> they will not believe in this, but reject a Saviour that comes upon those disadvantages, which will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> therefore prove occasions of falling to them.</p>
                  <p>That it was so is expresly said, <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a Chief Corner-stone, a stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 33. 1 Pet. 2. 6.</note>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:109439:104"/>
And that it was so upon this account is clear, the Great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ones cry out of him, <hi>This fellow we know not whence he is:</hi> They that seem'd to know whence did upbraid him with it, <note place="margin">Joh. 9. 29. Mar. 6. 3. John 7. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>Is not this the Carpenter?</hi> And therefore with a deal of scorn they question, <hi>Do any of the Rulers or the Pharisees believe in him?</hi> Yea Christ himself knew this would be so great, a Scandal, that in the 11 <hi>Chapter</hi> of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> in the close of many Miracles which he wrought on purpose to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> he adds <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>and blessed is he that shall not be offended in me.</hi> As if he thought his mean condition would prove a greater argument against him than <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his mighty Works were for him: And it were a vaster Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy to see the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World, the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> poor and abject; than to see one <hi>cure the Blind,</hi> and <hi>heal the Lame,</hi> and <hi>raise the Dead;</hi> and they might think they had a stranger Miracle to confirm their unbelief, than any he would work to make them believe in him.</p>
                  <p>And really, that the Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which the <hi>Prophets</hi> did expresse in terms as high as their own Extasies and Raptures, in transported words, as if it vied with Gods Dominion, both for extent and for duration, should prove <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> at last an Empire onely over <hi>twelve poor Fishermen and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans,</hi> and one of them a <hi>Traytor</hi> too: And that <hi>He</hi> that was born this <hi>King,</hi> should be born in a <hi>Stable;</hi> while he liv'd that he should not have an <hi>hole to put his Head in,</hi> nor his <hi>Corps</hi> in when he <hi>died,</hi> but his <hi>Grave</hi> too must be <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> this would startle any that did wait for the <hi>Redemption of Israel</hi> in those glorious expresses which the Prophets trac't it out in. To you indeed that are Votaries to <hi>this Child,</hi> are confirmed Christians, these seeming disadvantages can give no prejudice: However mean and abject his condition were, that cannot make you to despise him, who from that must needs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> reflect how dear you were to God, when for your sakes meorly he became so mean and abject. <hi>He became poor,</hi> saith <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 9.</note> S. <hi>Paul, that you through his poverty might be made rich:</hi> He was made the <hi>Child of Man,</hi> that you might be made <hi>Sons of God;</hi> it was to pay the price of your Redemption that he so <hi>emptied himself;</hi> thus he valued you; and men do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise meerly <hi>because,</hi> and <hi>by those measures</hi> that, they are <note place="margin">

But 'tis worth inquiry, why, since it was certain that for this <hi>this Child</hi> should be <hi>the fall of Israel,</hi> that for this they would reject
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:109439:105"/>
him; and the meannesse of his condition would prove an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> unremoveable obstruction to their belief, as it is to this day; Why yet he would choose to be born in a condition so in the utmost extream to his own nature, so all contradiction to his Divinity, and so seemingly opposite to the very end of his coming.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jew</hi> indeed will find no excuse for his Infidelity from this condition: For whatever that were, yet those <hi>Miracles</hi> that made the <hi>Devils</hi> to <hi>confesse</hi> him, brought conviction enough to make <hi>Jews inexcusable.</hi> And it was obvious to observe, that He who <hi>fed five thousand with five Loaves and two Fishes,</hi> till they left more than was set before them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 14. 19, 20, 21.</note> needed not to be in a condition of want or meanness, if it were not otherwise more needful he should not abound. <hi>God,</hi> that when <hi>be brought this first begotten Son into the World,</hi> said, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worship him,</hi> might have put him into an estate which all Mankind most readily would <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> have done homage to: As easily have drest his <hi>Person</hi> with a <hi>blaze</hi> of <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Splendor,</hi> as his <hi>Birthday</hi> with a <hi>Star;</hi> if there had not been necessity it should be otherwise. And such there was. For <hi>when the fulnesse</hi> both of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity was come,</hi> when Vice could grow no further, but did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> even cry for Reformation, and when the Doctrine that must come to give the Rules of this Reformation, was not onely to wage War with <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> with those desires which <hi>Constitution</hi> gives, but which <hi>perpetual universal Custom</hi> had confirmed; and which their Gods also, as well as Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did contribute to; which their <hi>Original sin,</hi> and their <hi>Religion</hi> equally fomented; for <hi>Vice</hi> was then the <hi>Worship</hi> of the world, <hi>Sins</hi> had their <hi>Temples, Theft</hi> its <hi>Deity,</hi> and <hi>Drunkennesse</hi> its <hi>God, Adultery</hi> had <hi>many,</hi> and to <hi>prostitute their bodies</hi> was most <hi>sacred,</hi> and their very <hi>Altar-fires</hi> did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> kindle these foul heats, whence Uncleannesse is so often call'd <hi>Idolatry</hi> in Scripture: And besides all this, when all the <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and all the power of the world were ingag'd in the belief and practise of this, and resolv'd with all their wit and force to keep it so. When it was thus, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that must come to oppose, controul, reform all this, must come either arm'd with <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> design to settle it self by <hi>Conquest,</hi> or come in a way of <hi>Meeknesse</hi> and of <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:</hi> The first of these <hi>Religion</hi> cannot possibly design, because it cannot aim to settle that by <hi>violence,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be <hi>forc't;</hi> and where 'tis <hi>force,</hi> is not <hi>Religion.</hi> One may as well invade, and hope to get a Conquest over <hi>thoughts,</hi> and put a <hi>Mind</hi> in <hi>Chains,</hi> and <hi>force</hi> a man to <hi>will
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:109439:105"/>
against his will.</hi> All such motives are incompetent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Doctrines; for however successful their force proves, yet it cannot prove the Doctrines true; for by that Argument it proves that Religion that it <hi>settles</hi> true, it proves that which it destroyes was true before, while it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd and had the Power. Had <hi>this Child</hi> come so, he had onely given such a testimony to the truth of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as <hi>Heatbenifave</hi> had before, and <hi>Turcisme</hi> hath since: He might indeed, have drown'd the wicked World again in another Deluge of their own Blood: But sure, never had reform'd it thus. Therefore that Religion, that must oppose the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Customes and the Powers of the World, upon Principles of Reason and Religion, must do it by <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> by <hi>doing good,</hi> (and which was necessary, then by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as the world stood,) by <hi>suffering evil:</hi> parting with all, not only the Advantages but the Necessaries of this life, and life it self too, where they stood in competition, and were inconsistent with mens duties, and their expectations: And by this means they must shew the world that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion did <hi>bring in a better hope</hi> than that, which all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 19.</note> pleasures, glories of this World can entertain and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus they did, and thus they did prevail. For the first Ages of the Church, were but so many Centuries of Men, that entertained Christianity with the Contempt of the World, and Life it self. They knew that to put themselves into <hi>Christ's</hi> Service and Religion, was the same thing as to set themselves aside for spoyl and Rapine, dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Poverty and Scorn, to Racks, and Tortures, and to Butchery it self. Yet they enter'd into it; did not only renounce the Pomps and Vanities of the World in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Baptism, when they were new born to God; quench their affections to them in those waters; but renounc'd them even to the death; drown'd their affections to them in their own heart blood: ran from the world into flames, and fled faster from the satisfactions and delights of Earth, than those flames mounted to their own Element and Sphere: In fine, they became <hi>Christians</hi> so, as if they had been <hi>Candidates of death,</hi> and onely made themselves <hi>Apprentises of Martyrdom.</hi> Now if it were not possible it should be otherwise than thus, as the world stood, then it was necessary that the <hi>Captain of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 10.</note> should lead on, go before this <hi>noble Army of Martyrs;</hi> if it were necessary that they must <hi>leave all who followed him,</hi> then it was not possible that he should be here in a state of Plenty, Splendor, and Magnificence; but of Poverty, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:109439:106"/>

                  <p>I am not so vain as to hope to perswade any from this great Example here to be in love with Poverty, and with a low condition, by telling them this Birth hath consecrated mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that we must not scorn those things in which our <hi>God</hi> did choose to be install'd; that <hi>Humility</hi> is, it seems, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dresse for <hi>Divinity</hi> to shew it self in.

                  <p>But it stayes not there; For Secondly, Upon the same account of strictnesse of Religion, men will fall off from and openly renounce both Christ and his Religion. This is that our Saviour himself found, <hi>Light,</hi> saith he, <hi>is come</hi>

                  <p>And if I should affirm, that it is nothing else but mens unwillingnesse to be obliged to those things, which if there be a <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Religion</hi> which this <hi>Child</hi> was set to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, they must account themselves obliged to; nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> else I say but this, which makes them so <hi>unwilling to believe a God or Christ;</hi> yea, openly renounce them both, and their Religion; I should have for proof of this, not only the late instance of a Nation in the <hi>Indies;</hi> which, by insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <note place="margin">Congo.</note> of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> was easily perswaded to embrace the Christian Creed, and was Baptized into our Faith; but when they were required to lead their lives according to Christs Precepts, and renounce their <hi>Heathen Licences,</hi> they chose rather to renounce their <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned instantly to their indulgent <hi>Heathenisme.</hi> But to this experience, give me leave to add this Reason, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is not the Difficulty of the <hi>Misteries of Faith,</hi> and their being above our Comprehension, which makes them not to be receiv'd; because there are as great difficulties in things that we are certain of. For in the very <hi>Sphere</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> within the lines and measures of her own <hi>Infallibility,</hi> in things of which she does assure her self by <hi>diagrams</hi> and <hi>sense,</hi> yet she is as much amaz'd, as at those objects in the highest and remotest Regions of <hi>Faith;</hi> and <hi>Mathematicks</hi> hath her <hi>Paradoxes</hi> that stand in as great danger of a contradiction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as any of <hi>Religions</hi> Mysteries; while Reason cannot cape <note place="margin">Myster.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:109439:108"/>
And then sure if we can think there is a <hi>God,</hi> we must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> needs think <hi>He</hi> can do things which we cannot comprehend, when it is plain our Reason cannot comprehend what she her self does find out and creat. It is not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to <hi>Reason,</hi> but to <hi>Appetite,</hi> that makes things of <hi>Religion</hi> so <hi>incredible;</hi> which I thus demonstrate to the <hi>Atheist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those very difficulties, to avoid which he <hi>denies</hi> a <hi>God;</hi> to wit, <hi>Those of an Eternal Being that is of himself;</hi> those very things he <hi>must</hi> and <hi>does acknowledge</hi> in the being of the <hi>World,</hi> if that either be it <hi>self</hi> Eternal (as the <hi>Atheist</hi> of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Tribe will have it) or else if its <hi>atomes,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> out of which it was concreted, were: (As those of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> herd assert.) In a word, if they say the <hi>World</hi> or its <hi>materials</hi> were made, they grant a <hi>God</hi> that made it; If they say they were <hi>not made,</hi> they assert then an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being of its self;</hi> that is, they allow those difficulties for which they pretend to <hi>deny a God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There being therefore the same difficulties, (Greater I could prove them, from the diverse natures of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and spiritual beings; for we are sure, in <hi>bodies</hi> that are still in <hi>motion,</hi> and so subject to <hi>succession,</hi> those things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are impossible; but if there be a <hi>Being</hi> that is <hi>not in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and by consequence, not subject to the <hi>laws</hi> of <hi>our time,</hi> all these knots unty themselves, those difficulties vanish and have no place: But to say no more than I have shewed, <hi>there being the same Difficulties,)</hi> in the <hi>Atheist's hypothesis</hi> as in the <hi>other,</hi> 'tis apparent, not the <hi>difficulties</hi> of <hi>belief,</hi> but <hi>practise,</hi> make him fix upon his own against the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions</hi> of the World. So that 'tis not his <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but his <hi>Appetite</hi> frames his <hi>hypothesis;</hi> and without fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, 'tis his <hi>Will</hi> that he believes with. And it is most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> evident, that because men do not love the Precepts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would not have them be their <hi>duty,</hi> therefore they would have the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of it not be <hi>truths;</hi> and in this they are the Disciples onely of their Lusts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot resolve to be otherwise, therefore they resolve not to be <hi>Christ's Disciples,</hi> but reject him for his holy Doctrines sake: And so <hi>this Child is for the fall of many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it were strange if upon this account, Christ should be for the fall of any of us; who have learnt a trick to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> reconcile his <hi>severe Doctrines</hi> and our <hi>Sins</hi> together. Where Vice most abounds, though it be wilful, and men persevere in it, they are so far from finding any reason to <hi>fall off from

him,</hi> or from his <hi>Gospel</hi> for this, that they therefore take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the <hi>faster hold of it,</hi> rely upon Him with the <hi>bolder, stronger confidence.</hi> As if good old <hi>Simeon</hi> were mistaken, when he thought, because men would not leave those sins which Christ so threatned, therefore they would leave him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not bear those his hard sayings, to <hi>pull out</hi> the <hi>lust</hi> and the <hi>Eye too; cast away the treasures of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse,</hi> and the <hi>right hand</hi> that receives them also; therefore they would cast off him: For, for this reason they betake themselves to him more eagerly, devolve and cast themselves upon him with assurance. Tis possible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that the new Christian'd <hi>Indians</hi> might believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves oblig'd to lead their lives according to the Vow that they had made in Baptisme, knew not how to live a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to be <hi>Christian Pagans;</hi> therefore they thought it absolutely necessary to renounce the one; and to reject <hi>Christ and his strict Religion was easier</hi> they thought. Our Saviour also might suppose, that when he brought <hi>Light</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, men would not receive that <hi>Light,</hi> because their deeds were evil: But our modern wickednesses that are of the true Eagle kind, are educated, bred up to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,</hi> and to <hi>defie</hi> the Light: Our deeds of Night have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> learnt to face both Sun and Men, yea and face the <hi>Sun of Righteousnesse,</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> of those <hi>flames that are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</hi> Our Saviour told the <hi>Pharisees</hi> indeed, <hi>that they repented not, that they might believe;</hi> for thinking it impossible they could assent to what he did affirm, except they would consent to what he did Command, He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought they were not able to Believe, because they would not purpose to amend. But there is nothing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult in this to us, who at the same time, are so perfectly resolv'd that every threat of Gospel is so <hi>Divine truth,</hi> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that we assure our selves, that we could be content to <hi>dye Martyrs</hi> to the truth of them, rather than renounce one tittle of them; yet even then are <hi>Martyrs</hi> to those <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> which those Threats belong to: Who, at once, believe this Book of God, that sayes, <hi>except ye repent ye shall all perish;</hi> and believe also, that notwithstanding <note place="margin">Luke 13. 3.</note> we do not Repent, yet by <hi>Believing</hi> we shall <hi>scape;</hi> not perish, but be saved, And is not this directly to believe our selves into <hi>Damnation?</hi> the <hi>third</hi> and the <hi>great fall,</hi> which <hi>his Child is set for.</hi>

                  <p>And then, if by how much greater Light and means we have resisted, we shall be proportionably <hi>more vile</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of doing so; keep at equal rates of distance from those <hi>Heathens,</hi> that the aggravations of our guilt stand at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> from theirs; Whether, <hi>alas!</hi> are we like to fall?</p>

                  <p>Consider whether men do not declare <hi>they like not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain God in their thoughts,</hi> when they endeavour to <hi>dispute</hi> and to <hi>deride</hi> him too out of the World! 'Tis true, they have not set up any <hi>sins</hi> or <hi>monsters</hi> in their <hi>Temples</hi> yet, as they did: But if they can empty them of God and Christ, and their Religion, and make room, we may imagine easily <hi>whose</hi> Votaries they will be, that live as if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they thought themselves unhappy that they had not liv'd in those <hi>good Pagan dayes,</hi> when they might have <hi>sinned</hi> with <hi>devotion,</hi> been most wickedly Religious, and most <hi>God-like</hi> in <hi>unchastities</hi> and other Villanies; I dare say none of our <hi>fine Gentlemen,</hi> or our <hi>great Wits,</hi> would have been <hi>Atheists</hi> or <hi>irreligious</hi> then.</p>

                  <p>Now to bring about his ends upon us he hath several means. The first that I shall name is</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:109439:114"/>
nor use, in things that are against their mind, to apply the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Understanding close and strongly to reflect on those consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations which should move assent, and work belief. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations which I dare affirm, if with sincerity adverted to (if there be no improbity within to trash their efficacy, no sensual inclination cherish'd that must hinder their admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as not being able to endure to lodge in the same breast with those persuasions) would make disbelief appear not onely most <hi>imprudent,</hi> but a thing next to impossible. But in those that give themselves no leisure, have no will thus to advert, 'tis not strange if, <hi>through Satans arts,</hi> in things of this remote kind they have onely <hi>languid opinions,</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sink quickly into <hi>doubts,</hi> and by degrees into flat <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> does setch the rise of unbelief of Christianity from hence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; In whom the God of this World hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their minds:</hi> That is, if the Christian Doctrine do not appear to be the truth of God to any, 'tis to obstinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons onely, whom the Devil hath besotted so with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and pleasures of this World, that their affections to these will not let the other be admitted.

                  </p>
                  <p>That Carnal prejudice can cast a mist before the mind, or that a bright and glittering Temptation of this World may dazle it so as that it cannot see that which is most illustriously visible, we have this demonstration.</p>
                  <p>Those Works which Christ and his Apostles wrought, which made the whole World that was <hi>Heathen</hi> then, so many Millions of such distant Nations as could never meet together to conspire an universal change in their Religions, made them yet agree to lay aside their <hi>dear gods</hi> and their dearer Vices, and do that to embrace a <hi>Crucified Deity,</hi> a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God put to a vile ignominious death, as one <hi>worse</hi> than the <hi>worst of men;</hi> and a Religion that was as much <hi>hated,</hi> count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>accursed</hi> as that God of it, <hi>He</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine</hi> crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alike; and a Religion too that had as great severities in its Commands as in its Persecutions, that did it self enjoyn as hard and cruel things to flesh and blood as they that hated it inflicted, the <hi>duties</hi> and the <hi>punishments</hi> equally seem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on its followers; and a Religion whose performances had no retributions here but fatal ones, no otherwise reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but with <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>faggot,</hi> and whose after-promises were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> most incredible: Those <hi>Works</hi> that could produce all this, had certainly <hi>Omnipotent conviction</hi> in them; sure we are there must be prodigie of <hi>Miracle</hi> either in the <hi>causes,</hi> or in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:109439:115"/>
the <hi>effect.</hi> And yet the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> are not wrought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> on by them. Their carnal Prejudices would not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not by the <hi>Finger of God:</hi> The mean and despicable, and, as to all their worldly expectations and affections, the unsatisfying condition of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> had so clouded all his Works, and their own pride so blinded them, that they could see no <hi>argument</hi> in <hi>Miracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now 'tis the Devil, that <hi>God of the World,</hi> that hath the power of its Glories, and the managery of its temptations, who, by raising these affections, dazles so and blinds the minds of men, that they should not believe. S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it: And 'tis plain that <hi>unbelief</hi> is no one's Interest but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's. For it is not Man's. Not the vertuous man's certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: He's concern'd as much as Happinesse amounts to, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a <hi>God,</hi> whose <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Providence watch</hi> over him, whose Ears and Armes are <hi>open</hi> to him, whose <hi>Bowels yearn</hi> for him, whose <hi>Blood</hi> did <hi>purchase</hi> him, whose everlasting Blessednesses do await him. 'Tis his Interest to trust that <hi>Vertue,</hi> which the World so scorns or pitties, was yet worthy God should be <hi>Incarnated</hi> to teach it, <hi>die</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie us into it, and will <hi>raise</hi> us up again to <hi>crown</hi> it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is this Unbelief <hi>Man's real Interest,</hi> abstracting from these prejudices of Religion. For if it were <hi>Man's real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> then it were every man's wisest course to pursue that Interest. But if every man did so, and should persuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and that Religion and a Deity were but <hi>dreams</hi> or artifices, and so arrive so far as to have <hi>no fear of God,</hi> nor <hi>sense of Honesty</hi> or <hi>Vertue,</hi> the whole world must needs return into the first confusions of its <hi>Chaos: Villany</hi> and <hi>Rapine</hi> would have <hi>right.</hi> When those Mounds are thrown down, there is nothing that can hinder but that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> man may lawfully <hi>break in upon</hi> and <hi>invade every thing.</hi> There is no fence to guard thy Coffers nor thy Bed, no nor thy very Breast: Rather indeed there can be nothing thine. This is, 'tis true, <hi>Leviathan's state of Nature;</hi> and 'tis so indeed with the <hi>Leviathans</hi> of Sea and Land, the wild Beasts of the Deep and of the Desert. But to prevent the necessary and essential mischiefs of this state amongst us Men, he will have Nature to have taught us to make <hi>Pacts</hi> and <hi>Oaths:</hi> But if there's no such thing as <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> then there is no obligation to <hi>keep</hi> Pacts or Oaths. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> why should he observe them that can safely break them? <hi>Here</hi> it is indeed that <hi>Doctrine ends;</hi> to this their <hi>Infidelity</hi> does tend. And therefore 'tis no Interest of <hi>States</hi> or <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> This the <hi>Atheist</hi> will confesse; <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi> he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:109439:115"/>
sayes, were invented for the meet <hi>necessities</hi> of Governours, who could not be secure without those higher Obligations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and these after-fears. And are they not <hi>kind Subjects</hi> then who, by promoting Atheisme, labour to break down that fence which themselves account <hi>necessary?</hi> Or are they not good rational Discoursers too, who labour to throw out a thing as <hi>false</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> because 'tis <hi>necessary?</hi> So necessary sure, that they who weaken these bonds of <hi>Religion,</hi> quite dissolve those of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> all whose Sinews are made of those Sacred Ties, which if you untwist, the other Cords are burst as easily as <hi>threads of Cobweb.</hi> Nay these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines lay Principles that justifie <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>King-killing.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For if there's no such thing as <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> then those are no Crimes. And it is no wonder <hi>Treason</hi> hath been loved, when <hi>Blasphemy</hi> hath been so. They that hear men <hi>droll</hi> on <hi>God Almighty, raille</hi> their <hi>Maker,</hi> and <hi>buffoon</hi> with <hi>Him,</hi> will quickly learn to speak with little reverence of their <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</hi> There's no Kingdom but the <hi>Devil's</hi> that can have support from <hi>Infidelity;</hi> 'tis the Interest of that indeed.

strengthens every sort of Wickednesse: By the steps and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> degrees of <hi>Infidelity</hi> men ascend towards the heights of sin: And when they have surmounted all Religious apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then they are upon the Precipice of Vice.

When God, either for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> prevention, as 'twas there, <hi>v.</hi> 7. or for exercising or illustrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Graces, or some other of his blessed ends, gives a man up to the affaults of Satan, he is often pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the temptation long; but in that case he does never fail to send assistances and aids enough against it. <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee,</hi> saith he to S. <hi>Paul</hi> there. And when he will have us tempted for his uses (if we be not failing to our selves) he does prevent our being overcome; so that there is no danger in those Trials from their stay. But yet it must not be denyed but that the Devil does prevail <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> sometimes by importunacy, and by continuance of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so that <hi>Resistance</hi> is not alwayes a <hi>Repulse,</hi> at least not such an one as to make him draw off and flie. It is not strange to find him fiding with a <hi>natural Inclination,</hi> with the <hi>bent of Constitution,</hi> still presenting Objects, laying Opportunities, throwing in Examples, and all sorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, alwayes pressing so, that when a man hath strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led long he does grow weary of the service, not enduring to be thus upon his guard perpetually, watching a weak heart which strong inclinations, busie Devils do lay fiege <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to; and so growing slack and carelesse, he is presently sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised: Or else, despairing that he shall be alwayes able to hold out, lays hold upon a tempting opportunity, and yields; by the most unreasonable and basest cowardise that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:109439:121"/>
can be, yields, for fear of yielding; lest he should not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hold out, he will not, but gives up; and puts himself into that very Mischief which he would avoid, meerly for fear of coming into it. For which fear there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son neither: For 'tis not here as in our other Sieges, where, if it be close, continuance most reduce men to necessity of yielding, Strengths and Amunitions will decay, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions fail, and, if the Enemy cannot, their own Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will break through their Walls, and make avenues for Conquest, time alone will take them; but in these Spiritual Sieges, one Repulse inables for another; and the more we have resisted, the Temptation is not onely so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> much flatter, and more weak and baffled, but the inward Man is stronger: Victory does give new forces, and is sure to get in fresh and still sufficient supplies.

                     <hi>they shall have abundance,</hi> saith our Saviour. So that where the Devil after several repulses still comes on with fresh assaults, we may be sure he does discern there is some trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous inclination that sides with him: And although the man refuse himself the satisfaction of the sin, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil sees he hath a mind to it, his refusals are but faint, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hearty; though he seem afraid to come within the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Vice, he keeps, it may be, correspondence with the incentives to it, entertains the opportunities, plays with the objects, or at best he does not fortifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Now this gives the Tempter hopes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites his assaults, and does expose the person to be taken by him.</p>
                  <p>But where he sees he is resisted heartily, his offers are received with an abhorrency, discerns Men are in earnest, watch to avoid all opportunities and occasions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and fortifie, and arm against him, there he will not stay to be the <hi>triumph of their Vertue.</hi> We may know this by his <hi>Agents,</hi> those that work <hi>under the Devil,</hi> whom he hath instructed in the <hi>mysteries of waging his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Where they are not like to speed (and as to this they have <hi>discerning spirits)</hi> they <hi>avoid,</hi> and <hi>hate,</hi> and <hi>come not near,</hi> but study <hi>spite</hi> and <hi>mischief</hi> onely there. The intemperate men are most uneasie with a person whom they are not able to engage in the debauch; the <hi>rudeness</hi> and <hi>brutality</hi> of their excesses are not so offensive to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> man, as his <hi>staid Vertue</hi> is to them; they do not more avoid the crude egestions, shameful spewings of their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken fellows Riot, than they do the shame and the reproach
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:109439:122"/>
that such a man's strict Conversation casts on them, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> does in earnest make them look more foul and nasty to themselves. In fine, every Sinner shuns the Company of those whom he believes Religious in earnest; 'tis an awe and check to them; they are afraid, and out at it, as their <hi>Great Master</hi> also is, who when he is resisted must be overcome: And as they that are beaten have their own <hi>fears</hi> also for their Enemies, which are sure to charge close, put to flight, chase and pursue them; so it seems he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is afraid of a sincere and hearty Christian, for he flies him: So he did from <hi>Christ,</hi> 4. <hi>Mat. vers.</hi> 11. and so the Text assures, If you <hi>resist</hi> him, <hi>he will flie from</hi>

                     <hi>grieved him</hi> so that he forsake and leave them utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

As if they knew not that to those who <hi>close their eyes</hi> and <hi>stop their ears</hi> against the Holy Spirit's motions, till they are grown <hi>dull of hearing</hi> and <hi>blind</hi> to them, God does send a <hi>spirit of slumber, that they should not see nor bear;</hi> and that for this dire reason, <hi>that they may not be converted, nor be saved.</hi>

Is it so easie for such sinners to <hi>believe</hi> and be <hi>converted,</hi> that thy self shouldst interpose to hinder it, and hide the possibilities of mercy from their eyes, that they may never see them, nor recover! What can then become of those for whom God does contrive that they shall not escape? when instead of those bowells that did make him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

                  <p>And yet all this is onely to those men, who, being <hi>dull of hearing</hi> the suggestions of the Spirit, and not willing to give entertainment to his holy motions, <hi>grieve</hi> him so, that they repell and drive him quite away; and so by <hi>consequence</hi> onely make way for the Devil: Whereas there are others that <hi>directly call him, force</hi> him to them, <hi>ravish</hi> and <hi>invade</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> occasions to serve him. Some there are that <hi>study</hi> how to <hi>disbelieve,</hi> and with great labour and contrivance <hi>work</hi> out <hi>arguments</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> to persuade themselves to <hi>Atheisme:</hi> Others <hi>practise, discipline,</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> themselves to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in <hi>Vice.</hi> Some <hi>dresse</hi> so as to <hi>lay baits, snares,</hi> to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap Temptation,</hi> that they may be sure it may not passe them: Others <hi>feed high to invite and entertain the Tempter,</hi> do all that is possible to make him come, and to assure him that he must prevail, when they have made it most impossible for themselves to stand and to <hi>resist.</hi>

he sees they have great <hi>inclinations,</hi> with some <hi>fears,</hi> he is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> fain to persuade them to <hi>repent</hi> when they have done; to lay hold upon the present opportunity, and not let the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction escape them, but be sorry after, and amend. For where these resolutions of Repentance usher in transgression, there we may be sure it is the Devil that suggests those reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. But if he can get admittance once thus, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with a person to receive him upon purposes of <hi>after Penitence;</hi> he is sure to prosper still in his attempts upon the same condition: For Repentance will wash out another sin, if he commit it; and so on. And it is evident that by this very train he does draw most men on through the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> course of sin and life: For never do they till they see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at the last stage, begin repenting. When they are to grapple with <hi>Death's forces,</hi> then they are to set upon <hi>resisting of the Devil:</hi> And when they are grown so weak that their whole Soul must be imployed to muster all its spirits, all their strength, but to beat off one little spot of phlegm, that does befiege the <hi>avenues of breath, the ports of life,</hi> and <hi>sally at it,</hi> and <hi>assault it, once, again,</hi> and a <hi>third, many times,</hi> and yet with all the fury of its might cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> break through, nor beat off that little clot of spittle; when it is thus, yet then are they to <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 6. 12.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now sure to put it off to such a fatal season is a purpose of a desperate concern.

                     <q>For many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the Enemies of the Cross of Christ.</q>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough many <hi>by the Crosse of Christ</hi> here understand any sort of Suffering for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sake of Christ or Religion (it being usual with the Scripture to entitle <hi>Christ</hi> to every evil that befalls a man for doing of his duty,) yet others looking on it <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> as that on which <hi>Christ</hi> himself suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, by the <hi>Enemies of the Crosse</hi> understand those that set themselves against the whole design and influence of <hi>Christ's</hi> Death upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now to name that in few words, the Crosse of Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not onely is one of the greatest Props on which our Faith of the whole Gospel leans, which it establisheth the truth of as Christs Blood shed upon it was the sanction of the Covenant on Gods part, who by that federal Rite of shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:109439:125"/>
Blood engag'd himself; and we may certainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> our selves, he cannot fail to make good whatsoever he hath promised in that Covenant, who would give the blood of his own only Son, who was so holy, and who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Seal that Covenant; and his Blood is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 13. 20, &amp; 10. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>the Blood of the Everlasting Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But besides this extrinsick influence of it, all the blessed Mercies also of the Gospel, are the Purchase of this Cross, and all the main essential duties of the Gospel are not only Doctrines of the Crosse, such as it directs and does inforce, but the Crosse also hath an immediate efficacy in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in us: For S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>by the</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note>

                     <hi>the World is Crucified to me and I unto the World.</hi> On it <hi>the Flesh</hi> is also <hi>crucified with the Affections and Lusts:</hi> And to say all that comprehensive Duty of the Gospel, <hi>Self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal,</hi> is but another word for <hi>taking up the Crosse:</hi> And then as for the Mercies of the Gospel on the Crosse the satisfaction for our sins was made, the Price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption paid, and that effected: There was wrought our Reconciliation with our God; Lastly that was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration upon which Grace was bestowed whereby we are enabled to perform our duty: With good reason <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Gospel <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 18.</note>

                     <hi>Philippians</hi> seems to understand it: And they that <hi>walk as Enemies</hi> to it, are such as do not onely hate the Duties of the Gospel, those especially which the Crosse directly does inforce; but their course of life is order'd so as to break the very Frame and Power of Christianity, they set themselves against all that Christ came to do upon and by the <hi>Cross,</hi> resist, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wage War with the <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and by consequence oppose the <hi>mercies</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The words being thus explain'd, I have no more to do but onely answer two Enquiries which they give occasion for.</p>
                  <p>The first is, What sort of men those are that <hi>walk as Enemies to the Crosse,</hi> and wherein their hostility does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it self?</p>
                  <p>The second is, What the danger and the sadnesse is of that condition, that they should make S. <hi>Paul</hi> think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> frequently to warn them of it, and to do it now with so much passion? <hi>For many walk,</hi> saith he, <hi>of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:109439:125"/>
First for the first. And here I shall not strive to give you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in a perfect list of all that walk as Enemies to the Crosse, but shall take that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath made ready to my hands in the next words.</p>
                  <p>And first the Enemies which he brings up in the front, are the Sensualists, the <hi>Men whose God is their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>they whose glory is in their shame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>who mind Earthly things,</hi> to which as being their consederates, and neer allyes I shall add</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, those that he reckons up in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>the wise</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>men of this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First the <hi>Sensualists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Men who diligently mind the serving of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite in meats and drinks, that study and contrive its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and with industry have learnt, and practise arts of Luxury, and in those have set up their delights, that these should be accounted Enemies of the Crosse of Christ there is but too much reason. For their course of life is perfect opposition to that <hi>Crosse,</hi> and to the whole <hi>design of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> and to the very <hi>being</hi> of all <hi>vertue.</hi> For since <hi>Vertue</hi> is but moderation and restraint of Appetites and Passions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and since sensuality indulges, and does raise and heat them: since the whole <hi>design of Christianity,</hi> is to <hi>mortifie the deeds of the Body,</hi> those <hi>our members upon earth,</hi> that <hi>Body of Sin</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> and since Voluptuousnesse quickens, pampers and does make them vigorous; lastly, since the Doctrines and the Influences of <hi>the Crosse of Christ</hi> do aim at <hi>Crucifying the flesh with its Affections and Lusts,</hi> and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do gorge and make them ramping, sure the enmity is too apparent to be prov'd. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the businesse of Religion to instruct and frame men into reasonable Creatures: God himself chose to dye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse that we might live like Men here, and then afterwards dye into Sons of God, and become equal to the Angels.</p>
                  <p>He suffered on the Tree, that we might be renewed into that constitution which the Tree of Knowledge did disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and debauch. Before Man ate of that, his lower Soul was in perfect subordination to his mind, and every motion of his appetite did attend the dictates of his reason, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> obey them with that resignation and ready willingness which our outward faculties do execute the Wills commands with; then any thing, however grateful to the senses, was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise desired than as it serv'd the regular and proper ends
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:109439:126"/>
and uses of his making; there was a rational harmony in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all the tendencies of all his parts, and that directed, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulated by the rules and hand of God that made them: In fine, <hi>then Grace was Nature, Vertue Constitution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to reduce us to this state as near as possible is the businesse of Religion (as it had been in some kind the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt also of Philosophy.) But this it can in no degree effect, but as it does again establish the subordination of the sensual to the reasonable part within us: That is, till by denying satisfactions to the Appetite (which is now ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and disorderly in its desires) we have taught it how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to want them, and to be content without them, and by that means have subdu'd its inclinations; or by taking down the Body have abated of its powers and its provocations; and where it is stubborn, heady, and rebellious, there by cutting off provisions from the flesh, and by sharp methods vanquisht and reduc't it into a condition of obedience; and (whenever that is also necessary) weakens so that insolent untam'd part of our selves, that we make it lye fainting, groveling at our feet (these are the Doctrines of the Cross, and this the method of its Discipline:) And withal by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> those rational and divine heavenly encouragements which above all Doctrines in the world our Christianity suggests and furnisheth with infinite advantage, have so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the mind that it resumes its principality, governs, and carries on the lower Soul in its obedience to Duty easily without resistance, as they say the higher Heaven moves the inferiour Orbs along with it although their proper tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are contrary: At leastwise if impressions from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or inbred inclinations stir, raise passions, and mutinies, yet the mind keeps so much power that they shall not beat it off, and force it from its prosecutions of good; nor shall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> unlesse by a surprize, engage its consent in the pursuit of evil. This is that which Religion aims at, thus to make us men, teach us to live according to our nature, to put Reason in the Throne, and vindicate the spirit from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of its own vassal flesh.</p>
                  <p>But sensuality is most perfect opposition to this whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; for it renverses that subordination without which there is no possibility of vertue as I shew'd you; and it puts that whether Lust or Passion in the Throne, which either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, conversation, or whatever accident, did give <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> possession of our inclinations to: And makes the strangest prodigy of <hi>Centaure</hi> where the <hi>Beast is uppermost and rides the man;</hi> where the <hi>beast is God</hi> indeed; for the sensual
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:109439:126"/>
man acknowledges no other <hi>God</hi> but his own <hi>belly,</hi> so S. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> does character him here. And truly if we look on the attendances, and careful services he gives it, and how studiously and wholly he does consecrate himself to please it, one would think it most impossible he should have any other God; but if we number the <hi>drink offerings,</hi> and <hi>meat-offerings,</hi> the whole <hi>Hecatombs</hi> he gives it, and whereas other Deities had onely some peculiar appropriate Creatures for their Sacrifices, how this votary rifles the Universe, goes through the whole latitude of beings for oblations, one would think he did out-number all the Heathen Legions in his Gods; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and yet all this is onely for his Belly. Now he that deifies his Appetite, and that is so attent and so sollicitous in its service, he that sets up such an <hi>Antigod</hi> as this to Christ, appears a scornful insolent Enemy to <hi>Him,</hi> his <hi>Crosse</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi> neer the state of those men whom the Wise-man couples with the sensual, persons <hi>of an impudent mind,</hi> the very disposition of those Enemies of the Crosse of Christ whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> brings up in the <hi>second</hi> place,</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Those that glory in their shame.</head>
                     <p>Amongst the uses of the Crosse of Christ, one chiefly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> meant, was by the ignominy of that most accursed infamous punishment to represent the vilenesse of Iniquity; to which shame and confusion were so due, that there were to be Contumelies as well as Agonies in the Death that was to expiate it: And it seems not sufficient that <hi>the Blood of God</hi> be shed for it, but that Blood must be stain'd too with the <hi>imputation of a Malefactor:</hi> Christ was to suffer the insulting scorns and vilifyings of his Crucifiers, his Honour must be sacrific'd as well as his Life, <hi>Barabbas</hi> must be preferr'd even before that <hi>Person of the Trinity</hi> to whom sin was to be imputed, and who was to bear the just shame of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it, such infinite debasement and contempt being a most es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential ingredient in the wages of Iniquity, of which this Crosse of Christ was the expresse.</p>
                     <p>And then how is it possible for men to wage a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest hostility against the Crosse of Christ, than by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put <hi>Reputation</hi> on the thing on which that Cross was set to throw <hi>Disgrace?</hi> by raising <hi>Trophies</hi> to themselves for that which raised a <hi>Gibbet</hi> to their Saviour? giving themselves a <hi>value</hi> for the thing which hath such infinite diminution in it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that it made the <hi>Son of God</hi> esteemed worse than <hi>Barabbas?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These men are two successful Enemies of the Crosse that thus triumph over it, and when it was erected as an Ensigne to display the vilenesse of iniquity, and to shame sin out of

the lives of mankind, vindicate and rescue sin from that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> contempt, and throw the Crosse and shame upon Religion it self; while they exult in their commissions as in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable things, and too truely verifying the Apostles aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations against wilful sinners, <hi>Crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame,</hi> while they put scorns on that contempt he suffered: For the Agonies and Contumelies he endured on that account of sin must needs be most ridiculous to them who count Sin gay and Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Thus they trample and insult upon his Passion, thus tread underfoot the Son of God even on his Crosse, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> upon that footstool they exalt themselves by putting sin in countenance and credit with the Age. For it is plain it is so when men once can <hi>glory</hi> in it: For our actions raise a glorying in us onely in relation to the sentiments of others, that growing from a confidence of having praise and value for them in the world. So that they must assure themselves that most men or the most considerable will applaud their vices; otherwise they could not glory in them, but would be ashamed. And such a judgment we may safely passe upon an Age or Nation, where great Crimes not only have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> impunity but Reputation; and men glory in them. Had it been so in the Heathen World when Christ and his Crosse first appeared there, Christianity had wanted one of its convincing pleas. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology for our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that blasted it with all imaginable imputations of impiety discourses thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Omne malum aut timore aut pudore Natura perfudit:</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">a <hi>Tertul. Apolog. c.</hi> 1.</note> hath dasht every vice with fear or shame; all Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors labour to lye hid, and if they are laid hold upon they tremble, and deny when they are accus'd, hardly confesse it to the Rack; and when they are found guilty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they bewail, upbraid themselves, and aggravate confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Crimes. <hi>Christianus verò quid simile?</hi> but what does the Christian like this? None of us is asham'd of his Religion, or repents, except it be because he was not sooner of it: If he be branded for it he rejoyceth, if you accuse him of it he does own it, triumphs in it; if he be condemned for it he calls his Execution his Martyrdom, his sufferings his Crown. <hi>Quid hoc mali est quod naturalia mali non habet?</hi> Now what strange kind of impiety is this that hath none of the natural affections of it? not the shame nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fear, tergiversations or repentance, or deplorings of it? <hi>Quid hoc mali est cujus reus gaudet, cujus accusatio votum est, &amp; poena foelicitas?</hi> What a kind of evil's this, which he that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:109439:127"/>
is found guilty of is glad? to be accus'd of it is his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to suffer for it is his happinesse?</p>
                     <p>Alas the world hath taught vice now adayes to use this plea with a much greater confidence, and he that would apply this argument to our experiences might plead thus for the Religion of sin. For now they are but pitteous puisny sinners who feel those things which in <hi>Tertullians</hi> dayes were natural and essential to sin, <hi>to blush,</hi> and <hi>be ashamed,</hi> and <hi>have regrets.</hi> Men do not onely own it as those primitive persons did their Christianity, but they out-vie the Martyrs heats; for they accuse themselves, and boast of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in villany, yea falsify, belye themselves in sin, and usurpe Vice, steal the glorious Reputation of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinfulnesse, as if the impiety were meritorious.</p>
                     <p>And truly as that Christian Confidence and Magnanimity brought in the world as Proselytes to the Crosse, so this other confidence brings Sholes of Votaries to Vice: For when once there is no need to be asham'd of it, there are but very few but will venture to commit it. And indeed this sort of men do manage their hostility so dexterously, as to use those very weapons Christianity was successful with, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> against it self. 'Twas by a <hi>discipline of shame</hi> (for that was the great strength of the <hi>Church Censures)</hi> that our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did at first prevail almost to the exterminating Vice out of the World: The temporal Sword was never so victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as this <hi>weapon of our Spiritual Warfare was,</hi> which yet in those times drew no blood, unlesse it were into the face, <hi>in blushes.</hi> But since men have found or made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts to glory in iniquity, and several Crimes are become honourable; Vertues are drest up as mean, poor spirited, sneaking qualities; some look <hi>melancholick, sad,</hi> are <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriacke,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> some <hi>pedantick,</hi> some <hi>unmanly,</hi> some <hi>irrational,</hi> and worse; so that men are now asham'd of Duty, 'tis a disparagement to own the doing it: Thus they have as it were <hi>excommunicated Religion.</hi> It is accounted a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, or at best foolish thing; which is the very sentence of the <hi>third</hi> sort of Enemies the <hi>Wise men of this World,</hi> those <gap reason="foreign">

of its Wealth, Delights, and Heights, when they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to draw us into sin or take us off from Duty. Now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to this it works by these three steps.</p>
                     <p>First, shewing us <hi>the Authour and the finisher of our Faith</hi> nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to that Crosse; his joynts rackt on it, his whole Body stript, and nothing else but Vinegar and bitter poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons allow'd his thirst; and thus convincing us that <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 16. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>if we will be his Disciples we must take up his Crosse and follow him,</hi> at leastwise we must have preparednesse of mind to take it up when ever it is fixt to Duty; to renounce all profits, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and delights of this World that are not consistent with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our Christian profession: This is the Doctrine of the Cross of Christ; it being otherwise impossible to be Disciples of a Crucifyed Master. And when this great <hi>Captain of our Salvation</hi> was himself <hi>consecrated by his sufferings,</hi> and had for his Standard his own Body lifted up upon the Crosse, we that are listed under him, and with that very badge the Crosse too, <hi>crucis Consecranei,</hi> Votaries and fellow Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of that Order, if we shall avoyd our duty when it is attended with a Crosse, or straitned any wayes, and the provisions of this World are cut off from it, and betake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our selves rather to the contents of Earth; we do not only shamefully fly from our Colours; fugitives, and cowards, Poltrons in the Spiritual warfare; but are renegadoes, false and traytours to our selves too, such as basely ran away not onely from our Officer, but from Salvation, which he is the Captain of; and which we cannot possibly attain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we be resolv'd to follow him, and charge through whatsoever disadvantages attend Religion, vanquishing all those temptations with which the World assaults us in our course of Duty. Thus the Crosse of Christ first shews us the <hi>necessity</hi> we have to renounce and <hi>Crucifie the</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                        <hi>World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to encourage and enable us to do so, it does also shew us</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>certainty of a good issue</hi> in the doing it, assures us, that those who deny themselves forbidden satisfactions here, that will be vertuous maugre all the baits and threats of Earth, will embrace duty when it is laden with a Cross, although so heavy as to crush out life, and kill the body; assures us that those lose not, but exchange their lives, shall save their Souls, and that there is another World where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their losses shall be made up to them, and repaired with all advantage. To the truth of this the Crosse of Christ is a most pregnant and infallible testimony. For as by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:109439:128"/>
of Miracles Christ sought to satisfie the world that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he was sent from God to promise all this, and justified his Power to perform it by experiment, raising some up from the dead; so when they said he did his Miracles by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> he justified it further with his Life; affirming that he was the Son of God (now 'tis impossible but he must know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were or no) and consequently sent and able to do all he promised, and resolv'd to do it also for our more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance in himself, that he would raise himself up from the dead within three dayes; and saying this when he was sure he should be Crucified for saying so, and sure that if he did not do according to his words, he must within three dayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> appear a meer Impostor to the world, and his Religion never be receiv'd.</p>
                     <p>Now 'tis impossible for him that must needs know whether all this were true or no to give a greater testimony to it than his Life. For this that Blood and Water that flowed from his wounded side upon the Crosse, which did assure his Death, is justly said to bear witnesse to his being the Son of God, and consequently to the truth of all this, equal to the testimony of the Spirit (whether that which the Spirit gave when he came from Heaven down upon him in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his Baptisme, or the testimony which he gave by Miracle;) for <hi>there are three that bear witnesse upon Earth, the Spirit,</hi>

God,</hi> who did create all these advantages of Earth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> those in Heaven, and does therefore know them both: Who also is the <hi>Wisdom of the Father,</hi> and does therefore know to value them, yet <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note>

                     <p>Now this being in their account folly, then the contrary to this they must think wisdom; as it is indeed <hi>the Wisdom of this World;</hi> which Wisdom since it does design no further than this World, and hath no higher ends than Earth and its Felicities, it must needs put men upon minding the acquist and the enjoyment of these Earthly things, for that is onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to pursue and to atchieve their ends, to catch at and lay hold on their felicity; and accordingly we see it does immerse them wholly in those cares. So that it is no wonder if their God and Religion can get no attendance from them, it being most impossible they should, when Mammon hath engaged them in the superstitious services of Idolatry; and when they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their whole selves to pleasure and make their bodies the burnt offerings of their Lusts, and when Ambition, even while it makes them stretch and climb and mount, causes them also to fall low, prostrate, make their temper, nature stoop, lye down to every humour, and to every vice they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> think themselves concern'd to court and please.</p>

And every dayes experience also does convince us, that the least crosse accident, pain or affliction on our persons or some other that is seated neer our hearts, or the least vexation or crosse passion will so sowre all those advantages, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly enjoy them while we have them; sickness makes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the richest plenty onely a more nauseous trouble, a more cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loathing; then the poorest Soul that is in health is that great rich mans envy.</p>
                     <p>And ther's no man also but does see so far into futurity as to satisfie himself that he shall dye, and then the shadow of death will cloud and put out all these glories. And uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal reason also does tell every man that to deny himself or want his present satisfactions of this helplesse dying kind, and suffer present evils, is in prudence to be chosen for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of a future evil or atchieving of a good to come which do transcend those other infinitely, and to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity continue. Sure as no man pities the poor Infant in the Womb because he lyes imbrued in Blood, hath no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance there at all, is fetter'd, coffin'd as it were in that dark cell; if he be to be born to an Estate, to live a full age here in gaiety of mind, and health of body, in Reputation, and all plenty of delights, we never are concern'd or troubled at his other nine months dungeon. So if this life be to the next as the Womb is to this; and if our hopes be no more on the Earth than in the Belly; and we have no inheritance or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> abiding place here, as we had not there; although the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of affliction, and to be in our blood should be as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to us as to the Child, yet if we thus presse forward to the other birth, to be delivered into immortality of joyes, this state were not to be lamented, but endeavoured for with all our powers. Lastly, the same reason does assure us, that if those futurities (which are most certain) were but onely possible, yet to part with every thing, and suffer any thing here to prevent miscarriage in relation to those two Eternities is certainly the safest course, and then by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the wisest.

Yet notwithstanding all this, he that minds these earthly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> things, whose heart is set upon them, whose desires the World serves, provides to satisfie every imagination of delight: His heart is so intangled in affections to them, and in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices for them, and hath so imbib'd the impressions of them, that he hath no taste for any other, and by consequence no satisfying notions of them: And if he hath not then it is not possible that he should really and from his heart, out of conviction and inward sense value these beyond the earthly ones; and it is plain we see he does not; and if he do not, to deprive himself of all the sweet contentments of his life, and tear out his own bowells that yearn after them, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cling to them; and instead of those embrace a Crosse, and do this for things which he cannot value more, and counts uncertain, he must needs think a mad folly: Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to contrive and seize the present to the best most plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful advantage is the wisest course; and therefore they that by whatever arts do thrive, advance themselves, live high and in delights, they are Wise men; because they do attain their ends, by meanes appropriate to those ends.</p>

But the Wisdom of this World designs to lay out all its cares and its contrivances within this World, minds nothing else but earthly things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and does not lift an eye or thought to any other.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, their <hi>Principles</hi> wage war: For earthly good things being the design, the main end of this worldly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, consequently that does justifie all courses without which men cannot gain those ends, by which they do, though they be never so unlawful by the Rules of that which we call Vertue and Religion; it does justifie, I say, all such as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. But the Principles of the Doctrines of the Crosse of Christ are positive, that we must renounce all earthly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, when they cannot be injoyed without transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Christs Commands, and imbrace duty even when it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes it self upon us.</p>

If to sport with things of sacred and Eternal consequence were to be forgiven, yet to do it with the crosse of Christ: Thus to set that out as <hi>foolishness</hi> which is the greatest mystery the <hi>Divine wisdom</hi> hath contriv'd to make <hi>mercy and truth meet together, righteousness and peace kiss each other,</hi> to make sin be punisht, yet the sinner pardoned: Thus to play and sin upon those dire expresses of Gods indignation against sin, are things of such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> and dangerous concern, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not give a caution against them but with tears, <hi>For many walke saith he, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, &amp;c.</hi> Which calls me to my <hi>last</hi> considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the crosse of Christ does represent Almighty God in so severe a shape, and gives the lineaments of so fierce dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasures against sin, as do exceed all comprehension. There was a passion in Christs Prayer to prevent his passion, when he deprecated it with strong cryes and tears, yea when his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whole body wept tears as of blood to deprecate it; and yet he cryed more dreadfully when he did suffer it; The nayles that bor'd his hands, the spear that pierc't his heart and made out-letts for his blood and Spirits, did not wound him
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:109439:131"/>
as, that sting of death and torments, sin did, which made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> out-lets for God to forsake him, and which drove away the Lord that was himself out of him. Neither did his God forsake him onely, but his most Almighty attributes were engag'd against him: Gods Holinesse and Justice were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to make Christ an example of the sad demerit of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and his hatred of it: Demerit so great, as was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable with the everlasting punishment of the World, fal'n Angels and fal'n Men; for to that did it make them lyable. Now that God might appear to hate it at the rate of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings, it was very necessary that it should be punisht, if not by the execution of that sentence on Mankind as on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Devils, yet by something that might be proportionable to it, so to let us see the measures God abhors it by, to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the Lord is just and holy by those torments, torments answerable to those attributes.</p>
                     <p>Now truly when we do reflect on this we cannot wonder if the Sinner be an enemy to the Crosse, and hate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of it, which does give him such a perfect copy of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, when our Saviours draught which he so trembled at shall be the <hi>everlasting portion of his Cup:</hi> For if God did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so plague the <hi>imputation</hi> of Iniquity, how will he torment the <hi>willful and impenitent commission</hi> of it?</p>
                     <p>But then when we consider those torments were the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the sins of man, methinks the sinner should be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise affected to them: Christ by bearing the Cross gave God such satisfaction, as did move him in consideration thereof to dispence with that strict Law, which having broken we were forfeit to eternal death, and to publish an act of grace whereby he does admit all to pardon of sins past, and to a right to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life that will believe on him, for sake their sins and live true Christians.

                        <hi>like the sorrow of thy Son wherewith thou didst afflict him</hi> for these sins of mine: And here is Blood also, his Blood to wash me in: and that Blood is within the Vaile too now and that my offering taken from the Crosse up to thy Throne, thou hast accepted, it, and canst not refuse it now my <hi>Advocate</hi> does plead it, and claims for me the advantage of the Crosse.</p>
                     <p>Now that men should be Enemies to this, and when they are forseit to eternal Ruine, hate that which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the forfeiture; that they should trample on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Crosse whereon their satisfactions were wrought; tread down the Altar which they have but to lay hold on and be safe; wage war with, beat off, and pursue a Lamb, that <hi>Lamb of God</hi> that comes to <hi>take away their sins;</hi> and make a spoyl and slaughter of their Sacrifice; hostilely spill upon the ground that Blood, that was appoynted for their Blood upon the Altar, for their <hi>blood of sprinkl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and was to appear in Heaven for them. It men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to be on <hi>terms of Duell</hi> with their <hi>God,</hi> and scorn that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> shall be made for them by any other way than by <hi>defiance;</hi> and although their God do make the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> satisfactions for them to himself, yet not endure it, but choose quarrel rather; this is so perverse and fatal an hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as no tears are sufficient to bewail.</p>
                     <p>But possibly men sleight these satisfactions because some terms are put upon them which they know not how to comport with; the merits of the Crosse must not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to them but upon conditions which they are not able to perform; they are required to master all their wicked Customes, their untam'd appetites, and settled habits, to keep under their Concupiscence, to calm their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> inclinations and their passions: Now on such severe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles friendship with the Crosse they think is too hard bought.</p>
                     <p>But therefore <hi>Secondly,</hi> that Crosse was the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which Grace is offer'd us, whereby we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to perform all this; the <hi>power to will</hi> and <hi>strength to do,</hi> all necessary aids from Heaven are granted to us as Christ merited them for us by his Sufferings; and that Blood he shed upon the Crosse it is the Fountain, 'tis the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Ocean of all grace: And if temptations storm thee, lay hold on that Crosse, it is the Anchor of Salvation thou hast hold on; tell thy God although thou art not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and stand, thou hast the price of strength, that which
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:109439:132"/>
did purchase it was paid down for thee on the Crosse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and is at his right hand, he hath it; give me therefore grace for it, let me have the value of that Blood, the <hi>Blood of God</hi> in spiritual succours, which may make me able to resist thy Enemies, and do thy will. Now God will never be unjust to deny any man those aids that were so dearly purchast for him, and for which he hath receiv'd the price.</p>
                     <p>And then that men should be Enemies of the Crosse which is their Magazine of strength against their Enemies! As men that do resist the having grace, least it should change <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their inclinations! as men that will not be impowered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Vice, but will oppose the Aids of Heaven, fight against the succours that are given them, and destroy their own forces, least with them they should be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter sin and overcome it! Thus wilfully to run against and charge their Anchor of Salvation; to poyson to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Fountain the whole Ocean of their graces, is the state of them onely that do resolve and that had rather perish.</p>
                     <p>Once more, on that Crosse was wrought <hi>a reconciliation</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

He sent his Son to move us to be reconciled, as if he did acknowledge us the offended party; and as if he meant to give us satisfaction, in his Blood, he dyes upon the Crosse to effect that reconciliation.

                     <p>And is a Reconciliation with the Lord so hateful to us, that we will be Enemies to the Crosse that works it? are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we so assur'd of worsting God Almighty, that we will resist whatever makes towards a peace with him? are the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners expectations so tempting? do we look for such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

                        <hi>spoyled Principalities and Powers, triumphing over them on it;</hi> therefore set our selves against that Trophee of his Victories over our friends the Devil and his Fiends? is the love of Christ so injurious to us that we will be Enemies to the Expresses of it? and when his affection threw him down so low for our sakes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> humbled him to Hell to beg and to procure our friendship, will we go to trample on him there rather than not go thither, and rather than we will not be for ever there?</p>
                     <p>Was it not for this <hi>O blessed Saviour!</hi> that thou didst pray against thy Cup so earnestly, because of Man's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful enmity to it? because thou wast to suffer God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightys Indignation in it, and the Sinners hatred for it? because it was the Cup of the Lords fury, and Man's also? God squeezed into it all the dregs of his Wrath, and man scornfully spits into it? and when the one will make thee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> drink it up, the other throws it in thy face? was it not because thou wert to take a Crosse up which thou couldst not bear the Torments of, and Man will not endure the Blessings of? but most despitefully treads down that Cross while thou art sinking under it laden with their weight? This is alas, a state so sad that neither S. <hi>Pauls tears,</hi> nor <hi>Christ's Blood</hi> hath sufficient compassion for.</p>
                     <p>And yet though one <hi>wept</hi> the other <hi>dyed</hi> for them, these men have neither tears nor pitty for themselves. Yet one would think this were a subject worthy of them: 'Tis storied of <hi>Xerxes</hi> that when he took a view of his vast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Army which he went to Conquer <hi>Greece</hi> with (an Army such as the Sun never saw, and it could scarce see that, which the Historian sayes did <hi>Coelo minitari tenebras,</hi> as it cover'd and drank up the Sea, and took up and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd the Earth, so it did seem to darken Heaven too: An Army which consisted saith <hi>Herodotus,</hi> when muster'd at <hi>Thermopylae</hi> of Five Millions, two hundred eighty three thousand, two hundred and twenty Men, besides Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, Harlots, and Horses; and it had Twelve hundred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Gallies for Sea fight, besides Twenty hundred Ships for carriage.) when upon this view he had for a while glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in his happinesse to behold and Command so many Nations, and so Powerfull a Fleet and Army: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:109439:133"/>
on a sudden he burst into Tears on this Consideration, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that in one Hundred years there should not one sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive of that great marvellous multitude: (And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through his folly in one hundred weeks scarce any one but was the prey of Enemies, and Death and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy.) But 'tis a sadder Contemplation to reflect on the far greater Armie of the Enemies of the Crosse, who, if they do not end that quarrel, will in fewer years be all dead and in Hell. I know not whether such a sad reflexion called out S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Tears, but sure I am it does deserve their own: And there is nothing will avail in their behalf without their tears. It may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be tears are piteous things for such brave Sinners: But then what will these insulting Enemies of the Cross do, when they shall see <hi>that Sign of the Son of Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Clouds of Heaven?</hi> When this Crosse shall usher in the great Assize? When they shall <hi>look on him that they have pierced and Crucified upon it?</hi> And when that Crucified offended Enemy shall come there to be their Judge? That takes himself to be offended much more in his kindnesse, than his Person; and will judge this more severely that we would not let his Crosse and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Passion do us any good, than that we Crucified him on it.</p>
                     <p>Let us then be caution'd in the fear of God to be no longer Enemies to that which is to reconcile our Judge to us. If we have his Friendship on the Crosse, we may be sure to have it on the Judgment Seat. He that on the Crosse parted with Godhead and with Life for us, will on the Bench adjudge us that Inheritance which his Crosse did purchase for us. He sits there to pronounce Happinesse upon all faithful sincere Christians to proclaim <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

In which we must consider,</p>
                  <p>First, the object both of the Duty and the Threat <hi>a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and that <hi>the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, our concern and duty in relation to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom we have onely <hi>to receive it. Whosoever shall not receive</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
                     <hi>the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatever bustle men are well content to make to get possession of any Earthly Dignity or Power, sometimes to wage war with their Conscience and all obligations, violate all Rights both Humane and Divine, and assault greatest difficulties and yet greater guilts, to invade mens Crowns, and other rights, there's no such need in this; we have no more to do but <hi>let this Kingdom come,</hi> and not resist the having it. For therefore also</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the manner we are by our Saviour here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to receive this Kingdom in is, <hi>as a little Child. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child,</hi> as one that cannot stand against the power of a Kingdom when it comes; that hath nor strength nor malice, neither force nor will to oppose; which they that do must needs keep themselves out of it: Which is</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the thing threatned, <hi>they shall not enter therein;</hi> there being neither reason nor indeed a possibility men should possesse that which they will not receive. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, Christ's asseveration is added to all this, <hi>Verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, he shall not enter therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But because the main thing Christ intended in the Text
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:109439:134"/>
(which he so oft repeated upon several occasions) was, by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> significative embleme of <hi>a little Child,</hi> visibly to informe us of some dispositions that are absolutely necessary to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Christianity, either in our minds by Faith or in our lives by practise; I shall therefore wholly attend that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of his in the words, and handle them particularly as they seem here to be spoken in relation to the Doctrine of it. This being most of use now in an age when men not only tear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with disputes, but aime to baffle it with reproaches quite out of the world: Now against such the text is positive, <hi>Whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God,</hi> the Doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Christianity <hi>as a little Child he cannot enter therein,</hi> neither into the possession of the Promises of Christianity, nor indeed into the profession of it.</p>
                  <p>And here I need not labour much to finde that in a child which Christ requires of those that come to be disciples in Religion; for it is plain that children being impotent, unable to sustaine or to direct themselves, they give themselves up to the aids and the directions of others, those especially whom they are committed to, and with whose cares of them they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; to whose guidance they resign themselves entirely, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> laying hold on them in any dangerous appearance, and not trusting to themselves at all: And when their age first makes them capable of having any thing infus'd into them, being empty and unseason'd vessels they will easily receive all and sincerely without taint: And being neither fill'd before hand with prejudicate opinions, nor with windy vaine conceits of their own skill or knowledge, they must needs take in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let or hindrance what ever is infus'd, and submit themselves to be directed wholly by their teachers, without contradiction or dispute, for they Judge not, nor examine, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> receive. Now such a resignation seems the proper disposition which our Saviour expects in a disciple. It is plain that his pretended Vicar and that Church expect it, that men shall submit their Faith entirely to the Church, believe whatever <hi>shee proposeth as reveal'd by God meerly on that account as she proposeth it,</hi> for otherwise it is not a right faith: Yea, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that men give their assent to the determinations of her head, the <hi>Pope,</hi> in <hi>matters of fact</hi> also, where they are as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to Judge as he; And though with all their industry, and using the same means, they cannot finde the fact to be as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he determines, yet they are oblig'd in conscience to that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to depart from their own Judgement, and to <hi>yield</hi> and <hi>sign their assent</hi> to his determinations, Witnesse the matter of <hi>Jansenius.</hi> Yea their great <hi>Cardinal</hi> is positive that

And since assenting to a thing as truth is an act of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> faculty of the soul of man as it is properly and truly reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, namely as it <hi>understands and judges,</hi> it is not possible a man should really believe a thing unlesse he fatisfie himself that he hath reason for so doing. Yea, whether that be true or not which many men so eagerly contend for, that the will though free is bound, and cannot choose but will that which appears best at that time it wills, yet it is sure that he who with his understanding, which is not free in her apprehensions and judgments, but must necessarily embrace that which hath most evidence of truth: He I say who really assents to any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> proposition does satisfie himself that he hath better and more cogent reasons for that then the contrary: And therefore it is impossible that any man can verily believe a thing which he is throughly convinc't is contrary to clear and evident right reason, for he cannot have a better reason for the thing that is so; And were it possible for any man to believe so, there could be neither grounds nor rules for such a ones belief; for there is nothing in the world, so false and so absur'd although he were assur'd it were so, but he might assent to it, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever demonstrations could be offer'd why he should not, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it seems he might believe against acknowledg'd evident truth and reason, but this were onely <hi>wish</hi> or <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>imagination,</hi> not <hi>belief.</hi> And to prevent such childish weak credulity was the great work and care of Christ, so far is he from requiring we should be <hi>as Children</hi> in this kind. For <hi>when he was ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> up to heaven <hi>he gave some Apostles, some Evangelists, some Pastors and Teachers,</hi> he shed down the Holy Spirit and his gifts, <hi>that we might not be as Children tossed to and fro, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with every winde of Doctrine; Eph.</hi> 4. 14. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

                  <p>First, For want of rationall grounds instable in our Faith as Children are in body, and in judgement also, taking all appearances for truths. If men were only to believe, there must needs be as great variety of Religions as of teachers. And though God hath appointed that some Church should be as perfectly <hi>infallible</hi> as that of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to be; yet since there are so many Churches, and the true one therefore could be known no otherwise then by some marks, there must be disquisition before Faith; and men must reason and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine ere they can believe upon good grounds; for were they to receive Religion <hi>as a little Child,</hi> be nurst up with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

                  <p>Thirdly, 'tis as impossible that their immediate Ancestors who lived in the Apostles Age, who heard their Preaching, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> received their Writings, saw the Miracles they did, if they did any, and many of them must have seen Christ also after he was risen if it were so; yea multitudes of them were themselves parties in the gifts of Tongues and Miracles, if there were any, and so could not be impos'd on, but must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily know whether they were truths or forgeries: It is as impossible I say, so many should agree together to betray all their Posterity into the profession of a Religion from which they could look for no advantage but the certain total Ruin of themselves and their posterity; it was not possible they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> could have done this if they had not thought all this was true; and since they did know whether it were true or not, if they thought it was true, they did know it was, and if they knew it was, then it is certain that it was so; and these Scriptures, and the Doctrines Christians deliver (so far as they have not varied since that time from these Authentical Records) they have the <hi>Seal of God,</hi> Miracles to attest they come from God.</p>

                  <p>But notwithstanding this we may not think the mysteries of Faith are to be measured by the Rules of natural Reason, so to stand or fall as they approve themselves to its discourse or Principles: For though it be impossible that any Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can contradict right Reason (truth cannot be inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with truth:) yet it is very possible God can reveal those truths which we have neither faculties analogal, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> principles or notions proportioned to, nor any natural wayes of judging or examining. And if those faculties which are not capable of cognisance will judge; and judge of things removed from all our notices; (such as Spiritual, Infinite, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal being is) and do it by principles gathered from the information of our Senses, and by analogy with things of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind; corporeal finite things that are about us; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son need not be informed how liable such judgments must be to mistakes; and how that which we call repugnancy in one may have no place in the other. Here therefore to submit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our understandings, and believe is but modest justice, and to <hi>receive as Children what our Heavenly Father sayes.</hi>

they are commanded to believe, and those that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing but what they are able to comprehend, are alike <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> insolent, if not pernicious.

Now to attempt the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of such matter of fact by reasonings drawn from difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in some things which those men are witnessed to have deliver'd, or to conclude, that there can never have been any such persons in the world, because they cannot understand all that those persons taught, or possibly because they can take some occasions to buffoone on what they taught, is most ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. Thus History must have been false, and several known places not have been, because the story hath been turn'd into <hi>Burlesque:</hi> Thus he that with the Ancients cannot comprehend how it is possible that there should be <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or the earth can be any thing but a plain flat, otherwise he thinks the inhabitants must fall down to Heaven; may as rationally despise all the discoveries of the earth, assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self our constant Navigations which perswade us 'tis a Globe inhabited on both sides, bring home from the <hi>Indies</hi> nothing else but false relations, and that indeed there are no <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not urge how Christianity approves it self even to the reasoning of the sober part of mankind; and the morality of it had the suffrage of the world before it self appeared: for while the evidence stands good, if the matter of fact be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> true, the doctrine must be true, and the commands obey'd: and to use such arguings to refell such matter of fact is just like that which <hi>Zeno</hi> did attempt, namely, by subtilties to prove it was impossible there could be any motion, while another did
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:109439:140"/>
disturb his lecture by his motion up and down the Schools; it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is the same thing as to take a <hi>bowle</hi> to <hi>cut</hi> with, or the <hi>vessels of the Danaid's to carry water</hi> in: for such reasonings are alike improper for that work.</p>
                  <p>And indeed these arguings are not the exceptions of reason, but the struglings of mens vices against Religion. And it must be impossible so many thousands would give up their <hi>bodies,</hi> rather then their <hi>Bibles</hi> to the fire in <hi>Dioclesian</hi>'s days, because it is a book which they can find no other pleasure in but that of railling it, or helping them with subjects to be prophane upon. It must be false that <hi>Christ</hi> did feed 5000 with 5 <hi>loaves</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Mat.

And yet methinks upon the same account they should allow, that at a feast he turned so many <hi>pots of water into wine,</hi> because that seems to gratifie the thirsts of their intemperance. In fine, we <note place="margin">John 11. 6, 7.</note> do not live as men prepared or willing to be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all our doings, therefore we have no mind to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to give it: when we are thus minded, it is not hard to meet with difficulties that encourage the opinion that we shall not rise. Which difficulties when we look into, we cannot find how it is possible we can be raised, and 'tis easie then to think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we cannot, that it is impossible, especially when it is our will and interest to think so; and then it must be false whatever is in Scripture that we shall. These are the processes of those that reason against Christianity, such the grounds that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute upon: but their reasons are but Sophisms of lust and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, which will guild and paint whatever they are much in love with, and it is no wonder they find colours for it, and can think them reasons, for they always did so against present evident conviction. When <hi>Moses</hi> by his miracles endeavoured to let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> know who was the Lord, and to persuade him to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> let Israel go; while <hi>God</hi> permitted the <note n="a" place="margin">Exod.

                     <hi>Magicians</hi> to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit those miracles, it lookt like reasonable indeed that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> should not be convinced; but when they could not imitate, but did confess <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. VIII. 19.</note>

those plagues which they could not either conjure up or down;</hi> then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will not be persuaded, 'tis plain nothing but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, not the wonders which were wrought by the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, were the reasons that prevailed with him; for those were not reasons against more and greater miracles; yet they were effectual with him to the destruction of himself and his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Again when they who knew the mighty works <hi>Christ</hi> did, and were <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 24. 29.</note> forewarned by him <hi>of false Christs and false Prophets, that would come with signs and lying wonders;</hi> God allowing Sathan leave to struggle at his last gasp, and to make a blaze when he was to <hi>fall from Heaven as lightning,</hi> but far beneath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:109439:141"/>
can suffer you;</hi> and the reason was more pressing then the fact: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Nec enim Divinitas deputanda est quae subdita est homini, <hi>it being most impossible that that should be a God which a man could rule and triumph over,</hi> so imperiously manage him, as with a bare command to force him from his hold, and make him shame himself so villainously before both his adorers and his enemies, as to say, <hi>He was a Devil.</hi> Yet the Heathens still found colours to do out all this conviction; and their old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with their Gods, together with the custom of their vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worships, had more force with them then miracle and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And while the Christian disposest their Deities, he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> himself turned out of all his own possessions; and although he made their God confess himself a Devil, yet still poor he was made to suffer as a malefactour.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis not strange if men now stick as closely to their <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as those did to the <hi>Gods</hi> that patronized them, and it be as hard to exorcise the Devil out of their affections and practices, as it was then out of Heathen Votaries or Temples. They are as fierce against the Christian Religion for their lusts sake, as those for their <hi>Venus,</hi> and the very same account that made those Heathen customs, or the lying wonders of false Christs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians signs, be more persuasive then the other more real miracles; namely, because they sided with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and interests. This very account makes little difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (which Almighty God hath left in our Religion, as he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered signs and lying wonders heretofore, for trials) yea, makes cavils, mere exceptions, pass for reasons most invincible, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed, urg'd with great concern and passion, against all those methods of conviction which God hath afforded Christianity.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be to <hi>receive Religion as a little Child,</hi> 'tis with the <hi>frowardnesse of Children,</hi> when they are displeas'd or ill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> at ease; who resist and quarrell with the thing that is to make them well or please them, and returne the Parents cares to ease and quiet them with little outrages and vexing. And <hi>do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy Father that hath bought thee? Hath he not made thee and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisht thee?

Or should we cast off the relation and tenounce all the obedience due to it, because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we are not sure of it our selves? For ought we know those may not be our Parents, we have only testimony for it: Thus we serve our God on that account; and yet <hi>Hath he not made thee and establisht thee?</hi> As he began us, so did he not nurse and

bear us in his arms, and carry us in all our weaknesses and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, till he brought us up to a full strength? Till by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and signal providence he had establisht, settled us? and after all these cares bestowed upon us, do we prove a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of vipers onely, such as do requite the bowels that did bear and nourish them, by preying on them and consuming them? Or like the of-spring of a Spider, who, when he hath spent himself with weaving nets and working of them into la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths, to be the granaries and the defences of his brood, to <note place="margin">Arist. hist.

And shall we be such children to our Father that establisht us? make all his plenties turn to poison in us, and invenome us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself? make his miraculous mercies furnish us for the abuse and provocation of him? his blest Providence serve onely to afford us arguments against it self; help to confute it self because it hath so prospered, doth still suffer us?

A strange command in an age, in which we scarcely can finde men that love their friends, nor any thing but that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which serves their interests or pleasures, that indeed love nothing but themselves; nor is it onely injury that works their hate and enmity, but difference in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divides hearts, and men are never to be reconcil'd that have not the same mind in every thing; as if one Heaven should not hold them that have not one judgement in all things, we see that one Church cannot hold them, and they that have but <hi>one same God, one Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> one <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of Supplication, cannot agree yet in <hi>one Prayer</hi> to him, though they have but <hi>one same thing</hi> to pray for to him: will not meet in their Worship because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they doe not in some Sentiments; and 'tis no wonder all Christ's reasonings and upbraidings, all the Advantages He does propose to them that love, the shames he casts on them that doe not, by putting them out of his Train into the condemnation of Publicans; 'tis no wonder all this does not work with them whom their own sufferings and black Calamities will not convince. There is not one of us but knows that thus our miseries began but few years since, and yet we that have suffered for and by our Divisions, whose quarrels wounded the whole Nation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and our selves, who have wept so much bloud at once to vent and to bewail our differences, are still as full of the same animosities as ever, and want nothing but opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to confound all again, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>our selves:</hi> And in the name of God what did <hi>Christ</hi> mean when He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd this Precept? when he disputed? prest it thus? or what doe <hi>Christians</hi> mean when they doe break and tear this Precept and themselves? Though I be farre from any hopes to reconcile our Parties, (as by Gods help I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> shall ever be from making any,) yet I will offer an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to make them not so noxious; namely, if they will keep the differences of their judgements from breaking out into their affections and actions. And though while meekness and obedience to Governours, and the whole constellation of Gospel-graces, doe not seem to shine so fair as man's own reputation, or humor, or possibly some strict opinion which they have own'd, and the shew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness that glitters in it, while 'tis thus, I say, we cannot look any party will yield, all doe or will believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to be in the right; Yet I will give them leave to think so, and my prescription shall concern them equally
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:109439:171"/>
although they be; and by addressing my Discourse to them that are so really, I shall conclude more forcibly them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that are not, who ere they be; for sure I am none can be more in the right than those whom <hi>Christ</hi> lays this injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon, than his <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> as relating to those that would be their Enemies as such: yet 'tis to them he speaks here; <hi>I say unto you, love your enemies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The words contain a <hi>Duty prescrib'd,</hi> and the <hi>Authority prescribing</hi> it: the Prescription and the Authority in these words, <hi>I say unto you,</hi> the Duty in the rest: where it is set down 1. in general: <hi>Love your enemies,</hi> and that to be consider'd under a double prospect: 1. As it is plao't in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> opposition to something that was before indulg'd the <hi>Jews,</hi> or presum'd so to be by them; signified here by the particle <hi>But;</hi> and then as it stands by itself, in its own positive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: <hi>love your enemies.</hi> And secondly, this Duty is particulariz'd in several exercises of the Act commanded, <hi>love,</hi> in relation to several sorts of the Objects of that Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>enemies:</hi> as 1. Those that <hi>curse</hi> you, you must <hi>bless:</hi> 2. Those that <hi>hate</hi> you, you must <hi>doe good</hi> to: 3. Those that <hi>use you despitefully and persecute you,</hi> you must <hi>pray for.</hi> These I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> shall treat of in their given order, beginning with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Duty, and viewing that at once in both the lights that it doth stand in, that one may clear and fortifie the other. <hi>But I say unto you, Love your enemies.</hi>

                  <p>Of all the Points of Christian Religion those which did most stagger the faith of some, and check their acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, or adherence to it, (saith <hi>Marcellinus</hi> writing to St. <hi>Austin)</hi> were these 3; The <hi>incarnation of our Lord:</hi> The <hi>meanness of his Miracles,</hi> which they thought the works of <hi>Apolloni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>in the Text,</hi> It seems they lookt upon these Duties as the mysteries of Practice; that spoke as loud a contradiction to their <hi>active principles</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> as the other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to doe so, those of <hi>Speculation</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> a <hi>God made flesh,</hi> and <hi>flesh and bloud</hi> made so lame and passive, sweetned so, being alike impossible to their belief: as if no flesh could certainly be so, except that of which God was made, and the <hi>Word incarnate</hi> onely could fulfill, <hi>these words</hi> here in my Text: they lookt upon this as a much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more mighty work than any of his Miracles; as if 'twere easier to snatch one out of the arms of Fate from the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Grave, than to receive an enemy into ones own: As if <hi>Christ</hi> had done more when he pray'd for his

Crucifiers then when he prayed <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his grave: for their Magicians, they say, vied Miracles with him, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> none of their Religions or Gods did ever aim at this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, <hi>ut quae sit propria bonit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s nostra;</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian;</hi> this being a sort of Piety peculiar to the Christians. Nor did they onely think it unpracticable, but unreasonable; as carrying opposition to all Government, to the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and peace of every Polity; for he that does require that I shall have no return of injuries, but for a wrong, makes me in debt a kindnesse, not onely supersedes judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary proceedings, but does secure Rapine by Law, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it by Reward; and truly if it were impossible for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him that does affect a person to dislike his evil actions, and to desire he may have condigne punishment, such as by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-measures may be satisfaction equal to his fault, and warning to himself and others, these men had reason: but if a Father can at once love and correct his Child; if when I am with indignation displeas'd at my offences against God, and by severities revenge them on my self, I do then love my self most passionately; and if I can pray with all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of my soul for that false Traytor-bosom-enemy, my flesh, while it lies goading me to sin, &amp; with temptation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecuting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> me to everlasting death, then no reason of State, or of my own Requires I should not doe all these acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to my Adversary. In that thou hast an exact pattern for thy enmity to them that wrong thee, and <hi>thou shalt hate thine enemy as thy self,</hi> is a most perfect Gospel-Rule: that being most consistent with and directive of this Duty, <hi>love your enemies.</hi> But yet there is so great a difference indeed betwixt this Act here and its object (Enemy being constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such by enmity, that is aversion and hate) that love, and that seem strangely coupled, things that can be put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> onely for a contest, just as heat and cold, to weaken one another, that both the love and enmity may be refract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a lukewarmnesse. Therefore I shall divide them, handling <hi>Love</hi> first by its self, viewing the import of that as it is sincere, lest the enemy appearing with it, make it shrink into a very slender Duty: and having done that, secondly, see whether an others enmity; and thirdly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enmity with that appropriation here, <hi>your enemies,</hi> can take off from the Obligation of that Duty, <hi>Love.</hi>

                  <p>Now if all these acts and the many other there are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to Love and all be under Obligation; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> says there, they are so much Duty, that without these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances all Faith and all Graces profit nothing: the preaching Rhetorick of <hi>men and Angels</hi> would be nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> else but <hi>tinkling,</hi> and <hi>working Miracles,</hi> but shewing tricks. It follows then these acts must necessarily have a certain object, there must be some body that we are bound to love thus: and if that Object be our Neighbour (as that is most sure) 'tis clear my Neighbours injury, or hate or enmity to me, cannot take off nor yet diminish in the least that obligation I have to all those acts, but I must love him though he be mine enemy in every of those instances.

                     </gap>ity does formally dispose and quallifie my Neighbour for the object of my love: and many of its acts cannot relate but to a man that injures me, it must be in respect to <hi>provocations</hi> that <hi>love</hi> is said to cool into such a temper as <hi>is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provokt;</hi> For men are not provokt with kindnesses. I cannot <hi>suffer</hi> any thing but <hi>wrong,</hi> nor <hi>suffer long</hi> except there be <hi>continuation</hi> and <hi>frequency</hi> of wrongs. Nor is it possible I should <hi>forgive</hi> unlesse it be <hi>offences</hi> done against me. And so for divers of the rest: Now it were strange <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Enemy should supersede the obligation of that Duty, which cannot be a Duty but in order to an Enemy; that injury should give me a release, from doing that which I can never have cause or occasion to do but in the case of injury; that I should have leave not to obey the Command for that meer reason which alone makes it possible to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it, and which alone makes the Command: whereas indeed because I must needs love in these expresses, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must needs be my Enemy whom I must love.</p>
                  <p>But if he be without all provocation very unjustly so, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> if his hate be his sin, so that he hath offended God too in it, may I not then espouse Gods quarrel thus farre, not to love his Enemy if I must mine own, not to love the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious,

I except here <hi>Apostacy</hi> and utter <hi>obduration in it;</hi> a state that incapacitates for mercy, and by consequence for love and kindnesse. There is a sin which S. <hi>John</hi> would not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> say that we should pray for, and the Church thought that <note place="margin">1 John <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note> there was such a sinner, <hi>Julian,</hi> but as to lesse degrees; they that are suppos'd <hi>to persecute Disciples,</hi> and in doing so <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute Christ himself,</hi> may well be granted <hi>sinners, enemies</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christianity;</hi> but yet says he, <hi>I say unto you, love these your enemies.

                     <hi>We do not write as fearing for our selves, or dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that we are like to suffer, for we did enter our Religion on the condition of suffering, we covenanted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and staked our lives when we began our profession; but 'tis for you we fear, for you our enemies, whom our Religion does command us to love and to do good to.</hi> And though we must hate Vice, and do our best to root out Infidelity and Atheisme, destroy Profanenesse, irreligion and Heresie and Schism: these are fit objects for the zeals of Hate, and for the feavers of our Passion, and if our enemies be such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we may meetly endeavour they may have appropriate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints, yet not to exercise the acts of Charity and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to them we have no allowance: no sins can make it

                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, the onely persons that the <hi>Jews</hi> pretended to have ground to hate were Enemies, and enemies indeed to their Religion, the Idolatrous Gentile-world, therefore that being now forbid to us, there is no sort of men, nor any man whom it is lawfull for a Christian not to love; and all the reasons urg'd here by our Saviour do prove that all mankind whether good or bad is the object of a Christians love: because God does good to all, his methods of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are universall; he makes his Clouds drop fatnesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> upon them that consume the encrease on their Lusts, and sacrifice it to their Riots, making their belly be their God: he gives abundance of his good things unto those that love them onely as they advantage Vanity and Sin, and that turn Gods store into provision for Vice and for Destruction. He gives gold to them that make gold their Idol, and bestows large portions of earth on them that are Children of Hell, and them who for the pleasures of that Earth despise his Heaven. Yea, the whole order of things does teach us this, the Creatures do service to the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> kind, they acknowledge the man, and not the Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Friend; but alike the rich and poor, the good and gratefull, the wicked and ungratefull too. The Sun does not collect his Rays and shed more day to guild the gaudy and gay person whose Cloaths and Jewels will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect his light, return him as much almost as he sends, and vie brightnesse with him, then he does to the poor dark, sordid raggs that even damp his beams: he sheds the same unpall'd Day even on those men that draw such streams of bloud as with their mists endeavour to put out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or stain his shine: the Ayr gives breath to them that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie it, as well as those that send it out a Perfume. Yea the Creatures of sense and perception do not yet discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their Lords, but with that same indifference serve all: <hi>the Oxe knows his Owner,</hi> and <hi>the Asse his Master,</hi> not his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psalm 1. 3.</note> nor his <hi>Vertues;</hi> and then as there is something in man as man which God is kind to, something in man as man for which the Creatures serve, so there is something in man as he is man which we must love, and consequently we must love every man. And till thou hast found one so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> much a Monster that no Creature will fear or obey, and such a one as God will shew no kindnesse to at all, will not let his Sun shine, or his Rain rain upon, but while as others

that if a kindness lye before me, and I have no reason to deny it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a man, but this because he hates me, I must not deny it him, and if Christs reasonings do inforce the other it will conclude this too.
