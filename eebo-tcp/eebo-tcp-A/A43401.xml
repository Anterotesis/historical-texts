            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>If that your Honour do require the cause,</l>
            <l>'Tis this, I was not able to expresse</l>
            <l>In you, what is Great <hi>Britains</hi> happinesse.</l>
            <l>I long was woo'd to write your deserv'd praise,</l>
            <l>And by so doing, promis'd was the Bayes,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Caesars Virgil</hi> wore, but tender yeers</l>
            <l>To write that subject, fill'd my Muse with fears;</l>

            <l>such as might make the starry host to wonder,</l>
            <l>And make great <hi>Iove</hi> forget that he can thunder.</l>
            <l>But I'me amaz'd, and this is all I feare,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Iove</hi> thinks himselfe not safe whilst Pembroke's here.</l>
            <l>Methinks I see how <hi>Mars</hi> looks pale to see</l>
            <l>A man in armes, more brave, more stout than hee:</l>

               <hi>Hebe</hi> was so orecome with his bright eyes,</l>

            <l>Of all true vertue, he is the worlds wonder,</l>

            <l>Not our convicting him of Traitors sin.</l>
            <l>His vertues all admired singing againe,</l>
            <l>Long live our King <hi>Charles</hi> and his Lord <hi>Chamberlane.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Long live our King &amp; crowne him with such Peers,</l>
            <l>That hee may reigne most joyfull many yeers.</l>
            <l>Your true hacht Eagle will not prey on flies,</l>
            <l>Nor good men blot themselves with treacheries:</l>
            <l>Vertue shall live, but Infamie kills dead</l>
            <l>Each sprouting fortune in her maidenhead.</l>
            <l>You that are stain'd with treasons inky blot,</l>
            <l>And envy those men which as you are not,</l>
            <l>Looke on our subject, Envy will grow milde,</l>
            <l>To hate this man none sure can be so vilde.</l>
            <l>Shall the whole kingdome ring a peale of praise</l>
            <l>Vnto your Honour, and shall not I raise</l>
            <l>My <hi>Ela</hi> straine, and stretch my throat to sing,</l>
            <l>Out-caroll all our birds i'th pleasant spring?</l>
            <l>But O! one vertue here among the rest</l>
            <l>I have observ'd, deserves the terme of best:</l>
            <l>Your Honors humble daigning to give eare</l>
            <l>Vnto the abjectst vassall that comes neere</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:93548:5"/>
Your Honor; but pray pardon my dull pen,</l>
            <l>That I should formost of an host of men</l>
            <l>Vncase my rustick Muse, which bawles so loud,</l>
            <l>As if begot of <hi>Ixion</hi> in a clowd.</l>
            <l>Your vertues do deserve a <hi>Virgils</hi> straine,</l>
            <l>An <hi>Ovids</hi> verse, and not a home-spun braine.</l>
            <l>The splendor of your vertues dim the skies,</l>
            <l>Which I can't looke on with a Buzzards eyes:</l>
            <l>Your Sailes spred high, with greatest fortunes flow,</l>
            <l>Excuse my gazing up, standing below.</l>
            <l>The Commons voice runs thus of you, <hi>I see</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The abstract of vertue, and Epitomee</l>
            <l>Of all Morality: He is the man</l>
            <l>That gaines the hearts of all, do what all can.</l>
            <l>Methinks 'tis non-sence to gainsay the right,</l>
            <l>Or to deny the Sun-beame gives cleare light:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Vox Populi</hi> doth speake, we all agree,</l>
            <l>Our best estates owe <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> a Fee,</l>
            <l>Which must be payd with love, for he loves all</l>
            <l>Which loyall are: Desert daserves no fall.</l>
            <l>O! had my Muse been eloquent to raise</l>
            <l>A phansie which might elevate the praise</l>
            <l>Of his scarse paraleld vertue, surely then,</l>
            <l>Writing his worth, I had got praise of men.</l>
            <l>But O, my wits were dull, I wanted straine,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Calliope</hi> slept, she was not in the vaine</l>
            <l>For to assist me. Yee Commons me excuse,</l>
            <l>If height of your good wishes I abuse:</l>
            <l>My wits were dull; but yet to after-age</l>
            <l>His merits shall be shewne upon the stage.</l>
