            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>Your friendship I shall never decline; and if <hi>Sophia</hi> be just, you have a warrant for you faith of mine. When I went for <hi>Gallia</hi> to take command of those Legions there, at parting, we fell into discourse of you, and the never-enough-admir'd <hi>Cicilia,</hi> whose beauties and vertues she always mention'd with admiration: I confessed to her, that her former descriptions had engaged my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to your Sisters fame so much, that I was resolved, in some disguise, to see her. O're-joyed with this news, she recommended you to me for a guide, And though I ever admir'd the honour I found in <hi>Facertes,</hi> yet I confess, I made a little stop ere I resolved to put my self in the power of one, whom I had tempted with such a ruine, as obeying my Fathers injunctions, had made me lay upon your suffering Country; to remove which doubt she blushed out this secret; I ask'd her then, why she suffer'd thee to be led in triumph? she said, she pleaded against it, what she durst, and had she loved less, she could have said more, but seeing her own guilt, she fear'd it might have been trouble to all: Now if this truth can satisfie <hi>Facertes,</hi> that I have not wrong'd him, and now I beg, he'l give me leave to return his vows, to <hi>Cicilia;</hi> and now I conjure thee by that power which thou hast given her, in <hi>Sophia</hi>'s name, here to bury all thy fears, all thy anger, all remembrance that I was a misfortune to thee, in return of which upon thy breast, the

When first my Eye met his, it shot a flame in here, and the nobleness of that Act (which was sacrific'd to you) shook me, and waked my sleeping Honour, and I began to find desires that till then were strangers here, for they had more of love then blood in them.—What's the business? <stage>One knocks.</stage>

                        <p>His Love to the Sister, and her merits, who has a virtue equal to her Beauty, made him forget the injuries which <hi>Virgilius</hi> (in ambitious honour, not malice) threw upon him; besides, it will be a guard for <hi>Sicily</hi> hereafter, and <hi>Facertes</hi> gains his ends upon them.</p>

                        <p>Yes, it was about a slave he saw, and fell in love with; and while he stay'd for money to redeem her, another bought her; I was not at the beginning, but, I thank my fate, I came time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to his Rescue.</p>

                        <p>Because I have the honour to be his friend; and though I serve his passion, yet I should be loath to see him continue his Love for a Slave, that has nothing but miseries for his Honour to work upon.</p>

O happy Island, that has one young man in it that will be charitable to the old woman: Every one strives to feed the young till their bellies burst again, while we praise and beg, and can scarce get'em to sell us their ware.—How now, what have we here? oh is it you? I'll retire.</p>

I am glad 'tis no worse; by my troth, Sir, if you will starve with meat before you, I will bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you, but I will never pity you; Love and Marriage are the only two mischiefs that belong to the Sex which I have not had, and therefore can onely prescribe you Wine and Women for a remedy.</p>

                        <p>No more, I'le sooner be reconcil'd to want, or sickness, then that Rascal; A thing, that my Charity made sociable; one, that when I smil'd would fawn upon me, and wag his stearn, like starved Dogs; so nasty, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany cried foh upon him; He stunk so of <hi>Poverty, Ale,</hi> and <hi>Bawdry.</hi> So poor and despicable, when I relieved him, he could not avow his calling, for want of a Cassock, but stood at Corners of Streets, and whisper'd Gentlemen in the Ear, as they pass'd, and so deliver'd his Wants like a Message which being done, the Rogue vanished, and would dive at Westminster like a Dabchick, and rise again at Temple-gate; The ingenuity of the Rascal, his Wit being snuft by want, burnt cleer then, and furnish'd him with a bawdy Jest or two, to take the Company; But now the Rogue shall find he has lost a Patron.</p>

                        <p>As I live, if I had thought you would have been in such a fury, you should never have known it.</p>

                        <p>Treacherous Rogue, he has always rayl'd against thee to me, as a danger his Friendship ought to give me warning of; and nightly cry'd, yet look back, and hunt not, with good Nature and the beauties of thy Youth, that false Woman; But hear thy Friend, that speaks from sad Experience.</p>

                        <p>I keep thee? prithee, wilt thou keep me? I know not why men are such Fools to pay? We bring as much to the sport, as Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; Keep thee?

                        <p>Faith, Wench, so wilt thou and thou beest wise, from him and all of them, and be rul'd by me, we'll abuse all the Sex, till they put a true value upon us.</p>

                        <p>But there may be Company, and they will say, we take too long time to trim. <hi>Secret.</hi> Give me the flowers my servant sent me, he sware 'twas the first the Wench made of the kind.</p>

                        <p>Marry, I would he would take exception, he should not want ill usage to rid me of his trouble; as I live, custom has made me so acquainted with him, that I now begin to think him not so displeasing, as at first; and if he fall not out with me, I must with him, to secure my self. Sure (Aunt) he must find Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son absent, for when a Question knocks at his head, the Answer tells that there is no body at home; I ask'd him, th'other day, if he did not find a blemish in his understanding, and he sware a great Oath, Not he; I told him 'twas very strange, for Fool was so visible an eye-sore, that neither Birth nor Fortune eould reconcile to me.</p>

                        <p>Faith, methinks his humour is good, and his purse will buy good company, and I can laugh and be merry with him sometimes.</p>

                        <p>Why, pray, Aunt, take him to your self, and see how merry we will be; I can laugh at any bodies Fool, but mine own.</p>

                        <p>By my troth, but that I have married one Fool already, you should not have him. Consider, he asks no portion, and yet will make a great joynture; a Fool with these conveniences, a kind loving Fool, and one that you may govern, makes no ill hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; Niece, there are other Arguments too, to bid a Fool wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which you will find without teaching; think of it, Niece; you may lay out your affection to purchase some dear wit, or judgement of the City, and repent, at leisure a good bargain, in this Fool.</p>

                        <p>Faith, Aunt, Fools are cheap in the Butchery, and dear in the Kitchin; they are such unsavory infipid things that there goes more charge to the sauce then the Fool is worth, ere a woman can confidently serve him, either to her bed or board; then if he be a loving Fool, he troubles all the world a days, and me all night.</p>

                        <p>See if the air of this place has not enclin'd <hi>Secret</hi> to be a Baud already. No, <hi>Secret,</hi> you get no Gowns that way, Upon my word; if I marry, it shall be a Gentleman that has wit and honour, though he has nothing but a sword by his side; such a one naked is better then a Fool with all his Trappings, Bells and Baubles.</p>

                        <p>Why, as I live, he's a handsome fellow, and merry; mine is such a sad soul, and tells me stories of Lovers that dy'd in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, and of the lamentable end of their Mistresses (according to the Ballad) and thinks to win me by Example.</p>

                        <p>Faith mine talks of nothing but how long he has lov'd me; and those that know me not, think I am old, and still finds new causes, (as he calls them) for his love; I ask'd him the other day if I chang'd so fast or no.</p>

                        <p>Your Nephew? not I, As I live; he looks as if he would be woo'd; I'll warrant you, he'l never begin with a woman till he has lost the opinion of himself; But since you are so courteous, I'le speak to his friend, and let him know how you suffer for him.</p>

                        <p>Him! marry God bless all good women from him; why, he talks as if the Dairy-maid and all her Cows could not serve his turn; then they wear such baudy-breeches, 'twould startle an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest woman to come in their company, for fear they should break, and put her to count from the fall of them; for I'le warrant, the year of the Lord would sooner out of her head then such a sight.</p>

                        <p>I am not such an enemy now to his humour as to your Nephews, he rails against our sex, and thinks by beating down the price of women to make us despair of Merchants; But if I had his heart-strings tied on a True-lovers-knot, I would so firk him till he found physick in a Rope.</p>

                        <p>Why, he swore, he had a better opinion of her then to think she had her Maiden-head; but if she were that Fool, and had preserv'd the toy, he swore he would not take the pains of fetching it, to have it; I confess, I would fain be reveng'd on them, because they are so blown up with opinion of their wit.</p>

                        <p>Mine! oh God help me, mine's a healthy Fool, I would he were subject to pine and take things unkindly; there were some hope to be rid of him; for I'll undertake to use him as ill as any body.</p>

                        <p>Overcome! I think so, he might have won a City his way; for when he saw you were resolv'd he should not eat with you, he would set himself down as if he meant to besiege us, and had vow'd never to rise till he had taken us in; and because our sex forbad force, he meant to do it by famine; yet you may stay, and miss a better market; for hang me, I am of <hi>Secrets</hi> opinion; he had but two faults, a handsome fellow, and too soon deny'd.</p>

                        <p>'Tis true, he was a handsome fellow, and a civil, that I shall report him; for as soon as it was given him to understand; I desir'd he would come no more, I never saw him since, but by chance.</p>

                        <p>There were divers exceptions; But that which angred me then, was, he came with the Kings Letters Patents, as if he had been to take up a wife for his Majesties use.</p>

those merry days, a Bailiff trode the streets with terror, when all the Chains in the City were rusty, but Mr. Sheriffs, when the people knew no evil but the Constable and his Watch; Now every Committee has as much power, and as little manners, and examines with as much ignorance, impertinence and authority, as a Constable in the Kings key.</p>

Take wise Men from Cuckolds, and fools to make them; for your wise Man draws eyes and suspition with his visit, and begets jealous thoughts in the Husband, that his Wife may be overcome with his parts; when the fool is welcome to both, pleaseth both, laughes with the one, and lies with the other, and all without suspition; I tell thee, a fool that has money is the Man. The wits and the we's, which is a distinct Parreal of Wit bound by it self, and to be sold at <hi>Wit-hall,</hi> or at the sign of the Kings-head in the Butchery; these wise things will make twenty jealous, ere one Man a Cuckold; when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of fools will head a Parish ere they are suspected.</p>

                        <p>I am but a poor Souldier, and yet never reach'd to the Honour of being a Lover; yet from my own observations, Master <hi>Sadd,</hi> take a Truth; 'tis a folly to believe any Woman loves a Man for being constant to another, they dissemble their hearts onely; and hate a Man in Love worse then a Wencher.</p>

                        <p>I would he would; for as 'tis, there's no hopes amongst the Ladies; besides, 'tis such an example to see a King and Queen good, Husband and Wife, that to be kind will grow out of fashion.</p>

                        <p>Nay, that's not all, for the women grow malicious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not courted; nay, they bred all the last mischiefs, and call'd the Kings chastity a neglect of them.</p>

                        <p>Thou art in the right; An <hi>Edward,</hi> or a <hi>Harry,</hi> with <hi>seven Queens in Buckram,</hi> that <hi>Haught</hi> among the men, and <hi>Stroakt</hi> the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are the Monarchs they wish to bow to; they love no tame Princes, but Lyons in the Forest.</p>

                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>Why, and those were properly call'd the Fathers of their People, that were indeed akine to their Nobility; now they wear out their youth and beauty, without hope of a monumental Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad, or Trophee of a Lie-bell that shall hereafter point at such a Lord, and cry that is the royal Son of such a one.</p>

                        <p>And these were the ways that made them powerful at home; for the City is a kind of tame Beast; you may lead her by the horns any whither, if you but tickle them in the ear sometimes. Queen <hi>Bess,</hi> of famous memory, had the trick on't; and I have heard them say, <hi>In Eighty eighty,</hi> er'e I was born, as well I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, she rode to <hi>Tilbury</hi> on that bonny Beast, the Mayor.</p>

as much to say, I belong to such a Lord; the next with B for an elder Brother; C for such a Knight; D possest with melancholy, and at her breast you may knock an hour er'e you get an answer, and then she'l tell you there's no lodging there; she has a constant fellow Courtier that has taken up all her heart to his own use: in short, All are dispos'd of, but the good Mother; and she comes in like the Sabbath, at the weeks end; and I warrant her make any one rest that comes at her.</p>

                        <p>And what think you, is not this finely carryed? you that are about the King, counsel him, if he will have his sport fair, he must let the Game be free, as it has been in former Ages; then a stranger that has wit, good means, and handsome cloaths, no sooner enters the privy Chamber, and beat about with three graceful legs, but he spring a Mistress that danc'd as well as he, Sung better, as free as fair; those at first sight could speak, for wit is always acquainted: These fools must be akin er'e they can speak; and now the friends make the bargain, and they go to Bed er'e they know why.</p>

                        <p>Faith, he's in the right, you shall have a Buzzard now hover and beat after a pretty Wench, till she is so weary of him she's forc'd to take her Bed for covert, and find less danger in being truss'd then in flying.</p>

the upper house would Cross it; Besides, they ought to do it, Death! they provide against cutting down old Trees, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving high-ways and Post-horses, and let pretty Wenches run to decay?</p>

I believe 'tis the first time you have found them lie at the sign of the Page, Foot-men and gilded Coaches; They were wont to lodge at the thin Cloak, they and their Muses made up the Family; And thence sent Scenes to their Patrons, like Boyes in at windowes, and one would return with a Dublett, another with a pair of Breeches, a third with a little ready Money; which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their credit with a company, in three Tearms you rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saw a Poet repaired.</p>

                        <p>Why, the Devil ought us a shame it seems. You know I went home to give <hi>Wanton</hi> an accompt how we advanc'd in our design; and when I was writing the superscription, I remember the Boy came in and told me the Lady <hi>Love-all</hi> pass'd by.</p>

                        <p>Faith, 'tis a truth, this I shall say, you may all better your pleasures by, if you will observe it; I dare say, the fear of telling keeps more women honest then <hi>Bridewell</hi> Hemp; And were you wise men, and true Lovers of liberty, now were the time to bring wenching to that perfection no age could ever have hoped; now you may sow such seed of pleasure, you may be prayed for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; Now, in this Age of zeal and Ignorance, would I have you four, in old cloathes, and demure looks, present a Petition to both Houses, and say, you are men touched in Conscience for your share in that wicked ness which is known to their worships by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Adultery, and desire it may be death, and that a Law may be pass'd to that purpose; How the women will pray for you, and at their own charges rear Statu's in memory of their Benefactors; the young and kind would then haunt your Chambers, Pray, and present you, and Court the Sanguine youth, for the sweet sin se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by such a Law; None would lose an Occasion, nor chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly oppose kind Nature, nor refuse to listen to her summons, when youth and Passion calls for those forbidden sweets; when such security as your lives are at stake, who would fear to trust; with this Law all Oaths and Protestations are cancell'd; Letters and Bawdes would grow useless too; By instinct the Kind will find the Kind; and having one nature become of one mind; Now we lose an Age, to observe and know a mans humour, ere we dare trust him; But get this Law, then 'tis, like and enjoy; and whereas now, with expence of time and Fortune, you may glean some one Mistriss amongst your neighbours wives, you shall reap women whole Armfulls as in the Common field; there is one small Town, wise onely in this Law; and I have heard them say, that know it well, There has been but one Execution this hundred years; yet the same party searched seven years, and could not find an honest wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Town.</p>

                        <p>Why, one I have absolute Power over, the other's at large; Your Servant Lovers are those take Mistresses upon tryal, scarce give them a Quarters warning before they are gone.</p>

All things for nothing; then they are the diligent'st and the humblest things a Woman can employ; Nay, I ha' seen of them tame, and run loose about a house; I had one once, by this light, he would fetch and Carry, go back, seek out, he would do any thing; I think some Faulconer bred him.</p>

                        <p>The same, self-same. And by this hand, I was barbarous to her, for your Aunts sake; and had I not scap'd that mischief of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, By this light, I had had never seen her again; but I was resolv'd not to quit her, till I was sure of a wife, for fear of what has follow'd; had I been such an Ass as to have left her upon the Aiery hopes of a widows Oaths; what a case had I been in now? You see, your Aunt's provided of a man. Bless him, and send him patience, 'twould have been fine to have seen me walking, and sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon cold hunting, seeking my whore again, or forc'd to make use of some common mercenary thing that sells sin and diseases, crimes, penance and sad repentance together; here's consolation and satisfaction, in <hi>Wanton,</hi> though a man lose his meal with the widow. And, faith, be free, how do you like my Girle; rid thee of her; what do's she want now, pray, but a joynture, to satisfie any honest man? speak your conscience; Ladies don't you think a little repentance, hereafter, will serve, for all the small sins that good nature can act with such a sinner?</p>

Out, 'tis Mercenary and base; The generous heart has onely the Laws of Nature and kindness in her view; and when she will oblige, Friend is all the ties that nature seeks, who can both bear and excuse those kind crimes; And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, one as poor as the despis'd <hi>Captain,</hi> and neglected Courtier, may make a woman as happy in a Friendship as Master <hi>Sadd,</hi> who has as many faults as we have debts; one, whose Father had no more credit with Nature, then ours had with Fortune; whose soul wears Rags as well as the <hi>Captains</hi> body.</p>

                        <p>Alas, you mistake me, Madam, I am Epilogue now; the Captain's within; and as a friend I counsel you, not to incense the Gentlemen against the Poet, for he knows all your story; and if you anger him he'l put it in a Play; but if you'l do friendly offices, I'll undertake, instead of your Pearl you lost, to help you to the Jewel, the Scotch Dictionary will tell you the value of it; let them go alone, and fret not at their loss; stay, and take my counsel, it shall be worth three revenges.</p>

                        <p>They say, you have a great power over the Parson; if you can prevail with him to express his anger in some Satyrick Comedy (for the knave has wit, and they say his genius lies that way,) tell him, 'tis expected he should be revenged upon the illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Courtier that made this Play; if you can bring this business about, I may find a way, as Epilogue, to be thankful, though the Captain abus'd you to day. Think on't, <hi>Stephen</hi> is as handsome, when the Play is done, as Mr. <hi>Wild</hi> was in the Scene.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Love.</speaker>
                        <p>There's something of reason in what he says.—But my friend, how shall one believe you; you that were such a Rascal to day, in Buff, is it to be hoped you can be honest only with putting on a black cloak? well, I'll venture once again; and if I have any power, he shall sting the malicious Rascal; and I think he is fit for such a business. I'me sure he has the worst tongue; and a conscience that neither honour nor truth binds; and therefore 'tis to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if he will rail in publick he may be even with your Poet; I will cloath and feed him and his Muse this seven years, but I will plague him: <hi>Secret</hi> tells me, 'twas your Poet too that pawn'd me, to day, in the Tavern.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>By my faith, did he; nay 'twas he that told me of your friendship with <hi>Jolly.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Love.</speaker>
                        <p>I wonder the Parson has been so long silent; a man of his coat and parts, to be beaten with a pen, by one that speaks sence by rote, like Parots; one that knows not why sence is sence, but by the sound; one that can scarce read, nay, not his own hand; well, remember your promise.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>Leave it to me, he is yours; and if our Plot take, you shall all have your shares in the mirth; but not the profit of the Play; and the Parson, more then his Tythe, a second day.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Love.</speaker>
                        <p>We will discourse of this some other time; and pray dispatch what 'tis you have to say to this noble company, that I may be gone; for those Gentlemen will be in such fury, if I stay; and think, because we are alone, God knows what.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>'Tis no matter what they think, 'tis not them we are to study now; but these guests, to whom pray address your self civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and beg that they would please to become Fathers, and give those Brides within; what say you, Gentlemen, will you lend your hands to joyn them; the Match you see is made; if you refuse, <hi>Stephen</hi> misses the Wench, and then you cannot justly blame the Poet. For you know, they say, that alone is enough to spoil the Play.</p>

it hit; For <hi>Sforza</hi> is this day to set out from <hi>Pavia,</hi> which will give an occasion fit for our design; our doubt was, where to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt him; 'twas my opinion in the wood, when he is past the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; But <hi>Count Baptista</hi> believes 'twill be safer, when he passes the Ferry; I have whetted him on with repeating of his Injuries; and <hi>Carlo</hi> hath so confirmed him, that his banishment was procured by <hi>Sforza</hi> (who is now his Rival in <hi>Fidelia</hi>'s Love) that he is ready for any mischief, so she may be his reward, which we assured him, with a Restitution to all his Possessions when <hi>Cosmo</hi> reigned, which must be performed.</p>

                        <p>Passing through the Privy Gallery to my Fathers Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which you know joyns upon your Mothers Cabinet, I heard some laugh, which made me curious to listen; where I heard such light airy things as suit not with these times, nor our distracted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; and one (I will not name) with wicked mirth made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those dangers that now besiege my fathers life; At which my anger made me look, to see who they were; more amazed at the sight, then at the sound of those words: For the old beggar (we use to give our Alms to) was with them; He stood upright, no age nor wrinkles in his Face, nor silver hair on head or beard; he whisper'd something to the Dutchess, at which she laugh'd; and I could hear the Villain say, by to morrow Sun-set she should see no air of <hi>Sforza;</hi> and to his horrid wish bloody <hi>Martino</hi> said, Amen. But that which most cuts my soul, was, to find the Dutchess of this Councel.</p>

                        <p>Oh! Madam: That Villain I have long trembled at, fearing his counsel would at last tend to some horrid mischief; she is my mother, I shall therefore neither Judge nor revile her; though my heart weeps for her; let heaven speak to her, and tell her what Duty she owes to them, and give me piety enough to pay mine to her.</p>

                        <p>Your griefs are now unseasonable, pray defer them, and consider what is to be done to save my brother from their Malice; Your commands are more powerful far then mine, I will not doubt a sisters Interest; Let us write our fears, and assure him that there is a Plot laid for his life, and acquaint him with the relapse, and suddain danger that my father is fallen into; he will then know how necessary his presence must be here; but counsel him to come pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in some disguise, and we will expect him at your Chamber; while you write this, I will call <hi>Phillipine,</hi> to whose care we will give it.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I have letters here second yours, and from your best Friends, such whose affection, Faith, nor duty, ought to be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; They are full of Amaze and Wonder, to finde your Highness will so tamely consent to lose a Countrey that cost so much blood to purchase; Was not <hi>Cosmo</hi> born Prince of <hi>Pavia?</hi> how think you, Sir, a man of his Spirit, and Title to the Place, should consent to hold his birth-right for another? You are deceived, Sir; Nor were <hi>Cosmo</hi> fit for your Friendship, if his Spirit could grow so tame and degenerate, as to set a Slave upon his Fathers Throne; Come, Sir, 'tis Flattery and dissimulation, and they are all false; this is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your best Friends.</p>

                        <p>Take heed, <hi>Richardo;</hi> yet your love pleads in this indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; but do not presume; You know, I dare be angry, though it be long before a friend can finde it; your faith shall priviledge you to as much freedom as any Subject can pretend with his Prince; but impertinency and rudeness no discreet man will Commit. Hadst thou said, <hi>Julia, Carlo,</hi> and <hi>Martino</hi> had been false, thou hadst found my faith; for I know they have wrought my disgrace, and 'tis their business to break the Friendship betwixt Prince <hi>Cosmo</hi> and my self; and against those Traytors thy words would have raised a Tempest in my heart; For against that Villain <hi>Martino,</hi> (till my Revenge finds him) even my soul makes War; for I know him ungrateful, bloudy, and all the several ills that make a Villain are met in that inhumane Wretch, and my very dreams arm against him; But when thou sayest all are false, including the Princess <hi>Fidelia;</hi> That Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall questions the truth of that guilt which the rest are condemned for; No, <hi>Richardo,</hi> she has no share in that Treachery, she is all
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61734:91"/>
softness; piety and vertue are so natural to her that, for her sake, I can scarce be angry with the rest; For when her name but cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses my thought's, I can do nothing with Passion, save love <hi>Fidelia;</hi> Oh, Friend, thou dos't not know that Noble mind; and when thou shalt be acquainted with her thou wilt confess; The Princess <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia</hi>'s vertues were given her, as Cordials, to defend us against the Poison of her Family; and if thou lovest <hi>Sforza,</hi> Honour and serve the Princess.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I find many Lovers complain of Love, and the heavy burthens he lays upon them; yet few or none make haste to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves, but rather patiently lie down under their loads; your Highness now complains of two hard Masters, Love and Honour, and you make a difficulty of obeying either; Reason counsels you to prefer one, your Passion t'other; and to me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears easier then your part in both; for your Idle thought of coward, <hi>Cosmon</hi> is know above it; and if the Princess be all your aim, if her favour be your ambitious hope, as you say, What need you thus hunt your own dangers, and pursue her Brother, and your Prince, upon a most unreasonable jealousie; unless you will give satisfaction to others, by disobliging her that you profess to love and value above the world.</p>

We owe the root no thanks, while it lies sleeping in the ground; but when by the spring awakened, it sends forth its Clusters, then we cherish and admire the Vine, hoping to taste the rich Elixar. Love is that Root, and Love may bear such Fruit as may oblige a Mistress, by being diligent, finding and taking all occasions to serve her; yet then the Lover but obeys his Master; and to a Lover such an Act
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61734:93"/>
both makes and pays the debt; And this Consideration, <hi>Antonio,</hi> makes me pursue my first resolution; for since I can pretend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Princess but what is due to a person of honour, I must be careful to preserve that honour which is currant through the world; and till the Princess loves <hi>Cosmo,</hi> I must not let her kindness to a Brother make me unfit for the friendship or value of that Brother, by tamely suffering injuries.</p>

discover my self to <hi>Baptista,</hi> and make him write a Letter to my Mother and <hi>Martino,</hi> wherein he shall onely mention the Prince is escaped, and conceal his own Condition; He shall write to them that they should trust me with any design, as one he knowes faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fit for their purpose. This recommendation will admit me to their Councells; he shall tell them too, that he has seized me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Order, and that I shall be private and safe in his custody till their Order require me; 'twill keep off the suspition of who I am, or fear of my coming till they send for me.

                        <p>Thinkes Prince <hi>Sforza</hi> I will justifie her follies? why else do's he stab me with a repetition of them? Do's your Highness think to heal my wounded Mind by telling me you have forgiven my Mother? Do's that take away her faults? No, but shewes her guilt, and his vanity greater, and urged but to upbraid me, and civilly tell me how much better he deserves then I. Yet, if I had not been mistaken, you would not have forgot, that I, to keep a spotless Friendship with Prince <hi>Sforza,</hi> have erred even against Nature, abandoning a Mothers and a Brothers Interest, in quitting all the world to justifie the value I had of him above it; and had

                        <p>Gentle, Sister, why this passion? what is there more in his words then you your self have feared? had you rather we should all perish, then hear your danger from a Friend? Had a third person told you, would not you have broke the glass that brought you poyson? Good Heaven, I, without blushing, dare profess my self a Lover too, yet will not assume such a partial Dominion over his mind, as to prohibit him speaking what is just and honest; and if it be a truth, what he has said, me-thinks you are much to blame.</p>

                        <p>He that can be ungratefull will upon occasion be all that is ill; To avoid which opinion, I shall now endeavour to justifie my self Loyal to my Prince, just to those Lawes that must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this State, and yet not forget to be gratefull to my Friend. The many Obligations I owe to the <hi>Count Martino</hi> are well known both to your Highness and this Assembly. And that, I hope, will excuse me, notwithstanding the past vote, if I shall (as far as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Justice shall authorize me) in this Assembly, defend the Honour of my Patron. First, I would gladly see a legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the <hi>Count;</hi> let the Crime appear, and then the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Let the dead body of Prince <hi>Cosmo</hi> be produced, upon which all this business depends: For who knowes he is kill'd? who saw the Body? There appears to me onely a report made by her Highness, who received the relation from a Pilgrim. 'Tis granted, her condition and authority ought to find faith and pity.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61734:103"/>
Yet when Life and Honour are at stake, Justice cannot appear too circumspect; And though I will not deny he is dead, yet I will hope he lives, till I see some proof more visible; here is onely a passenger reports it; her Highness (like a kind Mother) believes her fears; and I, like the faithfull Servant of the unfortunate <hi>Count,</hi> will hope 'tis but her fears. And notwithstanding <hi>Count Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi>'s Passion, I shall believe this Action in me has much more Humanity then his sentence; I am sure, 'tis Charity, at least, to wish all men innocent; I know, Sir, the <hi>Count</hi> has many Enemies; your Highness trust and favour has made him fit for Malice; and who knowes but this is an Arrow of her shooting? Nay, I know he has been threatened, and when there is occasion will produce to whom. But to the business; here is a Letter produced, and they say the <hi>Counts</hi> hand is to it, and another that subscrib'd put out: why may not those that put out one name, put in another? <hi>Baptista</hi> is the <hi>Counts</hi> Accuser, you all know he was his Enemy, and I know he had reason to be so; yet 'twas your Highness service that gave him that reason: For the <hi>Count</hi> being certain he had ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous designes, not fit for a Subject to arrive at, (rather then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust him, by telling him he was not worthy of what he aimed at) in Policy, to keep the State quiet, kept him banished. Never smile, my Lord, for this is truth, though the Camp knew it not; And Prince <hi>Sforza</hi> knowes, <hi>Fidelia</hi> was their quarrel; for whom the <hi>Count Baptista</hi> has alwayes born an ambitious Passion.</p>

In whose name I onely desire Justice; Prove his Crime, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Treason; shew the Body, proceed Legally, and if <hi>Carlo</hi> be not as ready to pronounce his sentence, as any, then accuse me; But since no one here saw the Prince dead, or wounded, Give me leave, again, to say I hope he is living; and that hope is more kind to the prince, and has more Charity in it, my Lord, then all that furious desire of Revenge which your malice shews; And if you loved Prince <hi>Cosmo,</hi> or vertue, as you pretend, you had rather he were living, and the Count <hi>Martino</hi> Innocent, then to have a prince murthered, that your hate might then see your Enemy destroyed.</p>

                        <p>'Tis visible enough in thy impudence; will your Highness be pleased to read your Letter, and behold those wounds upon your own flesh; the rest was a Fame I onely met; here is the Traytors hand set to this blood, is that too little to convince a Traytor? Good God? how black and partial is this Court grown; when a few gilded words, (from a party in this mischief) should be able to divert Justice from her Course? and my honest heart must humbly beg pardon, if I take liberty at full to answer this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Creature; The first part of my wonder is, to find, even the best men are grown tame by Custome; slaved so by a favorite, that their mindes are scarce left free; Even their thoughts are led in Chains, and either dare not, or will not see, blinded either by fear, or Interest, through the mist his greatness throws before their eyes, else We might have grown wise, by our Neighbours miseries, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then have cherished a Frozen Viper; And whereas he boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of his dead Masters Trust, Ask the deceased soul of Great <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,</hi> whether <hi>Martino</hi> be not a false and a bloody Villain? Nay, ask this Assembly, whether he was not a Traytor to that Master? And since I am urged, I must say, I know <hi>Martino</hi> sold the Battel of <hi>Pavia;</hi> And he that would then sell his old Master, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, will not stick to betray the new one, when he finds a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; But he has now no need of these low Arts to rise by. Here he finds his way prepar'd, and, by easie steps now gains his designs; Lust, Covetousness, and flattery, in others, make his way; Who finding he growes powerful in your Highness mind, there rests one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, darkly to tell what he designs; And then let Signior <hi>Carlo,</hi> and his Emissaries, with all Arts and Diligence, strive who should first understand or serve his will, and procure that his ambitious desires may be offered ere he please to ask them; Nay, to such a height of Impudence his faction is grown, that here, even in the presence of your highness, where the Assembly is made up of the Royal Blood; One of them, and That, our Prince, calling for Justice; for those wounds which yet bleed in our Eyes, instead of punishing the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Behold, with what impudence one of his Parasites dares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, urging his honours, and his Trusts, so many Armys raised. Fool, those are so many Crimes onely, so many stains, so many why's he should be torn in pieces, being lost, or sold; I speak my own knowledge, this is a secret of the camps, Sir, that holp to buy one of them; since which my soul has abhorr'd the Traytors more for selling that gallant Prince, then him he has murd'red now.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I shall not dispute against your Highness; yet being called this day where my Honour and Conscience are both at stake, I shall claime the liberty of an honest man, that I may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my duty both to my Prince and Countrey. What I have said, Sir, is truth; and if I make it not appear, let me answer it with my life; And the day has been, when your Highness would not have check'd me for speaking truth; Nor this Table have let any one man grow so great, by his guilt, that we durst not accuse him; 'Tis an ill President thus to encourage Traytors. Had <hi>Martino</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under your Justice when he sold his first Master, 'twould not have been a crime, in me, to have accused him now. What makes <hi>Carlo</hi> defend him, but he finds he is grown so powerful? non dare speak their fears; And your Highness bounty has so chang'd his condition, and set such a stamp upon him, that he appears the greater part of your self; Nay, the honest part of the world sticks not to say you have forgot what he was. Take heed, Sir, his wickedness be not called yours too; for his Crimes are such, even the Women (you see) have lost their pity for him, and I pray Heaven, it be not too late for your Highness, or Justice it self, to take notice of him; So powerful he is, that the Law dares not speak to him; and he is now so guilty, that he is become Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; for who is beyond the Laws reach, He is more guilty; And, if not prevented, we shall see him begin to give Laws both to your self and people; to prevent which, again, I beg your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would but read that letter; Behold these wounds, do they speak less then destruction to the name of <hi>Sforza?</hi> Grant <hi>Cosmo</hi> living, Is he Innocent? Behold these wounds given your own Bowels; Do Justice for these, and Justice is easie to all but the wicked; Mercy is first due to the Innocent, and from them, let the guilty beg, and find it; 'tis safer far, then to leave the Innocent to the mercy of a Traytor.</p>

                        <p>For the Princes wounds, I can say nothing, but mourn the unhappy accident; The Count made his own answer to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and for the Letter, it ought to be punished with exquisite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and death, if (as your Highness says) it be proved his; I know his hand, but cannot say, upon life and death, this is his, since the Count denies it; the Souldier would give some light in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, could your Highness prevail to have him produced; 'tis not well to conceal or dismiss him at this time, in a business thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant; for his evidence would sway much, either to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or convicting of the Count; Treason has that curse with her, she is never quite rooted out; nor justice cannot cut so even, but even truth and innocence it self may suffer.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61734:106"/>
cold effect of a dull thoughtless Act, which every Beast and Bird does as well as we; and before it should be said I love <hi>Cosmo</hi> for those Reasons, he should this night fill a grave, with those foolish souls we have condemned, while the brave, the daring and the fortunate were adopted; and I will still believe the Conqueror is our Son, who ere he be; and <hi>Cosmo</hi> changed in the Cradle, though the false Nurse deny it.

                        <p>And why shouldst thou not again be honest? Threats are lost where they meet Minds resolved like ours; yet if thou dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est save these, they will pray so faithfully for thee, that thou maist kill me and be forgiven; All the horrour thou canst put into thy look I can despise; for the valiant man, in his first thought, digests the necessity of death; And since we cannot avoid that sight, I have long since Philosophyed upon my grave, as the second womb, and the certain way to the other world, as my Mothers led to this; and he that is honest onely sees those dangers. The guilty trembling Coward, 'tis he that tasteth the bitter cup, while his pale Soul labours and feels the throws of every apprehended Dart, whose anguish <hi>(Gentle Fidelia)</hi> is in leaving thee, and kind <hi>Victoria;</hi> Those that fear him suffer in every thought, and languish in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; For, dying, not death is the wound; and when death will appear, though in a Fever, <hi>Martino, Carlo,</hi> Treason and the Sword, are there.</p>

                        <p>O <hi>Sforza,</hi> talk of death, but not of parting; when we can die without that, these threatned wounds are welcome; Fever, Sword, nor Treason, I fear not, they are our slaves, and would be tame things if death and malice (Enemies to Nature and <hi>Fidelia)</hi> did not set them on to destroy Noble <hi>Sforza.</hi> O be still that good man, and let not these Villains prevail with thee to murther the Prince; Hell and curses are on their side, Innocence and Virtue on the Princes; if thou kil'st him, thou art damn'd; save him, and become an Angel.</p>

The horrour of her designes I will present unto her as things executed; and when I have brought her to a repentance, and a despair of Peace, then, as a Mercy beyond her hopes or merit, she shall know how Heaven has miraculously preserved her innocency from all this blood; This way I hope to reclaim that unfortunate Woman, now the authors of her sins are gone.</p>

The Duke must die ere they can Wed; for since we are stept in, we must now go thorough with the work: Lust and ambition know no bounds; and rather then we will see my <hi>Cosmo</hi> less then we design him, we will raise new diseases, scourges of the time, and Act what Age and sickness could not do.

His person is not his crime, he made it not; and if his mind had been good, I could with honour enough have listned to his passion; but his soul is as crooked as his body, and that is an imperfection that honour cannot be reconciled to; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,

Custom has made his importunities less troublesome then they were before; Especially when I consider, how much more afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Love must be to himself, in being the Lover, while despis'd, then to me that am beloved; for while I endure the hearing of it he has the Torment of suffering those pains he would describe, whose cure is desperate; for he knows my heart is vowed to <hi>Lucius,</hi> whose return he dreads; And I am confident he would kill him, if he durst Anger me; for, amongst all his crimes, Coward is none.</p>

Let us part and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace; whether we meet again or no, we are <hi>Romans</hi> still; <hi>Manlius,</hi> our Honour and our Lives lie in thy hands; And I am pleas'd to think the <hi>Roman Eagle</hi> has such a Protectour; If they force the pass, <hi>Lucius</hi> and my self will be ready to receive them.</p>

Why should <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the Mistress of all the world, hunt poor <hi>Amadeo,</hi> and warr against him, to make his people more miserable then Nature has design'd them; Here we live contented with our own, though the place be so poor that curious Travellers are scarce tempted to pass through it, to enjoy the fruitfull vales of <hi>Lombardy;</hi> What can ye hope by making us your slaves? Rich Mines we have none, Odours, Spices, and the Silk-worm are strangers here. These streams no shels with Orient Pearl afford, our sands breed no strife-full Gold; These Rocks have veins, but far from the blew Saphyr; The Ruby, Emrauld, nor the Diamond, grow not here. Innocence and Peace of Mind is all the wealth we boast of: And our Freedom the only Jewel we defend, which we will keep to the last Man; and the <hi>Romans</hi> shall alwaies find us strong enough to kill our selves, though we cannot destroy our Enemies.</p>

a time, saith she, for <hi>Amadeo</hi> to shew his vertue; now 'tis time to treat with honour; now when you cannot only defend your self, but destroy the Foe; if ever you hope to make a peace with this great enemy, neither rob nor disarm them; if they fight for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to command the world, they will not forgive a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor forget a benefit; what we have done this day, and all the wounds we have given to this place, was for our honour and safety; but what we shall act further, if you pursue them, will look like a desire of revenge or hatred; and make the world believe if we could have conquer'd we would never have treated; then she turn'd to me, and having received absolute power from her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Manlius,</hi> says she, is Brother to the noble <hi>Lucius,</hi> and friend to the most excellent of men, Princely <hi>Otho;</hi> and <hi>Manlius</hi> has ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which will weigh down the scale of <hi>Amadeo.</hi> Thus when she had made me blush with praise of my self; with our Arms and Honour she commanded we should in safety pass to pay the debt her Brother owes Prince <hi>Otho;</hi> and when you see the General of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our friendship to him, offer these few lives and swords we have left to serve him and the Roman Eagles; offer all, but our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, for a peace; and let it be such a one as we may not blush to receive, nor the Romans despise us for accepting; and if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gain his friendship upon these terms, here you shall find us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to defend, with our antient vertue, both our Fame and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with minds resolved for what fates soever the Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point us.</p>

There is no disease so Princely as to fall by the sword when he must dye; sickness and old age take away from that Majesty that Reverence men pay us: who can adore us as Gods on earth, when they see the Gout Cramp us, or a saucy ague shake a Princes soul out? No, <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> when Fate will call me to my Doom, let me meet it in a pitch'd Battle, against a gallant enemy; then we fall like our selves, and our Funerals are waited on with thousands of loyal Souldiers; those that live to wither here till old age waste their souls, dye common deaths; and go to heaven like private men, and pass unregarded like some melancholy Ghost.</p>

                        <p>The Noblest of <hi>Romans!</hi> I am not envious, nor proud, yet the Noblest, me-thinks, is a Title should be bought at a higher rate then <hi>Otho</hi> has paid for it. Ambition is a Souldiers Beauty, Honour his Mistris; and I will not give place to any man when that is in dispute; What, a Pox, makes me thus Quarrelsome; Thus on the sudden concern'd in her Opinion; There is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing seems new and strange to my mind; 'tis troublesome, and yet 'tis pleasing, 'tis a vexation I never felt before; Her words raise a storm, and her Eyes allay it again; I never was concern'd in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans thoughts before; Me-thinks I could now be strangely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to act something, that might please her; If this should be love What would become of me? A peace and Love both together, You must get a dark house for <hi>Manlius;</hi> They will make me fit for <hi>Hellebore;</hi> I will find <hi>Calis,</hi> and tell her my pain, she has talk'd of Love, and loving me; I will find by her, whether I am bewitched or no; My heart will not be idle, I perceive; We no sooner are proposing of peace, but he is busying himself with Love. All brave men I loved before; But never saw a Woman that could possess my thoughts; But this has so much of the Souldier in her, I begin to fear; I would I could see her spin; This storm has so disordered my mind, all things lie on heapes in my heart; Love and Hate, Reason and Honour, lie shuffled together; 'twill cost an Age, in thoughts, to Collect them, and place them as they were before this fatall day, so full of care. O! That I could see what fruit this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter root can bear.</p>

                        <p>Rise, Sir, <hi>Lucius</hi> is welcome as mine own wishes; <hi>Lucius,</hi> to me, in his faults, even in this fear is well-come; and though I will not chide him, because his Fear is Love, yet I will counsel his Jealousie, which, to this hour, I confess, is not onely pardonable, but ought to be rewarded; Which thus I do. Know <hi>Lucius,</hi> Though <hi>Amadeo</hi> has Excellencies enough if 'twere possible to justifie a broken Faith; Yet it must not be where my friend is his Rival, Who has all that is required to make a happy Friendship, if not stain'd with Jealousie. Be therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that I have Honour; And here must cease all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome fears that tell your heart ought, but <hi>Lucius</hi> shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy my Love; And now I have said this, if <hi>Lucius</hi> shall again stain me with his Jealousie, I fear my heart will not bear such an Injury; For none but a faulty heart can doubt the Honour of his Mistris, when she has given her faith.</p>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61734:120"/>
whilst you Excuse it, and reward it thus? 'twere Ingratitude; I ought rather to Sacrifice to that weakness, since it has been so fortunate as to make me happier then all the endeavours of my life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>

Love has but one path, but one safe way; he that would walk in two may lose himself; and I have told <hi>Lucius</hi> he is that way; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his Jealousie and Injustice can make <hi>Cicilia</hi> stray.</p>

                        <p>I shall hide my fears no longer from your Highness, but confess his coldness since he returned; and that strict friendship he has made with Prince <hi>Amadeo</hi> makes me believe he has some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign on the fair <hi>Clorinda,</hi> which vain hope; when I consider, her mind and his Rival, I cannot fear he should be master of his wishes; yet the attempt will be enough to let me see I am past hopes of mine; for I know him of a nature most violent in his passion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of love or hate, bred always a Souldier, and taught by success to know no opposition but what a Souldier ought to remove; yet when your Highness sees him you may, by some Questions, as by chance, inform your self of what I dare not mention.</p>

                        <p>But the General had wont to give Reason place; even in his Anger, and his wounds, he would not be averse to Reason; else I should not venture thus rudely to give him my opinion. Pray, Sir, tell me, is it a Crime to love, or a sin to be loved? for in one of these two lies the guilt; if it be a sin in either, why are you so partial to believe your self Innocent for doing that which is a Crime in the prince? whose Love is Honour, rather then prejudice to you, and but justifies to the world that you have placed your Affection upon a deserving person; and this Injurious jealousie of yours, but shakes her Resolution; and, by disgusting of her heart, gives more ground to your Rival then ever his Addresses could have won. Were I the General, who would should love my Mistris better then I, so she loved me better then him; And then my Rival should break my
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61734:127"/>
neck assoon as my sleep, upon that score. Rivals are so many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and Arguments, so many Affidavites, that she has honour, so many Bucklers to defend her against the Envy and malice of the world; and when you fold her in your Arms, they become so many Trophies of your Victory; Rivals are, in Loves war, as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, Colours, and the Cannon; Win the Battel, and lead them all in Triumph.</p>

                        <p>Faith, Sir, if this be so, (which few will believe) my Counsel is, that you should be silent; for she has such a stock of Reputation in the world, as no single Opinion, nor any one Action, can waste; and 'twill not be for your Honour, while the world esteems her, to say, I am that <hi>Lucius</hi> that the Princess <hi>Cicilia</hi> loved once, but she is now unconstant; 'tis the same thing, as to say, you had like have couzen'd her, but she found her Errour: Hide this misfortune, rather, as some imperfection; 'tis a story better forgot; for either, you were deceiv'd in her, or she in you; 'tis clear, one of you wanted your value; Come, Sir, let no man think to get any advantage over his Mistriss, or, to add to his own Esteem, by saying she is false; for no worthy man ever let a Gallant Woman be false; 'tis not possible to destroy a perfect Friendship, you may destroy nature as soon.</p>

Their constancy in Love, their often and patient becoming Martyrs to Friendship and Honour, as far beyond the merits, as faith of men, scarce one of them trusting that has not been betrayed by our perjur'd Sex; Mercy being their Nature, and oftentimes their Enemy, having rendred them miserable; For could they see us sad, they might laugh; But their pity of false men makes many of their Scenes set in tears and blood; and 'tis as rare to find a Constant man, as a faulty Woman; Yet I find History condemns revenge in either, Mercy in the last Act being as becoming a gallant Lover, as Love in the First, so to strive to win from the world a handsome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, by forgetting and forgiving each others crimes; and those who seek by Revenge to vindicate themselves; The guilty has from that found pity, and their Rage stood condemned by gods and men; Yet, in this latter Age, we have deliver'd our selves up to a mistake of Honour; and Custome has made it so binding, that 'tis not to be disputed against, 'tis by Duel; which vain &amp; Cholerick men embrace with Joy, as a quick way for the one to be known to the World, and the other to be revenged of the World; Nay, wise men submit to it now, as a necessity; and though, in your case, some would fight, Yet there are divers would not; Much is to be said for them both, and against them, and the wilde Justice

'twill be too late to put back when I have discover'd the villain; she will hate, and they despise me; and I shall sell all my past honours for a shadow; what rests then? Force. Ha! good gods! what may not man be if he will once break the bounds of honour? see if I have not already swallowed the great difficulties of Friend and Brother, and given up that honour I have preserved through a thousand hazards; and lust, finding it self master, would not only reign, but bring in murder too; sure I was never honest, never stout, all my fighting was but cowardize, nothing but fear to dye made me defend my self; If I had either honour or courage in my heart, they would now defend me against my self, and make me ashamed to yield my sword to lust and treachery; sure if it were ever lawful to kill, 'tis now; for a greater villain then my self no man can strike.—See this Dagger prompts me to it; the act will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <stage>He draws his Dagger.</stage>

                        <p>I believe the cause is easily guess'd; you know the Prince and his Sister have this Morning disputed with some heat and Choler concerning our affairs; <hi>Lucius</hi> too is inform'd that the <hi>Pretor</hi> has given his consent at the desire of <hi>Otho;</hi> and the displeasure the Princess shewed her Brother is but a spark of that Fire you are to expect from <hi>Lucius,</hi> whose nature can never endure, nor dissemble his troubles; whence came you now?</p>

                        <p>From making my excuse to the Princess, where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived so civil a resentment of my proceedings, that her dislike was but one degree of less Obligation then the acceptance of my Love would have been. For I must confess, my Reason Honours the Princess when she acts great things; and to be faithfull is most Princely. 'Tis like her self, to avow her Friendship; yet her words were full of civility, and, in all her expressions as just to me, as kind to <hi>Lucius;</hi> And that Civil Justice shall bind me as much as her Love can my Rival. And though his pretence may be more fortunate then mine, yet who ever shall give a true Character hereafter of <hi>Amadeo</hi>'s Love, the world shall say, he owes nothing to Honour nor <hi>Cicilia</hi>'s Friendship.</p>

                        <p>Reveng'd? upon whom? foul Revenge is due to thee, not from thee; Thou hast injur'd a Friend, a Brother, and a Mistriss; and thou talkst of being reveng'd, of which of these? good Heaven! whither am I fallen? Reason and Honour are dead within my Heart, and the Coward is crept into this breast, else I could save all yet; Thus: this Sword bent against the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor here would do it yet; But Honour has lost his power, Lust and Revenge reign Tyrants over my Heart, Revenge: whose plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is of so short a reign, it scarce out-lasts a thought longer then the storms that Injuries and Anger raise; and who enjoyes it most is most Beast, and shews more wicked nature then all the several vices that Man was born subject to; Nay, 'tis hard to say, who repents a revengefull Mind most, the Revenger or the sad subject of his Revenge; That I, who this Morning was a Lover, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night degenerate into such contraries as Hate, and desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the thing I lov'd, it starts my Soul. I that would have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Morning to have serv'd or pleas'd <hi>Cicilia,</hi> am now bent at the rate of all that is precious to Man, Honour, Health, and Peace of Mind, to seek her despight, and, with hazard of mine own life, strike <hi>Lucius,</hi> though a Brother, which she nor Nature can long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er protect; For though my Heart tells me he is my Brother, yet she has said he is my Rival; which very thought has more mysterie in it; then I shall live to understand. That I should have reason to know this, and not have power to master that impious Passion! They have too much reason who affirm there is a Fate in all things, which commands above our Reason; and 'tis vanity in Man to think or resolve he will be virtuous: His Stars laugh at him; and what is writ in Heaven we must act, for we but play our parts here; how would the world wonder else, when they shall read this part of my story? <hi>Manlius,</hi> that in his youth did something like Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and aspir'd at nothing but a fair Fame, proud of the worlds esteem; Now, when he has found the highest Object Honour and Virtue can work upon, which is to Love handsomely, without any design or hope of Reward more then such a virtuous action brings; To know this, and to despise all the rewards that the Gods and <hi>Cicilia</hi> must owe to such an action, and sacrifice to Revenge all that a Brother, a Friend, and a Mistriss claim, must beget mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which already beget my despair. Love, if thou bee'st a God,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61734:133"/>
as thy blindness has led me to this precipice, thou hast wings though no Eyes; and 'twill be Justice to lend me them to save me; else this new kind of madness will find too late a pity. My Hate levels at all, Brother and Friend are not out of distance. What she loves I must hate, my Rival cannot be my friend; nor can I with patience think she should be any others, though I know she will never be mine; But woe to the happy Lover who ever he be, 'tis not Brother nor Friend shall protect him. <hi>Calis</hi> too, though I never said I lov'd, yet I have listned to what she has said of modest and kind; so that this crime of mine cannot stab less then four; for each base act that I commit, she will bleed though innocent.—Ha, what noise is that?

This Truth, Madam, has faults enough, and therefore we may hope to find belief; and this Errour which a Brother committed, we hope for a Brothers sake may be pardoned.</p>

But love him I must not. <hi>Cicilia</hi> is not worth her esteem when she is false to her vows, which (I confess,) I have given <hi>Lucius;</hi> and nothing but <hi>Lucius</hi> can absolve that vow. Death, or <hi>Lucius</hi> his faults, can onely set <hi>Cicilia</hi> free; This I would have told the Prince, but that I was loath to add to his griefs a knowledge that might make him hate my friend or me.</p>

This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Guilt, this affected Malefactor has won my Heart; even this Crime is an Obligation. My Friendship shar'd in all his good, and shall I abandon him in his misery? Heaven forbid. You know, Sir, in his healthy hours, in his dayes of Triumph, <hi>Lucius</hi> left not me out. Can I then with Honour share with him in his glories, and abandon him in this sad afflicted Fortune, where I am the cause too? It cannot, it must not be. You may deny me his life, but know then, you cannot perswade me to out-live him. Nothing shall say, <hi>Lucius</hi> was so much gallanter then <hi>Cicilia,</hi> as to die for her that would not in his Funeral bear him company.</p>

Nor will the world wonder why I plead for him: Is guilty <hi>Lucius</hi> such a common Theam? Were he not guilty, why should I bow my knees? A Daughter to one, and a Friend to the other? Are her tears no tie? Are her knees bowed, and her hands held up, of no force with a Father for a Friend? Is there nothing due to these? Common Miseries find common Remedies; And my Father may by a thousand wayes shew his Justice, though how for my sake he shew <hi>Lucius</hi> Mercy.</p>

                        <p>I must not cross him now, his jealousie is too high wrought; besides, I know his nature is easier led then drove; in this particular <hi>Lucius</hi> has some reason; nor can I justifie a Maid in such actions; for women that will give and take, for fancy, are not safe; because custom may bring them to like some things so well as to purchase them they may be perswaded to buy and sell; then the man that can soonest flatter them into a bargain has the undoing of them.</p>

                        <p>There is much more reason in this passion then in your other Arguments; for if the Princess could have learn'd the guilt of other women, 'tis probable she might have learn'd their craft too, and dissembled; which I am certain her fervent kindness (pleading in tears upon her knees, vowing friendship and love for <hi>Lucius,</hi> receiving no denial, making all his crimes so many loves to her, and so many Arguments for her love and protection) will acquit her from; till that fatal Paper, which you sent the Prince, was by her Father given her, which when she had read she was struck with the unkindness, and the displeasure of that thought that told <stage>Lucius <hi>falls on</hi> Dyon's <hi>neck.</hi>

But alas, my Friend, my heart is grown sick of Love and fear: You must not believe all I say, I scarce do it my self; 'Tis my fear, not my faith, that speaks in this passion; yet she was too cruel, because she might be mistaken; <hi>Manlius</hi> mistook it you saw, for Love; how then can you blame me for thinking I am robb'd, when the Thief confesses the theft; guilty <hi>Manlius</hi> confest his Crime, which she hid, and cherish'd; But I hope, my Friend (when he has told her of my fears) will present them too as the effects of a distracted Lover, which I would fain beg her pardon for;</p>

O <hi>Calis,</hi> that shaking, that dumbness, those tears, his Quiver, Bow and Arrows are not more his characters, then they (when they are true) but these were dissembled all; and my revenge shall be as curious now, as my love was then, which I will take at height; follow <hi>Calis,</hi> and be a witness of that as thou hast been of my love and injuries; no words; By thy friendship, I conjure thee, no dispute; for I am resolved.</p>

she yet loves <hi>Manlius</hi> as part of <hi>Lucius;</hi> whose guilt is so unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, as if not suddenly redeemed, I fear a danger not to be resisted; but I am now in haste, and cannot stay to tell you my fears (though it shall be my business to provide against it) because the Princess stays for me; but to morrow I will not fail to bring her hither, as soon as the chase is up; till when lye quiet, and leave the rest to me.</p>

                        <p>You must expect his fury should discharge it self upon you; therefore be so just to the Princess, as calmly to tell him his error; and upon how unreasonable grounds he builds his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, this will confirm what you have said to her; for every fault <hi>Lucius</hi> commits her kindness makes heavy to her; and what ere you may believe, let him be never so guilty, she will not love his punisher; for to make his faults publick by <hi>Amadeo,</hi> is to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid her; and if you would destroy a Rival more gracious then your self, wisely see, and seem to hide his faults; then all your gallantry is his poyson, and obligations upon her; I would not now fight with him till he struck me; and that patience shall win more from a generous heart, like hers, then thou canst possibly reap with thy sword; for she and all the world knows, 'tis not fear of <hi>Lucius</hi> but love to <hi>Cicilia</hi> makes <hi>Amadeo</hi> spare even his enemy, because she loves him.</p>

                        <p>O <hi>Calis,</hi> how vain are our thoughts, how endless those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires that rule our hearts! <hi>Lucius</hi> his jealousie has so humbled my heart, so discouraged me in the pursuit of happiness, that my soul is grown desperate; 'tis vanity for any Maid to hope by Reason, or Vertue, to tye any man to her friendship; the blind
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61734:146"/>
pursuit of some, may by chance some minutes be happy; But no Rule can prescribe a certain way to make a Lover happy; Now I find, it had been better far for me to have had a nature like other common women, with a mind easily satisfied, and in a modest Ignorance have believed all that their false Sex said, and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what my fate would have sent me, then to labour the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the best minds, and, with a sweet Vexation, make my self fit for such as I cannot find, so to be onely more miserable then other Women; for they in their folly gain that bliss I in my dreams have onely found, and not knowing better enjoy all their wishes, living contented, and dying loving, and lamented, whilst I in pain languish, having lost that pride and value of my self which <hi>Lucius</hi> once begot; But 'twas flattery all; I am not fair nor virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sure; There is no Magick in this Form, as that dissembler swore; Else were those graces here, how came <hi>Lucius</hi> to despise me? Had I virtue, how durst that dissembler doubt my honour? O <hi>Calis,</hi> this scorn has robb'd me of all my Friendship, I have scarce enough left to protect my breast against my own hands, which hate the heart that this false youth has wounded; Therefore no more, no more, I know 'twas he, and I am resolv'd; and since <hi>Calis</hi> has sworn to be secret, she shall now know my design.</p>

His jealousie has committed such low sins; I wonder he is not ashamed to converse with such mean thoughts; and I hate my self, to think I was such a fool as to let it be twice in <hi>Lucius</hi> his power to Injure me; But, from this hour, all the memory I shall retain of such a Crime as his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, shall be to shew him I am Innocent when his Repentance shall come too late.</p>

break my heart, I will do it; which I know 'twill do, when I shall find my self embraced by his Rival.

                        <p>But <hi>Manlius</hi> is missing, and <hi>Lucius</hi> though banished, is not far off; His Peace is made by the generous Prince <hi>Amadeo,</hi> and was for certain, last night, at the Gardiners little house in the Grove; <hi>Calis</hi> confesses she brought him thither, and that he flew from her in a Rage when he saw the Prince <hi>Amadeo</hi> taking his leave of the Princess <hi>Cicilia,</hi> and mistook their parting for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of what his jealousie has apprehended; This, if you meet him, you are to assure him of from <hi>Calis</hi> and my self, that his mind may find some peace; Let us divide our selves, he was seen to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this wood, and his Horse was taken up this Morning loose; I will take this path, and we will meet in the place where the Hounds are uncoupled; Let not the <hi>Pretor</hi> know he is hereabouts, till we have spoken with him.</p>

                        <p>I shall observe; but if there were no other way to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then these Princes find <hi>Lysander</hi> would curse his Starrs; Dost thou think there is so much to boot betwixt a woman and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as these foxes pretend? If there be, I thank the Gods for my ignorance, that understand not the difference of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in my practice; Sweet, and young, and kind, if sound, goes farr, and when they were alone they would all hear Reason that I have had to do with: But here is such fighting, and sighing, such hunting and losing, and squatting, starting, and turning of a Coney, such erring, swearing and staring, and Puss is as angry as any of the kennel of Mad-men that hunt her. Are all <hi>Roman</hi> Princesses thus hard to be caught? Sure he that gets this will not complain she is tough; And if a hunted Mistriss be a good Bed-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, bid him put this in crust; I warrant her she will eat short, yet I have heard a Lover say, his Mistress Heart cannot be too soft, nor her Arse too hard to make a servant good sawce.</p>

One cold kiss I will take, and then farewell; did <hi>Lucius</hi> ever love? O be merciful, and say so, though it be false; there is less sin in such a well natur'd lye, then with a cruel truth to add to a friends dying misery, who thus with wounds and prayers her heart sets ope to seek the flying soul of welcome <hi>Lucius,</hi> lov'd companion of my heart.</p>

                        <p>Sir, we know not what to believe, and yet, for mirth, we let all pass; He is one has past all Fortunes by Sea and Land; surfets, and want of bread, lov'd, and been belov'd again, and of that passion has tasted both the honey and the sting, thrown from his cradle into other mens grounds, naked, and unthought of by his Parents and Friends, and what was cruelty then, is his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness now; for being bred with the wolf he grew wise enough to thrive in the forest.</p>

he eats through the difficulties of Fortune, and now emboldned by success doubts nothing; I have seen him in a morning put his hand as confidently into his pockets for money as if the Devill had been his cashire, when he knew he put them off at night, as empty as his gloves.</p>

                        <p>He is rich, and I believe frank enough; but they say he is of an insolent and froward nature, and so jealous he will neither lead nor drive, a proud valuer of himself; let's be gone before he return; some men are got with shadows, and some birds with chaff; others that are wiser will have the corn in the sheaf; and Don <hi>Pedro</hi> is observ'd to be a better Lover in a window, then in a bed, and will give as much to be rid of a Mistress, as to purchase her; therefore I am resolv'd nothing but his golden-key shall let him in.</p>

                        <p>Rather, why did you set it up, If not for that purpose? sure you know the excellence it expos'd to our Eyes; which I would now describe, but that the conversation with your Glass will do it better, which I perceive you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted, by the price you seem to value them at; In short, I saw and lov'd you, fair one, as who do's not; I wish'd for you too, as who would not? But when I read your paper, I found the price of this Jewel too great, not for my value but my Fortune; had that been equal to my Love, you should have found at what rate I priz'd the Beauty and the Friendship of the famous and fair <hi>Angellica,</hi> that Star of <hi>Italy;</hi> who had she been as fixt as bright, a Prince might have worne such a Jewel in his Breast, and receive greatness and lustre from her; These thoughts my wounded Eyes, and ravish'd Ears, suggested to me seeing that Form, and hearing those charmes thy hand and voice dispers'd amongst the surpriz'd, and sighing multitude; When guilty of my own condition I despair'd any success with my Alms-mony, to think of purchasing your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; <stage>Angellica <hi>is serious and attentive to all he sayes.</hi>
                           </stage> And therefore I resolved at all hazard to possess this shadow to feast my Eyes with, and to kiss and imagine kindness for it.—You smile now, and look upon my Cloaths, and despise me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am poor.</p>

Good Heaven! What faults have I seen Wealth and Beauty hide! Even Princes flatter faces, and wink at the sins and crimes they commit; and while Riches break the Nets, Beauty numbs the Fishers hands: Riches weighs down the scale, while Poverty lies open to the Law and censure, liable to the scorn and punishment; for though all are taught to know the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law, 'tis the poor man is made the example.</p>

                        <p>No, no, let her vent her spleen, for the same question is in your heart too, onely you can be so discreet as to hide it; What would you have? Who are you? One that scornes to play your parts; and though I dare spend my blood, I scorn to sell it for so base sallary; No, not to enjoy you, though I avow a Love and admiration for thee, and would run any hazard to purchase thee; See here the last sum I can command upon the earth, the last meal I know where to eat now in my Body, when this money is gone; Yet I am such a servant to Love and Beauty, this last, last hope, I'll freely give to enjoy thee; here, pray take it, I conjure you take it. Do not scorn me, fair one, now I have said this; For know, <stage>She turns from him.</stage> if you do, I can hate at as great a rate as I can love; and for my Revenge, not onely give this last penny, but hazard the last drop of my blood too: Why are you coy to me? I know you are to be had, and would be mine had I money to purchase you; 'tis printed, and by your own Order publish'd; Which Cordial, I'll still repeat to my heart, that knowledge has a virtue, and in time will heal these wounds; Never frown, fair one; I would not for the earth thy Fame were as fair as thy face.</p>

                        <p>Not that I despise you, but to secure my self; All those flames I feel now are but so many Lusts, I know them by their suddain bold intrusion; The impatiency and the sawciness of the flame betrayes it, still devouring till it be devoured; had it been Loves pure dart, I should have pin'd at your feet in silence, ere found a daring to tell you so. Lust his bastard-brother, and born of the same Mother, can brook a denial of that which Love dares not ask, and onely grows angry for a time; But the next kind Girl quenches his flame.</p>

You men are strangely partial to your selves, you would not despise us else; Is the fault single in us? If not, why should we lose our Honours in the Act, when you think it an Honour to be the Actors? Who made the Law against Love? Or where will you find it obligeth women onely? If the Law be general, must not the crime be so too?</p>

Well. 'tis resolv'd, I am a proper fellow, and she loves me.—Come, no more tears, fair one; All passion but love is unseasonable, and out of tune now; and since you are a Lover you shall find I can be grateful, kind and serious too; and when you are collected, tell you 'tis not only good nature, but wit in women, thus to surprize a Lovers heart, and give, though not before 'tis ask'd, yet before he hopes, such a favour; the seasonablenss of a curtesie is the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the action; and Loves fruits above all expect we should ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in season, if they hang long they rot or wither; and if neglected, Loves flowers fade and fall; what beauty had that Rose yesterday, which to morrow is only fit for the Still? such, and so seasonable was the bounty of this kindness; our Rose and fruit has now all the fragrancy and season in it; had I won it at long running, wooing still, and tasted kisses here and there, what's <hi>Angellica</hi> now would have been a dull and common joy; for such tastings dull the edge and deads the stomack of a Lover, who after such weary steps lies down by his Mistress tir'd, or without an appetite.</p>

for the horn; the Lyon's lean too, but he will never be tame; you may see the Royal Beast still in the Fair; and I have heard an Irish Capuchin swear (for he is a blade too, though in a gray scabbard) that if the Cavaliers could be brought to pray as well as fast, he believ'd the King would yet have more Saints in his Army then St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> has Lamps burn dim.</p>

                        <p>When I consider the base means we submit to ere we can gain our Ends, The sordid ways, besides the sin and shame we pass, to arrive at fortune, It makes me wonder how any woman can abandon her self so as to play our parts; A Common whore, How I tremble at it? One that must yield to all Embraces, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to all that Lust can invent, nay farther, not onely obey their base desires, but blow the fire too, and tempt, as well as suffer; Bowing before all Deformities, and all diseases, not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse either number, time, or place, when their lust Commands, and all for base Sallary; though we see Our selves despis'd, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before enjoy'd, but always after; No one setting a price or value upon that youth and beauty we expose; But because 'tis

common, therefore cheap in their Eyes; Thus when I look back upon the Paths I have trod, I could curse my Fortune, That, in my Autumn has given me a slave to <hi>Philippo.</hi>

                        <p>You mistake me, Sir; I am not at all confounded with the News, nor asham'd of any esteem I have for him; My value sprung at first from that praise your self and my Father gave him. Then Honour, Justice, and Gratitude, made me his Debtor, being forgot and abandoned by all, and expos'd to such dangers as the licenc'd Lust of common Souldiers threaten; When Rage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest flew through the City, ruining all that was virtuous, Then <hi>Thomaso,</hi> this Wanderer, came and saved me; for which action my Soul has a high value for him; Nor will I blush to say it to you, though I never said so much to him, who has ever paid me an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and a civil respect since that action, which no time nor absence shall deface: 'Twas gallant to all men, and particular to me, who, when a Father and a Brother could forget me, left a prey to the first comer voluntarily, and for my sake threw himself into all dangers to redeem me; That Wanderer did this, that Wanderer that sav'd my Life and Honour; and <hi>Serulina</hi> has so much virtue as to prefer him and his Friendship before any frowns or Fortune whatsoever.</p>

He must either change his Nature, or Love me too; Come, <hi>Calis,</hi> I am resolv'd in two lines to write him what we hear, and something of what they would have me fear, which I cannot do; For he that had virtue enough to prefer her before Fortune, quitting his Country for his Honour, shall never want my Fortune nor my Friendship, when it can serve such a Virtue.</p>

                        <p>Madam, I am glad this chance has gain'd some serious knowledge of your mind; yet 'twas no saucy intrusion nor curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature of mine that made me give you this interruption, but obedience to your Brothers desires, who has commanded me again
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61734:181"/>
to tell you his fears, that he may, at least, have the satisfaction to know upon what ground you build your faith that <hi>Thomaso</hi> is a Lover.</p>

                        <p>Don <hi>John</hi> has ever been honour'd by my Father and his Family, and I shall be proud to find I have not lost that value he had once for his Daughter; and to confirm him in my esteem of him, I shall satisfie him 'tis no blind willful passion, but an affection grounded upon reason which I profess (if love can have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his sacrifice) besides those thousands which to day I gave my Brother; who if he found a froward answer must chide himself; for Love, <hi>Johanne,</hi> is a child; and if wak'd too rudely will be out of humour.</p>

                        <p>Madam, you will honour me in this trust; and I shall not rudely cross your heart in her designs, but joyn to serve you in arguing calmly your reasons with your Brother, who only fears you may be couzen'd of your heart; for Don <hi>Thomaso</hi> yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises no great stock of love to purchase such a Jewel; what kind of address he has formerly made I know not; but since his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, methinks, there has been but little of the Lover seen; then his humour and his actions are too wild and extravagant for a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart to consider.</p>

                        <p>What his humour has been to day, or yesterday, I know not; I shall rather judge by those years I knew him, then by these few hours of which you accuse him; all his addresses to me were still full of humility, and had honour enough for any Maid to avow; nothing of the earthy, heavy, envious Lover, that eats his own heart, if I but praise another man; none of the watry ey'd, whyning sigher, that thinks to gain from a womans pity that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which he could not deserve or win from her Reason; none of your fiery, cholerick Lover neither, whose bloody rage speaks in his passion war and destruction; one that will frown and look pale upon a Mistress, as if he would win that heart by force and storm, which he has no title to by love or vertue; no, Don <hi>John,</hi> none of these, nor your aiery Humorist, your Dresser, Singer, Fencer, Horse-man, Dancer, Poet; all the all that all women, in all men, admire, I can prize, but it shall not slave me; had <hi>Thomaso</hi> lov'd the common way of men, I would have paid him with ordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and for his Mistresses, that great crime so often urg'd by my Brother and your self, I despise it, and inquire neither who, nor how many he has; I scorn to fear he can be such a fool as to give them his heart; and for his body, 'twas always the least of my thoughts, and only known as it went and came upon Loves Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands betwixt us; and she that is concern'd in her servants bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his body till he is hers, (were I the man) I should believe such an anger were but darkly telling me she had a mind to it her self; come <hi>Johanne,</hi> let <hi>Thomaso</hi> keep his heart and mind fit for my value; let them be chaste, and for his body I shall never consider what it doth.</p>

                        <p>Jealousie is, no doubt, a sign of Love; but 'tis not of the man I am jealous; I would be as soon jealous of my Cook or Keeper, as of my Lovers person; for they have flesh of mine in keeping too; yet I allow jealousie both proper and honourable in your sex; and were it not troblesome I would wish it in my servant; for it is fit he should be jealous, not only of my heart and person, but every word, look and motion is worth his fear and care; for a Virgin once blown upon by the world, or touch'd in reputation, is for ever stain'd; and yet this stranger, this jealous Lover, the eldest son of Love, is by foolish women traduc'd, and his birth-right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd him.</p>

                        <p>I rather believe they want justice, then wit; and dread it as the Cage into which few Birds enter willingly; they do not dislike such love, but fear the consequence of such a Lover; they will not be impal'd, such a passion cuts off their liberty, and his diligence is look'd upon as a spye; most woman love servants as they do fruits, in, and of every Season some. 'Tis not the Grape, the Melon, the Peach, will always please; no, nor the old Apple it self; and though few women can deserve one gallant friendship, yet none are contented with a hundred: All would have all, nor do they care so much to be lov'd, as to have it said so; they dress, Feast and Court for the vogue of the Town; and you will find in the Herd a hundred brace of fools, and not one pair of Lovers; though I will hope you may find <hi>Thomaso</hi> one; upon your score, Madam, I shall serve him; I beg your pardon, Madam; your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <stage>She steps into an Arbour, and lyes down.</stage> expects me before this.</p>

                        <p>MOst Illustrious Dons, and egregiously beautiful and vertuous Madona's, with the rest of my Gentle friends and Auditors; Behold your humble and most officious Servant <hi>Lopus,</hi> arrived from the most ancient and stately City of <hi>Saragosa,</hi> on purpose to make a Present of the wonderful effects of his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical and Chymical Arts to your fair acceptance, in this most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Courtly Town of <hi>Madrid;</hi> I protest to you, Gentlemen, I and my wife, with all my Servants, are not able to make of this Precious Oyl you see in this Glass, half so fast, as it is fetch'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from my Lodging, by Gentlemen and others of this famous Town; and sent for by many of the greatest Dukes and Condees of this much celebrated Nation; Some of which have detain'd me to their private and particular use awhile, since my arrival, by their splendidous Liberalities; And worthily, for what avails it your rich man to have his Cellars stuffd with the purest grape; and his Tables furnish'd with the rarest variety of dainty Acates, when his Physitians prescribe him (on pain of death) to drink nothing but water-gruel, or over-stewed herbs, in a thin heartless Broth? O health, the blessing of the Rich, the Riches of the poor! who can buy thee at so dear a rate, since they cannot enjoy any happines in this world without thee? Be not then so sparing of your purses, Honourable Gentlemen, as to abridge the natural course of your lives; For when a humid Flux, or Catarrh, by the mutability of the Air, falls from your head into an Arm or Shoulder, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part; take you a Ducat or Castilion of Gold, and apply it to the Place affected, see what good it will do; No no, It is this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Unguento, this rare Extraction, that onely hath the power to disperse all malignant humours, from whatsoever ill affected Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they shall proceed. It has power to fortifie the most indigest and crude stomack in the world, though it be of one that (through extreme weakness) vomits bloud; Applying onely a warm Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to the place, after the Unction and Fricace; for the Vertigo in the head, putting but a drop into your Nostrils, likewise behind your Ears, a most Sovereign and approved remedy. The Mal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duco, Cramps, Convulsions, Paralysies, Epilepsies, Tremor Cordis, retired and shrunk Nerves, evil vapours of the Spleen, stoppings of the Liver, the Stone, the Strangury, <hi>Hermia ventosa, Iliaca pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio,</hi> stops a Dysenteria, immediately easeth the Tortion of the small guts, and cures Melancholia Hypochondriaca, being taken and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed according to my printed Receipt; For this is the Physitian, this the Medicine; this Counsels, this Cures; this gives the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this works the effect; And in Sum, both together may be termed an Abstract of the Theorick and Practick in the Aescula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61734:183"/>
Art; The price is but four Royalls, that is the price, and less I know, in curtesie you cannot offer me; take it, or leave it; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, both I and it are at your service; I ask you not neer the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the thing; For then I should ask you a thousand Duckets; so several Grandees and Grandessa's have given me. But I despise money, onely to shew my affection to you, Honourable Gentlemen, and this most inclyte Town; I have neglected the Messages of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Princes and Nobles, and directed my Journey hither, onely to present you with the fruits of my experience, and travels.</p>
                        <p>I have here likewise a most inestimable water, or Quintessence of Spirits drawn from all sorts of Medicinable Vegetables, which is equally to be valued with my Oyl; of Both which if I had but time to discourse to you the miraculous effects, with the Countless Catalogue of those I have cured of the aforesaid, and many more diseases, the Patents and Priviledges of the most Catholick and Christian Kings; as also of all the Princes and Commonwealths of Christendom; or but the depositions that have appeared, on my part, before the most learned Colledges of Physitians, where I was Authorized, upon notice taken of the admirable virtues of my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments and my own excellency in matter of rare and unknown secrets, to disperse them publickly for the common good. And though divers have professed to have as good and experimented Receipts as my self, and have assayed to make both of this Oyl and water; Bestowed great cost in Furnaces, Stills, Alembicks, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fires, and preparation of Ingredients (as indeed there goes to each of them six hundred several Simples, at least,) yet they ever lost their labour and cost, both, for want of that large Talent of knowledge, requisite to such a work. For my self, I have always hunted after the most recondite secrets, and to get them. I have spared no rest, or labour, but taken indefatigable pains therein; Insomuch as, Gentlemen, I will undertake (by vertue of Chymical Art) out of the Honourable Hat that cov<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Here is likewise a Powder conceal'd in this Paper, of which, if I should speak to the worth, five thousand volumns were but as one Page, that Page as a Line, that Line as a word; so short is this Pilgrimage of Man (which some call Life) to the expressing of it. Or if I would reflect upon the Price, why the whole world were but as an Empire, that Empire as a Province, that Province as a Bank, that Bank as a private purse, to the purchase of it. I will onely tell you; It is the very Powder that made <hi>Venus</hi> a Goddess, (given her by <hi>Apollo)</hi> that kept her perpetually young, clear'd her wrinckles, firmed her gums, filled her skin, colour'd her hair; from her derived to <hi>Helen,</hi> and at the Sack of <hi>Troy</hi> unfortunately lost, till now in this our Age it was as happily recovered by a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Antiquary, out of some ruines of <hi>Asia;</hi> who sent a Moyety
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61734:184"/>
of it to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> but much sophisticated: The rest, at this present, remains with me, extracted to a Quintescence; so that, wherever it but touches, in youth, it perpetually preserves; in Age restores the Complexion, Seats your Teeth (did they dance like Virginal Jacks) as firm as a wall, makes them white as Ivory, that were as black as Jeat; and with the addition of a most wonderful Bath, of my own preparation, It will tinct a gray hair pure Auburn, and make it grow so; make you cast your old harsh skin for one as fresh and smooth as <hi>Laeda</hi>'s, and so supple and quicken your Joynts and Nerves, as but seldom using it, you shall ever enjoy your juvenile Activities, Gustos, and total Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the Admiration of all that formerly knew you; Many other rare effects there are of this Powder and Bath, too tedious to reckon in this place; but whosoever has a mind to try them, if they please to repair to me at my lodging, shall be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly informed. Onely this I shall add at this present; This Powder has likewise a wonderfull variety of Amorous effects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, which are not here to be enumerated; And for my rare Oyl, thuogh I impart it to the Rich for mony, I often cure the Poor for God-sake.</p>

                        <p>No, nor none of them knew of my being in the house; nor was he less amaz'd then I; 'twas in the dark; For I went in Knavery, without a light, to surprize her, who, I thought, had been alone in her bed; We kiss'd, and hug'd each other, till our Beards discover'd; but afterwards, you may see by my face how he set up mine.</p>

                        <p>I was even glad to leave them behind me, and escape so; Hee's naked too. I saw him stalk before me, like a Ghost in the shade; you must needs have met him.</p>

                        <p>Gentlemen, you may laugh, but believe it, I cannot; would I were in my own Bed, I would not quit it for any shee's in <hi>Madrid.</hi> Now do I smell a Ballad to morrow in the <hi>Prado,</hi> of the two Bearded Lovers, kissing like the Divel and the Colliar in a Ladies Bed; If I be not reveng'd I shall pine in my mind.</p>

They're twigs of those Rods that jerk'd you so lately; and the Jest stings still so much, that I dare say, thou wilt not endure the sight, nor sound, of Don this moneth. Alass, 'tis ordinary; We see Children that have been frighted with a Cat in the cradle hate the poor Beast for ever; And 'tis to be hop'd, you may come to hate a whore too in time; by that a Fardingale has us'd you as ill as a man in a great belly'd Doublet has done: But for thee, <hi>Fred,</hi> thy dislike is as <hi>Pannick</hi> as his fear who dy'd the next day at the sight of a past danger; So thou tremblest at what's to come, and apprehend'st being couzen'd and beaten to night: You know where you are to go; take heed, it comes with a fear, especially with a Countrey-gentlemans fear; Your <hi>Essex</hi> man in <hi>Madrid,</hi> their prophetick Phantasies make their Dreams Visions still.</p>

having had the honour to be known to you formerly, I venture upon the score of a Gentleman and a Souldier that once was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by you; to whom 'tis known, I left neither the service, nor the Country with blushes; which will be enough, I hope, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you to forget the accident of yesterday, in which I am only guilty of having so late call'd to mind a person whom I'll so much honour as I shall ever do Don <hi>Pedro.</hi>

                        <p>No, Sir; though honour be that I think not of, because the custom of the world has plac'd it beyond our power; yet I can prize it in others, and despise that man that wants it. Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and faith to my Lover, good nature and charity are the height of our ambition; and 'tis one comfort, that heaven is easier satisfi'd then men; who think this fault of ours a gallantry in them, a sin so light they sing and dance under it all their days; a sin so tam'd by custom that few or none hide it, as if honour had no pretence below a mans Girdle; so his heart be right all is gallant; chaste men ridiculous, neither believ'd, esteem'd or trusted by either sex, scarce held of honour if once branded with that stain; Nay, the contrary, both sexes admires him who has the potent'st arms, and gives the frequent'st and mortal'st wounds in <hi>Venus</hi> wars; while women are so slav'd with custom, that vertue, parts, nor fortune can heal the wound in us, though Nature, Love and Kindness give it; for which, but that I know we shall have other judges of that well natur'd sin, and never a man of you all be of the jury, I would eat bran ere any he that breathes in breeches should come between my sheets.</p>

What partial folly then is that governs the minds of men; and what fools are women to submit to their Lunacy? I prize my self as high for having enjoy'd a gallant man, as you would do for having won his sword, or a gallant womans heart; despis'd because enjoy'd by others! tell me, to morrow, if you find any paths or steps upon my body where former Lovers trod, or any print of pass'd kisses cleaving to their lips; if you can miss those Graces, those Roses they gather'd, and find not as fresh and full handfulls for you to reap, as if he or they had not found their harvest.</p>

                        <p>He scarce hopes to find such a Virtue in your Sex: Yet allow him as ill as your fears, or his Enemies would present; I will prove you are as far out of the way of being happy with <hi>Alphonso,</hi> as with my Friend with all his faults; Nor is <hi>Alphonso</hi> chaster or confidenter then he, onely duller and more niggard, one that fears his flesh more, and loves his money better then <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maso;</hi> which are the hedges that keeps him in; 'tis neither Love nor Honour that binds him; only his Craft can dissemble better to gain his own ends, the fair <hi>Serulina</hi> and her Dowry; Besides, the Beauty of her person, and Honour of her Family, are Blessings any man would dissemble to purchase.</p>

                        <p>Yet he can pretend a Portion, for he can make a Joynture as honourable as my Dowry; And though he be not so fine a Gentleman as your friend, yet he may be as good a Husband; he can keep a Wife too, he has a fortune will make her live splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly like her self; and discretion bids us consider those real goods, and not dote upon flowers; and give me a Husband that can feed and cloath me as well as hug me. What Jewels will Don <hi>Thoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so</hi> present his Wife with? those of his eyes and heart; and hang his Arms in stead of Pearl about her neck? or in her ears fine Verses in stead of Pendants? suppose this yet; 'tis a stout man whose sword can defend his Wife from cold; and although Don <hi>Thoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so</hi>'s wit be better then <hi>Alphonso</hi>'s, yet his bond is worth twenty Colonels.</p>

                        <p>When? by Moon-shine? I am sure you dare not meet Signior <hi>Sol</hi> abroad, unless you'l come home, like Rose-cakes from a Still, bak'd and sweating; which though your dew be sweet (as common civility will make us allow that) yet 'tis troublesome and a new sight to meet Ladies abroad, when the dogs cry as they pass the streets, when to walk in your Court but two turns is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for chastity, and out-does the old Law <hi>Ordeal:</hi> 'Tis enough for your <hi>Alphonso</hi> and his Indian breeding to endure such stabs as the Sun strikes in the Dog-days; 'tis true, they say he will beat the hoof in his woollen-hose, till his feet sweat and stink more then a hunted Bores, and are fain to be steep'd at night as long as the Beef, ere they be fresh again; this commonly out of freedom is done in my Wives Chamber; and if he be kind, and dares trust you, perhaps he desires you to cut his Corns and dress his Issue, signs of favour I can assure you; and such as you must not hope, unless your woman be out of the way; and that honour being pass'd, the Gyant stretches himself, yawns and sighs a belch or two, stales in your pot, farts as loud as a Musket for a jest; and then throws himself under the Rug, and expects you in his foul sheets, and aspit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cloath, where hangs as much of his Lungs as remains in his body; and ere you can get into the bed he calls you with a snore or two; and are not these fine things in a Ladies bed? who would not rejoyce to meet his woollen-waste-coat and knit-night-cap without a lining? a shirt so nasty a cleanly Ghost would scarce appear in at the latter day; for his linen is a kin to him ere he
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61734:203"/>
puts it off; thus prepar'd for delight you Ladies meet your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-husbands; the <hi>Alphonso,</hi> high shooes; and there lye and suffer them to abuse you as often as they please to use you, which you'l too late repent; and there you may lye and sight whole nights away, he'l snore and snore till it be day under the same covers, and in the same bed his forefathers liv'd and dy'd in, and some so lately you may smell the very earthiness of the Corps still; and 'tis a better savour then his arms or breath, a stink compos'd of vile Tobacco and dead Wine, stuffed nose, rotten lungs, and hollow teeth, half whose number has been drawn with dry Cheese, and tuff lean beef; yet this man you must kiss; nay, you must kiss none but this, and muzzle through his beard to find his lips; and this you can submit to for threescore year for a joynture; which you must purchase too; for he sells you that and this Paradise, his bed, for the price of your portion only; and in strict sence you give him so much to lye with him as long as he lives; for unless he dies you have nothing but a place in his Family, and so has his dog, who shall have a pension as well as you; for in these bargains of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock the Wife is to the portion only the handful over measure; a Chattle that he takes to stock his Family, as other Cattle to stock his ground; nay, perhaps he's a blade too, and then you may spin at home, while he is abroad with <hi>Phillis</hi> in the field; by which you find, the <hi>Alphonso</hi>'s are as subject to the ills you dread, as the <hi>Thomaso</hi>'s; only, as I said before their differences is, the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi>'s are more nasty lusts, and cheaper Whores, and the sin more dirty there then in the City.</p>

What cares Don <hi>Alphonso</hi> for you or your opinion? sick or well, live or dye, he's prepar'd; the funeral cloke is brush'd and laid up for the good day; and if you dye, 'tis upon your own account, for he is sure of your Portion; and your Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture serves again, never the worse for wearing; and will bait the hook for some other fool to bite at.</p>

whom you affect, though at price of your fortune, then to be chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd or sold to slavery by friends, who only think upon joyning wealth to wealth; with my friend you command as much as you must obey there; Don <hi>Thomaso</hi> has seen the world, and gather'd from every Nation what is excellent, and can comply with times and natures, for he has been bred in Courts and Armies, those schools of the mind, where men learn to tame their wills and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for Princes are to be studied and obey'd, not disputed with; with him you'l know no cause of dispute; with the other you must expect perpetual civil war, a sullen, rude, louring, willful, scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling clown, from whom if you escape blows, 'tis well; an unhew'd rudeness, whose very kindness bruises; that when he but stroaks or flatters his dogs, they cry, This will seek and bring all that is pleasure home, either in humour or conversation, to divert you; the one will devoure this youth and beauty that flows with such grace in every form and feature in that lovely body and diviner face, like common food, for his dull appetite, without a thought or value of the feast you set before him; while Don <hi>Thomaso</hi> with awe and respect and faithful kindness from a ravish'd soul enjoys you. <hi>Alphonso,</hi> Don <hi>Indian!</hi> By this light, he thinks he's trading at <hi>Gamba</hi> still, and would sell you, himself, that Bell and Bauble for your youth and fortune; 'tis his last venture, and you'l make a voyage if he catch you.</p>

                        <p>Faith, Madam, and Marriage is one disease which women are necessitated to pass; for an old Maid is an evil without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; an ill husband may be cur'd by a divorce, but there's no flying the other curse; a kind husband is the best cordial you can provide against infection of Marriage; and if you should be sick or sad (which heaven defend) <hi>Thomaso</hi> would so divide your griefs with a kind sense of what you suffer, so pity your pain, so feel all your griefs, that you will find sadness vanish, and sickness it self decay, while health, perfect health, by kindness charm'd, returns; and you'l find so much more pleasure to walk with such a friend in one of his descriptions of a Garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then in twenty of <hi>Dameta</hi>'s Orchards; and read in his relations the Histories of persons, times and places; And such such minds, Madam, and such men, are fit for such Brides as the Gentle <hi>Serulina;</hi> and they only make happy Hymens; the rest but joyn the sex and beast together; and such sordid coupling is base and mean, and the herds afford as good Nuptials; this advantage Colonels (Madam) that have wit and breeding may pretend above those who have nothing good but their Bond and Joynture. Your servant, Lady; my hour is out, and so much shall serve for this time.</p>

And in a Lover your crime is greater then ours; and the neglect you have shewn her a higher offence then what we kneel for; our Insolence was a chance, and proceeded from Ignorance and passion; for had we known her, we would have sacrific'd our lives for her, rather then have acted or suffer'd the least of those Crimes. But you that have the Honour not onely to be known, but esteem'd by her, to be thus long in Town, and never pay your own duty, nor inform us how we might pay ours, it makes it our faults your guilt; You shew'd us all the Whores in Town, and were mad till you had seen them your self; But, for this noble Lady, I never heard her mention'd in <hi>Madrid;</hi> Had you paid that respect your Heart knows due to her, we might have had, by such a visit, the Honour of being known to this Lady; which would have given her Protection, and secur'd our Innocence. Do you blush? 'Tis time; and if you had any grace, this Truth would be a Ring in your Nose, as well as the other in ours. Good severe, small Friend, am I with you?</p>

                        <p>Yours, Sir, is lusty, and walks about the house, starts, and wonders at her self; seems angry with her own shadow, then frowns, and listens as if she were frighted; she will not believe she is her self; yet she knows me, and wonders why I call her by her name; she asks for you, then pinches and pricks her self till she squeeks again, ere she would believe that load at her back and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong'd to her; in earnest, Sir, 'tis a sad sin to wrong them thus.</p>

                        <p>There is a guilt and shame, as well as sadness in these tears; and I must hope for nothing but certain misery from your joys; your vertue may smile, you have all the causes joy can bring you; in birth happy, in love and fortune blest, and in innocence, which crowns the rest. Yet heaven witness, I envy not your youth her peace; for though I cannot be innocent my self, I am not so wicked but I can adore both her and vertue in the breasts of others; nor do I lament a grief that has surpriz'd me; 'tis long since my heart discover'd his; and they are fond women, who stain'd with our crimes can hope to weep gallant men into such madness as to leave the blessings the fair and vertuous <hi>Serulina</hi> brings, to blush their lives with us.</p>

                        <p>Custom, impious custom, is guilty of all my sins, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original of all my crimes; whose deprav'd liberty not only tolerates, but encourages those follies whose guilt I blush before such a vertue as the fair and innocent <hi>Serulina;</hi> who has not only honour, but mercy too. Other women may be chaste, but they are so rigid and so cruel to our faults; and their counsels so full of whips and stings, it rather incenses and hardens then reclaims a heart; nor doth their ill nature care to make a convert amongst us, so they may have the vanity to make a Satyr upon us; but here I find the Balsam of true innocence; which is not so proud, or vain in her own blest condition, as sollicitous to preserve and redeem others: and here I see the true stock of honour, which in your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous breast has diviner forms and fruits then we can know or imagine in our sick state; yet I dare boast never to have broke the Laws she prescrib'd to our sex, faithful, kind, constant and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to cur Lovers, concern'd only in their good, never betraying or abandoning their trust.</p>

The <hi>Angellica</hi> shall have her thousand crowns again, 'twas the first money I ever got by the sex; and I cannot but wonder at their narrow minds, as well as their fortunes that can be so poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirited as to design farther then the kindness of a woman.

                        <p>All is well, Sir; The Justices came immediately as you went out, and have seiz'd all the goods they found. But those Prodigies in the Baths has made them flie the House; Four such Gyants, Sir <hi>Amadis,</hi> nor the <hi>Palmerins</hi> ever encountred; The German guards are now in Arms to seize them, <hi>Scarramucha</hi> is come out a Lady, as big again as Don <hi>Edwardo</hi>'s; And there is a Lady come forth <hi>Scarramucha,</hi> a Gyant amongst Gyants; She doth so wonder at her Beard and Breeches, for she has <hi>Helena</hi>'s old Whores Soul in a mans Body; 'twas sport to see the wonder, and what a start she gave at the Ammunition of her own Breeches. The Mountebank keeps his own Features, but in a horrid form; and threatens black destruction to you all: His wife too is one of the loveliest forms and perfect symmetry that such a Monster can present to the judging eye; <hi>Celia</hi> in Youth and Beauty, such as when her charming Hand and Voice led <hi>Rome</hi> in Chains; Yet she is still frighted with the power of that Charm that first enslav'd her, and would hide or flie the Anger and the Love of him who now with frowns and severe looks threatens all; They quickly made the Inquisidors leave the House; which gave me occasion to tell them you were Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, guilty onely in the trying a publick experiment; Men that had not a sold to lose, poor cashier'd Cavalliers; whom their Guardian had couzen'd of their Portions, and I'de un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, for a piece of money, should quit your Interest to them; upon which they seiz'd the Guardian, and expect Don <hi>Harrigo</hi> to treat your Interest; You are sure he's in the Gallies for his Life, and his Estate confiscate to the Church; Your wives will be Prisoners during Life; for to lie with them is held Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with the Devil.</p>

                        <p>Most certain; led on by <hi>Clytus,</hi> Their descent in <hi>Sicily</hi> found no resistance; the people were so generally disaffected with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government they willingly consented to put themselves under the prince's protection; This news has awaked the King, till then lost in security; and now too late he finds the fire he despis'd has taken hold of his Palace. The prince <hi>Leopoldo</hi> is absent too; A person of that Piety and Virtue, but that he is the cloud that shadows our young King, and unjustly possesses his right, I could joyn with the world in worship of him; and it was indeed his Interest, ioyned with his noble Sisters, which these late years has kept the people quiet;
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:61734:236"/>
But the prince and <hi>Palantus</hi> being absent in these late disorders, our Friends have taken hold of the occasion, and prevailed so far, that the people are now Armed in the Name of our long lost prince; which hope, joyned with their hatred of the present Government, has begot a danger. The King cannot resist, but 'tis thought he will be forc'd to leave <hi>Naples,</hi> and seek a safety in <hi>Capua,</hi> that place in my Opinion being fittest to make his general Rendevouz. This news was the cause of my sending for you, that you might avoy'd the present danger which the prince <hi>Leopoldo</hi> and <hi>Palantus</hi> his Army may bring, who are now upon their march towards <hi>Naples,</hi> and must pass through your Forest, where your abode, during these troubles, will be most unsafe; and to prevent a mischief, pray let me counsel your self, and the Children, to retire hither this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                           </stage> my Dream expounded; in that thou wilt finde my Fate; and I confess with a clear soul, and as much innocency as the sleeps of Children, I love that fatal figure, that something without a name, that kinde nothing is all the business of my minde; In my sleep he rescu'd me, me thoughts he sav'd my honour in a time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger when my heart was desperate; and though a Dream the fear has still dwelt here, and a kindness for him, which makes me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him before all but honour; cease to wonder, for that shadow is all my conversation, all my joy, and all my misery; Is it not a strange Passion that the Gods have sent me for one I never saw but in my Dream, the similitude of nothing? yet this advantage we have of others, we are secured from jealousie; for as Fate has hid him from my eye, so a kinde power has set me free from the envy or fear his love may bring; by night he makes his visits still; like the <hi>Egyptian Apis</hi> in a Dream he comes; the soft-foot'd God of Sleep is onely Witness to our Love.</p>

                           <hi>Roderigo,</hi> a word.—Now you find the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was well design'd, and before they shall find a power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the truth whether their Prince be in our power or no, I will make these Traytors cut themselves.

                        <p>With joy, Sir; and with impatient longing they expect the sight; and 'tis my opinion 'twill be the best way to produce him this day, and present him to the Army; if we should delay their expectations, perhaps we may lose their affections and their faith too; and then we have only arm'd and drawn together a multitude that may, for their revenge, joyn with the enemy; who when he shall hear of their discontents will not neglect to play the best of his Game; 'tis therefore again my counsel to lose no time, but produce the King.</p>

                        <p>It is his own desire not to be discover'd till things be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, at least till the Castles and strong places be surrendred, for the better security of his person.</p>

just then in the person of the King (who you would have me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thus wicked) should punish their own act in the person of the innocent Prince: but suppose the King as guilty as you would make him; what has the Prince done, then a Child? why do you war with him? whose virtue neither your rage nor hatred can deny; for to my self you have often given him divine honour; Oh, Sir, your silence is more noble then your hate; and lest I may be seduced to lose my loyalty, or my duty, in this dispute, I'll retire.</p>

our retreat to this hill, from whence we fled yesterday, must breed some doubt of the cause; for it must seem strange to finde themselves sought by those men to day which fled them last night; Besides, your Highness knows, Their Army is compos'd of divers Interests, which will make them jealous of each other; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably enough apprehend we have some intelligence in their Army, which time can onely satisfie, and may joyn to them the doubtful part, which expect but the fortune of a day, to declare for the Conqueror; We can hope no more then we are; every day will increase them, both in number and repute; therefore my counsel is, to offer them Battle, while we are in lust, and hope of victory; delay will but abate the Souldiers hearts, and then 'tis easie to master the Limbs.</p>

Something calls me back, my fond heart would <stage>She offers to go out and stops at the Door, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</stage> gaze again. Do, do, and be fit for pity, drink deep of that delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Poyson, so are you past remedy; yet if you bet ler me fly and inflame the world; Love and Desire, your winged fire here I feel, yet glory not in my ruine; for 'tis but a poor Shepherdess breast, and no wonder if a God oppress it.</p>

                        <p>THis strange chance that <hi>Arcus</hi> relates makes me fear some sudden issue of my Dream; he describes a Maid, whose beauty took my Brother in an hour when his heart was most opposite to love; and by the habit and the place only her sex differs; for his description most lively paints that shadow which my Dream has thus long enjoy'd; ye gods, if it be your will in Riddles still to wrap your secrets, we mortals can only say Amen. But why do I let this lesser thought fill my breast; when Countries ruine and the death of my dear Father (the great part of my fear, or ought to be) past by unmourn'd? sure there is a reason for this fault; this weakness has its cause; something that my mind does yield to, prevails; yet I find not my Reason overcome, though there's something in this gentle fear I know not what to call it: I never yet felt love by what I observe of him in others; yet I begin to fear he's knocking at my breast, and would fain get in; sure 'tis he, for I was never till now so neer being a Lover as the fear of it. But I must still these noises in my thoughts; for a Virgins innocency is so coy, so jealous, and so gentle too, she need not take the pains to beat it from her heart; she may think that and her peace away. Therefore, <hi>Bellamira,</hi> wisely in time correct thy thoughts, and suffer them not to play with this dangerous god, lest the sport prove ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, lest the child thou play'st with grows too strong for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and from innocent thoughts becomes unruly passions. <hi>Fidelia,</hi> though she knows all but my fears, yet I now begin to blush, because there is something like my Love, whil'st 'twas <stage>

                        <p>Madam, the story of our change is common; and the Poet tells whose curse we bear in our faces; no such reason as your Highness in your goodness imagines, whose charity would perswade us we might yet find acceptance when we lov'd; but 'tis too sad a truth, that for the sin of one coy <hi>Daphne</hi> all our Nation mourns; that froward Girle incensed <hi>Apollo</hi>'s rage, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of her scorn thus he brands us all, lest our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey should again boast a face, that he might love; yet this good I finde from my black; all people boldly praise me; and 'tis such an impossibility to believe any body can love it, that even your Highness will venture to defend it, and safely may; for 'twill beget no mans jealousie nor womans envy.</p>

For know, Madam, I cannot be satisfi'd, nor

                        <p>Sure there cannot be such a punishment in store for loving <hi>Bellamira</hi> as thy kind fears apprehend; And since we have touch'd this string, whose harsh sound I have long avoided for thy sake; Yet give me leave to say, Heaven and my Friend can witness, I never made any vows to <hi>Fidelia;</hi> what I have done for her, let the gods prove propitious to them and make us happy yet. And therefore, in Justice, you cannot call me unconstant, or abuser of your Love. Gratitude (if it were not too like vanity to say so) is all I ever could pay to thee; Not that I would not have given more, but 'twas all I had left; This fatal fire sent for my punishment, I fear, is either Child or Parent of that little god; for till then, I never knew or scarce believed there was such a power; nor did your own Heart desire a return of Love more then I have longed to give it you; For I know, Honour in all the heights of excellency produces nothing more glorious then a handsome Friendship: Other Virtues have him in pieces, but intire Honour is in the perfect Love of two; which since we cannot enjoy as we wish, yet you cannot accuse me of a crime which you have confess'd your self; Gentle <hi>Fidelia,</hi> though not at the same Altar, yet I bow to the same power that leads thee in chains; nor will I be so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous as to imploy thy Love to advance my wishes with <hi>Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi> nor fear from thee such injustice as to do ill Offices: Let our Friendship pity each other, and while we love with Honour leave the rest to Fate; and thou shalt find, though Love be binld, since he has brought us to this precipice, (I prophecy) he will lend us his wings to save us.</p>

'Tis true Love, of it self, is innocent, and the gods have given it for a tye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, and 'tis the greatest Blessing, even to the happy'st Fortunes; A Beauty in the best minds, if not corrupted. Else That, as all good things in Excess, are ill. Consider then what 'tis you attempt. A Prince, and your Fathers Enemy; One By the Stars set out of your reach; If Honour then be your guide, what can you expect to be (but what I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor to name?) Are you not born private issue? A Shepherds Daughter? can that condition hope any thing but to become some vile thing, despis'd by him, before enjoy'd, and by all, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?

I ask him nothing; is it a fault to love my Prince? If it be, it is no general Crime; Witness the sad Cause of these Wars; and if my Father did not lend a more Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ear to his Anger then to my Love he would not now Command me to hate my Prince, nor longer cherish that only crime that stains his Story; That low passion makes us miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; or can you doubt me so fall'n from virtue, so aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by all the gods, as to forsake all their Sacred Rules, to become a prostitute, or such a Child as to give up all their rights to the first Temptations of my heart? Oh, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your censure till I have play'd my Part in this unfinish'd Story, and you shall find I build not my happiness on any other grounds but those of honour; And if the Prince prove Master
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:61734:251"/>
of all those Excellencies I believe in him, they shall be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make me wicked; but if he prove short of those vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, you shall finde me scorn him, and pity my self; and if his virtues have no power to tempt me, I am certain his vices shall not; 'Tis the Diety in the Prince, not the Man, <hi>Phillora</hi> stoops to; and when my Father, or dear <hi>Pollidor,</hi> can bring such an Argument against my Love, as to shew me Prince <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poldo</hi> acting one thought less then his part, less then a Prince, you shall see <hi>Phillora</hi> prompt him, and Act something more then woman.</p>

I see that smile, now your heart laughs at me; 'tis true, I draw a weak Bowe, but Love will guide the Arrow: I know I hunt all this while impossible things, yet for my peace of minde let me beg, <hi>Pollidor</hi> will be so kinde as to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me this day; what though I lose my self in some hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som high Attempts, should thy Sister dy, there would be Fame, though no Victory; and if I live there will be time enough to return hither, and in this private life lament my ambitious passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and here learn to level my thoughts at something low as my fortune.</p>

But as it is, you may as soon expect I should sleep when I am bidden, or leave to remember <hi>Pollidor.</hi> I know I am mad, and must plead that Madness, which now must instead of Reason prevail with thee: In desperate Diseases, and with mortal wounds, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can do good, nothing can do hurt: I am that person, so sick, so wounded. Thy Sister hath at her eyes drank mortal Poyson: Here in my heart I bear the wounds <hi>Apollo</hi> himself complain'd he could not cure; since then in Art and Nature there rests no hope, I conjure thee in kindness let me again drink the pleasing Venome in, and refuse not to thy unfortunate Sister (since she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live happily) the satisfaction onely of choosing this way to dy.</p>

                        <p>Alas, Sir, how easie 'tis for me to speak kindly, heaven knows that sees my heart; <hi>Phillora,</hi> Sister, unlucky Maid, once more pardon the harsh expressions of a Brothers grief, whose love and kindness mistook the way to express it self; all my design was to have recommended reason as a companion for thy love, for love alone is but a passion, and a blind one; Dear <hi>Phillora,</hi> much care and pains goes to make him a virtue, and then honour must be his parent, and his issue too; this is all I had to say, and this I would fain should have been reason; but thy love shall prevail hereafter; and dear <hi>Phillora</hi> cease now to be sad, and angry with thy Brother, or to believe me so barbarous as to dispute against that god of passion, but as I fear him thy enemy:—Or think me such a stranger to thy heart as to doubt <hi>Phillora</hi>'s honour; what I have said was only to prompt thy mind, which I found this day so busie obeying of thy love, I was afraid, during this civil war in thy mind, some watchful enemy passion might surprize that strength which I am confident no assault, or siege can win.</p>

that must be held by a Sword is not worth a Swords cure; For who has once been doubted may be innocent, but never fully cleared; for such a doubt, if it do's not stain, yet it dyes the minds of the best friends; Men, reasonable enough, fear there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing call'd, some looks or words, some motion, that becken'd him to come, and made her subject to the boldness of that Sex; some negligence that bad him hope a Surprize, e're the boldest durst at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt such a fort as a modest mind; if there had not been some intelligence within, or at least the guards of virtue sleeping, they durst not (I say) hope; And this is my guilt, who, in my sleeps, have given up that mind and heart to a shadow, in my Dreams, that waking defended it self against the world; and now the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour insults.</p>

                        <p>Sir, 'tis now no time to talk of why-nots; this night we must expect some attempt from them, their business is done, the King is slain, the Prince too, for ought we know, his Clothes and order being found upon the ground; the people too are armed in their defence, and expect we should produce their King; which abused hope We cannot expect they should forgive; and we are to believe this party that have defended themselves thus long against the King will never yield to our power by any argument but the Sword: Besides, you may gather from <hi>Clytus</hi> what the rest intend, whose Forces are drawn apart towards <hi>Naples,</hi>

I catch at air, and my love is spent on shadows; and when I find it more real I fear my despair must encrease too; for if she be mortal she's some eminent person sure, and where shall I compass proud titles to heap upon her, to raise her name above the people, to please her vanity, when they shall wonder and reverence as she passes by? where's that wealth and jewels whose envied worth and charming beauty may affect and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her bright eyes? had I a Scepter, whose power (like <hi>Leopoldo)</hi> I might throw at her feet, and like him to <hi>Phillora</hi> by such a service speak my love, then I might hope: but alas! all I have to plead is love; and all I can do for her is to love her;
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:61734:274"/>
and what is that to her? when I shall urge it, she'll say, who do's not? what then is my love in order to my happiness, till she loves too, but idle air, lost and forgot like the found that breath'd it?</p>

No, 'tis Love, wounded with Jealousie and Inconstancy, or Infected with disdain; Love set too high, or too low, by birth or Nature oppos'd, which, thus set out of her reach, or so low in the Earth that Honour cannot stoop to gather her blessings; or

else at such a height that even Hope loses his Leap, and the noble Fruit hangs still to tempt us: or a worse Curse than all these, which is my fate, to love a scornful Maid that loves another: these are the true grounds of Lovers miseries, and their Errours are falsely laid upon Love, and all our stubborness call'd his Crimes, when we, not Love, are blinde, who is indeed the gentle Ty of all Mankinde, though he be made many times the most innocent Root of many mischiefs, and would be all Honey still but that our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son gives him a sting; Reason, <hi>Roderigo,</hi> which Chain the Gods, have thrown upon us; for we no sooner covet and know what would please us, but we finde it still forbidden; and from this Root (this Reason) all the foregoing miseries are deriv'd; kinde Nature else would be obey'd, and all these troubles pass without a thought or grief.

Death, what Cards would you have to play if these lose? A young handsome General, a Prince, and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that has wit and courage, and yet be strangled in an Apron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string! sigh and let a Smock smother me! They shall bury me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gallows when I dy of that Disease; No faith, if any of them be too hard for me it shall be in Bed, and there let them use me as they please; I care not whether I win or lose in their arms, and he that desires more of Love than such a kindness is mad: when I embrace her if she smile and do speak like a Lover, let her heart be as busie as she pleases, and make any other happy till I miss her company. I do not remember I ever sigh'd, yet I think I have had my share of Women, but I would not be so miserable as to remember any of their faces for a Kingdom, for then I might be subject to Constancy, a Disease harder to be cur'd than the Pox; Constancy is really a weak-stomack'd Lover: My heart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests a Mistress presently, and hungers for another; thirsts and enjoys her without any thought of Constancy and Remembrance; but the last is as dangerous as if my Supper should ly in my belly always, where should my Dinner go? If ever your fine Arguments perswade me to be one of your one Meals men, you shall geld me; give me an appetite every meal in the day, and kinde hearts to

Remember 'twas she that led thee to this degree of Honour: Remember how, contrary to Nature, Sex, and Custome, inspir'd by the Deity of Love, I laid violent hands upon thy heart, and forc'd thee to receive those glories thou now art proud of, in spight of that low mean hatred of a gallant Prince which would have held thee back: Look upon these wounds, there is a beauty in them, and a grace even in these scars,

Yet, know all the world, <hi>Pollidor</hi> can neither repent, dissemble, nor tame his love, though he can dye when a less cause then your Highness displeasure calls; but will not be hired to live at a less rate then your pardon. And <hi>Phillora</hi> may call to mind something consonant to this fatal Dream; do's she not remember how in our most innocent days, the Dreams our distracted sleeps have had? what honours and what worship has been paid us from crouds of unknown faces? which compar'd with this waking Dream seem to revive, though darkly and afar off, something from those nothings; and these thoughts begot that guilty silence which displeas'd my Sister. But though <hi>Phillora</hi> can chide my silence now, I fear she will short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find her heart subject to thoughts too, whose strange kind of fortune is like troubled waters now, and the storm is yet in her streams; but when 'tis setled, honour and quiet of mind will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide thy heart; for though she thinks now her heart will desire nothing but leave to love the Prince; know, <hi>Phillora,</hi> those roots that are in the spring contented to send forth a bud, their sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous natures are busie still to nourish them; such is thy heart now Love but buds in it, and it will break to see that after all thy care that flower thou dotest on should hang upon anothers bosome; and all thy sweets and graces wither in that shadow; and while thou dy'st to make a handsome story, some one less excellent, but more fortunate, surfeit on those sweets thou pinest for; then thou wilt find how vain and idle a good pity is, and that fruit (if they love) poor and virtuous <hi>Phillora</hi> may reap; for pity is a good that's still attended with misery, dear bought, being never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd at less rates then ruine; and they may be happy that can pity, but the wretched are still their subject; now thou hang'st thy head, blasted with this sad truth; and now thy soul is awakned I defie thy heart to be at peace.</p>

                        <p>This, <hi>Palantus,</hi> is that I had to beg; and now I conjure thee by all that love and gallantry thou hast been so diligent to shew the world, pay here thy vows to friendship, and I shall be happy by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make my dear <hi>Fidelia</hi> so.</p>

                        <p>Madam, my love was always obedient, but here is no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to shew it; and now I lament the virtues of the sad and kinde <hi>Fidelia</hi> which give me no room to express your power. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia</hi> has a Beauty and a Virtue to be sought after at the price of Kingdoms, and hazard of all that's most dear to man, and 'tis to injure her to receive her as curtesie from her who knows my soul had always a value and kindness for her; and truth still dwelt in my heart; for since I would not ly to thee that lov'd, but plainly told I lov'd another, be confident I shall never ly hereafter; and now I have said that here before the Gods of Gratitude and Truth, in the presence of this Princess, I vow a faithful friendship to the gentle <hi>Fidelia.</hi>

no body would buy me, the soul of a Slave in their esteem not weighing down his limbs: Ye Gods, either send me liberty or take your gifts again: Honour and her Issue, Courage, Justice, Faithfulness, are of no use to me; Who would be judg'd by a Slave? Courage in Chains, what can it hurt? or to be faithful, of what use when we are not trusted? O my fate! Why was I born free? Had I been bred a Slave I could have sung in Chains; nay, to have perish'd in them had been dying in my Calling; but to fall from greatness, and without a fault be punish'd with the guilty! nay, where the guilty scape!

Thousands of times have I naked stood their rage, when the element of fire has shot his angry flame into the yielding main, as if he had meant to wound her god with his forked lightning; this I have seen, and felt the mischiefs the unruly winds beget when they break prison, and force from the entrails of the earth a dangerous birth; and still their dangers were but noise.</p>

                        <p>Why dost thou hide thy blushes in my bosom, think'st thou I can be cruel to <hi>Lysimella?</hi> no, no; since I saw thee I have felt thy pain, and now can love too, but dare not promise I shall be fortunate.</p>

                        <p>Will it please the King to retire to my homely Cell, 'tis free from storms, unless you bring 'em with you; I have liv'd long there, but never felt any save what my sins brought. Some skill too I have in herbs, and fortunate (I thank the gods) I have been in my attempts in Surgery; and hope they'll smile upon these Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents too, I find no danger of death amongst 'em: and when I have my Salvatory laid by, then I'll take up my Beads; for the Priest, I see, must compleat the joys of these happy pairs, my interest in which I'll no longer hide.—Oh speak <hi>Eucratia,</hi> think'st thou the gods will accept an offering from aged <hi>Memnon</hi>'s hand again, that <stage>Puts off his disguise.</stage> once abus'd their altars by giving false Oracles, which thus they have reveng'd? if thou think'st they will, here I throw off my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, and from a Father and Priest, Sir, receive her.</p>
