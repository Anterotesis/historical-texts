            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the great <hi>opinion</hi> that I

grew ſo mightily upon me,
as that it has by a ſtrong

provoke others to appear in

Topick of St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
In his Sermon to the People,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 'tis interwoven through every
<hi>Part:</hi> In his Diſputation with the moſt
learned Philoſophers, the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and
<hi>Stoicks,</hi> in the moſt learned Univerſity of
the whole World, <hi>He Preached unto them
Jeſus and the Reſurrection,</hi> Acts 17. 18.
In his conferences with the Scribes and
the Phariſees, he Diſcourſes of the <hi>Hope
and Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> Acts 23. 6.
In ſhort, he keeps this Text and Theme
ſtill before the Rulers and Governors,
<hi>Felix, Feſtus,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa;</hi> and Drift,
Deſign, and Nerves of his Diſcourſes
meet and concenter in this great Article:
Nay it ſeems plain and undeniable that
this was in a more peculiar and eſpecial
manner given them in charge, by their
great Maſter, who <hi>ordain'd</hi> them, as it
is clearly intimated by St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi>
10. 42. <hi>He commanded us to preach unto
the People, and to teſtifie that it was he that
was ordained of God to be Judge both of the
Quick and of the Dead;</hi> the reaſon of this
is viſible at the firſt glance, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Deſcription which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of
the Reſurrection: In one place he calls it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106721:10"/>
               <hi>The Hope and Reſurrection,</hi> Acts 23. 6.
in another, <hi>Acts 26. 6. The Hope of the
Promiſe made of God unto our Fathers,
unto which Promiſe our Twelve Tribes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſerving God Day and Night, hope to
come; for which Hope's ſake, King</hi> Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,
<hi>I am accuſed of the Jews:</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
in the words next, and immediately
following, explains himſelf beyond all
doubt. <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
with you, that God ſhould Raiſe
the Dead?</hi> The Reſurrection then
is, <hi>The Hope of the Promiſe,</hi> or rather the
Reward <hi>hoped for at the Reſurrection,</hi>
which in truth is the Life and Soul of
Religion, the moſt effectual and powerful
motive to Piety, which makes every good
Man (notwithſtanding the multitude of
difficulties and diſcouragements, with
which he is at preſent ſurrounded) in love
with it, and ingages him <hi>chearfully</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movably</hi>
in God's Service. The encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all our actions and labours here is
the expectation of ſome what lovely which
attends them in the end: Wherefore doth
the Ploughman <hi>Sweat</hi> and <hi>Toil, Dig</hi> and
<hi>Delve,</hi> engage early and late in the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
labours of Husbandry through the
whole Circuit of it, Is it not becauſe he
has a proſpect of a joyful Harveſt; <hi>when
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106721:11"/>
the Vallies ſhall ſt and ſo thick with Corn, that
they ſhall laugh and Sing,</hi> Pſal. 65. <hi>ult.</hi>
Wherefore doth the Soldier run through
ſo many Hardſhips, engage in ſo many
Difficulties, expoſe himſelf to ſo many
imminent Dangers? What think you?
are not the conſiderations of the Rich
<hi>Spoils,</hi> the Glorious <hi>Victory</hi> and <hi>Triumph,</hi>
on the other ſide of this Scene of <hi>Blood
Slaughter</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> the ſtrong <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticks</hi>
to draw him on? Can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that the Combatant at the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks</hi>
would put himſelf at the expence
of that Oyl, Exerciſe and Pains, which
are indiſpenſibly neceſſary to his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter,
were it not for the allurement of
that <hi>Crown</hi> at the end of the <hi>Goal,</hi> which
appears in his Eye moſt beautiful and
charming.</p>
            <p>Take away the Reſurrection, and
you cut aſunder the <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Ligatures</hi>
of Religion, ſecure it and you have ſet it
up; the denial of this ſhocks, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
the other Articles of our Faith. The
Eſtabliſhment of it fixes them: This I
take to be the Import of the <hi>Hope of the
Promiſe,</hi> and I am confirmed in it from
the uſe of the Hebrews, who were wont
to call the Reſurrection the <hi>Seculum Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedis,</hi>
the great time of Recompenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106721:11"/>
This Argument is profeſſedly and larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled by the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
on both ſides; where from the Negative,
he acknowledges the <hi>Folly,</hi> the <hi>Vanity,</hi>
the <hi>Madneſs</hi> of preaching, ſetting up for,
or pretending to Religion; <hi>then i. e.</hi> if
this great Truth labour, all that is built
on it muſt of courſe fall to the ground;
<hi>then is our Preaching Vain, our Faith Vain:</hi>
The great Heralds of the Goſpel are
<hi>Falſe Witneſſes, we are in our Sins:</hi> Then
thoſe that are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are
periſhed. The Apoſtle goes on, <hi>ver. 19. If
in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are
of all Men moſt miſerable.</hi> Whereas Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
with a ſuppoſition of a Reſurrection
and the immediate attendants of it, muſt
be confeſs'd to take the beſt, and the
wiſeſt courſe, to have the ſtart and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of all Mankind beſides: The
contrary does moſt juſtly charge them
with weakneſs, folly, and diſtraction;
and in the proſecution of the Argument,
he plainly lays open the Reaſons of the
ſame, <hi>ver. 29. Elſe what ſhall they do that
are Baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe
not at all; why are they then Baptized for
the dead, and why ſtand ye in jepordy every
hour?</hi> The true intent and meaning of
which place (without engaging in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106721:12"/>
Intricacies and Difficulties of it, which
is a thing excentrick to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
I take to be this. To what end do
Men tye themſelves up to the ſtrict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of this Way of Worſhip, and
willingly expoſe themſelves to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Butcheries,</hi> to moſt cruel Tortures,
Racks, and Deaths? If there be no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi>
this way is the moſt ſenſleſs
and ridiculous: If ſo, the Saints were
<hi>Fools,</hi> the Martyrs were <hi>Fools,</hi> thoſe that
crucified their Bodies by the ſeverities
of <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Self-denial,</hi> muſt be
confeſſed weak in their intellectuals; and
thoſe that expos'd themſelves to Fire and
Faggot, to the Torments of the <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre,</hi>
the moſt Cruel and Barbarous
uſages which Men or Devils could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
to treat them with, were egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
deceived and deluded. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
brings home the Argument to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>ver. 31, 32. I proteſt by your rejoycing
which I have in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, I
die daily; If after the manner of Men I
have fought with Beaſts at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>what
advantageth it me if the dead riſe not? Let
us Eat and Drink, for to morrow we die;</hi>
where the Apoſtle counting his Practiſe,
his Perils, his Sufferings, readily grants
all theſe to be miſtakes and miſcarriages,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106721:12"/>
without the Reſurrection; and prefers
the Doctrine and Practiſe of the Epicure
before it. To what end ſhould Men
<hi>Faſt, Watch,</hi> and <hi>Pray,</hi> and deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the injoyments of this World,
<hi>keep under their Bodies,</hi> and bring them
<hi>into ſubjection?</hi> To what end ſhould Men
indure the contradictions of Sinners? To
what end ſhould Men expoſe themſelves
to all the hardſhips, and miſuſages of
Men of a wicked and barbarous World
if there be no Reſurrection? But on the
contrary, to our everlaſting Comfort
and Encouragement, he aſſures us of a
Reſurrection; and That a moſt glorious
one too, which is the grand Subject of
the remaining part of the Chapter; on
which, as on a Foundation impoſſible
to be ſhaken, he endeavours to fix the
Faith and Practice of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
and with them, of all that embrace this
Holy Profeſſion: <hi>Wherefore, my beloved
Brethren, be ſteadfaſt, immovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as you know that your labour is not

Heavenly Doctrine is fixt on immovable

and Fabulous Reports</hi> of <hi>Pinto</hi> and the

of the Old, and more eſpecially

of an <hi>Alknowing, Infallible, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent</hi>

moſt conſiderable Objections that have
been brought againſt it, are daſh'd in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and laid even with the Duſt; from the
conſideration of the Veracity and Alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of that God, who has bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106721:14"/>
and his Attributes for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant how many learned
and ingenious Men have taken much
pains to ſolve, from the principle of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
the Arguments brought againſt it.
I honour and admire them for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances;
but I muſt freely ſay, I much
queſtion whether the attempts of this
kind come up to the point, whether they
are not too low and inferiour to give it
ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>My Reaſon is this, The Reſurrection
is confeſſed by all to be a work above Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and how it can be made out by
Natural Philoſophy, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>Our Reaſon muſt be beholding to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
in this matter, and call in the
aſſiſtance of Faith, without which there
can be no Aſſurance. In ſhort, if we
believe the Creation, I cannot ſee any
<hi>ſtumbling block</hi> here, that Power who
made the World and Man at firſt, out of
nothing, muſt be readily acknowledged
able to raiſe him from the Grave, and to
joyn together the ſcattered Particles of his
diſſolved Body. The one ſeems more
eaſie than the other: This is the great,
the Common Argument of the Ancients,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106721:15"/>
and has without doubt been more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to the purpoſe than a Cart-load of
<hi>Chimical Experiments,</hi> than all the notions
of the moſt ſubtile Philoſophers. But this
I have ſaid to make way to my <hi>Deſign,</hi>
which is to enquire into the ſtrength of
the Argument for the Reſurrection from
a principle of Juſtice; In which I ſhall
take this Method,</p>
            <p>1. I ſhall briefly lay down the State
of the Argument</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall ſhew how it has been the
Great, the Principal, the moſt Topping,
and Chiefeſt Argument of all Ages.</p>
            <p>3. I ſhall offer to anſwer the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are levied againſt it.</p>
            <p>4. I ſhall Examine his Reaſons of the
Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>

will ſecure it.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
            <p>THE State of the Argument in
ſhort is, The Body and the Soul
are here joyned together as <hi>ſharers</hi> in all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106721:15"/>
the Concerns and Actions of this Life
which is a ſtate of <hi>Probation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are to ſtand or fall together in
the next, which is a ſtate of <hi>Remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The Body of the Saint and Good
Man concurs with his Soul in the exerciſe
of Vertue and Piety in this World; and
can there be any thing more equitable
than that they ſhould be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in that which is to come? On the
the other hand, the Body of the Sinner
muſt be allowed a <hi>Partner</hi> with the Soul
in Evil; and is there not all the reaſon in
the World that it ſhould ſtand forth at the
Bar, and be joyned with it in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
The contrary muſt be pronounced
downright Injuſtice. Can we have ſuch
hard thoughts of the moſt <hi>Righteous
Judge,</hi> that he ſhould admit the Soul
of the Martyr upon his diſſolution, to that
Glorious <hi>Crown</hi> which he has promiſed
in the higheſt Heavens; and mean while
have no regard to the Crucified Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
Body that has <hi>born the heat and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the Day;</hi> been the <hi>ſaddeſt Patient</hi>
in all the Tragedy; but ſuffer it to lie
neglected in the Grave? <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lt.</hi> How can
we imagine that the Soul of the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
ſhould be condemned to the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Tophet,</hi> for thoſe ſins it commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106721:16"/>
in conjunction with the Body; and
that the Body it ſelf ſhould eſcape ſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free,
<hi>ſleep</hi> undiſturbed in the Grave, and
neither know nor <hi>feel</hi> any thing of thoſe
<hi>Flames.</hi> In this caſe have we not reaſon
to cry out with the Prophet <hi>Malachy, 2. 17.
Where is the God of Judgment?</hi> For
Juſtice carries in the very Nature of it
a due and impartial diſtribution of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
and <hi>Puniſhments.</hi> If two work
together, both have a right to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
'tis downright injuſtice to give all
to One, and nothing to the Other. This
is the ſubſtance of the Argument, of
which I muſt take leave further to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the Reader, that it has been the
great, the <hi>ſtanding</hi> Argument of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
of Men in all Ages: In the firſt
place I affirm this was the great reaſon
which the Jews ſtill uſed and applyed to
the ſame purpoſe. I would not boaſt of
what I have not, I cannot pretend to
<hi>Rabbinical Learning;</hi> yet I am ſure of
what I aſſert, becauſe many learned Men
have told me ſo, and I have ſeen <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
their ſecond <hi>Solomon,</hi> their <hi>Renowned
Epitomizer</hi> in Latin; and many times met
with the famous Fable of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
which becauſe it comes home and pat to
the purpoſe, I here inſert: <hi>There was a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106721:16"/>
great Lord who planted a delicious Garden,
wherein he placed two Keepers, a Blind Man
and a Lame Man, that he might be ſecure of
his Fruit on all hands; but ſo it was that
after ſome time he found himſelf Robb'd: He
charges the Keepers with the Theft; they
both offer very plauſible excuſes; the Blind
Man pleads he could not ſee the Fruit, and
therefore could not Steal it: The Lame
Man alledges the Infirmity of his Feet, he could
not reach it, and ſo could not take it away:
At laſt the fallacy was found out,</hi> viz. <hi>'Twas
done by the mutual combination of both:
The Blind Man takes the Lame Man on his
back, by whoſe direction and aſſiſtance he is
guided to the Trees, lifted up to the Fruit,
and ſo enabled to take it away; whereupon
the Maſter after all their excuſes, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
gives them their doom;</hi> Both were
joyned in the Sin, and Both muſt ſhare
in the Puniſhment. This is the caſe of
the Body and the Soul, ſaith the Jewiſh
Maſters: The one acts in conjunction
with the other; one could not Sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the other, and therefore both muſt
ſtand and fall together; And I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to add, <hi>Nec Lex eſt juſtior ulla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I do affirm this to be the conſtant,
profeſt, moſt ſolemn reaſon, moſt often
and upon all occaſions made uſe of by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106721:17"/>
moſt, if not all <hi>the Fathers</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
The Learned and vaſtly read
Author in his <hi>Elaborate Treatiſe,</hi> has given
us a conſiderable number of them, <hi>p. 209.
Athenagor as, Tertullian, Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi>
St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, Epiphanius, Ambroſe,
Theodoret, Aenaeas Gazaeus, Damaſcenus,
Nilus, Photius;</hi> and has cited the places.
And though I cannot pretend to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of the Doctor's knowledge in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yet I can eaſily give him a much
larger <hi>Liſt,</hi> and produce the places too;
but this I induſtriouſly avoid, becauſe
every <hi>Common-Place-Book</hi> will afford it;
and becauſe it would be juſtly liable to
Cenſure, and becauſe in the preſent caſe
'tis altogether needleſs, foraſmuch as the
Learned Author has liberally granted,
<hi>That all the ancient Greeks and Latins agree
in this, that God is obliged in juſtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or puniſh the Body together with the
Soul: Nay,</hi> Origin <hi>himſelf who has ſet up
a different Hypotheſis makes uſe of the ſame.</hi>
'Tis beſide my intention to ſtuff this
ſmall Eſſay with a multitude of great
Names and Quotations.</p>
            <p>In the next place I take leave to ſay
that this is the great and main reaſon,
made uſe of in the preſent Argument,
by <hi>the Maſter of the Sentences. The
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106721:17"/>
Angelical Doctor,</hi> and the whole Tribe
of the Schoolmen, as any one that has
but look'd into them muſt acknowledge,
and the Doctor himſelf has owned. In
the laſt place, I affirm this to be the
main, chief, and conſtant reaſon urg'd by
all Modern Writers, Commentators, and
others, not only of our own, but other
Nations: For my part I ſpeak it upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I can caſt mine Eyes on no Book on the
ſubject, but I meet with it; and that
not among the <hi>Scriblers</hi> of the lower
Rank, but amongſt the <hi>Maſters of the
Aſſemblies,</hi> the moſt celebrated Authors,
Men of Renown in their Generations.
I could eaſily fill a great deal of Paper
here, but I ſhall diſmiſs this Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with one Authority only, and that
is of the Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> on <hi>Mat. 2. 32.
Inter omnia Argumenta quae ad probandam
Reſurrectionem adhiberi ſolent,</hi> &amp;c.—
<hi>Amongſt all the Arguments which are brought
to prove the Reſurrection, I know none
more effectual and proper, than that which</hi>
Clement <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>was wont to
urge, having received it from St.</hi> Peter, <hi>that
if God be juſt there muſt be a Reſurrection;</hi>
and this Doctrine this great Man approves
of, and in that place eſtabliſhes with no
mean Authorities. Whither (not to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106721:18"/>
tranſcribe) I refer the Reader; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he tells us, 'twas the Doctrine
which St. <hi>Clement</hi> received from St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
I could heartily wiſh that I could find
out this paſſage in St. <hi>Clement,</hi> in order
whereunto I muſt confeſs I have ſought
after it, and have found it, but not to my
<hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> among the <hi>Dialogues</hi> of
St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> the <hi>2d. Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>
which bears the name of St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but no doubt is <hi>ſpurious,</hi> and
therefore not to be inſiſted on, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended,
however it may bear ſome

            <p>BUT the Learned Author, in his
Treatiſe of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> has been
pleaſed to lay it aſide; and having paid
his <hi>Reſpect and Deference</hi> to the ancient
Fathers, the avowed Patriots of it; He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<hi>Cenſures</hi> and <hi>Condemns</hi> it in the

impartially conſider this Aſſertion, we ſhall find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it not to be true,</hi> and he gives us thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for it; <hi>1ſt, To ſpeak properly the Body is
not capable either of Sinning or doing Well, it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106721:19"/>
is only the inſtrument of the Soul, and the
Arm that ſtabs, ſins no more than the Sword;
'tis the Soul only that is the Murderer:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
2dly, <hi>Is the Body capable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
or Puniſhments, 'tis the Soul</hi> that is
ſenſible: Nothing but what is ſenſible
only, can <hi>be capable of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
3dly, <hi>If it be injuſtice</hi> in God, to
Puniſh the Soul alone <hi>without the Body,
in Conjunction with which ſhe committed the
Sin; then all the Matter which conſtituted
the Body when the ſeveral Sins were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
muſt be raiſed again and reunited to
the Soul; for if ſome, why not all? But
what Monſters of Men ſhould we be in the
Reſurrection, if all the ſubſtance, of which
our Bodies conſiſted from our Childhood
to our Death, ſhould be gathered together and
formed into a Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Sum of the <hi>Charge,</hi> which
the Learned Doctor has to lay againſt the
Doctrine which has been allow'd of
by all, and is the <hi>Attempt</hi> of this Paper
to cover and fecure: There are other
Paſſages in the following part of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
which ſhall be accounted for in
their proper place.</p>
            <p>And here I take it for granted, that
there are no other difficulties that lie
in the way; no other <hi>Objections,</hi> at leaſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106721:19"/>
of any moment, againſt it, becauſe they
come from ſo accompliſhed an Author,
who muſt be ſuppoſed to have ſaid the
moſt that can be againſt it.</p>
            <p>Without making any Apology, I ſhall
endeavour to give ſatisfaction to all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the method in which they
lye.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I anſwer by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
that the Body, properly ſpeaking,
is not capable of Sinning, or of doing
well, conſidered in its own Nature, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractively</hi>
in its ſelf; 'tis a paſſive prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and can pretend to no Life, Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
Senſe, or Motion in a ſingle ſtate:
'Tis likewiſe granted that the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Soul, is a Dull, Stupid, Senſeleſs
Clod of Earth, a Stinking Carcaſs, a Sink
of Rottenneſs and Corruption, uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Acting, Doing, Suffering, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
all whatſoever, or more than the
Doctor can ſuggeſt; but in a ſtate of
Conjunction with the Soul, 'tis far otherwiſe,
ſo that it injoys Life, Senſe, and
Motion; ſhares and ingages with it in
all its concerns: So that in the two firſt
Reaſons there is a manifeſt <hi>Fallacy</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
which runs through every part,
viſible to every common Eye; and is no
ſooner de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rted, but the whole Fabrick of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106721:20"/>
his ſubtile Argumentation ſinks, and falls
even with the duſt: Though the Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
cannot, yet in conjunction with the
Soul, it may. When a Noble <hi>Lord</hi>
takes to Wife one of the meaneſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
who has no pretenſions of her
own, to any thing that is great; yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her <hi>Marriage</hi> ſhe is Dignified and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
with all the Privileges of her
<hi>Right Honourable Spouſe:</hi> This, as near
as I can repreſent it, is the Caſe of the
Soul and Body: The Heaven-born
Bridegroom ſtoops to the Earth for a
<hi>Partner;</hi> Advances, Exalts the Beggar,
confers Life, Senſe, Motion on her; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
her to <hi>Bed</hi> and <hi>Board,</hi> allows her a
ſhare in all his <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Injoyments.</hi>
The Body without the Soul can neither
<hi>Sin</hi> nor do <hi>Well:</hi> But the happy wedlock
has ennobled this piece of Clay, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
it in conjunction to act with it.
So that I fancy the Doctor to be under a
miſtake, when he calls the Body only the
Inſtrument of the Soul: Certainly 'tis
more, 'tis an eſſential Part, and the Man
can as well be without the Soul as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Body; to call the Body therefore
an Inſtrument, is too low a <hi>Term,</hi> when
'tis manifeſtly the <hi>Collegue</hi> and <hi>Companion</hi>
of the Soul, and together with it, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106721:20"/>
               <hi>the Great Prince and Lord of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
I ſhall challenge the moſt Acute of
Philoſophers to give me the definition of
a Man without a Body: <hi>Nec caro ſine
anima Homo, quae poſt exilium Cadaver eſt,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> The Soul without the
Body is no more the Man, than the Body
without the Soul. If then it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
a <hi>Phyſical, Indiſpenſible</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of his conſtitution, the one half of
the Man; What a diſparagement is it
to call it an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> only? Now that
it is ſo, the Learned Doctor himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
tells us, <hi>Pag. 218. 'Tis a great
miſtake to imagine, that the Identity or Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Man conſiſts wholy in the Sameneſs
of the Soul; if</hi> Euphorbus, Homer, <hi>and</hi>
Ennius <hi>had had one and the ſame Soul,
yet they would not have been one and the ſame,
but three diſtinct Men.</hi> It ſeems then it
is the <hi>conſtituting,</hi> the <hi>eſſential,</hi> and moſt
<hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Principle, it can make three
Men of one Soul; and ſo by conſequence
threeſcore: And how worthily 'tis called
an Inſtrument only, let the World judge.
I confeſs 'tis often by Philoſophers and
Divines ſet out by this Expreſſion, <hi>The
Inſtrument of the Soul,</hi> to denote, as I
ſuppoſe, the tranſcendent excellency of
the Soul above it, and all that Life,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106721:21"/>
Senſe, and Activity it can pretend to, as
derived from the Soul, and dependent on
it; yet, That it is more than an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is acknowledged by the Learned
Author, who calls it <hi>pag. 198. The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue</hi>
and <hi>Companion</hi> of the Soul; and
<hi>pag 204. Her old Acquaintance;</hi> and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably
proved from 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 18. He
that comitteth Fornication Sinneth againſt
his own Body:</hi> Here it is manifeſtly a <hi>Party,</hi>
and ſo interpreted and underſtood by
Commentators on the place. The like
might be obſerved of other ſins, as of
<hi>Gluttony, Drunkenneſs,</hi> &amp;c. which are
properly called the <hi>Luſts</hi> or <hi>Sins</hi> of the
Fleſh. But 'tis farther Objected, <hi>That
the Arm that stabs, ſins no more than the
Sword.</hi> Here then is a good plea for Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
at the <hi>Bar,</hi> and 'tis much it has
never been made uſe of: but I believe
the <hi>Homicide</hi> ſuſpects that it would do him
no kindneſs; it would be received by
the Court with <hi>Laughter,</hi> and rejected
with <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Indignation;</hi> and reaſon
good, for the Sword is a Tool in its ſelf
<hi>Innocent</hi> and <hi>Harmleſs,</hi> 'tis the Arm that
weilds it, that impreſſes it, that' gives it
<hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> to deſtroy; ſo that if to
gratifie the Objection, we allow the
<hi>Arm</hi> to be an Inſtrument, yet that it is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106721:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no more concerned in the <hi>Matter</hi> than
the Sword, is notoriouſly falſe, becauſe
the one is a <hi>dead,</hi> the other a living <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument;</hi>
and there muſt be a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between theſe. The Arm conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
a-part, is no more able to kill, than
the <hi>Sword;</hi> nay, leſs able, becauſe that
has not ſo fit a diſpoſition to pierce thro'
the Bowels as the other, being made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
for that purpoſe: But the Arm uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Body has Strength, Vigour,
Motion in every part, and muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the true efficient Cauſe of the
Murther; whereas the other is the
Means, the Weapon to effect it: And
here alſo the Fallacy of Diviſion is very
plain and viſible.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
            <p>BUT the <hi>Objector</hi> adds, <hi>'Tis the Soul
only that is the Murtherer.</hi> If it be
ſo, I wonder then what the <hi>Judge,
Jury,</hi> and <hi>Executioner,</hi> the <hi>Gaol,</hi> or
<hi>Gallows</hi> have to ſay or do to the Body; if
it be ſo, there is an horrible Scene of
Injuſtice all the World over; if ſo, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirant
Reges, plectuntur Achivi,</hi> was not
the ſingle Caſe of the poor <hi>Grecians,</hi>
who went to pot for the Miſcarriages of
their <hi>Generals,</hi> but the common and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Fate of all Mankind. Certainly
if the Soul only be the Murtherer, the
Body is free, ought not to be touch'd, is
by all Laws whatſoever, diſcharg'd both
from the Guilt and Puniſhment of that
Crime in which it had no hand. For
as 'tis Injuſtice on one ſide, not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Guilty; ſo 'tis no leſs on the
other to puniſh the <hi>Innocent.</hi> If this
<hi>quaint</hi> Notion of the Philoſopher could
be made good before the <hi>Bench,</hi> it would
bring him in more Gain than all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
beſide: But alas, this nail will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106721:22"/>
never drive. He will never be able to
perſwade the World of the truth of it.
And indeed it does exceedingly labour:
For, 'tis not the <hi>Soul,</hi> but 'tis the <hi>Man</hi>
that is the <hi>Murderer.</hi> And here alſo is a
manifeſt <hi>Tang</hi> of the old Sophiſm. True
indeed, the Soul is the firſt, chief, and
principal <hi>Actor</hi> in the <hi>Tragedy,</hi> but we
can by no means excuſe the outward Part.
'Tis the Soul that beſtows on the Body
<hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>senſe,</hi> without which it could
not poſſibly lay claim to either; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
here 'tis <hi>Ridiculous</hi> to imagine, that
the more <hi>Spiritual</hi> and noble Part, uſes the
<hi>Terreſtrial</hi> and earthy, as a <hi>Tool</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,</hi>
an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> only, <hi>i. e.</hi> bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agitates and moves it, as the <hi>Snail</hi>
does his <hi>Shell;</hi> the <hi>Waterman</hi> his <hi>Boat;</hi>
the <hi>Rider</hi> his <hi>Horſe;</hi> the <hi>Fencing-Maſter</hi>
his <hi>Weapon;</hi> the <hi>Man</hi> his <hi>Cloaths.</hi> No,
this has been ſufficiently exploded by the
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> in the cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Queſtion on the preſent Subject,
being by Both, conſtantly maintained in
the <hi>Negative.</hi> The Soul, during its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
with its <hi>beloved Bride,</hi> is liberal
in his Endowments towards her, (as in
the foregoing Compariſon) furniſhes and
ſets her up with great <hi>Accompliſhments,</hi>
beſtows <hi>Senſe, Vigour, Activity, Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106721:23"/>
on</hi> on her, ſo that derivatively ſhe has
the Benefit, Uſe, and Enjoyment of all
theſe. This is a Doctrine diſputable; and
I believe will not go down with all; but
for the Truth of it, I appeal to the Senſe
of Mankind, and for its Support I briefly
offer theſe <hi>Conſiderations.</hi> 1. The Soul
diffuſes it ſelf through every <hi>Part</hi> of the
Body, according to the known Maxim
of the great <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> and certainly to
no other purpoſe, but to beſtow its <hi>Largeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
The <hi>Vegetable Soul</hi> gives Life to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Particle of the <hi>Plant</hi> or <hi>Tree,</hi> and
the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul cannot be ſuppoſed to
be leſs <hi>liberal.</hi> 2. 'Tis undeniable, that
there is a <hi>mutual</hi> and <hi>reciprocal</hi> Influence of
each toward other. The Soul impreſſes
the Body; on t'other hand, That im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
the Soul. The loving Pair <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
give and receive from each other;
the noble <hi>Spouſe</hi> makes his <hi>Bride</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Preſents ſo often mentioned; She,
on the other hand, guides and directs the
Soul in his Behaviour; according to the
known Axiome, <hi>Mores animae ſequuntur
temper amentum corporis,</hi> which I confeſs I
do not underſtand, unleſs it come home
to the purpoſe. The different <hi>Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>Complexions</hi> of our Bodies have
a powerful influence on our Souls, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106721:23"/>
do, in a great meaſure, <hi>over-rule</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
them. This is allowed by all, and
manifeſtly appears in the Behaviour of
<hi>Children</hi> ſuitable to their <hi>Progenitors:</hi>
They do, for the moſt part, follow their
<hi>Way,</hi> and tread in their <hi>Steps.</hi> The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is the <hi>perpetual Dictator,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
to the Soul the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi>
of its Government. Thus, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the peculiar Compoſure of the
<hi>outward,</hi> we find the Diſpoſitions of the
<hi>inward Man.</hi> He in whom the <hi>ſanguine
Complexion</hi> is predominant, proclaims his
Conſtitution by his Port and Actions, is
<hi>Bold, Couragious, Magnanimous</hi> and <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick;</hi>
whereas the <hi>Cholerick</hi> Man tells the
World what he is made of, by his <hi>Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs</hi>
and <hi>Petulancy:</hi> And ſo in all other
Caſes as all here agree. And leaſt the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion
of <hi>Traduction</hi> which prevails with
ſome, ſhould enervate the force of the
Argument, To put it altogether without
diſpute, I lay down this as an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Poſition,</hi> That the <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
are not only influenced by their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
but <hi>Nurſes</hi> too. The Conceſſions
of <hi>Philoſophers, Phyſicians,</hi> and confirmed
<hi>Experience</hi> of all, do give me a <hi>Superſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi>
here, and pronounce the Proof of
it altogether needleſs. There is a Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

this Subject, to a <hi>Noble Woman,</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her to give <hi>ſuck</hi> to her own <hi>Child,</hi>
and not endanger the corrupting of his
<hi>Manners</hi> by a <hi>ſtrange</hi> Milk. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is ſo <hi>full, excellent,</hi> and <hi>nervous,</hi> that
I can hardly forbear to tranſcribe it; and
whereunto, for full Satisfaction I refer the
<hi>Reader.</hi> 3. That the Body is endowed
with <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Senſation,</hi> is undeniable from
the common and daily Experience of it in
every part: Even the <hi>Extream</hi> Parts are
endued with a ready and moſt exquiſite
<hi>Senſation.</hi> And, 4. the Truth of it is
abundantly confirmed from this uſual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
That if at any time there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
a <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> a <hi>Mortification</hi> in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
part, inſtantly there is recourſe to
the <hi>Surgeon</hi> and his <hi>Saw,</hi> to take off the
<hi>dead</hi> part, for the Preſervation of the
<hi>whole;</hi> which to me is little leſs than a
<hi>Demonſtration,</hi> That the other Parts are
<hi>truly</hi> and <hi>actually alive.</hi> The Body even
of <hi>Adam</hi> (if the Suppoſition may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd)
before its Union with its Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Partner,</hi> was a ſenſeleſs Clod of
Earth; but when <hi>God breathed into him
the Breath of Life,</hi> then <hi>Man became a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106721:24"/>
Soul;</hi> a living Man, though we
allow it a Carkaſs, upon its Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="7" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Objector</hi> goes on: <hi>Neither is
the Body capable of any Rewards or
Puniſhments, 'tis the Soul only that is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
and nothing but what is ſenſible can
be capable of Rewards and Puniſhments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here again we are aſſaulted with the
old <hi>Paralogiſm,</hi> and therefore muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
it with the ſame Anſwer. The
Body without the Soul is capable of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Rewards</hi> nor <hi>Puniſhments;</hi> but in
Conjunction with it is exquiſitely ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and enjoys either. What have we
to do to conſider the Body in a ſeparate
state? This is <hi>foreign, impertinent,</hi> and
beſide the Argument in all reſpects. Our
Diſpute lies about the <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> that
Men do in this Life, and that <hi>Remuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
which according to their Deſerts,
ſhall attend them at the <hi>Reſurrection:</hi>
In both which the whole Man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and not one part; neither the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106721:25"/>
Body without the Soul, nor the Soul
without the Body, but both in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And though I will not deny;
That the Soul while in the Body, may,
and does ſometimes act <hi>Abſtractively,</hi>
without the <hi>Concurrence</hi> of the Body, in
a Spiritual and Intellectual Manner, in
good or bad <hi>Deſires, Cogitations,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances,</hi>
which are by the Philoſophers
call'd <hi>Immanent Acts;</hi> and ſo by conſequence
has a <hi>ſeparate, diſtinct</hi> Enjoyment of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
or <hi>Pain,</hi> according to the Reſult and
Nature of them, wholly <hi>peculiar</hi> to its
ſelf, and altogether <hi>independent</hi> from the
Body; yet all other Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
here, are conferred on the
Soul by the Mediation of the Body; ſo
far is the Objection from being true, as
that the contrary is undeniable. As the
Body is beholden to the Soul for the
Capacity of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> ſo
all the Rewards or Puniſhments that are
or can be placed on the Soul in this
Life, are owing to the Body, without
which 'tis altogether impoſſible it ſhould
be inveſted with either. How is the
Soul of the moſt deſerving <hi>Courtier</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd,
but by the Body? How is the
Soul of the <hi>Valiant Soldier</hi> advanc'd to
higher Dignity of Command, but by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106721:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Body? How is the Soul of the <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Doctor</hi> bleſs'd with Plurality of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
in the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi>
but by the Body? And ſo in all other
Caſes whatſoever. On the other hand,
the ſame is no leſs viſible in the Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Puniſhments: How is the Soul of
the <hi>Malefactor</hi> brought to ſuffer, but by
the Body? Ask the <hi>Priſoner</hi> in the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi>
with his heavy Load of Fetters on,
how the <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Irons</hi> come to affect
his <hi>Soul;</hi> he will readily tell thee, 'Tis
by the <hi>Body.</hi> Ask the <hi>petty Thief</hi> at the
the <hi>Cart's Tayl,</hi> how his Spiritual Part
does rue for his Tranſgreſſion, and he'll
tell thee, 'tis by the painful <hi>Stripes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on his <hi>Back.</hi> Ask the Man that
has undergone the Shame and Torment
of the <hi>Hot Iron,</hi> how the principal Actor
in the <hi>Crime</hi> comes to have a ſhare, he
will immediately by his woful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
reſolve the Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> by the
ſcandalous <hi>Stigma</hi> in his <hi>Hand</hi> or <hi>Cheek;</hi>
which to his Anguiſh he has felt, and to
his Diſgrace muſt retain. In ſhort, Ask
the Man in the <hi>Cart,</hi> tyed with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<hi>Halter,</hi> and juſt ready to be turn'd
over, how the firſt and chief <hi>Contriver</hi>
of the Offence for which he is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is brought to ſuffer, and he can give
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106721:26"/>
thee no other Anſwer. The Soul is a
<hi>Spiritual, Intellectual, Inviſible</hi> Being, no
way ſubject to the <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> or <hi>Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of any Power on Earth; 'tis no way
capable of the <hi>Preferment</hi> of a <hi>Palace,</hi>
nor of the <hi>Confinement</hi> of a <hi>Priſon,</hi> but
above, and out of the Reach of both, and
can have no Colour of pretence to any
<hi>Rewards</hi> or <hi>Puniſhments</hi> whatſoever, at
preſent, (excepting thoſe before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
but in Conjunction with, and by
the Mediation of the Body. In Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
our Anſwer here is, 'Tis neither
the one nor the other, in a <hi>divided</hi> or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Senſe, that has a Claim or Title to
<hi>Rewards</hi> or <hi>Puniſhments</hi> here; 'tis the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum,</hi>
the Soul and Body in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and
Conjunction</hi> together; <hi>i.e.</hi> 'tis the <hi>Man</hi>
that can challenge this: And as for an
Anſwer to the <hi>Objection,</hi> with reference
to the Body after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> (which
is the main <hi>Subject</hi> of the preſent <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi>)
if the Body be not capable of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
or <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> I would fain have
the Learned Dr. to tell me, what doth the
Body of the <hi>Saint</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> or what
makes the Body of the <hi>Reprobate</hi> in <hi>Hell?</hi>
Sure I am, becauſe ſo taught by Chriſt
himſelf, as two <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> have record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it (<hi>Matt. 10. 28. Luc. 12. 4.) That
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106721:26"/>
Men are able to kill the Body, and God is
able to deſtroy both Body and Soul.</hi> Now
you cannot be ſaid, with any Congruity
of Speech, to kill that which has no
<hi>Senſe,</hi> no <hi>Life;</hi> and what is liable to be
deſtroy'd in Hell-fire muſt be allow'd ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> and by unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Conſequence, of <hi>Sin,</hi> whereof this
is the <hi>Wages.</hi> In ſhort, this ſacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
lays the <hi>Axe</hi> to the <hi>Root</hi> of the
<hi>two firſt</hi> Objections, and <hi>fells</hi> them to the

<hi>deſtroy'd in Hell-fire;</hi> it cannot be deny'd
to be <hi>ſenſible, capable</hi> of <hi>ſinning,</hi> of <hi>doing

            <p>THat our Bodies are more than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
only, is a <hi>Truth</hi> that
clearly ſhines forth from the Make and
Creation of them. Man was brought
into the World laſt of all, and therefore
muſt be acknowledg'd the moſt <hi>perfect</hi>
and <hi>compleat</hi> of all the <hi>Creatures;</hi> He is
upon this account, called by the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
the <hi>Microcoſm,</hi> the <hi>Little World,</hi>
the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>Greater:</hi> And tho' the
Fabrick of all others, (tho' never ſo mean)
muſt be own'd to be <hi>ſtupendous;</hi> yet
there is certainly ſomewhat in <hi>Humane
Bodies,</hi> ſurpaſſing and tranſcendent; if not
in the <hi>Matter,</hi> yet in the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
of 'em. The Conſultation of the
<hi>Eternal Trinity</hi> about this Affair, imports
ſomewhat <hi>ſingular;</hi> a Product more than
ordinary.—<hi>Come, Let us make man, (Gen.</hi>
1. 26.) the <hi>Prince,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> of all the
reſt. This is taught us in that paſſage of
<hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job 33. 4. The ſpirit of God hath
made me, and the breath of the Almighty

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106721:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
notes the <hi>Exactneſs</hi> of his Frame:
Man is the <hi>Maſter-piece</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi>
(as his immortal Commentator (<hi>Caryl</hi>)
has obſerv'd. Our Bodies are <hi>Temples
built,</hi> and <hi>Temples ſanctify'd: A living
Man,</hi> Geneſ. 2. 7. <hi>Man became a living
Soul:</hi> And upon this account the Royal

Rapture, <hi>Pſal. 139. 14. I will praiſe thee,
for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
marvellous are thy Works, and that my Soul
knoweth right well. My ſubſtance was not
hid from thee though I were made in ſecret;
and curiouſly wrought in the lowest parts of
the earth; Thine Eyes did ſee my ſubſtance
yet being imperfect, and in thy Book were
all my members written, which day by day
were faſhioned, when as yet there were none
of them.</hi>—The <hi>Fabrick</hi> of Man is of all
other the moſt <hi>exquiſite:</hi> This the Great
<hi>Mrſter of Phyſick</hi> has profeſſedly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in a moſt Admirable Treatiſe of 17
Books; which <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> thinks was
penn'd with a Spirit of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> for
the Refutation of the <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of <hi>Epicurus:</hi> and the <hi>Mirrour</hi> of
<hi>of Learning, (Orig. Sacr.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 1.)

The whole <hi>Work</hi> is a full and

Prelate,</hi> who thereupon thinks it
ſtrange that <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of all Men ſhould

2. But if this Conſideration will not
do, let us for a while contemplate the
<hi>Aſſumption,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of our <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour.</hi> He took ſuch a <hi>Nature</hi> as
ours, ſuch a Body as ours, with all its
Organical Parts. To this purpoſe he
ſtoop'd to <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> to the <hi>Womb</hi> of
a <hi>poor Virgin,</hi> to the <hi>Stable</hi> and the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi>
To this purpoſe, He that <hi>was in the
form of God, and thought it not robbery to
be equal with God, made himſelf of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>emptied</hi> himſelf, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rob'd
himſelf of his <hi>Divine Dignity,</hi> and
took upon <hi>him</hi> the <hi>Form of a ſervant, and
was made in the likeneſs of man.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>
tells us, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. That the Eternal
<hi>Word that was in the beginning, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all things, was made fleſh, and dwelt
among us:</hi> And the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
chap.</hi> 2. 16. gives us a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, with an Aſſeveration, <hi>Verily
he took not on him the nature of Angels,
but the ſeed of Abraham; i.e.</hi> He was an
entire Man like any of us (<hi>ſin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi>).
Nay, what is more, that very
Body which he aſſum'd, in which he <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
and in which he was <hi>crucified,</hi> is
aſcended up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> where he ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
at the <hi>Right hand of God,</hi> and by
the powerful <hi>Rhetorick</hi> of his Wounds,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106721:29"/>
the <hi>Impreſſion</hi> of which he now retains,
is our <hi>Eternal Expiatory Sacrifice, inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
tranſacting the great Work of <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
with his Father, ſtill making <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi>
for us.</p>
            <p>By this there is conferr'd on <hi>Humane
Nature,</hi> the higheſt <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi>
imaginable; and this muſt teach us to
put a value on our Bodies, and to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them as more than <hi>Machines</hi> and <hi>Tools</hi>
only. This (if I miſtake not) is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
moſt genuine, and naturally flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Premiſſes; and 'tis moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the expreſs Uſe which the Ancients
would have us to make of it. Thus St.
<hi>Auſtine,</hi> on the preſent Subject, (<hi>de Verit.
Relig.</hi> cap. 6.) <hi>Demonſtravit nobis Deus
quàm excelſum locum inter creatur as habet
humana natura, in hoc quod in hominibus,
in vero homine apparuit: God</hi> (ſaith the
holy Father) <hi>hath given us a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Dignity and tranſcendent Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of Humane Nature, in that Christ, a</hi>
VERY MAN, <hi>lived among Men.</hi> And
to the ſame purpoſe another great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
(<hi>Leo, Serm. 1. de Nat. Dom.) Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſce,
O Chriſtiane, dignitatem tuam &amp;
divine conſors factus naturae, noli in vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
vilitatem degeneri conſuetudine redire:</hi>
i. e. <hi>Christ, by taking ſuch a Body, has ſhewn
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106721:29"/>
thee the Dignity and Excellency of thine;
taught thee not to diſparage, diſ-eſteem it, or
uſe it unworthily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But if neither of theſe be ſufficient,
come we in the <hi>third</hi> place, to caſt our
Eyes a little on the <hi>Redemption;</hi> and in
that great Work the <hi>Whole Man</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.
The Prince of our Salvation
ſubmitted himſelf to the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and all
its <hi>ſhameful, miſerable, painful Appendages,</hi>
to become a Propitiation for <hi>Both. Our
Bodies as well as Souls are the Price of his
Blood:</hi> And can any one then account
'em no more but <hi>Inſtruments only?</hi> The
thing is ſo evident, as that I think it
needleſs to ſay any more for it; nor can
I imagine what can in the leaſt colour
be ſaid againſt it.</p>
            <p>4. Wherefore I paſs to the <hi>next Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi>
under this Head, for Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Doctrine in hand; and that is
<hi>Bodily Worſhip.</hi> Have not all the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>
Pulpits <hi>echo'd</hi> and <hi>ſounded</hi> this aloud.
How often have we been told, <hi>That we
are to ſerve God in our Bodies as well as
Souls;</hi> the one is but <hi>maimed</hi> and <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
without the other; the Great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
has an undeniable and manifold Right
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106721:30"/>
to <hi>Both.</hi> How much, the true <hi>Sons</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> have labour'd in this <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
cannot be unknown to any who
know any thing of the <hi>Controverſies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Modification</hi> of Worſhipping
God, which has been the grand Subject
of the <hi>Diſpute</hi> of this laſt Age.—How
zealous, good Men have been to relieve
that <hi>abuſed</hi> and <hi>miſapply'd</hi> Place, <hi>John</hi> 4.
24. from Captivity, and to diſcharge it
from that <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> Service
which the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> would have impoſed
upon it, and compelled it to bear; ſtill
aſſerting, that to ſerve God, as (in Truth)
we ought, we muſt ſerve him more than
in <hi>Spirit only?</hi> How often has that of
the Apoſtle been made the <hi>Text, 1 Cor.</hi>
14. <hi>ult.</hi> That in God's Service regard
muſt be had to <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order?</hi> How
often have we been told, that we muſt
not make our Approaches to the moſt
High in a <hi>ſlovenly manner,</hi> but in the
moſt <hi>humble</hi> and becoming <hi>Poſtures:</hi> To
give Teſtimony of our <hi>inward,</hi> by the
uniform Port of our OUTWARD MAN,
and to make the Worſhip acceptable and
compleat, to be careful to join both theſe
together? The truth is, the Body by its
ſelf is altogether incapable of the leaſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance;
for as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> has obſerv'd,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106721:30"/>
               <hi>The dead praiſe not God, neither they that go
down to ſilence.</hi> But yet we have the ſame
infallible <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> that <hi>the living can and
do praiſe him:</hi> Do not our <hi>Lips, Tongue,</hi>
and <hi>Mouth</hi> ſhew forth his Praiſe? Do
not our <hi>Hands</hi> ſerve God when we lift
them up toward the <hi>Mercy-ſeat of his holy
Temple?</hi> Do not our <hi>Feet</hi> bear a <hi>part</hi> alſo
here, when they make chearful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Paths to <hi>the place where his honour
dwelleth?</hi> Do not our <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> go
<hi>Sharers</hi> here, when they <hi>behold</hi> and <hi>hear
the wondrous things of God's Law,</hi> when
they are attentively exerciſed in his <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes?</hi>
In a word, Do not our whole
Bodies engage in this Divine Work, in
their <hi>Submiſſions, Adorations,</hi> and <hi>Proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
before his <hi>Altar?</hi> What Nonſenſe
is it for any Man to imagine the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
when we are ſo often and <hi>pathetically</hi>
commanded and called upon by God, in
his Holy Word to do it? Not to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Authorities here, the <hi>winning</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing</hi>
Entreaty of the Great Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is ſufficient, <hi>Rom. 12. 1. Wherefore
I beſeech you, Brethren, by the mercies of
God, that you preſent your Bodies a living
ſacrifice, holy, and acceptable unto God, which
is your reaſonable ſervice:</hi> And if it be
here ſaid, that the Apoſtle by <hi>Bodies</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:106721:31"/>
means the <hi>Whole Man,</hi> I have no mind
to deny the <hi>Allegation;</hi> but I reply, that
the Body is alſo concerned, and (as muſt
be acknowledged from the Alluſion to
the legal Sacrifices) in an eſpecial manner
<hi>pointed</hi> at: And if this be not Proof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
there are other places which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be underſtood in any other ſenſe,
which refer peculiarly to the Body. Thus
the ſame Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Sin of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſays, <hi>Rom. 1.
24. That they did diſhonour their own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
between themſelves;</hi> And to the ſame
purpoſe he calls upon his <hi>Corinthians</hi> to
<hi>glorifie God with their Bodies which are his;</hi>
and 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 23. he prays, that their
<hi>Spirit, Soul, and Body be preſerved blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to the coming of our Lord Jeſus Christ:</hi>
Where Both the Objections of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Author are put to ſilence, and quaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by one word, <hi>Blameleſs;</hi> which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuppoſes our <hi>Bodies</hi> capable of doing
<hi>well,</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments;</hi>
otherwiſe there can be no <hi>Congruity</hi> in
the Diſcourſe of the great <hi>Doctor</hi> of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> (who was brought up at the
feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> was ſo Accompliſh'd
an <hi>Orator,</hi> as that 'twas one of the three
<hi>celebrated</hi> Wiſhes of the great St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
That he might have ſeen him in the
<hi>Pulpit;</hi> nay, what is more, was inſpir'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106721:31"/>
               <hi>from above</hi>): And he muſt be allow'd
by all, to ſpeak at a very impertinent
Rate. I cannot ſee any doubt or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
here: The Wicked ſin and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God with their Bodies, and that,
properly ſpeaking, <hi>by the Luſts of the
Fleſh,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by the
<hi>Luſts of the lower Belly,</hi> as the Father
calls them: The Sins of <hi>Gluttony, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> and a multitude of
others. Nay, St. <hi>John</hi> ſeems to fix Sin
more eſpecially on the Body, in his firſt
<hi>Epiſtle, chap.</hi> 2. 16. where he reckons
them up under <hi>three</hi> Heads, <hi>All that is in
the World, the Lust of the Fleſh, the Lust
of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</hi> On the
other hand, the Caſe is altogether as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable:
The good Man <hi>ſerves, honours,
worſhips,</hi> and <hi>glorifies</hi> God with his <hi>Body,</hi> in
adorning it with <hi>Sobriety, Temperance, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,</hi>
and other Exerciſes of <hi>Vertue;</hi> in
keeping it <hi>clean, ſwept,</hi> and <hi>garniſhed;</hi> a
fit <hi>Receptacle</hi> and <hi>Manſion</hi> for the Holy
Spirit, in a ready Compliance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Soul in all the Offices
of Religion. This moſt evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be the Doctrine of our Church,
when we are admitted to the higheſt
and neareſt <hi>Communion</hi> with God in the
<hi>Eucharist,</hi> by that Clauſe which is inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and repeated in both <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration;</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:106721:32"/>
when the Prieſt delivers the
<hi>Bread,</hi> He prays, <hi>That it may preſerve thy
Body and Soul unto Everlaſting Life;</hi> and
again he uſes the ſame <hi>Form</hi> when he
gives the <hi>Cup, The Blood of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, which was ſhed for thee,
preſerve thy Body and Soul unto Everlaſting
Life.</hi> Now to reaſon fairly; Unleſs our
Bodies are capable of <hi>Everlaſting Life,</hi> I
know not what ſenſe we can make of
the Prayer: And if our Bodies are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of <hi>Everlaſting Life,</hi> as muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
they are neceſſarily imply'd ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to <hi>Everlaſting Death,</hi> and by unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Conſequence, muſt be allow'd capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of doing <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil.</hi> To conclude
this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo throughly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of Both, as that he rallies together
a multitude of Arguments, to <hi>prevent</hi> the
one, and <hi>engage</hi> us in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 13. The Body is for
the Lord,</hi> i.e. 'Twas made by him, and
therefore ordain'd and devoted to his
Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, The Lord for the Body,</hi> i.e.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, God will raiſe our Bodies,</hi> v. 14.
i.e. The Reſurrection lays a farther Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:106721:32"/>
               <hi>Fourthly, Our Bodies are the Members
of Christ,</hi> and therefore they ought not to
be the <hi>Members</hi> of an <hi>Harlot:</hi> We ought
to keep them clean and pure for his ſake,
as Parts of that Society whereof he is the
Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, He that committeth Fornication
ſinneth against his own body;</hi> i.e. Though
there are ſome Sins without the Body,
yet the Sins of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs</hi> are properly
Sins of the <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, Our Bodies are the Temples of
the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ver. 19. The Sins of our
Bodies turn this Holy Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Styes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, Our Bodies are bought with a
price,</hi> ver. 20. Therefore not to glorifie
God in own Bodies as well as Souls, ſince
by a manifold Right they are both his, is
not <hi>ſimply</hi> Sin, but Sin of an <hi>high Degree,</hi>
and <hi>deep Dye;</hi> no leſs than the Sin of
<hi>Sacrilege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all this, to corroborate the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
I might here expatiate upon the
great Coſt and Expence which the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Chriſtians</hi> beſtowed in Embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their dead Bodies; of which <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:106721:33"/>
St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others, give us
a large Account, which comes home
fully to the Point in hand, and can be
apply'd to no other purpoſe. By this
Practice of theirs 'tis plain, they look'd
upon their Bodies as <hi>perfumed</hi> with their
<hi>Graces</hi> here, ſmelling ſweet in their Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitories,
depoſited as in a Bed of Spices,
and reſting in full Hope of a Glorious
Retribution.</p>
            <p>But I conceive I have no need of it;
and therefore it may ſuffice only to have
noted it.</p>

            <p>I Paſs to the Examination of the <hi>Third</hi>
and <hi>last Objection,</hi> which as a <hi>Bar</hi>
lies in our way, and ought to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<hi>If it be Injuſtice in God to puniſh
the Soul alone without the Body, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with which ſhe committed the Sin;
then all the Matter which conſtitued the Body
when the ſeveral Sins were committed, must
be raiſed again, and reunited to the Soul;
for if ſome, why not all? But what Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Men ſhould we be in the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if all the Subſtance of which our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
conſiſted from our Childhood to our
Deaths, ſhould be gathered together, and
formed into a Body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without taking notice of the <hi>Severity</hi>
of the <hi>Objection,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to
give ſatisfaction to it: And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I Anſwer; That the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
depends upon an <hi>All-ſufficient</hi> and
<hi>Omnipotent</hi> Power; and though I cannot
tell with what Matter the Bodies ſhall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106721:34"/>
ariſe, yet every good Man ought to reſt
ſatisfy'd in this, That a God of <hi>infinite</hi>
Abilities will take care to make good his
Word; <hi>For there are an hundred things</hi>
(as the Learned Author has aſſerted,
<hi>p. 221.) both in</hi> NATURE <hi>and</hi> DIVINITY,
<hi>the Exiſtence of which we cannot doubt, and
yet the Reaſon of them we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</hi>
Of which he there gives us a
multitude of Inſtances, (whereunto I
refer the <hi>Reader</hi>) and at laſt reſolves
the Reſurrection into God's good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
as the Higheſt Reaſon. 'Tis alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>ſurprizing,</hi> how he came to be ſo
<hi>poſitive</hi> here, and in this <hi>difficult</hi> point im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be underſtood or reſolved by
the wiſeſt of Men, to be ſo <hi>magiſterial;</hi>
eſpecially conſidering that <hi>unlucky Paſſage</hi>
which drops from his Pen, in the Words
immediately following, <hi>p. 222. I fanſie
my ſelf</hi> (Philalethes) <hi>talking to a bold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finer
on the Promiſes and Decrees of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, and one of thoſe little Nothings
that call themſelves Philoſophers, that form
to themſelves Notions and Idaea's, then deal
with Revelation as the Tyrant did with the
poor Innocents on his Bed, either violently
ſtretch it beyond its natural Reach, or chop
off a part to make it commenſurate to their
Intentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:106721:34"/>
I will make no <hi>Animadverſions</hi> here,
though I have a fair Opportunity; but
I cannot forbear to ſay, that the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author has made <hi>Monſters</hi> of all
Men at the Reſurrection, if it be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on <hi>Juſtice</hi> contrary to his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
in the places foregoing, where he
profeſſes his Ignorance, and challenges
the World to give an account of; as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
it <hi>impoſſible:</hi> And yet boldly aſſerts
<hi>here,</hi> That all the Matter which was of the
Body of the Man from his Childhood to
his Grave, muſt be rallied together at the
Reſurrection, or elſe there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>Juſtice</hi> in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwer; This <hi>Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
runs Counter to the Doctrine of
the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Ancients,</hi> who have
with one Mouth determin'd, That the
<hi>Child</hi> ſhall not ariſe a <hi>Child,</hi> nor the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent</hi>
Man with his great <hi>Bulk;</hi> nor he
who ſunk under a <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> peep out of
his Grave a <hi>Skeleton.</hi> Nor the <hi>Old</hi> Man
appear at the Reſurrection with his
<hi>Grey Hairs,</hi> or any <hi>Symptomes</hi> of Age;
but all ſhall ariſe (<hi>inter Incrementum &amp;
Decrementum humanae naturae</hi>) about the
Age of 33, in a <hi>perfect State; ſtatura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Cap.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I anſwer; That this is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
beſide the <hi>Queſtion;</hi> We are to
conſider the Body <hi>fallen,</hi> and to prove the
Reſurrection of that <hi>ſame</hi> Body, to be
joined to the <hi>ſame</hi> Soul, in order to a
Judgment; And this is all that in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can be expected: We are no ways
concerned to look back to its <hi>various</hi> and
<hi>different</hi> States, from his <hi>Childhood</hi> to his
<hi>Death;</hi> if we can produce the ſame <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners</hi>
before the <hi>Supreme Tribunal,</hi> there
can be no <hi>Injuſtice</hi> in the Thing; for
the Learned Author has granted, and
<hi>proved that our Bodies, from our Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to our Graves, notwithſtanding their
conſtant, innumerable, great, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Changes, are ſtill the ſame.</hi> Pag. 132.
Moreover he has granted, <hi>That (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Suppoſition of Philoſophers) tho'
the Body be changed once in</hi> ſeven <hi>Years;</hi>
(which, <hi>obiter,</hi> I can never believe, and
am ſure is impoſſible to be proved) yet
he grants <hi>it is ſtill the ſame. That a Man
that has kept his Bed for above ſeven Years,
upon his Recovery riſes the ſame Man, tho'
he have not now one Particle the ſame that
he had when he took his Bed;</hi> and he gives
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106721:35"/>
us the Reaſon of it, <hi>Becauſe the Particles
of the Body are gradually changed in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Soul. The Body</hi> (he
ſays) <hi>in ſuch a Caſe is the ſame, and may
properly be ſaid to raiſe again.</hi> And yet
the Learned Author in his Argument
here, exacts all the <hi>Matter</hi> which conſtituted
the Body, when the ſeveral
Sins were committed, to be raiſed again,
to be re-united to the Soul; which how
congruous to himſelf, and how reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in its ſelf, I leave others to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I anſwer; This <hi>Objection</hi> is
too <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>ſubtile;</hi> It <hi>impeaches, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys,</hi>
and <hi>overturns</hi> all Juſtice upon
Earth, and renders it altogether impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
The Reaſon is irreſiſtible; for there
are <hi>fleeting Particles</hi> of Matter, which
conſtantly <hi>come</hi> and <hi>go, ebb</hi> and <hi>flow</hi> in
our Bodies, through the whole Courſe
of our Lives, ſo that the Man is not <hi>to
day</hi> what he was <hi>yeſterday,</hi> nor will be to
<hi>morrow</hi> what he is <hi>to day.</hi> This is more
manifeſt in <hi>long Impriſonments;</hi> The <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor</hi>
frequently comes into <hi>Gaol, plump</hi>
and <hi>hail,</hi> full of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> but by
his long Confinement is <hi>emaciated,</hi> and
appears at the Bar quite another Thing:
Yea often times it ſo happens, that he is ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106721:36"/>
much impair'd in his <hi>Health, Strength, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi>
and <hi>Complexion,</hi> that he is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
dropping into the <hi>Grave</hi> without the
Help of the <hi>Gallows;</hi> and yet no Man ever
queſtions the Juſtice of his Execution.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was beheaded for a
Crime committed above 20 Years before,
and though (according to the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Philoſophers above-mentioned)
this Body muſt be <hi>thrice</hi> changed in this
Interval; yet the Equity of his <hi>Sentence</hi>
was never doubted. The like might be
obſerved of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland.</hi>—
The <hi>Annals</hi> of all Nations overflow with
Examples of Criminals whoſe Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have been a long time protracted
without the leaſt ſuſpicion of Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Therefore I anſwer plainly, by
denying the Conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> That it
does no way follow from the Principles
of Juſtice, <hi>That all the Matter which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the Body when the ſeveral Sins were
committed, ſhould be raiſed up again;</hi> My
Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>much</hi> if not <hi>most</hi> of
this <hi>Matter</hi> is <hi>accidental</hi> to the Body; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as 'tis plain, the Body can be,
and oftentimes is without it. What fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and conſiderable Alterations all
Men undergo in this reſpect, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106721:36"/>
confirmed by the Experience of
all. Moſt Men generally are well fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Summer,</hi> but in the Time of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
fall away. And this is more viſible in
the Cattle of the Field, being for the moſt
part <hi>Fat</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> in the <hi>Hot</hi> Seaſon of the
Year, which affords plenty of <hi>Graſs</hi> and
<hi>Food:</hi> But when the <hi>Frost</hi> and <hi>Snow</hi>
comes in upon them, and diminiſhes
their Paſture, then they <hi>pine</hi> away, and
are often ſtarved. Men owe the <hi>Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
of their Bodies in a great meaſure
to their <hi>Eaſe, Health, Proſperity,</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence:</hi>
Whereas <hi>Hunger, Cold, Want, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
Diſeaſes,</hi> will make them <hi>dwindle</hi>
and bring them down to nothing but
<hi>Skin</hi> and <hi>Bones.</hi> To this purpoſe I am
ſure, I have long ſince met with the
<hi>Determination</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> in their
Philoſophical Tranſactions, <hi>namely, That
the Fat and Corpulency of a Creature is
nothing but the Repletion of the</hi> Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:
And that they would undertake to
make a <hi>Dog</hi> or an <hi>Horſe, Fat, Fleſhy,</hi>
and
<hi>Full</hi> in a very few Days. There is no
neceſſity then for all the <hi>Matter</hi> to be
rallied together at the Reſurrection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
much of it is <hi>Accidental,</hi> not <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
to the Body: It has been, is, and
may be without it. Our Doctrine then
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106721:37"/>
muſt ſtand in ſpight of this Shock and
Aſſault. The Juſtice of God is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
and the Saint in no manner of
Danger of mounting from his Grave a
<hi>Monſter;</hi> nor the Sinner neither in this,
though he muſt be acknowledg'd ſuch
in the worſt of ſenſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If all that has been hitherto
ſaid cannot put the Objection to ſilence,
I will preſume to borrow the mighty
Sword of our <hi>Opponent,</hi> which alone
can do the Work, and as effectually as
that of <hi>Goliah,</hi> cut off this <hi>Monſtrous
Head. Pag.</hi> 187. his Words are theſe;
<q>It is farther to be conſidered, that
though the ſame Body that died is to
riſe again, yet it is not neceſſary that
all the Particles of it ſhould be raiſed
up; 'tis enough that ſuch Particles are
raiſed, as made up the <hi>integrant</hi> and
neceſſary Parts of the Body. By <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Parts,</hi> I mean thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
after the utmoſt degree of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
without which the Body would
not be <hi>integrant,</hi> but <hi>imperfect;</hi> and
theſe are chiefly the <hi>Bones,</hi> the <hi>Skin,</hi>
the <hi>Nerves,</hi> the <hi>Tendons,</hi> the <hi>Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the ſeveral Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
as long as theſe, and all that are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106721:37"/>
neceſſary to Life remain, the Body is
truly <hi>whole,</hi> though never ſo much <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated;</hi>
all the <hi>Fleſh</hi> that is added
makes nothing to the <hi>Wholeneſs</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrality</hi>
of the Body, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to Strength and Ornament.</q>—And
by and by he adds, <q>If the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
be <hi>extremely maciated,</hi> I do not
doubt but in the Reſurrection it
will be reſtored by <hi>foreign adventitious
Matter,</hi> to its due and juſt Proportion:
So in Bodies that are <hi>full</hi> and <hi>fleſby,</hi>
there is a great deal of Subſtance that
is not neceſſary, which if it become the
Fleſh of another Man, the Body may
be raiſed up without it, and yet be
<hi>Phyſically whole,</hi> and truly the ſame.
In Bodies that are <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>groſs</hi> there
is doubtleſs a great deal <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi>
which will never be raiſed up; though
it were never made the Ingredient of
another Man's Body.</q>

to wait on the Learned Author
in what remains, who is labouring to
find out a Reaſon of the Reſurrection of
the Body, as indeed he is obliged; ſince
he has taken away the <hi>main Pillar,</hi> and
laid that aſide: In order whereunto he
tells us, <hi>pag. 211. That the Soul does not
die with the Body, as ſome ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Arabians held.</hi>—This is an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
too <hi>ridiculous</hi> to be confuted. Then
<hi>pag.</hi> 212. he tells us, <hi>That the Soul does
not ſleep until the day of the Reſurrection,
as the</hi> Pſychopannychiſts <hi>imagined.</hi> All
that is to be ſaid here is, That this is a

call it) of the groſs <hi>Naevus</hi>
here, <hi>etſi habet corpus, etſi habet membra,</hi>
which the Father applies to the Soul in
a ſeparate State, and is by no means ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable:
Nor to undertake a Defence of
him here or elſewhere, in an exact, ſtrict
and rigid ſenſe; for 'tis well known, that
this <hi>African Father</hi> is the moſt dark, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe,

makes uſe of uncouth, <hi>obſolete Words,</hi>

in the main here <hi>precarious;</hi> to my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
there is no <hi>begging</hi> at all in

with a multitude of other ſuch Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

here to fill up a great deal of <hi>Paper</hi> with

have eſpouſed this Opinion; but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly
avoid the Vanity of it, and
think it altogether needleſs in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Diſpute, becauſe the Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
ſpeaking of the <hi>Opinion</hi> of Pope
<hi>John</hi> XXII. tells us, <hi>That he only held that
the Soul does not at all enjoy the Beatiſick
Viſion before the Reſurrection;</hi> and for
Confirmation of it, adds, <hi>pag. 212. This
indeed was the Opinion of the Primitive
Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And albeit this Doctrine was <hi>Cenſur'd</hi>
and <hi>Condemn'd</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi>
yet this can have no Influence on us,
who know too well what this Council
was, and the <hi>Age</hi> of it. And though it
prevail with thoſe of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
yet 'tis obſervable, how that even the
Learned Men that are <hi>Bigotted</hi> to that
way, do not ſtick to give us their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of it. <hi>Meminerint hunc erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem

<hi>This Opinion is no prejudice to the Piety

another Eminent Writer of that Church
calls it, <hi>Pia &amp; beata opinio veritati facile

Opinion, eaſily reconcileable to the Truth,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106721:41"/>
by the diſtinction of a perfect and imperfect
Happineſs:</hi> So that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Opinion and Council ſeems to
be only about the <hi>Place,</hi> in the <hi>Condition</hi>
both agree. About the Capacity of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi>
Souls, I am not willing to diſpute,
'tis too ſublime a Subject, and above our
<hi>mortal Reach.</hi> Nor will I eagerly contend
for the <hi>Place,</hi> where (upon their diſlodging
here) they are diſpos'd of: But this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
I readily embrace, <hi>That before our
Saviour's Aſcenſion they were not admitted
into Heaven,</hi> whatſoever they are ſince:
Nor will I preſume to determine for
what Things the happy Soul is reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
nor on the other hand, for what the
Soul of the <hi>Reprobate</hi> is puniſhed; but ſo
far I conceive it to be plain, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Concurrence of all, <hi>That Both
at preſent have their different Enjoyments,
though imperfect.</hi> So that in my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
the Conſequence of the Learned
Author does <hi>Claudicare,</hi> ſtand in need of
a <hi>Crutch;</hi> it is and always will be a <hi>Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
The Soul of the Saint is at preſent
admitted to Happineſs, I ſee nothing in
Reaſon from hence to infer;—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis capable of being fully rewarded:
On the other ſide, the Soul of the Sinner
is in its Separate State capable of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106721:41"/>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis capable of being fully
puniſhed. I muſt freely ſay, I cannot
ſee the leaſt colour for the Inference;
Where-ever the Soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> now is,
it muſt be (without doubt) allowed by
all to be <hi>happy;</hi> but that it is as <hi>happy</hi>
as it will be after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<hi>deny.</hi> On the other ſide, That the
Soul of the <hi>Rich Glutton</hi> is now in a State
of <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> muſt be readily aſſented
to; but that it is in a full, compleat <hi>State,</hi>
will, can, muſt never be granted. This
Aſſertion runs againſt the ſtream and
current of <hi>Reaſon, Scripture,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;</hi>
as will moſt manifeſtly appear
in the Examination of the other Opinion
of <hi>Tertullian;</hi> which I now come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He ſeems to affirm in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<hi>above-cited,</hi> That the <hi>Soul is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
without the Body of Pleaſure or Pain,
of Puniſhments or Rewards, and therefore
concludes for a Reſurrection:</hi> 'Tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
my intent to attempt the <hi>Defence</hi> of
this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> tho' the <hi>Centuriators</hi> have
undertaken it: And if the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi>
be <hi>real,</hi> (as I believe no one will deny,
becauſe conſtantly ſo repreſented in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106721:42"/>

reſolve how this <hi>Fire</hi> can affect, and
reach the Soul; how a <hi>Material</hi> can <hi>act</hi>
upon an <hi>Immaterial.</hi> Beſide there are no
mean Authorities, and not a few neither,
to be produc'd, who have aſſerted much
the ſame thing: Thus <hi>Maldonate,</hi> as Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Doctrine, That the <hi>Damned were not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
before the Day of Judgment;</hi> which
how it is to be underſtood he there tells
you. Notwithſtanding all this, I think
the foreſaid Paſſage, in a <hi>ſtrict, literal,
groſs</hi> Senſe, by no means <hi>defenſible;</hi> we
muſt give ſome <hi>Grains</hi> of <hi>Allowance</hi> to the

the <hi>Drift</hi> and <hi>Carriage</hi> of the Diſcourſe,
expound one Paſſage by another, and
judge <hi>charitably</hi> of all; and then the
Meaning will be plain. One while he
allows the <hi>departed Souls,</hi> according to
their different Deſerts, a <hi>preſent</hi> Portion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106721:42"/>
of Pain or Weal: Other while he ſays,
That <hi>the ſeparate Souls</hi> are rewarded or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at <hi>preſent</hi> for the good or bad
things they did without the concurrence
of the Body; and that tho' they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
without the Body of Pleaſure or
Pain, yet they are not ſo fully capable
as when united to it. In other places
he ſeems to affirm the quite contrary,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul is not capable of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
at all without the Body; that in
a divided State it can feel neither Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
nor Pain, and upon this account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the Neceſſity of a Reſurrection.
Now to a favourable Reader, who ſhall
govern himſelf (as in reaſon he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged)
ſuitable to the method but now laid
down; here will upon mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appear no Contradiction, no Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency
in all this; the one leads us to
the underſtanding of the other. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Souls tho' in ſome meaſure they
do now partake of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet they are in a manner nothing,
in compariſon to what they ſhall be;
the Height and Accompliſhment of both
awaits the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> when Body and

only the Condition of all ſhall be <hi>compleat.</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:106721:43"/>
And that this is the Meaning of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Writer, is abundantly evident, not
only from the whole <hi>Thread</hi> of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
but alſo from ſome plain Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

            </p>
            <p>This then being allowed to be the
Senſe of the Father (as I do not ſee how
it can well be denied) <hi>viz. That the Soul
is not capable of Rewards and Puniſhments
without the Body: but by no means (as the
learned Dr reports it p. 214;) That the Soul
is not capable in its own nature without an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
Body of any Perception; how, that
it is not capable without ar humane Body of
either. Rewards or Puniſhments.</hi> This ſeems
to be a too rigid, extream, and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Conſtruction of thoſe paſſages, and
woud unavoidably involve the Father in
the other <hi>Errors</hi> of <hi>the Death of the Soul,
or the ſlumber of it.</hi> But though the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<hi>Tertullian</hi> in this matter thus <hi>ſeverely,</hi> yet he
confeſſes this notion very conſiſtent with
the Doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and the
General Judgment that is to follow after
it; but he has this to object againſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106721:44"/>
it <hi>pag. 24. I know not how to make it conſiſtent
with ſome other places of Scripture; here lies
the difficulty, the Scripture is plainly againſt
it.</hi> I confeſs it does not well accord with it,
as it is here repreſented; and I cannot for
my Heart imagine how he came to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the Father ſo groſly Erroneous here
who has produced ſo many places wherein
he loudly proclaims the contrary, and
plainly and fully expreſſes himſelf: in
which if we take him, as by all means we
are obliged to do, <hi>viz. Of the imperfect
ſtate of the Soul in its ſeparation, that it is
not capable of being fully rewarded or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
without the Body.</hi> I ſee nothing
amiſs here, this <hi>Opinion</hi> muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conſiſtent with the Doctrine of the
<hi>Reſurrection</hi> and the General Judgment
which is to follow after it, harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly
correſpondent with the Analogie
of Faith, and the holy Scriptures; even
thoſe very places which are alledged by
the Learned Author <hi>pag.</hi> 215. Thus, in
that of our Saviour to the Penitent Thief,
<hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe;</hi>
in which Words there is a Promiſe of an
happy injoyment to his diſlodging Soul,
but an <hi>imperfect</hi> one, for we can Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<hi>Paradiſe</hi> in no other ſence but
what imports either the <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106721:44"/>
of the happy ſeparate Souls, a place,
undeniably different from Heaven; a
Condition of happineſs in hand, but far
ſhort and inferiour to that hereafter.
The Soul of the <hi>Celebrated Penitent</hi>
was immediately upon its departure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
with a ſtate of Bliſs, but the full
meaſure of it cannot be expected before the
<hi>Reſurrection,</hi> Thus alſo in the ſecond
Scripture, <hi>Phil,</hi> 1. 23. where St. <hi>Peter</hi>
wiſhes <hi>To depart and to be with Chriſt,
which is far better.</hi> The Expreſſion clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intimates an happineſs which would
accrue to his Soul by his diſſolution, far
above any thing that this World could
afford, as is Emphatically expreſſed in the
Original by the <hi>double comparative</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
The Soul of the great
Apoſtle where-ever he be, is without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
gloriouſly happy; yet (this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)
that it cannot arrive to the fulneſs
of it, before it be united to that Body
which was his <hi>Faithful Companion and
Partner,</hi> in all his <hi>Perils, Dangers, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
Sufferings, Conflicts, Labours</hi> here.
And ſo in the third place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10.
in which the Souls of the Martyrs are
repreſented from under the Altar, loudly
crying for Judgment. This Text to me
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106721:45"/>
is one of the moſt undeniable and <hi>adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi>
proofs of both the <hi>Doctrines</hi> under
preſent conſideration; for as on the one
hand it ſtrongly eſtabliſhes the bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the ſeparate Souls, ſo on the
other it will not ſuffer us to doubt of their
imperfect ſtate: The completion and
height of happineſs is put off to the great
<hi>Day of Recompenſe.</hi> The Text is full, and
deſerves to be conſidered: <hi>I ſaw under
the Altar the Souls of them that were ſlain
for the Word of God, and for the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
which they held; and they cryed with
a loud Voice, ſaying, How long, O Lord,
Holy and True, doſt thou not judge and
avengé our Blood on them that dwell
on the Earth: And White Robes were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to every one of them, and it was ſaid
unto them, that they ſhould reſt yet for a
little Seaſon, until their fellow Servants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
and their Brethren, that ſhould be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as they were ſhould be fulfilled.</hi> Where
every Word and Clauſe makes for our
purpoſe. Whether we underſtand it
(as ſome) of their Bodies, by a <hi>Proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia,</hi>
ſpeaking from their Graves, or of
their Souls which are ſaid to be under
the Altar, <hi>i.e. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Protection of
Chriſt,</hi> as a Learned Critick does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106721:45"/>
it: <hi>And they cryed with a loud voice,</hi>
which in my apprehenſion imports not
ſo much the <hi>multitude</hi> of them (an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
much eſteemed by ſome)
as the <hi>vehemency</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> of
their deſire which is for juſtice; and
that chiefly in reference to themſelves;
Namely, that God would tranſlate and
advance them to that <hi>Happineſs</hi> which he
has promiſed, and they <hi>deſiringly</hi> do <hi>deſire.</hi>
This exactly ſuits with all that follows
after. They had at preſent the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
the <hi>Livery,</hi> the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
the <hi>earneſt</hi> of it: But the full of
their Reward, they were not to receive
until the time of Harveſt, the <hi>laſt Day,</hi>
when both Parts were to meet
again, and when the Noble Army of
Martyrs (all Conflicts and Fighting
being for ever done away) ſhould in

               <q>The Natural love which we all by

the Soul is in it ſelf an IMPERFECT SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANCE,

and command of the Soul has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
much, born the greateſt part
of all difficulties and conflicts here;
ſhould have no ſhare in the Reward.—
Add to this, That it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
but that the Supream Creator
ſhould propound ſome great end in
erecting HUMANE NATURE; and
that can be conceived to be no leſs than
the Happineſs of the WHOLE MAN:
Now the Happineſs of a part cannot be
the Happineſs of the WHOLE; but God
made the WHOLE Man.</q> Thus this

of the Inhabitants of that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>

down</hi> with them there, praiſing, exalting,
congratulating each others condition, as is
by many aſſerted, and is not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable.
This offers fairly for the
proof of what the <hi>Shools</hi> have here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined;
who in the procedure of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106721:48"/>
Argument further tells, <hi>viz. That the

as <hi>the Soul makes the Body perfect;</hi>
for the ſupport of which they produce
the known Axiom which is allowed of
in all other caſes, and therefore ought to
paſs muſter here; <hi>That every part is by its
ſelf imperfect,</hi> 'tis perfected <hi>in the whole.</hi>
'Tis true, if we conſider the Body as it is
repreſented by the <hi>School of Plato,</hi> a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,</hi>
a <hi>Priſon;</hi> or really as it now is, a
ſink of Infirmities, Diſeaſes, and Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions;
an heavy <hi>load and weight, preſſing
down the Soul.</hi> I do confeſs I ſee nothing
<hi>Beautiful</hi> or <hi>Charming</hi> to make the Soul in
love with it. But when we ſhall draw
the <hi>Curtain,</hi> and change the <hi>Scene,</hi> when
we ſhall contemplate the <hi>glorious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
wherewith it ſhall be enobled after
the <hi>Reſurrection, when this corruptible ſhall
have put on incorruption, and this mortal
have put on immortality;</hi> when it ſhall
have obtained a moſt perfect <hi>Victory</hi> not
only over Death, but all its troubleſome
antecedents and conſequences alſo: the
known miſeries of this Life, and the
calamities of the Grave; when, I
ſay, the Body has ſurmounted all theſe,
and ſits above 'em; this muſt induce us
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106721:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtrongly to conclude for the Argument in
hand. If this be the caſe, (as in Truth
it is) the Happineſs of the Saint muſt
be advanced to ſuch a degree, as ſurpaſſeth
our underſtanding: All that we have to
do is for ever to <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>adore.</hi> To
conclude this part, 'tis a Truth too plain
to be diſputed, <hi>That the ſeparate Soulson all
hands are not under the full injoyment of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rewards or Puniſhments:</hi> That this
is the caſe of the Damned Spirits, needs
no laboriouſness of proof, the <hi>ſingle</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation
of thoſe diſpoſed in the
Goſpel, <hi>Mat. 8. 29. Art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
us before the time?</hi> Alone is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
nor have we leſs evidence on the
other hand. Where-ever the Souls of
the departed Saints under the Law were,
'tis certain they were not in Heaven; for
the Captain of our Salvation was the firſt
that opened thoſe <hi>everlaſting Doors,</hi> and
made his entrance there; that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to provide <hi>manſion Places</hi> for his
Faithful ones. Wherever the Souls of
the Goſpel-Believers, ſince departed,
have their Reſidence, though (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
notwithſtanding the determination
of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and others)
we can conclude nothing of certainty
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106721:49"/>
here; nevertheleſs we have ſo much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that their <hi>State</hi> is imperfect; as
that I do not ſee how any Man can have
the forehead to deny. The <hi>Nail</hi> of this
Doctrine is immovably faſtned by the
Author to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and <hi>laſt,</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had given a large <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the
moſt renowned Saints departed, together
with the Records of their moſt noble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements;
ſays expreſly, <hi>That all theſe
having obtained a good report, through
Faith, received not the Promiſe; God having
provided ſome better things for us, that
they without us ſhould not be perfect.</hi>
In the meaning of which place there can
be no doubt, becauſe the ſtream of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
here run in one Channel, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
undivided; all agreed that this is
the ſence.—<q>The Conſummation of the
Happineſs of thoſe under the Law ſhall
not prevent thoſe under the Goſpel; the
Day of Judgment is the ſtated time of
both, whenthere ſhall be a general Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
The accompliſhment of the
great Patriarchs under the old diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
muſt await ours under the
new; the Labourors that entred the
Vineyard the firſt Hour of the Day,
ſhall not be paid off before thoſe that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106721:49"/>
came in the laſt Hour; the wages of
all is not to be expected before the end
of all;</q> The Promiſe refers to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
(as was noted in the Preamble)
and is put for the <hi>Thing Promiſed;</hi> which
can be no other than the Glorification of
our Bodies in conjunction with our Souls,
and this makes the Happineſs compleat;
which ſhall not be conferr'd on ſome,
before others, but ſhall be beſtowed on
all aſſembled together in a Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory
at the laſt <hi>Audit.</hi> This alſo is the
profeſſed Doctrine of our Church, as ſhe
has Taught and Injoyned us in her Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
to Pray,—<hi>Beſeeching God of his
Gracious Goodneſs, ſhortly to accompliſh the
Number of his Elect; and to haſten his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
that we, with all thoſe departed in the true
Faith of his Holy Name, may have our perfect
Conſummation and Bliſs both in Body and
Soul in thy Eternal and Everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
A moſt Heavenly Prayer; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incomparably the beſt <hi>Shield, Buckler,</hi>
the beſt <hi>Antidote</hi> and <hi>Preſervative</hi> againſt
the loſs of Friends, or the Conſideration
of our own approaching Mortality,
(with reſpect both to our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
to bouy up our Spirits amidſt the
Melancholy Apprehenſions of the Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106721:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Miſeries of the Grave, and
exalts us above the Worms, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of it; directing us aſſuredly to
know and believe that there is a time
coming, when there will be an <hi>happy
meeting</hi> of both (though they are now
with Grief and Rluctancy divided) when
the happineſs of both ſhall be <hi>complete:</hi>
And this is an Authority undeniably Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
and muſt (for any thing I can
ſee to the contrary) ſtrongly and irrefrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
eſtabliſh the Doctrine contended
for, <hi>viz. That our Bodies are capable of
Cewards and Puniſhments hereafter of doing
Well or Evil here.</hi>

            <p>THE Learned Author having laid
aſide the Opinions of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
as not ſerviceable to his purpoſe; not
affording him a <hi>Satisfactory Reaſon</hi> of this
<hi>Decree</hi> of Almighty God concerning the
<hi>Reſurrection:</hi> To give a true Accounr of
it, thinks it neceſſary to mount a little
higher, and to look a little farther and
paſſing by many conjectures, which he
finds in the Schools, and in ſome of our
Ancient Writers, and among the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Maſters; <hi>p. 217. lays before you his own
Thoughts;</hi> and here <hi>he aſſigns three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why God has been pleaſed to decree, that
the Soul in the Day of Judgment ſhall be
again united to a Humane Body</hi> In diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing
of which, I ſhall beg leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the order of them, as more ſuitable
to the method of my Diſcourſe, and for
the advantage of my preſent Argument;
which (if I miſtake not) will gain one
of thoſe Reaſons over to our ſide and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106721:51"/>
party, as falling over to it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to go together.</p>
            <p>The laſt Reaſon, which I here place
firſt, why God will reſtore us to our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, and why he will raiſe up
the very ſame Body is, <hi>p.</hi> 219. HE
WILL BECAUSE HE WILL, <hi>a very bad
Reaſon for the Actions of Man, but a very
good one for God's; he will becauſe he hath
Promiſed:</hi> Which the Learned Author
irrefragably confirms from what follows,
<hi>p.</hi> 222. which I conceive my ſelf obliged
to tranſcribe; and is as follows,—<q>I
am the Lord, I have ſaid it, and who
can ſay, <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that God does, but he does for
a very good reaſon: And who are we,
that we ſhould call him to an Account
for what he does? His Ways and his
Counſels are many of them unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us; and as <hi>Job</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap. 33,
13. He gives not Account of any of
his Matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> 'Tis his part to Act, ours
to Admire and Submit; and as long as
our Reaſon and our Senſes are not
plainly contradicted, we are only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
WHAT, not How, or WHY.
I would fain know of thoſe who deny
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106721:51"/>
the Reſurrection of the ſame Humane
Body, becauſe they do not know what
uſe we can make of the particular parts
in the Life to come, whether they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or doubt the exiſtence of all other
things; the Reaſon of which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend: I would undertake to
quiet the Scruples of theſe Men, and to
ſatisfie all their Queries, if they would
be pleaſed to anſwer a few Queſtions of
mine: I could ask them the reaſon of
an Hundred things in Nature and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</q>
—Which he there ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
unaccconntable; and particularly
in the caſe about the Reſurrection, <hi>p.</hi> 221.
He acknowledges a multitude of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
altogether inextricable, <hi>i. e.</hi> for
which there is no reaſon to be given, and
therefore muſt of neceſſity be reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, <hi>viz. the Will and Pleaſure of
God.</hi> I willingly concur with the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Author here, and preſume there is
no one that will oppoſe him. For this
without paradventure is the <hi>highest</hi> and
moſt <hi>ſupream Reaſon</hi> which muſt put to
ſilence all Objections; remove all Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
whatſoever, and make things which
ſeem to us <hi>impoſſible, eaſie.</hi> Though with
<hi>Mary</hi> we do not <hi>know how this can be, Luke</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106721:52"/>
1. 34, Though our reaſon cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom,
cannot comprehend it, yet our
<hi>Faith</hi> muſt give us an aſſurance that <hi>it will
be;</hi> and teach us, with the Mother of the
Holy Jeſus, with ſubmiſſion to conclude,
—<hi>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be
it unto me according to thy Word.</hi> This is
a Reaſon above all Reaſons, allowed and
approved of by all, and to which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(however Philoſophical and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
muſt ſubmit. This I gladly and
readily <hi>note,</hi> becauſe I expect to receive
ſome advantage from it in the ſubſequent
part of this Diſcourſe, for I am in hopes
to prove the Doctrine I have attempted
to defend, to be the expreſs determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God's revealed <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Word,</hi> and
then all the moſt powerful Arguments of
the <hi>Profoundest Philoſophers,</hi> muſt <hi>truckle
under,</hi> and fall to the Ground: But (if I
miſtake not) this Reaſon of Gods <hi>Word</hi>
or <hi>Decree</hi> of the Reſurrection of the Body,
was not in the leaſt the Subject of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute:
The Queſtion only aroſe from the
<hi>Reaſon</hi> of this <hi>Decree.</hi> There can be no
doubt but that the Reſurrection will be,
becauſe God hath ſaid and ordained it: The
Subject of the enquiry can be no other
than the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of God's Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106721:52"/>
here; Namely why God has <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed</hi>
the Reſurrection of the ſame Body;
and this obliges the Learned Author to
look farther; and therefore,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In the the next place he tells
us,</hi> (p. 219.) That another Reaſon why
God has been pleaſed to ordain that the ſame
Humane Body that Died, ſhall Riſe again
and be reconjoined to the Soul; I take to be
this (and that indeed I take to be the firſt
and chief reaſon of that Decree) we had all
been immortal Men if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned;
'twas God's deſign that we ſhould never Die,
but that our Souls ſhould remain for ever uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their Bodies; this Gracious deſign being
fruſtrated by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion; he
was Graciouſly pleaſed to ordain, that as in
<hi>Adam</hi> all Die; ſo in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſecond
<hi>Adam,</hi> we ſhould all at laſt Triumph over
Death, and be reſtored to thoſe Bodies; and
that Humane Nature, which he firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhould be immortal; by the Death and
Reſurrection of Chriſt our loſſes are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
which <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin occaſioned, but our
loſſes cannot be repaired, unleſs we are reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to thoſe Bodies which by his ſinning we
loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:106721:53"/>
To this Second Reaſon I ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I have no mind to implunge my
ſelf, or Reader in the Decrees of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, which is an <hi>Abyſs</hi> or <hi>Ocean</hi> never
to be fathomed: Nor am I diſpoſed to
concern my ſelf about the examination of
that Queſtion, <hi>Whether</hi> Adam <hi>and his
Poſterity had Died if they had not Sinned?</hi>
Only I ſhall briefly and freely deliver my
Opinion in this matter. That it ſeems
to me very probable that (allowing the
ſuppoſition of his and their continuance in
their ſpotleſs purity) He and his Race af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome time, like <hi>Enoch</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or
ſome other way, (with <hi>Analogy</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
to theſe,) ſhould have been
tranſlated; for 'tis no way conceivable, how
that <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> (which was but a <hi>Garden,</hi>
as the word imports, and by the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and deſcription of it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
a very ſmall and inconſiderable
part of the Earth) ſhould have held, and
contained him and his numberleſs iſſue in
the State of innocency, which ſtate muſt
unavoidably by all be allowed, <hi>perfectly
and intirely Prolifick,</hi> abſolutely free and
diſchargeb from all <hi>falſe Conceptions</hi> or
<hi>Abortions,</hi> all <hi>Impediments</hi> or <hi>Indiſpoſitions</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:106721:53"/>
whatſoever, on either ſide; Paſſing by all
this, I ſay, that that which the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Author takes to be the <hi>Firſt and
Chief</hi> Reaſon <hi>of this Decree of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
I take to be <hi>no Reaſon at all,</hi> or
at leaſt to be no <hi>adequate</hi> Reaſon of the
<hi>General Reſurrection;</hi> the utmoſt that it
can pretend to, (as it is here ſtated) is
only the Reſurrection of the <hi>Just;</hi> the
Reaſon is undeniable, for the Learned
Author here ſets it forth, and expreſſes it,
by a <hi>Gracious Deſign,</hi> and the <hi>Gracious
Pleaſure of God.</hi> Now how this can
agree with, and include the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> let the World judge.
The Subject of our Diſcourſe is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of all Men, of which the <hi>Wicked</hi>
are allowed by all to be by far the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
Number. And this is a Doctrine that
can meet with no Oppoſition; That theſe
are to be called out of their Graves to
an Everlaſting Death, to be taken out of
the <hi>common Priſon;</hi> to be <hi>delivered over
to Tormentors;</hi> to be caſt into that <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi>
whence there is no Redemption;
where <hi>the Worm dieth not, and the Fire
never ſhall be quenched;</hi> where there is
<hi>utter Darkneſs</hi> and uninterrupted, <hi>weeping
and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> In a word, The
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106721:54"/>
Reſurrection of the <hi>Wicked</hi> is only in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to a Judgment that is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable.
He is like the worſt of
Criminals taken from the Gaol to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
a much ſeverer <hi>Doom.</hi> His Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
uſhers in the tremendous Sentence,
<hi>Depart, ye Curſed, into everlaſting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
Here the Deſigns carry in them the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Divine <hi>Vengeance, Juſtice,</hi>
and <hi>Glory,</hi> without the leaſt <hi>Mite</hi> or
<hi>Crumb</hi> of Grace or Favour. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
Reprobate placed on the other ſide
of the <hi>Great Gulf,</hi> is for ever excluded
from all Hopes of theſe; not all his
Cries, in his greateſt Extremity, can
prevail for <hi>one drop of Water.</hi> There is
no place for Favour or Mercy in Hell,
ſo that it ſeems to me ſomewhat ſtrange,
how the Learned Author came to take
up this for a Reaſon, and to alledge for
Confirmation of it, that Paſſage of the
Apoſtle, (1 <hi>Cor. 15. 22.) As in Adam all
die, ſo in Christ ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
I am verily perſwaded, that this place
was never before underſtood of, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the Reſurrection of the <hi>Wicked,</hi>
but of the <hi>Righteous</hi> only. <hi>Ne<expan>

            <p>Wherefore I come to conſider the
<hi>Third</hi> and remaining Reaſon, aſſigned by
the Learned Author, Why the Soul at
the Day of Judgment is again to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Body; which is as follows:
p. 218.—<hi>That as we are Men when we
ſin, or do well, ſo we may be Men, when by
a judicial Sentence we are puniſhed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for it: But we cannot be Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we have Humane Bodies.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us, THAT WE MUST ALL APPEAR BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE
THE JUDGMENT-SEAT OF CHRIST,
THAT EVERY MAN MAY RECEIVE THE
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106721:55"/>
THINGS DONE IN HIS BODY, ACCORD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING
TO THAT HE HATH DONE, WHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER
IT BE GOOD OR BAD. <hi>And as
we are to give an account for what we did in
the Body; ſo in the Body we ſhall give an
account, if it be reaſonable that we ſhould
be Men when we are puniſhed or rewarded
for what we did when Men; it ſeems much
more reaſonable, that we ſhould be then the
ſame Men: But we cannot be the ſame
Men, unleſs we have the ſame Bodies.</hi>

It may ſuffice to my purpoſe only to note
how that the Wicked are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
treated according to their deſerts in
this Life, as that the contrary for
the moſt part is beſtowed on them, they
go away with the Riches, Pleaſures, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:106721:59"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tis alſo certain that the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of ſome is ſo <hi>ſuperlatively</hi> great,
as that it cannot be ſufficiently puniſhed
in this Life, by all that can be inflicted on
them, the repetition and <hi>accumulation</hi> of
a multitude of Crimes, each of which is
in its own nature and by the Law, <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
muſt be acknowledged too great to
be compenſated by one <hi>ſingle Death.</hi> He
that has ran through the whole Circle
of Sin (as the caſe may be Stated) tho
he be handled according to the ſevereſt
Method, both of <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>puniſhments</hi>
can make no <hi>equivalent</hi> or tolerable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the ſame. <hi>The firebrand of
the World,</hi> who with the furys of War has
deſtroyed Countrys, depopulated Nations,
ſent thouſands of Souls to the other World
in their Blood and Sins, can make no
ſufficient attonement, by all that he can
do or ſuffer here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> nor is it leſs evident on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, that the good Man does not
(I may ſafely ſay) oftentimes cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a juſt recompence for all his doings
and ſufferings here; he is encompaſſed with
ſo thick a Cloud of miſeries, that his
whole Life is but one <hi>continued conflict,</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:106721:59"/>
with hardſhips and difficulties, from the
firſt to the laſt ſcene, the moſt doleful
of Tragedies. Like the <hi>Poor Begger</hi> in the
Goſpel, he has a full meaſure of <hi>evil
things,</hi> is pinched with Cold, Hunger,
Nakedneſs, boyls and ſinks under his
complicated calamities: Or like the great
Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor. 11. 25, &amp;c.</hi>) can give us
a black Role of miſeries that have on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſide attended him thro the whole
Race of his Life, and have been his inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Companions to the grave: this
was more eſpecially the caſe of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Chriſtians that lived in the <hi>Fiery</hi>
days of Perſecution, and has been and
will always be, more or leſs, of Pious
Souls to the World's end.</p>
            <p>Now if we reflect on theſe paſſages
with a thorough, and ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what concluſion can we poſſible draw
from hence? Shall We take an occaſion
upon this account as the Heathens have
done, to arreign the Juſtice of Heaven,
with open mouth to <hi>charge God fooliſhly,</hi>
or as we find Holy Men ſometimes mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.
<hi>Tuſh! God hideth away his face, and
he doth not ſee, there is no knowledge in the
Almighty, then have I cleanſed my heart in
vain, and waſhed my Hands in Innocency,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106721:60"/>
it is vain to ſerve God, what profit is there
in it.</hi> No, verily theſe are <hi>Illogical</hi> and falſe
inferences, from theſe irregularities and
failures here, we muſt firmly conclude
there is a time approaching, when the
ſupreme Judge will ſet all things at rights,
<hi>i. e.</hi> there is a Reſurrection, which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with impartial Juſtice to all, this
I am ſure is the great uſe which the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> points at and directs us to, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
94. 14, 15. <hi>The Lord will not caſt off his
People, neither will he forſake his inheritance,
but Judgment ſhall return unto Righteouſneſs.</hi>
Tho now they are at a diſtance, yet they
ſhall ſhake Hands and meet again, and
then the Wicked ſhall be puniſhed, and
the Godly rewarded.</p>
            <p>This I am ſure is the Improvement St.
<hi>Paul</hi> makes of it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 5. where ſpeaking
of the Perſecutions and Tribulations which
the Saints endured, calls them <hi>a manifeſt
token of the Righteous Judgment of God.</hi>
Not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not an example
but <hi>Demonstration;</hi> tho' now the Order
of Juſtice be inverted, tho' the Wicked
which deſerve puniſhment are far from
it, tho they proſper and triumph, are flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
and ſpreading like the <hi>Cedars in
Lebanus,</hi> and you that are well deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106721:60"/>
are rudely and barbarouſly treated,
you are to look on this as an undeniable
evidence, that there is a <hi>day of review</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
when Juſtice ſhall be done to
all; this is undeniably the meaning of
our Apoſtle here, as appears not only from
the expreſſion but alſo from what follows,
where he expatiates on the Argument.
<hi>That ye may be counted worthy of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, for which ye alſo ſuffer; ſeeing
it is a righteous thing with God to recompence
tribulation to them that trouble you, and to
you who are troubled reſt, when the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his
mighty Angels in flaming Fire, taking Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
on them that know not God, and obey
not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who
ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction
from the preſence of the Lord, and from the
Glory of his Power, when he ſhall come to
be Glorified in his Saints, and to be admired
in all them that believe in that day.</hi> The
natural and genuine Interpretation <hi>of
which Place</hi> can be no other than if the
Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>Have but a little patience
and the ſcene will be inverted, thoſe who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
and perſecute you ſhall pay dearly for it,</hi>
and you that now ſuffer ſhall be gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rewarded at the Reſurrection of all,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106721:61"/>
which is deſigned for Juſtice to all Men,
and to every <hi>part of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> From the foregoing experiences
(which muſt be allowed) there can no
inference be thought on more reaſonable
than that which the ſame Apoſtle has elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
repeated, <hi>Acts 17. 30. That God
hath appointed a Day in which he will Judge
the World in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the farther improvement of the
Argument, I think fit to recommend in
the next place thoſe various Parables in
the Goſpel ſo often mentioned; of the
<hi>Labourers,</hi> of the <hi>Talents,</hi> of the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen:</hi>
For 'tis undeniable that all
theſe have a manifeſt tendency to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
in hand. All theſe are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and according to their behaviour
treated, upon the <hi>Return</hi> of the great
Lord at the end of the Day, and of their
Work, in all which we have a ſpecial
and exact Account of every Man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
according to his <hi>Works; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi>
in all the proceedings being made
the <hi>ſtanding Rule</hi> and <hi>Meaſure,</hi> and the
<hi>Reſurrection,</hi> the unalterable time, and
ſo by conſequence appoſitely anſwers our
preſent deſign. In all theſe caſes we have
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106721:61"/>
the repeated Declaration of that great
Judge, that he will give to all what he
Promiſed, what is Right, what proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belongs unto him. He that hid his
<hi>Talent</hi> meets with a hard but <hi>equitable</hi>
Doom: He that improved it is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
In a word, the Loiterer (<hi>eo nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>)
is puniſhed as ſuch, and the faithful
Labourer is promoted. The treatment
of all here is proportioned to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
doings and deſervings. So we find
it expreſly noted by St. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 17. He
who had received five pounds, and by his
induſtry had gained five more, is kindly
received with the Character of a <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>faithful Servant,</hi> and becauſe of his ten
pounds, has Authority given him over
ten Cities; and ſo with proportion in the
next example, He whoſe Pound had
gained five, has a ſuitable command over
five Cities.</p>
            <p>Nor have we leſs evidence of the point
in hand, from the <hi>Rewards,</hi> the <hi>Wages,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe</hi>
of reward; which are Phraſes that
ever and anonoccur in Holy Writ. All theſe
are well known to be metaphorical and
relative terms; and therefore for a right
underſtanding, neceſſarily direct us to
the <hi>Correlative;</hi> and that can be no other
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106721:62"/>
than the whole Man: All his Actions,
all his Deeds, all his Merits, ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into conſideration; the Traffick of
his whole life is brought upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and accordingly he ſhall receive the
returns of them; at the ſetled time of
the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Nor may we omit the diverſities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Rewards and Puniſhments, which
attend the Bodies of Men in the other
World, and can reſult from nothing but <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;</hi>
For as it is the eſſence of it to take care
to Puniſh the Evil Doer, and to Reward
the Man of Merit: So is it no leſs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
both with reſpect to the deſervings
of either. This is the Method of all
<hi>Tribunals</hi> here below, and is induſtriouſly
obſerved (as himſelf has aſſured us) by
the <hi>Judge above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe all Governments have
provided great varieties of all kinds, to
anſwer the infinite caſes that come before
them, and how plentifully in this the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream</hi>
Governour is accommodated, the
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Heaven will not ſuffer us
to be ignorant.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch then as there are in that
everlaſting Dungeon below different Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or at leaſt Puniſhments provided
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106721:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for ſuch as ſhall by a dreadful Sentence
be fixed there; of which (to paſs by all
others) the tremendous woes pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
againſt <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,
Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> the <hi>outer darkneſs</hi> and
<hi>greater Damnation</hi> are undeniable eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
it roundly follows that the hand of
<hi>Juſtice</hi> is conſpicuous in all this: On
the other ſide, foraſmuch as there are
<hi>many manſions, higher</hi> and <hi>lower</hi> places of
Honour and Glory prepared for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Saints in the <hi>Empyraean</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Of the truth of which we are ſo
abundantly ſecured, as that it would be a

We are by all the Rules of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<hi>Logick</hi> to make the ſame concluſion as
heretofore; it being ſcarcely poſſible to
derive it from any other cauſe. If the
Bodies of the Twelve Apoſtles (for the
promiſe cannot be applied to their Souls
only, becauſe it is to be made good after
the Reſurrection, and at the Day of
Judgment) are hereafter to be ſeated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Twelve Thrones, as <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors</hi>
of <hi>The Twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, i. e.
Of all Mankind. If the <hi>Sons of</hi> Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee;
the Martyr'd Saints, ſome of thoſe of
the higheſt form ſhall fill thoſe immediate
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106721:63"/>
places of the <hi>Right Hand,</hi> and of the <hi>Left
Hand</hi> of Chriſt of his Kingdom. If the
eminent Chriſtians in the <hi>Gentile</hi> World
ſhall come from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and from the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> and take their Places next to <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the great Patriarchs
of the Promiſe. If thoſe that have <hi>beaten
down</hi> their Bodies, and brought them
<hi>into ſubjeicton</hi> (by their unwaried wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling
with the <hi>Fleſh</hi> have obtained a
Victory over it here) ſhall receive the
advantage thereof in their Exaltation
above: if (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

to his Labour,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 8. if thoſe
that have done and ſuffered more in this
Life; are carried on and encouraged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
from an infallible aſſurance of a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Retaliation:</hi> That is to ſay, of an <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent</hi>
and proportionable <hi>Recompence</hi> at
the Reſurrection of the Juſt; It is I think
to any Man who will not ſhut his Eyes
againſt the Light, a <hi>Plain Caſe, viz.</hi> in
all this the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God is ſignal and
conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>Hither tend the <hi>advancements</hi> of Glory
appropriated and applied by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
and Schoolmen to three ſorts of Men;

more abundantly in the Vineyard. Of
the truth of this there can be no doubt,
ſince <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf has aſſured us, <hi>That
they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs
of the Firmament, and they that turn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

And this is farther and more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the above mentioned promiſe
<hi>of Twelve Thrones</hi> to the firſt <hi>Heralds</hi> of

unſpotted from the Fleſh, have
adorned their Converſation with Purity

and Victoriouſly in this <hi>Warfare.</hi> This
is aſſerted by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in a lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Rhetorical ſtrain, (as his cuſtom
is) <hi>Chap. 54. 4, 5. Thus ſaith the Lord
unto the Eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths,
and chuſe the things that pleaſe me, and take
hold of my Covenant, even to them will I
give in mine Houſe, and within my Walls,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106721:64"/>
a Place and a Name, better than of Sons

Everlaſting Name that ſhall not be cut off.</hi>
This is alluded to by our Bleſſed Saviour,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 12. and emphatically noted by
St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 14. 4. where thoſe pure
<hi>Virgins that were not deſiled with Women</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Noble Army of Martyrs,

            <p>There can be no diſpute of the truth of

white robes were given unto them,</hi> Rev. 6. 9, 10.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106721:64"/>
And poſitively pronounces the <hi>Right hand,

Kingdom of Heaven to belong to thoſe
that have drank of Chriſt's Cup, and
been Baptiſed with his Baptiſm, <hi>Mat.</hi>
20. 22. To this purpoſe excellent is the
animadverſion of St. <hi>Auguſtine, Videbimus
in illo regno in corporibus Martyrum vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
Cicatrices, quae pro Chriſti nomine
pertulerunt non enim deformitas in eis, ſed

Civ. Dei l. 19. c. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We ſhall ſee in Heaven in the Bodies of the

                  </gap> will gloriouſly
ſhine forth through theſe impreſſions.</hi> And
again this great Father to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
has noted, <hi>In cicatricibus Martyrum,
ſole fulgidioribus extabit Martyrii glorioſiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
Monumentum, non autem ullum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris
glorificati dehoneſtamentum.</hi> Civ.
Dei, l. 6. 22. cap. 19. <hi>In the Scars of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Martyrs, brighter than the Sun,
ſhall ſhine forth the moſt glorious Trophy of
Martyrdom.</hi> We all allow it for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Reputation of a Souldier to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106721:65"/>
ſhew the <hi>Foot ſteps</hi> of thoſe wounds which
he received in fighting valiantly for his
King and Countrey.</p>
            <p>And indeed this Conſideration makes
this Opinion very probable; 'tis gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
admitted by the <hi>Schools</hi> and others,
and in the main, cannot be denied; and
in my apprehenſion does not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the ſupport of that Doctrine
which is our buſineſs to eſtabliſh;
If the Bodies of ſome of the Saints
in Heaven ſhall be <hi>ſignalized</hi> with
Characters of <hi>Advancement</hi> of Glory,
they are certainly capable of Rewards.</p>
            <p>For the farther improvement of the
argument, I deſire that it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
how that the Reſurrection and
Judgment are ſo interwoven and <hi>twiſted</hi>
together, as that the one cannot be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the other; 'tis a truth which
neither can nor will be denied; that the
one is in order to the other; And as at
the Aſſizes here below, when the Court
is ſet, the Perſons concerned are brought
from <hi>Preſon</hi> to the <hi>Bar,</hi> in order to their
<hi>Trials:</hi> So it is in this laſt and general
<hi>Aſſize,</hi> the Supream Judge ſends out his
Officers to remand all out of their Graves,
from all Quarters of the World, to make
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106721:65"/>
their perſonal appearance, to anſwer to
their Charge, and abide the final deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of this laſt <hi>Audit.</hi> And though
there may and will be to the end of the
World, <hi>prevarications, failures,</hi> and <hi>devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
in the proceedings of all <hi>Earthly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals,</hi>
yet this higheſt Court of Juſtice
muſt be acknowledged by all to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
exempt from theſe: 'Tis placed
beyond the poſſibility of the leaſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.</p>
            <p>Well then, the Reaſon of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
is the Judgment which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to follow after it; and if our
Bodies are not concerned in the buſineſs
Tranſacted, what do they make here?</p>
            <p>If they are no other than <hi>Inſtruments</hi>
only, their appearance is altogether <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
of which we have a full aſſurance
by all the methods of Judicature upon
Earth. To what purpoſe ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God put himſelf to the expence
of a miracle, which muſt be allowed by
all <hi>equivalent</hi> with the <hi>Creation?</hi> To
what purpoſe, I ſay, does the <hi>omnipotent
Power</hi> in a more extraordinary and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
manner exert it ſelf, in rallying toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ther the confuſed and ſcattered <hi>Atoms</hi> of
all Mankind, in bringing them back to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106721:66"/>
their <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> to the ſame ſtation
and order in which they formerly ſtood;
would he (think you) do all this were
our Bodies no more than Tools?</p>

If then it can be made appear, that our
Bodies are in an eſpecial manner concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Buſineſs and Determination of
this great and terrible Day, there needs
no farther Proof, to bring the former
abſurdities home, and Fix them here.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To ſtrengthen what
we have here aſſerted, and to ſecure it
from the attack of the Philoſopher, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it may be <hi>obſerved:</hi> How that the Holy,
Scriptures are on our ſide, and ſeem to
countenance this <hi>Truth.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> does
frequently tell us <hi>That the Dead were Judged</hi>
—and our Bleſſed Saviour in no leſs
than three Places, is deſcribed by this <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis,
a Judge both of the Quick and the
Dead,</hi> Act. 10. 42. 1 Tim. 4. 1. 1 Pet. 4.
5. there is no need of a comment here.
The word <hi>Dead</hi> puts all out of doubt, it
being properly applicable to our Bodies
only. Our Souls are (by the allowance of
all) pronounced <hi>Immortal;</hi> and in the Senſe
of the Scripture here, neither are or can <hi>be
ſubject to Death.</hi> So that here, if any
where, the <hi>caveat</hi> of the Apoſtle ought
duly to be regarded. <hi>Col. 2. 8. Beware
leaſt any Man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and
vain Deceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this paſſage we are plainly taught
that there is a ſort of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> both <hi>vain</hi>
and <hi>deceitful,</hi> and how prejudicial it has
been to <hi>Divinity,</hi> no one (any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
with the Learned) can poſſibly
be Ignorant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:106721:68"/>
Hence <hi>Valentinus</hi> owes his Hereſie,

            <p>And without doubt the <hi>Aereal</hi> Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
derived from the ſchool of <hi>Plato</hi> led
the moſt Learned <hi>Origen</hi> aſide in his Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
about the Reſurrection, upon this
account it was that the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Days of
the <hi>Maccabees</hi> enacted a prohibition againſt
Philoſophy, and the known character that
<hi>Tertullian</hi> gives them (<hi>Petriarchas Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum</hi>)
can be derived from no other
cauſe.</p>
            <p>Of this ſtamp (if I miſtake not) is the
Philoſophy before us, <hi>Fallacious</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful</hi>
(as I have above Repreſented it,)
and therefore we ought to be careful, and
fearful of it; the ſureſt way not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
with it, is to lay it aſide: What,
tho the ſubtile Philoſopher, urge me
with a Syllogiſm which I am not able
to Anſwer, nor, (as is by him ingeniouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confeſſed) himſelf neither? What, tho he
by his Logick entangles me in a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which is not eaſily effoyled? I am not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all his <hi>Quirks</hi> to be tenaceous
of that Truth, <hi>which</hi> I have all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106721:68"/>
in the World (except his Fallacy) to
believe. When the Philoſopher urged a
ſtrong and as was ſuppoſed an irreſiſtable
Argument againſt Motion, the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
gave him a ſufficient Anſwer and
confutation by his <hi>Walking.</hi> The Caſe comes
home, the Body is expreſly ſummoned to
appear and muſt be concluded a Party,
notwithſtanding all that the Philoſopher
has to ſay againſt it.</p>
            <p>The Sophiſter then here labours in the
<hi>Fire,</hi> all his deceitful <hi>Logick</hi> will never be
able to perſwade Men of underſtanding
that the Body is barely the inſtrument of
the Soul, tis (as he has been often told)
a <hi>Part,</hi> an eſſential Part, the one <hi>half of</hi>
the Man, which as ſuch is properly and
directly concerned in the Negotiations
Traffick and Actions of this State of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
and ſo unavoidably intereſted in the
account and as a Party together with the
Soul to Anſwer for all; and to ſtand or
fall accordingly.</p>
            <p>Tis not to be denyed that our Senſes are
the great inletts of Sin, and therefore
ought to be allowed the proper Subjects
of Puniſhment, in order whereunto tis
obſervable how that the greateſt part of
the Torments of Hell which we find
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106721:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mentioned in its Black Catalogue ſeem in
a peculiar and proper manner to be marked
out, and intended to this very Purpoſe,

For example here is <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> than which
nothing can be more offenſive to the
<hi>Sight,</hi> and to make it full here is <hi>utter
Darkneſs.</hi> Is Fire injurious to the <hi>Touch?</hi>
Here tis with a <hi>Witneſs</hi> moſt frequently

Hell. And that the <hi>Smell</hi> ſhould not

            </p>
            <p>And farther to affect the Organs of
<hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>hearing;</hi> there are two other

(unleſs we will interpret all theſe Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically,
contrary to the Judgment of
all) muſt be applyed to the <hi>Body.</hi> In a
<hi>Word,</hi> the Argument is clearly on our ſide,
it being the Doctrine of all (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception)
that there are in that Dungeon
below, Puniſhments provided for and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to both Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The elaborate Treatiſe of the

He has proved the Reſurrection of the
<hi>ſame Body,</hi> from the <hi>Antidiluvian Patriarchs,
the Jews, the Abiſſines, Peruvians, Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,
Braſilians,</hi> &amp;c.—from all the
Heathens—he has proved it to have
been the Doctrine of the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
of the Councils; of the Creeds; of
the Scriptures: Anſwered all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
againſt it, and can it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that he ſhould take ſo much pains

It muſt be confeſſed and allowed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>No verily, by this accompliſhed Work,
he has obliged the World, and done
the Church good Service, effectually
Proclaimed aloud the Truth, which is
here contended for. The Reſurrection of
the ſame Body carries in the very bowel of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106721:70"/>
it a Judgment, together with the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of it.</p>
            <p>And if it be neceſſary that the ſame
Body ſhould appear, the Actions of the
former Life, are unavoidably faſtned
to it, together with the ſutable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of that which is to come.</p>

            <p>IF theſe Sentiments were not (as we
conceive them to be the ſuggeſtions
of <hi>Reaſon</hi>) to mount in the Argument a
little higher, come we to <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and to enquire what Authorities we
can find here for the ſupport of it.</p>
            <p>For if our reaſon of the Reſurrection
receive any countenance from the <hi>Sacred
Oracles;</hi> its above the <hi>ſhock</hi> of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
and can no more be impreſſed by
all his Notions, than the <hi>Creation</hi> of the
World could be overturned by the known
Axiom of the great Stagyrite, <hi>ex nihilo
nihil fit, out of Nothing Nothing can be
made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with two noted Authorities of
our Saviour, which becauſe of a near af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
to each other, I ſhall join here in
one: That of our Saviour in his Sermon on
the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 30. together with
that of the Twelve Apoſtles when he
gave them their Commiſſion, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them in their Duty, <hi>Mat. 10. 28. For
if thy Right Eye offend thee, pluck it out and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106721:71"/>
cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee
that one of thy Members ſhould periſh, and
not thy whole Body ſhould be cast into Hell:
And if thy right Hand offend thee cut it off,
and cast it from thee, for it is profitable for
thee that one of thy Members ſhould periſh
and not that thy whole Body ſhould be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Second, <hi>Fear not them which
kill the Body, but are not able to kill the
Soul, but rather fear him which is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
both Body and Soul in Hell</hi>—in both
which places we are again and again aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the Bodies of Men, as well as
Souls are liable to the <hi>Puniſhments of Hell,</hi>
unleſs we can imagine that Chriſt here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to alarm the World with a <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
fulmen,</hi> an <hi>ineffectual Threat</hi> (which
is moſt impious to conceive.) To what
purpoſe ſhould he give ſuch frequent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements
as thoſe, if Hell were not
to be the Portion of evil Bodies?</p>
            <p>The caſting into Hell and <hi>deſtroying in
Hell</hi> are applied to Bodies; it can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
in no other Senſe but as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
or affirmation, that they ſhall
be doomed upon their miſcarriages here
to the ſevereſt Torments in that Region
below.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:106721:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If Men do not <hi>pluck out their Right
Eyes, cut off their Right Hand</hi>—they are
in danger of implunging the whole in the
Lake that burns with Fire.</p>
            <p>If Men do not fear God above Men,
their Bodies as well as Souls are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Hell Fire.</p>
            <p>So that from theſe two places, all thoſe
Concluſions follow, and appear as clear
as Chryſtal diametrically contrary to what
the Learned Author would have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That our Bodies are capable of
Puniſhments becauſe liable to be caſt into
Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they are capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Evil at preſent, becauſe that portion
of miſery is here denounced againſt them,
Hell being provided for none but the
wicked.</p>
            <p>And the two oppoſites to theſe are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
as apparent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Our Bodies are capable of doing
well here, we can <hi>cut of our Right
Hand</hi>—we can <hi>fear God,</hi> or elſe it had
never been here intimated as our Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:106721:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If we live in the diſcharge
of our Duty, our Bodies ſhall be admitted
to glorious enjoyments in the other
World. For this in the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
applied.</p>
            <p>The firſt Authority that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
ſhall be that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom:</hi>
2. Where after he had pronounced the
ſinner inexcuſable who committed the
ſame Sins which he condemned in others;
and charged him with the ſure Judgment
of God, which is according to truth from
his impenitency and perſeverance in it,
tells him, <hi>verſe 5. That he thereby treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
up to himſelf Wrath against the Day of
Wrath, and Revelation of the Righteous
Judgment of God, who will render to every
Man according to his Deeds; to them who by
patient continuance in well-doing ſeek for
Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life; But to them that are contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
and do not obey the Truth, Indignation
and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh upon
every Soul of Man that doth Evil, of the
Jew first, and alſo of the Gentile: But
Glory, Honour, and Peace to every Man that
worketh Good,, to the Jew first and alſo to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106721:72"/>
Gentile, for there is no reſpect of Perſons with
God.</hi> If this Text be well conſidered, it
will afford a good Argument; in order
whereunto it is worthy our obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> How that the <hi>Man</hi> is through
the whole courſe of it charged both with
the Sin and conſequences of it; as in the
1, 3, 6, and 11. <hi>Verſes. O Man.</hi> …</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he is ſaid <hi>to treaſure up
wrath,</hi> by which elegant <hi>metaphor,</hi> nothing
leſs can be ſignified, than that his ſins are
kept in a ſafe reconditory to be brought
forth againſt the <hi>Man</hi> in the great Day of
Reckoning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He is alſo here infallibly certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of the Juſtice of all the Proceedings
then, and that <hi>1st,</hi> From the Nature of
the Judgment it ſelf, <hi>'Tis Righteous.
2dly,</hi> From the Character of the Judge
ſet forth by this Paraphraſe, <hi>who will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to every Man according to his Deeds;</hi>
which moſt certainly carries an <hi>accent</hi> and
<hi>emphaſis</hi> with it, being ſo often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
repeated, as <hi>Pſal. 62. 12. Mat. 16.
27. Rev. 22. 12. 3dly,</hi> By another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
which makes his Juſtice altogether
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106721:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as conſpicuous. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he is no
reſpecter of Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We have here withal a large
amplification of the different ſtates which
attend all according to their Deſerts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> So univerſal is this laſt <hi>Scrutiny</hi>
as that no Man whatſoever is exempt from
it, neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Gentile;</hi> that is, no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at all, The Argument from this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
runs thus. There is a time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when all <hi>Men</hi> (which unavoidably
ſuppoſes the conjunction of both parts)
ſhall make their Perſonal appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a moſt righteous Judge, when all their
Deeds, of what kind ſoever, ſhall be
brought upon the Stage, and they imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
treated without any other reſpects
but their deſervings. When, as St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi>'s
Creed expreſſeth it, <hi>All Men ſhall
riſe with their Bodies, and give an account
of their Works; and they that have done
Good, ſhall go into life everlaſting, and they
they that have done Evil, into everlaſting Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is this but <hi>Juſtice</hi> both with
reſpect to Body as well as Soul? for both
are here joined together, and one is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
concomitant of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:106721:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The <hi>Second</hi> Authority which I offer
for the confirmation of the Doctrine
which I endeavour to vindicate, is <hi>John</hi>
5. 28. <hi>Marvel not at this, for the hour is
coming in the which all that are in their
Graves ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall come
forth; they that have done Good unto the
Reſurrection of Life, and they that have
done Evil unto the Reſurrection of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To bring my Text home to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we are neceſſitated to look back into
the context; where we find the occaſion to
be the cure of a <hi>Paralitical</hi> Man, who
had laboured under this <hi>Chronical</hi> Diſeaſe
for no leſs a Space than 38 Years, at
which the Spectators deſervedly wonder;
whereupon our Bleſſed Saviour gives
them an account of a much ſtranger
thing than this—namely, of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Bodies of all Men from
the <hi>firſt</hi> to the <hi>laſt,</hi> at the end of the World;
<hi>Marvel not at this, for the hour cometh
when all that are in their Graves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>My obſervation from this Place for the
Advantage of my Argument, is, <hi>Firſt,</hi>
we have here a Reſurrection (how ſtrange
ſoever and impoſſible it may ſeem to be)
confirmed and eſtabliſhed from the Mouth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106721:74"/>
of Chriſt himſelf; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> we have
here the conſequence of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the main Reaſon of it (which is
the matter of our Diſpute) and I moſt
willingly appeal to the Reaſon of all
<hi>Mankind,</hi> whether it be not manifeſtly
held forth in the latter Clauſe; for tho
the <hi>illative</hi> be ſuppreſſed, yet tis manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implyed, and the latter part is <hi>exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
i. e.</hi> gives us the Reaſon of the
former.</p>
            <p>The Bodies of good Men are to riſe
again, and to enjoy everlaſting Happineſs,
and the Bodies of the Wicked are to be
united to their Souls, to ſuffer thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
in conjunction now, which their
Sins, committed in their former Union,
have deſerved. The moſt natural Senſe
of the place is, as if Chriſt had ſaid,
<hi>All Men ſhall riſe, that they that have done
Good, may go into Life everlaſting, and that
they that have done Evil unto the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and next Text is <hi>Rev. 20.
12, 13. I ſaw the Dead, ſmall and great
ſtand before God, and the Books were opened;
and another Book was opened, which is the
Book of Life, and the Dead were Judged
out of theſe things which were Written in the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106721:74"/>
Books, and the Sea gave up the Dead which
were in it, and Death and Hell deliver'd up
the Dead which were in them, and they were
Judged every Man according to their Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Viſion St. <hi>John</hi> repreſents the
general Reſurrection, under the popular
<hi>Scheme</hi> of a grand Aſſize (with alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in all probability to the like paſſages
of the Prophets <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Malachy, Dan.
7. 10. Mal.</hi> 3. 16.) at which time <hi>the
Books of Records,</hi> containing the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Charges of thoſe Summoned
to appear, are produced, faithfully Read
and Examined: And as theſe are found,
ſo do the Perſons at the Bar, either
ſtand or fall: Even ſo is it to all intents
and purpoſes at the Reſurrection, tho
there will be no real Written Books of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters,</hi>
but the Metaphorical ones of God's
<hi>Omniſcience,</hi> and every Man's <hi>Conſcience</hi>
(which carries in it the whole Work of
the Court, all the Officers of it) we are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
infallibly ſecured of the <hi>Accuracy</hi> of
Juſtice in all the Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Every Line and Clauſe of this Text
affords us ample evidence of the Doctrine
we contend for: As the Bodies of all Men
ſhall ariſe to be brought to Judgment,
ſo ſhall all their Actions be laid open,
carefully Scanned, Weighed and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106721:75"/>
to make the Sentence Righteous.
Of which the Books (that is, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
Charges, and Works contained
in them) are the unvariable <hi>Meaſure</hi> and
<hi>Rule</hi> inviolably to be obſerved by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judge in the final Determinations
of all Men. Now that the force of the
Argument of this Text may not be elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
I deſire the Reader to conſider theſe
three Remarks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Dead are raiſed in order
to their Tryal, and therefore muſt by all
be allowed in a ſpecial manner concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'tis ſaid expreſly that the Dead
were Judged, which cannot be referred
to the Souls of Men (which are Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
no ways ſubject to Death in the
Senſe here) it muſt therefore by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
neceſſity be underſtood of the
Bodies, and ſo by conſequence all the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of this Judgment, from firſt to
the laſt, both the Works and Remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
faſtned here. And for the full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of which, it ought to be,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106721:75"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Farther noted, how that 'tis
twice repeated in the cloſe of both the
Verſes—<hi>The Dead were Judged out of
theſe things</hi> which were Written in the
Books—<hi>and they were Judged every Man
according to their Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> After theſe I cannot paſs by
that of <hi>Heb. 6. 10. God is not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
to forget your Work and Labour
of Love in Miniſtring to the Saints.</hi> For
our encouragment in well doing, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
directs us, to caſt our Eyes on the
recompence of reward which ſhall attend
good and charitable Men at laſt, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
us in this, that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> (which
is the ſame with Juſtice) ſhall be the
ſtandard of it, and clearly implies that
if God ſhould forget, ſhould not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
the Saint according to his Works,
he would be Unrighteous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Nor may we omit that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
aſſurance which we have received
from the Mouth of our Bleſſed Saviour
in that full Place <hi>Mat. 25. 31. &amp;c.</hi> where
we have a large Account of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Judgment, together with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
Rule, and Reaſons of both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:106721:76"/>
The curſed Sentence which ſhall be
paſſed on the Bodies as well as Souls of the
Wicked (for they are now both joyned
together) has reſpect to the Sins which
in their former conjunction they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
the one is Aſſigned the expreſs
Reaſon of the other. So it runs, <hi>depart ye
curſed into Everlaſting Fire,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For I was an
Hungred and ye gave me no Meat,</hi> &amp;c. here
the illative, <hi>For,</hi> is allowed by all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> as well as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to be
<hi>Cauſal.</hi> And the whole Man was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Sin and muſt be joyned in
the Puniſhment, and tho' in the adverſe
Part, <hi>when</hi> the welcome Invitation is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father inherit
the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For I was an Hungred
and ye gave me Meat.</hi> … ſome <hi>Divines</hi> of
the <hi>Reformation,</hi> will not have it here
to ſignifie the <hi>Cauſe</hi> but the <hi>Conſequence,</hi>
to avoid the Force of the Argument for
<hi>Meritoriouſneſs</hi> of good Works, which
ſeems to me a very ſtrange <hi>Diſtinction</hi>
(and as I conceive in the preſent Caſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
needleſs) for God may, ought,
and will reward us for our <hi>good Works;</hi>
not for any real Merit of <hi>condignity</hi> in
them, but becauſe he hath been pleaſed
out of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi> to give
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106721:76"/>
us his <hi>Gracious</hi> Promiſes ſo to do, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account is obliged to make good his
Word; but be this how it will, ſo much
is certain, and muſt be acknowledged by
all, it is the main drift and deſign of our
Bleſſed Saviour in the whole Diſcourſe,
to repreſent our Actions here done in the
<hi>Body,</hi> to be the <hi>Square</hi> and <hi>Meaſure</hi> of
that Judgment which ſuitably ſhall attend
both <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> After all this I might here call

of the whole Chapter tends. For it muſt
be acknowledged by all, the main End
of it: Now the Reaſon of all, can reſult
from no other Principle, or at leaſt none
ſo conſiderable as this, <hi>viz. That we have
to do with a God who will Reward every Man
according to his Work;</hi> which fully comes
up to what I am to prove.</p>
            <p>Can any one imagine that there would
be ſo much ado about our <hi>Bodies,</hi> if they
were not capable of an exalted injoyment
in <hi>Heaven?</hi> No verily, we may depend
upon the Truth of the contrary (let the
Philoſopher ſay what he pleaſes) for the
ſame Apoſtle has elſewhere aſſigned this
as the Reaſon of it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. laſt, <hi>God ſhall
change our vile Body, that it may be faſhioned
like unto his glorious Body; becauſe our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
is in Heaven.</hi> Our <hi>Citizenſhip</hi> lies
there; we are free of that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above,
and this <hi>Angelical</hi> Alteration is in order
to our <hi>Inveſtiture</hi> into all the unſpeakable
<hi>Privileges</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the tendency of the whole
Chapter reſolves it ſelf into this. That
Chriſtians, notwithſtanding all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragments
in the <hi>way,</hi> ought to go on
with reſolution and chearfulneſs in the
diſcharge of their Duty, upon the aſſurance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106721:77"/>
of a <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> when their <hi>Bodies</hi> as
well as their Souls ſhall receive a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for all; and if this be the Caſe of
the <hi>Saint</hi> (as it is here plainly and fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented)
<hi>what</hi> the State and condition of
the <hi>Sinner</hi> will be upon his Reſurrection
we may eaſily conclude, not only from
the <hi>Topick</hi> of contraries, but alſo becauſe
he is to bring his <hi>Works</hi> along with him
to the <hi>Judgment-Seat,</hi> and according to
theſe ſhall receive his Sentence of him,
who will, muſt, and can do no other,
than <hi>Judge the World in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> I ſhall mention but one Text
more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. FOR WE MUST ALL
APPEAR BEFORE THE JUDGMENT-SEAT
OF CHRIST, THAT EVERY MAN MAY
RECEIVE THE THINGS DONE IN HIS
BODY ACCORDING TO WHAT HE HATH
DONE, WHETHER IT BE GOOD OR BAD.</p>
            <p>This is the very Scripture <hi>which</hi> the
learned Author alledges for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Reaſon for the Reſurrection,
<hi>viz. That as we are Men when we do Well, or
Sin, So 'tis reaſonable that we ſhould be Men,
when we are Rewarded or Puniſhed for it.</hi>
Which, as was intimated before, is the
ſame <hi>Doctrin with ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106721:78"/>
And this is that <hi>invictus Cunaeus,</hi> that
invincible Fort which can never be taken,
which will and muſt maintain the great
<hi>ſtanding</hi> reaſon of the Reſurrection againſt
the Aſſaults of the Philoſopher, being above
them all. This is that Place which we have
induſtriouſly reſerved as the laſt and ſureſt
<hi>Nail,</hi> to fix the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and render it
<hi>immoveable:</hi> This is that place which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
and proclaims it as loudly and
plainly as <hi>Letters, Words,</hi> and <hi>Syllables</hi> can
do it.</p>
            <p>I do not ſee how 'tis poſſible for any
one (that is not irreſiſtibly perverſe) to
avoid the force of it. For here our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are cited before this <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and all
the Actions of our Lives are brought
with them, to be reviewed, ſcanned over,
ſentenced and Judged; all the actions of all
ſorts of Men, without exception—whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad.</hi> And the proper wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of either is to be given accordingly,
and that in <hi>ſtatu compoſito,</hi> the <hi>whole Man,</hi>
his Body as well as Soul. There are a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Elegancies obſervable in the
words, the chief of which I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to note. As,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:106721:78"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> The neceſſity of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in order to a Judgment, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
We muſt appear, which gives us ſure
grounds to conclude that our Bodies are
more than <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> that they are in
an eſpecial manner concerned in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the <hi>Bench.</hi> No upright, full
Judgment can be paſſed without them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have here the manner of
it, ſignificantly ſet out in the <hi>Idium</hi> of the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Appear clearly as in the
Light,</hi> manifeſtly to be laid open in every
part, all that ever was done in the Body
muſt appear with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as ſome
Copies read it; the Body is brought to
anſwer for the proper things it did here,
and <hi>ea quae corpori debentur,</hi> as another of
the Learned has Paraphraſed it: The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhall receive the things which are <hi>due,</hi>
which of <hi>right</hi> belong unto it; <hi>Sicut
Juſtitia dicitur, ſuum cui<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> dare,</hi> as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Criticks comments it; and
this is the very nature of Juſtice, that <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body ſhall have the proper Reward which
is exactly ſuitable to his work.</hi> And <hi>congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter
ad id quod geſſit,</hi> as another of no
ſmall Repuration has given us the ſenſe
of it: The Judgment of every Body ſhall
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106721:79"/>
be <hi>tongruous</hi> and <hi>correſpondent</hi> to his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
We ſee the main indictment is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Body, and all the deeds done
in the former Life are applied to it, and
according to theſe it is we are either to
ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis farther to be noted how
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes himſelf by a <hi>Trope</hi>
a <hi>Metonymie</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> for the <hi>Effect,</hi>
the <hi>Works</hi> for the <hi>Wages,</hi> the things <hi>Done</hi>
in the Body, for what is <hi>Due</hi> unto them
And if this be not plainly enough expreſt
to remove all ſcruples, cavils, doubts and
gain-ſayings, we have here,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Reaſon of all this aſſigned
by the infallible Spirit,—THAT EVERY
MAN MAY RECEIVE THE THINGS DONE
IN HIS BODY, ACCORDING TO WHAT HE
HAS DONE, WHETHER IT BE GOOD OR
BAD. … Which ſounds to me, as if the
Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>To this very end, to
this very intent, for this very purpoſe, for
this very reaſon,</hi> The Proceſs of the Day
of Judgment requires the appearance
of our Bodies, as well as Souls, that Juſtice
may be done to both. I can make
no other conſtruction of it. <hi>That every
Man may receive the things done in the Body
according to what he has done, whether it be
Good or Bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:106721:79"/>
Upon the whole I declare, that ever
ſince I met with the Objections of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Author againſt it, I have been ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to put the thoughts of it out of
my Head; and the more I conſidered it,
the more I am in love with, the more I
am eſtabliſhed in it: And whereas the
Learned Author would enervate, throw
it aſide, and make it no reaſon at all; I
on the contrary muſt confeſs (beſide the
will and pleaſure of God) that I look on
it, as the firſt and great Reaſon of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:
I do give it the <hi>ſupremacy</hi> and
<hi>precedency</hi> to all others. I muſt freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that I cannot, after my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſearch and inquiſition, poſſibly find
out any Reaſon that can pretend to <hi>equal</hi>
or <hi>rival</hi> it, that can ſtand in <hi>competition</hi>
with it. The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is in order to
<hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> here
are all one.</p>
            <p>I cannot for my heart Divine upon
what other Account but this, the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
of the <hi>ſame Body,</hi> ſhould be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
by all the Ancients contended for,
and expreſly aſſerted, <hi>Reſurrectionis vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
non aliam rem vindicat quam quae reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi>

            <p>I will not dwell upon this, nor light a

beyond a poſſibility of denial.</p>
            <p>Now I deſire the Philoſopher to give

Why any Body at all?</p>

            <p>I do verily believe he will have an hard
Task of it, and however he may be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
perſuaded, it will (I preſume) be a
a difficult matter for him to perſuade or
convince others. For my part, I look on

            <p>'Tis moſt certain that this Doctrine has
