         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Is that Houſe which is called by my

For, in regard ye have done ſuch works as
they did, ſaith the LORD; and, foraſmuch as I
ſpake unto you (<hi>as I did to them</hi>) riſing up early,
yet was not heard, not anſwered when I called

Therefore pray not for this people, that they may

Apoſtacies? and how few are now ſecure from the
Spiritual and Temporal Oppreſſions of this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
(As they did in Jeremiahs dayes</hi>) the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
gathered wood, the fathers kindled the fire,
the women kneaded the dough to bake cakes for
the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink
oblations to other gods, that they might provoke

the Fathers, the Women, and the People of all ſorts

according to their abilities, after the mode of theſe
times; and pour out their drink Oblations of curſed
healths, to thoſe Idols which they have ſet up and

do they provoke me to anger ſaith the <hi>LORD?</hi>
do they not rather provoke themſelves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion

therefore, thus ſaith the <hi>LORD,</hi> Behold, my
anger and my fury ſhall be poured out on this

know, GOD delights not in them.</hi> What I ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Fathers, <hi>and unto your ſelves,</hi> in the dayes

this I commanded you, ſaying, obey my Voice,

own hearts, went backward and not forward.
Ever ſince that day, wherein I delivered you
<hi>from your Spiritual Thraldom, and in which I would
have delivered you from your Corporeal ſlaveries;</hi> I
have even from that time until this day, ſent
unto you my ſervants the Prophets (<hi>of all ſorts,
and with various diſpenſations</hi>) riſing early, and
dayly ſending them, <hi>as I did heretofore to my

words, though they have not hearkned unto them;
yea,</hi> thou ſhalt call <hi>again</hi> upon them though they

a time will come wherein they ſhall take the
bones of your Kings, and the bones of your

of your Prieſts (<hi>and Prelates</hi>) and the bones of
your Prophets <hi>who ſeduced you,</hi> and the bones of

Earth. And, death ſhall be rather choſen then
life, of all thoſe who remain of this evil Family,
whereſover they remain in the places whither I
have driven them, ſaith the <hi>LORD</hi> of Hoaſts.
Thou ſhalt ſay thus likewiſe unto them; Thus
ſaith the <hi>LORD,</hi> ſhall they fall and not riſe?
Shall they cauſe him ſo to turn away from them
that he ſhall not return? If not, why then is this
People ſlidden back by a perpetual backſliding?

                  <hi rend="margQuotes">The remainder of this Prophetical rebuke
and Invitation to Repentance, I leave to be
peruſed in the ſaid propheſie of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and
applyed by every Reader as <hi>GOD</hi> ſhall give
him underſtanding, that the Myſtical <hi>Balm of
Gilead</hi> therein mentioned, may be timely ſought
after; and that <hi>Phyſitian</hi> found, by whom our
Maladies may be cured; To which purpoſe, I
will proceed with what I have more to ſay, in
order to the making you deſirous and capable
of receiving benefit by that <hi>Univerſal Goſpel,</hi>
which the <hi>Angel</hi> flying through the midſt of
Heaven, was to Preach to every <hi>Nation, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
Tongue</hi> and <hi>People</hi> throughout the World;
and, after a more general reception thereof

               <p>This foregoing Branch of the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi>
Commiſſion; being, (as it were by way of <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification</hi>)
delivered out to me upon the occaſion
aforeſaid, I was internally moved to publiſh it to
theſe <hi>Nations</hi> in this my <hi>Generation,</hi> as I have now
done this day; And I have performed it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably,
with a good Conſcience, becauſe, I
am infallibly aſſured, that, it was recorded for
all <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Generations</hi> to the end of the
World, as well as intended for the Inhabitants
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95680:9"/>
of <hi>Judah</hi> in <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> dayes; and that it ought to
be applyed to all thoſe who are found guiltie of
the ſame, or of the like <hi>Prevarications;</hi> and this
I believe, in regard he who doth nothing in vain,
would not have preſerved, during ſo many Ages,
this Record of his Judgements, and of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
paſſages between him and his People; and
cauſed it to have been ſo diſperſed throughout
the Earth, had it not concerned all <hi>his People</hi> in
all <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places.</hi> Therefore, it evidently
appearing unto me, that <hi>GOD</hi> moved me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> I have accordingly made
Application, in this manner; conceiving it will
operate the more effectually, by being expreſſed
in the Prophets own powerful words &amp; ſenſe; and
much better heeded and regarded then in mine
onely; or if it had been undertaken by my own
<hi>Premeditated Deſign,</hi> though I have ſeen enough
to warrant the juſtneſs and neceſſity of making
ſuch an Addreſſe upon a morral account. I have
not hereby charged upon theſe <hi>Nations</hi> any tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
which was charged upon the Inhabitants
of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
(nor any <hi>Prevarications</hi> reſembling their ſins or
to them equivolent) but, ſuch as <hi>GOD,</hi> my <hi>own
Conscience,</hi> and <hi>moſt men</hi> know (or may know)
theſe <hi>Nations</hi> are guilty of; nor do I exclude <hi>my
ſelf</hi> out of that number which needs Repentance,
but, have performed my duty faithfully without
reſpect or diſreſpect of Perſons according to my
underſtanding. And, being conſcious that it is
my duty ſo to do, I will now, by the Authority
of thoſe <hi>Credentials,</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> hath written in
my heart (and which are in part, publickly ſhown)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95680:9"/>
make uſe of them in ſuch Immergencies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies
as occur, faithfully adding what I
believe he hath further Commiſſioned me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
ſo far forth as my <hi>Experience</hi> and his <hi>known
Inſtructions,</hi> joyntly conſidered, ſhall indubitably
warrant. And that is, at this time to ſend out
among you an <hi>Exhortation</hi> to be wary, that you
ſtill harden not your hearts as in thoſe former
dayes of <hi>Temptation</hi> and <hi>Provocation,</hi> wherein
ye provoked <hi>GOD's</hi> wrath: but, that you hearken
unto his <hi>Voice</hi> whilſt the <hi>day of Grace</hi> laſteth.
But, alas! I am between hope and fear, it is
almoſt too late with many; For, they who are
worſt, have ſo high a conceit of themſelves, that
there is more hope of meer fooles then of them.
They think themſelves to be ſafe &amp; clear-ſighted,
when they are indeed, miſerable, poor, blind, and
naked; they ſuppoſe they are ſetled upon the hill
of <hi>Sion,</hi> whereas, they are yet but as it were upon
the mount <hi>Gilboa,</hi> even in ſlippery places, where
they cannot long ſtand faſt; For, we have almoſt
ſo generally indulged <hi>Oppreſſions, Injuſtice,</hi> and
<hi>Vanities,</hi> that they ſeem to be the principal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
of our <hi>Safety, Power,</hi> and <hi>Honour;</hi> yea
to be eſſential to our <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>legal Cuſtoms,</hi> as
alſo ſo great a part of our Revenues, &amp; the means
of our <hi>Subſiſtance,</hi> that, we can hardly live without
them. Verily break off in due time from your
ſins, and from all the occaſions of tranſgreſſing;
<hi>Hear, repent</hi> and turn ſpeedily to the <hi>LORD</hi> our
<hi>GOD,</hi> not <hi>preſuming</hi> nor <hi>deſpairing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I do humbly (though I might
do it Magiſterially) beſeech you my <hi>dear brethren</hi>
(who ſeeming to be Profeſſors of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95680:10"/>
diſſembled or Apoſtatized, or any way given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Scandal</hi>) be exemplary to others in a <hi>ſignal
Repentance:</hi> For, nor your <hi>formal,</hi> nor your <hi>former
Righteouſneſs,</hi> will avail, if you have Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
from it. Though not in reſpect to my
words, yet for the Honour of <hi>GOD,</hi> whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
you are thought to be, and for your own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſake, repent and turn to the <hi>LORD</hi> unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all ye, who have hitherto taken the <hi>Name</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in vain, and prophaned it, by not living
the <hi>Life of Chriſt</hi> according to thoſe Doctrines of
his, which ye have profeſſed; nor <hi>acting,</hi> nor
<hi>ſuffering</hi> conſtantly according to that <hi>honeſty,</hi> and
<hi>Piety,</hi> whereof ye made fair outward ſhewes:
For, many of you have made ſordid <hi>Gain</hi> by a
pretended <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> and like the Religious
Whore, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh, have made
your <hi>ſeeming holineſs,</hi> and formal <hi>Devotions</hi> and
<hi>Conformities,</hi> to be Preambles and Brokers to
your <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>uncleanneſs.</hi> There have been
very great failings of late in that kind among the
beſt of us; ſo much <hi>ſelf-ſeeking, diſſembling</hi> and
<hi>Apoſtatizing,</hi> that, there was little truth in our
<hi>words,</hi> or <hi>deeds;</hi> and very great and ſevere are
thoſe <hi>chaſtiſements</hi> which <hi>GOD</hi> hath already laid
upon us for our tranſgreſſions, and greater are
yet to come, if we more heartily repent not. All
<hi>GOD's Judgements</hi> afore-mentioned, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> might
have been prevented by timely <hi>Penitence;</hi> and
ſo may thoſe wherewith we are threatned, and
theſe alſo be quite removed, which yet continue.
But, neither our <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in time paſt, from
which we have Apoſtatized, ſhall profit us; nor
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95680:10"/>
ſhall our <hi>ſins</hi> which we have heretofore commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
damnifie us, if we reform our wayes: For,
<hi>GOD</hi> hath not onely ſaid it, but ſworn it alſo by
his own Life, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11, 12. &amp;c. <hi>As I live
ſaith the LORD, I have no pleaſure in the death of
the wicked, but rather, that he may turn from his
wickedneſs and live; The Righteouſneſs of the
Righteous ſhall not deliver him in the day of his
Tranſgreſſion, nor ſhall the wicked fall by his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
in the day that he turneth from it: neither
the Righteouſneſs of the Righteous ſhall be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
when he committeth Sin, without Repentance;
nor the wickedneſs of the wicked be mentioned, when
he forſaketh his Sin; but he ſhall ſurely live, though I
formerly ſaid unto him, thou ſhalt ſurely die. GOD,</hi>
who will not be mocked, hath begun to execute
<hi>Judgements</hi> at his <hi>own Houſe,</hi> and we prolong and
increaſe them, by continuing and encreaſing our
Trangreſſions; yea, and not onely by our little
awe of his <hi>Judgements,</hi> but by not rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
his <hi>Love,</hi> and by defect of that <hi>mutual
and hearty love</hi> to each other which moſt eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
denominats us to be <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples; for,
we have thereby multiplyed our ſorrows and
Troubles, more then all our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> could
elſe have done; And, though we had no other
<hi>Oppreſſors</hi> or <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> that alone is ſuffcient
(if it continue) to make us utterly deſtroy our
ſelves. Conſider this, my dear brethren, with
what it hath already brought upon us, that ye
may ſpeedily repent: <hi>GOD</hi> vouchſafe his Grace
to aſſiſt you therein, and to me <hi>Perſeverance</hi>
alſo, in unfeigned <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95680:11"/>
Repent likewiſe, all ye, who ſay in your hearts,
<hi>There is no GOD,</hi> and ſport away your Salvation,
by ſuch horrible Imprecations, as <hi>GOD damn me;</hi>
For, though you not onely think, but ſpeak and
act alſo, as if indeed there was no <hi>GOD,</hi> you will
one day find there is one, and that he hath ſeveral
wayes manifeſted himſelf unto you, both open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in ſecret (by his <hi>Judgements</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi>
upon your ſelves, and others for your example)
though you will not yet acknowledge it, but run
on impudently, into all manner of impietie and
prophaneſs, promiſing unto your ſelves Peace,
when deſtruction hangs over your heads. For, as
the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 49. 12. and 25. 29. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
ſaith the LORD, they whoſe Judgment was
not to drink of the Cup, have already drunk thereof;</hi>
and <hi>ſhall you go unpuniſhed? you ſhall not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed,
but ſhall ſurely drink it. I have begun to
bring evil upon thoſe who are called by my Name, and
ſhall you utterly eſcape puniſhment? you ſhall not eſcape;
for I will bring a ſword upon all the Inhabitants of the
Earth, ſaith the LORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, I will conclude with an <hi>Evangelical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation;</hi>
and that which I ſhall declare unto you
is an Epitome of the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> which
aſcertaineth that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Eternal Mercy</hi>
of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Redeemer of all mankinde</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> the ſame <hi>to day,
yeſterday, and for ever.</hi> This, I am authorized
to Preach unto you by an unqueſtionable <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Commiſſion;</hi> For, I declare it according
to that <hi>Original Commiſſion,</hi> which was given to
all who were or ſhould be the <hi>Miniſterial Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> thereto qualified by the <hi>Gifts</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95680:11"/>
given to men from above, though not Ordained
by men: For, I declare it not by that <hi>Light</hi> alone
which the <hi>Son of GOD</hi> potentially ſet up in me
when he aſſumed the <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> (and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he enlightens in ſome degree every one who
comes into the World, for the Salvation of his
own Soul) but, by having his <hi>Goſpel</hi> declared and
witneſſed alſo unto me by that <hi>Light</hi> in the
<hi>Lanthorn of his Word,</hi> which ought to be a guide to
every mans feet, and the direction of all men in
their wayes, left the other <hi>Light,</hi> being but like
that, which the <hi>Moon</hi> receiveth by reflection
from the <hi>Sun,</hi> may be darkned by the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> or by the deluſions
of the <hi>Devil. GOD's Threatnings,</hi> Mercies, and
<hi>Promiſes,</hi> are all, or for the moſt part, <hi>conditional;</hi>
and <hi>may be,</hi> or <hi>may not be,</hi> according as we demean
our ſelves, when he calleth &amp; offereth his <hi>prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and aſſiſting Grace;</hi> wherein he is never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to perform his part of the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with
<hi>mankinde</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He is <hi>long-ſuffering, ſlow
to Anger, would all men ſhould be ſaved,</hi> and <hi>deſireth
not the death of any ſinner.</hi> There is no end of his
<hi>Mercy,</hi> unleſs to them onely, who wilfully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him firſt (after he ſo ſufficiently rewards the
<hi>Will</hi>) when he ſaith, <hi>Give me thy heart,</hi> which
he may give up unto him, by vertue of the
Talent which he hath received; And, even to
them who then reſiſt his <hi>gracious offer,</hi> he is not
<hi>extreamly ſevere,</hi> until they do (as it were) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
his <hi>Juſtice</hi> to limit his <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> by juſtly
hardening them into a <hi>final Impenitency,</hi> that his

then truſting to his Word, who placed them in a
<hi>happy Condition;</hi> and, when they forfeited it by
their own default, had ſo much compaſſion on

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſo ſtrong a Motive to <hi>Repentance,</hi> that, they with
whom it prevailes not, will be little moved
with Preaching Everlaſting Damnation in Hell
Fire.</p>
               <p>If ye be not ſenſible of this unſpeakable <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
nor of <hi>Spiritual Judgments,</hi> let the ſenſe ye yet
have of thoſe that be <hi>Temporary,</hi> and <hi>Corporeal,</hi>
make entrance for the former into your ſerious
and timely conſideration. Beſide many other
<hi>Plagues</hi> that now lie upon you, <hi>GOD</hi> hath lately
threatned to deprive us of the Fruits of the Earth
for our Trangreſſions; we fear a <hi>Famine;</hi> and it
having already begun to pinch us, we pretended
a <hi>General Humiliation</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> that our
fear might be removed: But, what follows? we
continue ſtill in our unrighteouſneſs and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſs,
proſecuting our former courſes, rather
with more then leſſe violence. The Oppreſſed
are not eaſed, but more oppreſſed. Priſoners
are not ſet free, to whom the Lawes allow Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but, Jayls are daily repleniſhed with new
gueſts, barbarouſly treated, Even harmleſs men
and women ſuffer meerly for their <hi>Conſciences</hi> in
relation to <hi>GOD,</hi> or upon miſinformations and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95680:12"/>
miſpriſions only, unheard, and uncondemned by a
<hi>legal conviction.</hi> Which proceedings are contrary to
the Laws of <hi>GOD,</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and likewiſe of
theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> if they have any in force. For, if the
Complainants ſad cryes, which I hear (and hear of)
be as creditable, as they are lamentable, many honeſt
Families are (and will be) expoſed to beggary, and
even rich men will probably be made beggars alſo.
They are ſhut up from their deareſt <hi>Relations;</hi> and
they themſelves being deſpoiled of all their liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
and of means to ſupply neceſſaries by their
labours, are deſtitute of all accommodations. They
are lodged worſe than doggs, thronged up together
in ſickneſs and in health, nothing left or provided
for them to feed on (except they will eat their own
fleſh) but what GOD providentially conveyes unto
them, by the charity of his Servants; of which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they are ſometimes defrauded by their hard-hearted
Keepers, and that which comes to hand, is
handed-in alſo with much difficulty. Theſe cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are aggravated with many other oppreſſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commitants,
which make them almoſt inexpreſſable
and unſufferable; yea the more unſufferable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that during the Seſſions of <hi>Parliaments</hi> and
<hi>Courts of Justice,</hi> which were wont to be their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Refuge, the Oppreſſed can have no Relief;
and theſe Grievances are kept alſo from the King's
ear, who is their laſt hope next under GOD.</p>
               <p>Let us take heed how we fall into the hands of
the living GOD, when his Wrath is kindled, leſt he
utterly &amp; ſuddenly conſume us, as he did <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah,</hi> for ſhewing ſo little mercy to others, who
have lately received ſuch extraordinary mercies from
him. Learn by <hi>Examples,</hi> though ye have neglected
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95680:13"/>
                  <hi>Precepts,</hi> ſeeing what hath been heretofore, may
be ſo again hereafter, and in regard <hi>Caſes</hi> that have
a reſemblance, will bring down the like <hi>Judgments.</hi>
When <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet was a Priſoner for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
his Conſcience (as I, and many others are
at this day) the <hi>Famine</hi> ſo encreaſed, that there was
no <hi>Bread</hi> then left in the ſtreet of the Bakers at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
It will therefore concern us that we be
wary we continue not in the like ſins, leſt ere long,
there be little <hi>Meal</hi> in our Markets, and a greater
ſcarcity of <hi>Bread</hi> in the ſhops of our <hi>Bakers</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi>
For, as there are among us very great failings,
ſo there are very great appearances of GOD's high
diſpleaſure; who hath more dreadful plagues ready
to execute his Commands, than <hi>Famine, Peſtilence</hi>
and raging <hi>War,</hi> joyned all together; and he will
here inflict that whereof we are moſt ſenſible, and
thoſe hereafter, if we repent not. Conſider this all
ye who forget GOD, and return: for, he is at all
times ready to meet every one in mercy (without
excepting any) who returns unto him by hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
yea, he takes all opportunities whereby
he may ſhew <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> with preſervation of his
<hi>Juſtice;</hi> and is ſo inclinable to <hi>Mercy,</hi> that he oft
withholds his <hi>Judgments</hi> from wicked perſons and
places, for the ſakes of a few <hi>Righteous men</hi> among
them, though they perſecute and ſeek to deſtroy
them for whoſe ſakes they are preſerved; and
vouchſafes <hi>temporal Bleſſings</hi> (as he did to <hi>Ahab</hi>)
for <hi>outſide Humiliations.</hi> He is not, as his Enemies
do ſcandalouſly report of him, a <hi>hard Maſter, who
looks to reap where he ſowed not, and to gather
where he ſtrewed not;</hi> but ſo juſt, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no more at any mans hands, but according to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95680:13"/>
what he hath given; nor puniſh any one for the ſin
of another. There is no better means for us who are
<hi>Subjects,</hi> to live ſafely <hi>in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs
without fear,</hi> than to adhere conſtantly to GOD's
Commands without dread of men, and to obey our
<hi>Superiours</hi> in obedience to the LORD: Nor any
ſurer way for Kings to poſſeſs the Thrones of their
Kingdoms upon Earth, in <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>ſafety,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>jealouſies,</hi> than to provide, as much as in then
lieth, that GOD may poſſeſs his Throne in the
<hi>Hearts and Conſciences of Men</hi> without <hi>Rivals;</hi>
and to endeavour to be <hi>juſt,</hi> as he is <hi>juſt;</hi> and to be
<hi>merciful,</hi> as he is <hi>merciful,</hi> acording to their meaſure:
For, whatſoever the Paraſitical Flatterers of Kings
would make them believe, they may be more ſecure
from dangers at home &amp; abroad, by thoſe poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious
men who are deſpiſed, than with twenty
times ſo many <hi>Ruffians</hi> and <hi>God-damn-me's;</hi> though
aſſiſted alſo by the formal devotions, and fained ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
of <hi>ſuperſtitious worſhippers,</hi> who ſeem glorious
and powerful in outward appearances. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
by what Hiſtories teſtifie, that thoſe great
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Conquerors</hi> of the world, to whom GOD
heretofore tranſlated the Kingdoms of men, from
their former poſſeſſors (when he changed <hi>Governors</hi>
and <hi>Governments</hi>) enjoyed them in <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
ſo long, and ſo far forth, as they tolerated the
Servants of GOD to worſhip Him according to
their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> though they themſelves were
<hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>falſe worſhippers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mercy of GOD leadeth to Repentance, and
extendeth <hi>to</hi> and <hi>over</hi> all his Works. This I am
warranted to proclaim by vertue of his <hi>grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and by his <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> heretofore iſſued-out
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95680:14"/>
for the comfort and encouragement of every <hi>true
penitent Believer</hi> in the days of his <hi>fierceſt Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Theſe are the <hi>glad Tydings</hi> of the <hi>Univerſal
Gospel,</hi> which cauſed the <hi>Angels</hi> to rejoyce and ſing
at the birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> this ſong; <hi>Glory be to
GOD on High, On Earth peace, good will towards
men.</hi> Let us joyn with that <hi>celeſtial Quire</hi> in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
of this <hi>great Mercy</hi> which ſo much concerns
us; for it is our <hi>nobleſt Intereſt,</hi> and that which moſt
advanceth <hi>GoD's Glory:</hi> Let our Burthen to that
Song be, <hi>Amen, Hallelujah,</hi> Praiſe the LORD:
Let us be zealous in defending this <hi>Univerſal Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and not be ſeduced by thoſe who ſeek to abridg
itto ſuch a narrowneſs, and to ſuch an uncertainty,
that if they ſhould be believed, we had more cauſe
to howl and lament than to ſing: This <hi>Gospel</hi> is the
ſum and ſcope of that <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> which was, and is
given by thoſe <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> the two <hi>Olive Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
and <hi>two Candlesticks,</hi> which ſtand before the
God of the Earth, bearing witneſs againſt the <hi>Beaſt</hi>
riſing out of the bottomleſs-Pit, who was to war
upon them, and ſlay them, and leave their Bodies
(as a dead Letter) unburied three dayes and an half
in the Streets of the <hi>great City,</hi> until the Spirit of
Life from GOD ſhould enter into them and make
them aſcend up into Heaven, in the ſight, and to the
amazement and vexation of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>Therefore they, whoſoever they be (though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be of GOD's <hi>Counſel,</hi> and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his <hi>Eternal Decrees</hi>) ſhall preach
contraty hereto, and think they honour GOD by
bounding His <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>infinit Mercy,</hi> deal with
Mankind, concerning His Charter of <hi>General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
as many among us now do concerning the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95680:14"/>
Kings late <hi>Act of Indempnity</hi> and <hi>general Pardon,</hi>
pretending thereby to do him <hi>honour,</hi> where<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> intends
both to his <hi>diſhonour</hi> and <hi>diſſervice.</hi> It is this
miſ-underſtanding, and limiting the <hi>infinit Love</hi> of
GOD, which hath been the chief occaſion of the
<hi>narrowneſs of mens love</hi> to each other; and of much
of that diſcord and bloodſhed which hath been in
the world: For, ſuch as men make their Gods to
be, ſuch will they themſelves be; in regard, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſaith, <hi>They who make them are like unto them.</hi>
This I adde, not impertinently, nor by the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a <hi>contentious ſpirit,</hi> in oppoſition to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others; or with an uncharitable cenſure of
thoſe who do yet think otherwiſe; But I have thus
in my <hi>mode</hi> preached it, in zeal to <hi>GOD's Truth</hi>
and <hi>Glory;</hi> who ſees my heart, and will puniſh me
for it, if it proceed from any other cauſe. He is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>merciful;</hi> ſo <hi>merciful</hi> in his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and ſo
<hi>juſt</hi> in his <hi>Mercy,</hi> that neither of them infringes the
other; and hath left us upon record two unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
<hi>exemplary Evidences,</hi> which manifeſt that
his <hi>Mercy</hi> is ſincerely intended to every true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
to be his Conſolation when <hi>Judgements</hi> are
epidemical and univerſal: For, though he ſpared
not the <hi>old world,</hi> but brought a general flood upon
all the ungodly, yet, he even then ſpared <hi>Noah</hi> and
his family; and when he made the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> an example to wilfull tranſgreſſors,
he then alſo ſpared <hi>Lot</hi> who lived among them, and
whoſe righteous ſoul they had vexed with their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and wicked converſation. Thus will he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
deal with all thoſe, in all times, who have
an upright and contrite heart (though they have
been grievous offenders) ſo far forth as it ſhall be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95680:15"/>
for his Glory, and their eternal happineſs.</p>

GOD, who is pleaſed in theſe dayes to preach
<hi>Mercy</hi> by his moſt contemned Servants; and cauſe
them otherwhile to act in ſuch <hi>Modes,</hi> and by ſuch
<hi>Dispenſations,</hi> as to the world ſeem ridiculous; and
as probably he did (in moſt mens eyes) when his
<hi>beloved Son</hi> rode meekly through <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> on
the foal of an Aſs, at the time wherein he firſt came
to take a viſible poſſeſſion of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> upon
Earth: which humble <hi>deportment</hi> his now preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>General Vicar,</hi> and the proud <hi>Kings</hi> of the
Earth, would have ſcorned upon the dayes of their
<hi>Inauguration.</hi> Which the <hi>Prelats,</hi> though raiſed out
of the loweſt of the people (as <hi>Jeroboams</hi> prieſts were)
and though pretending to be the ſucceſſors of <hi>Chriſts</hi>
humble <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> would have diſdained to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in that meek manner to their <hi>Inſtalments.</hi> But
many other things appearing contemptible to fleſh

they ſcoff at, who ſit in the <hi>Chair of the Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>

And, they whom <hi>Threatnings</hi> cannot work upon,</l>

               <l>And then, come what come will, I nothing fear.</l>
