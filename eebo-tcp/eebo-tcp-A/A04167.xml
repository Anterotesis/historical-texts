         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the saying of a <hi>Roman
Senator,</hi> who thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
well seene in matters of
State, <hi>Parvi sunt arma foris,
nisi sit consilium domi;</hi> Armes
are of little availe abroad,
without a wise Councell at
home, to give them instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but the <hi>wise King,</hi> part of whose words these
of my text are, saw a great way farther and layes
his foundation much deeper, <hi>parvi sunt arma foris,


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7862:5"/>
parvi consilium domi, nisi sint preces in Templo;</hi>
Councell of State or Councell of warre, armes at
home, or armies sent abroad by their directions,
with their best instructions, adde little to the securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and safety of State and Kingdome, without
prayers in the Church, or house of God. And for
this reason although he had now erected a goodly
<hi>Temple,</hi> with as Princely and cheerfull a heart as his
Father <hi>David</hi> had built an <hi>Altar,</hi> unto the name and
honour of the God of Israel, yet he thought it no
Sacrilege, no robbery at all to intend a publique and
perpetuall benifite to the State and Kingdome,
from this glorious worke. So compatible are <hi>Royall
intentions of Gods honour,</hi> with desires of Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
temporall upon the people committed to their
charge, that this wise <hi>King</hi> (even whilst he dedicates
this great house unto his God, for a peculiar habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherein he would be pleased to place his name)
yet consecrated withall as a <hi>Sanctuary, for every af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
soule,</hi> to be more then an <hi>Arsenall for warre</hi>
as a <hi>Magazine of medicines</hi> and remedies for all
manner of wounds, or diseases incident to the
body publique.</p>
                  <p>2 God had given this young King a large ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of <hi>Princely wisdome,</hi> and the <hi>spirit of government</hi>
in an extraordinarie manner; and of this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
wisdome and spirit one speciall part it was to
know that it was not in the power of man, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compasse of any wisdome (though participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from aboue) to direct his owne wayes, much lesse
the wayes of others aright, least of all to give suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to their best directions. As the skill of Pylots is


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7862:5"/>
best knowne in a storme, or dangerous passage: so
is the wisdome of Rulers best tried in perplexity, or
distresse. The best proofe or triall which <hi>Solomon</hi>
could give of his wisdome in this case, was the
knowledge to frame his petitions aright to the <hi>God
of wisdome</hi> and <hi>Lord of Hosts.</hi> This whole Chapter is
no other then an <hi>Anatomy Lecture</hi> of the diseases
and wounds of Kingdomes and Common-weales,
publiquely read by <hi>Solomon</hi> for the instruction of
Princes and Rulers that should come after him. It is
the <hi>glory of a King,</hi> as this King elsewhere obserues,
<hi>to finde out a secret,</hi> and to punish iniquity when it is
found out, (though committed in secret:) and to
render to every man according to the equity of his
cause, being made knowne, is the duty of a Iudge:
but in as much as many controversies of right and
wrong, must be determined by oath, if men will be
so destitute of the feare of God, as to sweare falsly;
or to contrive their owne gaine and others harmes
by perjury, what Iudge can help? what Prince can
remedy men by this meanes distressed? Yet <hi>Solomon</hi>
begins at this inward sore, or secret corruption,
the remedy he seekes from the searcher of mens
thoughts and hearts. So he prayes 2. <hi>Chron. 6. 22. 23.
If a man Sinne against his Neighbour, and an oath be
layed upon him to make him sweare, and the oath come
before thine Altar in this house. Then heare thou from
Heaven, and doe and Iudge thy servants by requiting
the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his owne
head and by iustifying the righteous, by giving him
according to his righteousnes.</hi> To recompense the
wayes of this wicked man upon his owne head is


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7862:6"/>
one of the mercies which in conclusion he besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
the Lord to shew unto his people, for <hi>crudele
est hîc misericordem esse.</hi> Though mercy be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
good, yet the better it is, the worse it is placed
upon such pestilent members. As great a cruelty to
shew pitty upon the perjur'd, as to pamper or che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
any joynt or member of the body, wherein the
<hi>Gangrene</hi> or other deadly spreading sore hath got
possession or roote. From this internall imbred cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
he proceeds unto more publique and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
wounds, or diseases usually made by causes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
as when <hi>Israel</hi> shalbe <hi>overthrowne before
their enemies. v.</hi> 25. When the <hi>heavens shall be shut
up,</hi> and the earth be <hi>without raine. v.</hi> 26. When there
shalbe <hi>Famine, Pestilence, mildew, Grashoppers</hi> or
<hi>Caterpillers.</hi> When the <hi>enemy</hi> shall <hi>besiege thee in the
Cities.</hi> When they shalbe afflicted by any <hi>Plague</hi> or
<hi>sicknesse. v.</hi> 28. The soveraigne remedy for all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of these and the like is the very same, and it
is this <hi>v. 20. 21. Then heare thou from heaven, from
thy dwelling place their prayer and their supplications
and maintaine their cause, and forgive thy people which
haue sinned against thee. v.</hi> 29. But what if this people
should be led captive into a foraigne land not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to repaire unto this <hi>house where the Lord had
placed his name?</hi> This <hi>Solomon</hi> foresaw as a matter
not impossible, how ample soever his promises unto
his <hi>father David</hi> and his seed might in ordinary
construction seeme to be: is there any possible salve
for this possible fore? or can this house (which he
had consecrated to be an house of prayer) afford
them in this case any remedy, when they could not


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7862:6"/>
come to pray in it? yes, the remedy is prescrib'd, <hi>v.
38. 39. If they returne to thee with all their heart and
with all their soule, in the land of their captivity, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they haue caryed them captives, and pray toward
their land which thou gavest unto their fathers, and
towards the city, which thou hast chosen, and towards
the house, which I have built for thy name: Then heare
thou from heaven &amp;c.</hi> Soe then both <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
were to <hi>pray in this house,</hi> whilst they possest this
land and city wherein it stood; to <hi>pray towards it</hi>
when they soiourned in forraigne Coasts, or were
detained in the land of their captivity; to pray <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the place wherein</hi> it had stood, in case it should
be demolished. So did <hi>Daniel,</hi> after this house,
which <hi>Solomon</hi> built, was burnt to the ground.</p>
                  <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>prerogatives</hi> which he petitions might be
bestowed upon this <hi>house of prayer,</hi> were, you see, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great. Was it then any part of his intention
in the suite, or of Gods purpose in the grant, to have
this house endowed with such ample priviledges,
for the use or benefit of <hi>Israel</hi> only, or of <hi>Abrahams
seede</hi> according to the flesh? surely <hi>Solomon</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his prayers out of a perfect and speciall faith,
yet the specialty of his faith in Gods promises made
unto <hi>Israell,</hi> or to <hi>Abrahams seede,</hi> did no way extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
his charity, or abate his good affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards
others, for he expressely consecrates his house to
be an <hi>house of prayer,</hi> for the use &amp; benefit of all the
nations under heaven, though in the first place for
Israel. <hi>Moreover as touching the stranger which is not
of thy people Israel, but is come from a farre country,
for thy great names sake, and thy mighty hand and thy


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7862:7"/>
streched out arme, if they come and pray in this house,
then heare thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling
place and doe according to all that the stranger cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
to thee for, that all people of the earth may know thy
name and feare thee, as doth thy people Israell, and may
know that this house which I haue built is called by
thy name.</hi> 32. 33. He knew the gracious goodnesse
of his God to be in it selfe so great, so truly infinite,
that it could not be a whit lessoned towards Israell
how farre soever it were extended towards others,
as it is extended to all men without exception, <hi>insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su
divise,</hi> though not <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> it is thus far
extended unto all, to the end that they might come
to the knowledge of the truth, but not extended, not
communicated to such as love darknesse better then
light, and falshood then truth. It was then well with
<hi>Israell,</hi> when their charity towards others was like
their heavenly fathers love, without factious partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or respect of persons. It was their seeking to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse
Gods promised blessings unto mankind</hi> which
twice brought that greivous curse upon them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which at this day they sigh and groane. Now
if all the nations on earth had this interest in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Temple,</hi> shall we deny any one of what Nation
soever the like interest in <hi>Abrahams seed,</hi> concerning
whom the Lord had sworne that in him should all
the nations of the earth be blessed? Thus much of
the generall scope or view of this Chap: to retire
my selfe unto my text, which is as the center or fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Angle, for taking the exact survey of this long
and fruitfull field.</p>
                  <p>4 To give you then a briefe comprehension of the


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7862:7"/>
principallest and most fundamentall truths, either
directly incident into, or naturall emergent out of it,</p>
                  <p>First it is taken as granted, by <hi>Solomon</hi> and it is to
us a point of faith, that as well the <hi>Calamities</hi> as the
<hi>Prosperities of states and kingdomes are from the
Lord;</hi> It is he that giveth life as well to bodyes poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
as to naturall. It is he that woundeth, and it is
he that maketh whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, no</hi> Calamity or wounds of state are in
their nature incurable, if this remedy be sought in
time; <hi>they grow</hi> incurable only <hi>by neglect of the
medicines in Gods word prescribed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the only Soveraigne remedy for restoring
states and kingdomes diseased and wounded by the
hand of God unto their perfect health, is prayer and
Supplications to the King of Kings.</p>
                  <p>The last must be the <hi>conditions of the prayers,</hi> or
<hi>qualification of the Supplicants,</hi> by whom such
prayers as may prevaile with God must be made.
Vpon this point <hi>Solomon</hi> often toucheth in severall
passages of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Such of the <hi>heathens</hi> as were alwayes ready to
sacrifice unto their owne right armes for victory
inbattle, and unto their owne wit in policy, for the
sweet fruits of peace, did often observe certaine sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plusses
of successe, good, or bad, which they could
not account to be the naturall issue, either of their
industry, or contrivance; and whatsoever fell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the mould of their hopes or feares, was attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>fates,</hi> if it were disastrous: to <hi>fortune,</hi> or <hi>chance,</hi>
if it were good; now whatsoever the <hi>heathens</hi> did
ascribe to <hi>fortune,</hi> to <hi>chance</hi> or <hi>fate,</hi> or to any other


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7862:8"/>
supposed <hi>guide of nature</hi> or <hi>intermedling power in
humane affaires</hi> all these the <hi>wise king</hi> ascribes who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto his <hi>God,</hi> he is the God of peace, and yet
the God that maketh warre, the Lord of hostes, the
God of plenty, and yet the God that sendeth scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The God of our health, and life, and yet it is
he which punisheth with plague and sicknesses. Nor
are we bound only to derive all extraordinary suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
(which the <hi>heathen</hi> gave to <hi>fortune</hi> and <hi>fate)</hi>
but ever even the usuall <hi>successe of ordinary endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
(be it good or bad) from his <hi>providence.</hi> That
the heathens did ascribe <hi>ordinary</hi> successe, (if it were
good) unto themselves, (if it were ill) unto their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
or opposites, this was their <hi>Atheisme</hi> or <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion.</hi>
That they ascribed extraordinary calamity,
unto <hi>fate</hi> or chance was their <hi>superstition.</hi> Vnto both
these extreames true religion is alike opposite, and
for this reason must ascribe all successe ordinary or
extraordinary, good or bad, unto him, who is a
God as well of wisdome as of power, as well of
peace as of warre. The <hi>Egyptian Magitians</hi> were
enforced to say of some miracles wrought by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Hic digitus Dei est,</hi> the finger of God is in this.
But if we looke on Gods workes, or our owne with
the eyes of faith, the point of his hand is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous,
or more full in matters of ordinary passe
or in the usuall course of nature, then in some rare
miracles. If the sunne should now stand still in its
sphere, as in the dayes of <hi>Iosuah</hi> it did, the world
would be ready to say this is the hand of God, yet it
is more impossible that it should move without
Gods power then stand still without it, whilest it


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7862:8"/>
stood still it was partaker only of his <hi>power sustenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi>
but deprived of his <hi>power motiue</hi> or <hi>cooperatiue,</hi>
move it cannot without the cooperation of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
power, nor could it continue moueable, though
without motion, for a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of time, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of his creatiue, and preserving power; and
thus in the continuance of ordinary successe or bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
upon mans endeavours, there is oftimes a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concurrence of divine communicatiue power,
then is requir'd unto successe extraordinary. For the
mere substraction of his vsuall cooperation or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
from us, or from such as oppose us, makes
the successe of the one, or other to be extraordinary,
and yet so blind and stupid are we for the most part,
that we take small notice of his ordinary presence
by his wisdome, power, and providence, without
some interpositions of extraordinary successe, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
occurrences, or interruption of the ordinary
course of time, and nature,</p>
                  <p>Did the body of the sunne alway move beyond
her <hi>Horizon,</hi> in such difference from it, as to leaue
no evident distinction betweene light and darknesse,
we should hardly know, how much our eyes are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to it for the use of its light: many happly
will be perswaded, that the light to their eyes were
sufficient to see withall: God who is the light and
life of the world, by whose participation the best
faculties of men performe their proper functions,
(as the eye doth its function by the bodily light of
he Sunne) is in his nature invisible; and hence it is,
that few conceive what intire dependance they have
on him in all their actions, and consultations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7862:9"/>
it please him sometimes to withdraw his gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
or assistance from him; nor need wee to deny,
or question the proper efficacy of any visible or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
causes, albeit we ascribe all successe, as well
ordinary as extraordinary, good or bad, unto the
same God. The matter of most soueraigne bodily
medicines is oftimes gathered from the patients
gardens: the Phisition infuseth no new quality, or
hidden virtue into the simples, or ingredients, yet,
inasmuch as he tempers and compounds them, and
appoints in what measure and season his receipt
shoud be taken, the recovery of health (though
wrought by the efficacy of the medicine) is wholy
ascrib'd to the Phisitians skil, not shared betwixt it,
and the naturall qualities of the medicine. Admit
of a thousand fighting men, no one mans strength
or courage were abated before the day of battle, yet
if every one then might be permitted to fight (as we
say) on his owne head, to come on, and off, at his
owne likeing, the multiplication of their severall
strength, without a guiding or directing power,
might harme themselves, more then their enemies,
so that we might truely say, that albeit our army
consists of common souldiers, as well as of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
yet the strength of an Army consists not
in the strength of limbes, but in the skill and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of their Commanders, and in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of good orders and discipline. Now beside
the especiall dependance which every particular
creature hath on the Creators power, in all his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
attempts or actions, which is such, as no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
in any medicine hath on the Physition; such


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7862:9"/>
as no souldier hath on his Commander; the whole
host of creatures, whether sublunary or Celestiall,
whether reasonable or reasonlesse, whether animate
or without life, is more subordinate to the direction
and guidance of the Divine wisdome and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
then any inferiour can be, to his lawfull, most
powerfull, and most esteem'd superiour. Though
God doth not alwayes worke alone, but every
creature workes in him, and by him in its kind, yet
he alone apoints the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>oportunity</hi>
of their workings, he alone apoints the <hi>issue,</hi> which
they finally bring forth, he alone doth limit the
<hi>number of coworking causes</hi> or of <hi>agents conspiring</hi>
for the effecting of the end designed by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
whence, though in the greatest atchievements
joyntly undertaken by man, every man might
know his owne and every others strength, his owne
and every others projects, which are confederats or
coworkers with him, though every one could know
all the preparation, which they severally, or joyntly
make, what the determinate force, or efficacy of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
instrumentall cause, whose help they use; yet is
it never possible, for them to know what other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or agents the wisdome of God may designe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hinder them, or to further their enemies in
their counterplots. So that all prosperity or calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any nation, visibily inflicted by secondary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
or agents, is justly ascribed unto the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
justice and providence of God. <hi>Can a bird fall
in a snare (saith the Prophet Amos cap. 3. v. 5.) upon
the earth where no ginne is for him?</hi> or <hi>shall there bee
evill in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Men


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7862:10"/>
he supposeth are as unwilling to be overtaken with
the evill here meant, with <hi>malum poenae,</hi> with calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or disaster, as <hi>birds</hi> are to be caught in a snare.
<hi>Calamity</hi> then is the <hi>snare</hi> whereinto men by Gods
appointment fall, and their owne <hi>proiects</hi> and <hi>devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
are the <hi>strings</hi> which draw this <hi>net</hi> upon them,
when these are contrary to the Councell of the
Lord, and if there be no evill of calamity, or disaster
in any city, which is not the Lords doing, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
the good which is contrary to this evill, all
the safty, welfaire, and prosperity of any nation, is
from the Lord, is the worke of his hande.</p>
                  <p>Ignorance, or want of beleife of this point, was
one speciall cause of the miseries which befell the
<hi>Christian Nations,</hi> by the inundation of the <hi>Gothes</hi>
and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> and other barbarous people, so a sweet
and learned writer of those times complaines, <hi>Si
quando enim nobis prosperi aliquid praeter spem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; meritum, Deus tribuit, alius ascribit hoc fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,
alius eventui, alius ordinationi ducum, alius consilio
alius magistro, alius patrocinio, nullus Deo; &amp; miramur
si nobis coelestis manus non praestet, cui quicquid praesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit
derogamus.</hi> If God at any time give prosperous
successe to our proceedings beyond our hope and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
on ascribes this to fortune, another to good hope
or chance, none to God. We may conclude this point
with the <hi>Psalmists</hi> testimony, <hi>Except the Lord build
the house, they labour in vaine that build it. Except the
Lord keepe the City the watchman waketh but in vaine,
Psal.</hi> 127. 1. We shall no way pervert his words, if
we thus invert or extend their sence. Except the
Lord be purposed to ruinate the house, they labour


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7862:10"/>
in vaine that seeke to ruinate it, except the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
up the city into their hands, they that beseige
it, beseige it in vaine, and if all endeavours without
his <hi>ratification</hi> of them be vaine, then it is he that
doth all in all; it is he, not the aire, elements, or hoste
of heaven, that bringeth scarcity, famine, or pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon the land, it is he, not the enemy, which
wounds, or weakens any state or kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But if all calamity be inflicted by his hand, who
can take off what he hath laid on, who can heale
where the great Physitian himselfe hath wounded?
But the question is not, what man can doe when any
calamity befals him, but rather what he which can
doe all things, will have man to doe for himselfe.
Now it is not his will that we should in this case sit
downe and doe nothing. The ascribing of all the
successe of our labours unto him, doth teach us
only to abandon all reliance upon our owne endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
or consultations, not the consultations or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
themselves; It should be the first and last
of all our endeavours, carefully to consecrate all
our consultations and enterprises unto him who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is able to give a blessing unto them. It is most
true, all our <hi>strength</hi> is but <hi>weaknesse</hi> in respect of
him, yet true with this exception, unlesse we rely
upon <hi>his strength;</hi> It is true, <hi>mans wisdome</hi> is but <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and yet true againe, that our <hi>wisdome</hi> becomes
more then <hi>mans wisdome</hi> by relying upon his <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
with the strength of our hearts and affections;
Now for the strengthening of our reliance upon his
wisdome, strength, and providence, and for conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
our endeavours aright, two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7862:11"/>
1. <hi>the right information of our understanding
in point of Doctrine, 2. sincerity of practise, answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the right information of our understanding.</hi>
The first and generall part of Doctrine is the second
point proposed, <hi>that noe calamity or wound in state,
though inflicted by the immediate hand of God, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
incurable, if the remedy be sought in time.</hi>
This point of Doctrine is grounded upon another
speciall principle of faith, to wit, that <hi>our gracious
God</hi> in his <hi>severest punishments is a most just judge,</hi>
he doth not immediately delight in the exercises of
punitive justice, as he doth in the exercises of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
mercies, and loving kindnesses. He bestowes
his blessings of prosperity freely, and for his owne
names sake, not for our sakes or deservings. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
plagueth any nation meerly for his owne names
sake, or of his owne accord, but as provoked by their
ill deservings. <hi>Deus non priui est ultor quam homo pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator.</hi>
God never proceeds to revenge, before man
hath done him manifest wrong. <hi>Poena semper se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur
culpam.</hi> Punishment never hath precedency
of offences, but alwayes followes them, and for the
most part in great distance. This truth or principle
of faith is expressly supposed by the wise King in
this <hi>Chap. v. 24. and if thy people Israel be put to the
worse before their enemy, because they have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee.</hi> This inferres that they should not be
punished with so much as losse of victory; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate
unlesse they had first sinned against their God,
and againe <hi>v. 26. when the heaven is shut up, and there
is no raine, because they have sinned against thee.</hi> This
teacheth us the truth of that which an ancient father


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7862:11"/>
hath, <hi>nos mutamus naturam rerum,</hi> we <hi>exchange the
nature of the creature,</hi> and divert the sweet influence
of heaven from our selves by changing from better
to worse, and by our turning from God. <hi>Quid ergo?

with the Christians of his time, which had beene
often overcome, and long prest by barbarous and
hereticall nations. But why doe we complaine that
our punishment is bitter and grievous, seeing every
one of us doth punish himselfe? But here happly
some will make that objection against the former
point, which <hi>Salvian</hi> makes against himselfe by
way of prevention, if all punishment or calamity be
from God, how are we said to punish our selues?
His answere is very satisfactory, <hi>Vtrum<expan>

Lib. 8. Num.</hi> 264. Both are true, we are punished by
God, but tis our owne doing, that we are punished.
The manner and order by which mankind fall into
extreamity of punishment, whether temporall or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting,
that he collects out of that saying of the
Prophet <hi>Esay. Chap. 50. v.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>good father</hi> albeit he lived in the miserable
times, wherein the visible feature of Christs
Church and of Christendome was much defaced
by the wounds and scars which had beene given by
barbarous hands, yet was herein happy, that he
might freely avouch the unspeakable mercies of
God, and extend his unfeigned love to all, (even to
those which perished in their sinnes) without cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of heresie or persecution, by men of his owne


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7862:12"/>
profession; It was no scruple to his tender conscience
to averre, nor was the often averring it any imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto him for many generations, that <hi>God did
punish us, invitus, against his will,</hi> but he was willing
to heale the wounds which he had made, that men
did <hi>constraine him</hi> to continue, or increase his
plagues, when he was otherwise ready to take off
his punishing hand.</p>
                  <p>But some in latter yeares question (and would to
God they did but question) whether <hi>punitive iustice
be as direct an effect of Gods primary will, or as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
intended by him in respect of some men, as the
exercise of bounty and mercy toward others.</hi> But if
this Doctrine were positively determined, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
which befall most states and kingdomes
would be more incurable, and all endeavours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
lesse available, then is behoofefull for
them to beleeve they are. Howbeit some passages
of sacred writ therebe, which either naturally run,
or have beene drawne this way, as if <hi>punitive iustice</hi>
were the <hi>marke</hi> or <hi>ayme</hi> of meanes offered by God,
for so that place and the <hi>Apostle Rom. 1. 20. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
things of him from the creation of the world
are cleerly seene, to the intent that they should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excuse.</hi> But this expression of the originall is
worthily corrected by the latter English. <hi>God did ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifest
himselfe in his works so faire, that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excuse.</hi> And though the speech be for its forme
indifferent, or aequipendent, yet the matter doth
necessarily sway it from the former to this latter
sense. For if God had manifested himselfe unto them
them to no other intent that they might be without


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7862:12"/>
excuse, they had a better excuse in readinesse then
any of the reprobate or damned shall finde, at the
day of Iudgement. None of them shall be then able
to deny either the <hi>receipt of a talent,</hi> or the receipt of
it to some better intent or end, then to leave them
without excuse. They are therefore without excuse
because they have <hi>hid their talents,</hi> and doe not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them to the use or end intended by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
But more particularly the calamities or plagues
which befell the Iewish nation may seeme incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from the words of our Saviour <hi>Mat. 23. 34. 35.
Behold I send unto you Prophets and wise men and
scribes, and some of them ye shall kill and crucify, and
some of them ye shall scourgein the Synagogues, and
persecute from City to City. That upon you may come
all the righteous bloud shed upon the earth, from the
bloud of righteous Abell, unto the bloud of Zacharias
sonne of Barachias, whom yee slew betweene the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and the Altar.</hi> Did the wisdome of God then
send Prophets and wisemen unto their forefathers,
or did he come to this generation in person himselfe,
to this intent, or end, that all the righteous bloud
which had beene shed upon the earth, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them? For thus interpreting this place
the originall phrase affords a pretence, somewhat
fayrer then can be brought for the former Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of S. Paul, <hi>Vt super vos veniat:</hi> yet every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

only true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast

said <hi>te cognoscere,</hi> to know thee to be the only God,
and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent, is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
Give these words of our Saviour in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
of S. Iohn leave to interpret his forecited words
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and their meaning will be in plaine Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
thus much and no more, some of them you
will crucify, and some of them you will scourge,
and persecute so long, untill the bloud of all the
righteous, shed upon the earth will come upon you.
The true reason why the bloud of Gods Prophets
was to be required of this generation was because
God had continually sent them unto them from
time to time, out of his mercy and compassion, that
they might be healed: So saith the Scripture, 2.
<hi>Chron. 36. 15. And the Lord God of their fathers sent
to them by his messengers rising up betimes and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
because he had compassion on his people and on his
dwelling place. But they mocked the messengers of
God, and despised his word, and misused his Prophets,
untill the wrath of the Lord rose against his people,
untill there was no remedy.</hi> That which made their
calamities remediles, or as the originall hath it <hi>incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
was their continuall <hi>mocking</hi> or <hi>despising the
messengers of their peace,</hi> which God from time to
time had sent to heale them: So that all the calamity
which ensued was not the end intended by God in
sending his messengers unto them, but the issue of
their <hi>mocking</hi> &amp; <hi>despising</hi> both <hi>Physitions</hi> and <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</hi>
They are the cause of their incurable wounds,
yet was it God that did inflict them; for so it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7862:13"/>
                     <hi>v. 17. 18. Therefore he brought upon them the
King of the Caldeans, who slew their young men in the
house of their Sanctuary, and had no compassion upon
young man, maiden, or old man, or him that stooped for
age. He gave them all into his hand; and all the vessels
of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures
of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the King
and his Princes. All these he brought to Babilon, and
they burnt the house of the Lord and brake downe the
wals of Ierusalem, and burnt all the pallaces thereof
with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this masse of misery fell upon the people of
God, for whose prosperity Solomon here prayes;
all the desolation here mentioned light on this
house which he now consecrates to be the house of
prayer. All this and more became inevitable in the
issue, but so it was not from the time that Ieremy
began to prophecy, to foretell, and forethreaten it
by expresse revelation from the Lord of heaven.
One speciall meanes by which this misery became
inevitable, was that erroneous opinion or conceit
wherewith most of this people were possessed, to
wit that their calamity or prosperity was fatall; that
all things were so predeterminated by God; that
nothing could fall out otherwise then it did; that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing was absolutely necessary, in respect of
Gods decree. This was the symptome of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
disease, for whose cure <hi>Ieremy</hi> was sent to
the potters house there to receive that instruction
from the Lord, of which we read <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
point of time wherein their disease (whether in
whole or part) became incurable, wee leave with all


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7862:14"/>
reverence unto him who hath reserv'd the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of times and seasons (as a speciall prerogative
of his power) unto himselfe. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 7. Yet thus much
he hath revealed unto us, that every part of this
calamity did not become inevitable at one and the
same time: the state of prince and people became
more dangerous then it had beene, (as it were a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
recovering strength from a relapse) by their
shuffling with God, after they had made a covenant
with him, for freeing their servants according to the
tenour of his law in that case provided. This breach
of covenant <hi>Ieremy</hi> foretels in thundring tearmes,
would prove the cause of greater calamity then
he before had threatned, <hi>And yee were now turned
and had done right in my sight in proclaming liberty
every one to his neighbour. But yee turned and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my name, and caused every man his servant, and his
handmaid whom yee had set at liberty at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to returne, and brought them into subiection to
be unto them for servants and handmaids. Therefore
(saith the Lord) because yee have not hearkned unto me
in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and to
neighbour, behold I proclaime a liberty to you, saith
the Lord to the sword, pestilence and famine, and I will
make you to be removed unto all the kingdomes of the
earth. Ierem. 34. v.</hi> 15. 16. 17. and <hi>v. 21. 22. And Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechiah
King of Iudah and his princes will I give into
the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them
that seeke their life; and into the hand of the King of
Babilons armie, which are gone up from you. Behold I
will command (saith the Lord) and cause them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to this city, and they shall fight against it and


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7862:14"/>
take it and burne it with fire, and I will make the city
of Iudah a desolation without an inhabitant.</hi> Yet was
not this sentence, though thus uttered with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as yet altogether unchangeable, much lesse
was this peoples safety <hi>peremptorily decreed by God,</hi>
as their false Prophets misperswaded them. This
errour concerning the tenour of Gods decree or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
being planted in them, the Egiptians expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
against the <hi>Caldean</hi> armie for <hi>Ierusalems</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
might with faire applause be pretended, as a
meane ordained by God for effecting their safety.
To quell this their vaine confidence in the strength
of Egipt the Prophet reavoucheth his former mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
with some additions, <hi>Ier. 37. 7. 8. 9. This saith
the Lord God of Israel, thus shall ye say to the King
of Iudah that sent you unto me to enquire of me. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Pharaohs army which is come forth to helpe you,
shall returne to Egipt into their own land, and the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans
shall come againe and fight against the city, and
take it and burne it with fire; thus saith the Lord, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not your selves saying the Caldeans shall surely
depart from us, for they shall not depart. For though
yee had smitten the whole armie of Caldeans that
fight against you, and there remained but wounded men
among them, yet should they rise up every man in his
tent and burne this city with fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet was not the event here foretold at this time
altogether inevitable, but <hi>inevitable only upon their
refusall to obey the Prophets counsell,</hi> for after this
time the same Prophet shews King <hi>Zedechiah</hi> a way
or meane ordained by God, which if he had follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
a great part of this calamity so peremptorily


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7862:15"/>
denounced might have beene avoided <hi>Ierem. 38. 17.
Then said Ieremiah unto Zedechiah, thus saith the
Lord God of Israel, if thou wilt assurely goe forth unto
the King of Babilon, then thy soule shall live, and this
city shall not be burnt with fire, and thou shalt live
and thine house. But if thou wilt not goe forth to the
King of Babilons Princes, then shall this city be given
into the hands of the Caldeans and they shall burne it
with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hands.</hi>
This was the last warning which he was to expect
from God, by his Prophet, for his peace. But not
hearkning unto his voice, whilst it was called to
day, but seeking to escape the Iudgements denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by flight, he inevitably brought them upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
upon his Princes, upon the temple, in a greater
measure, especially as they concerned himselfe and
his house, then they had beene threatned. When the
<hi>Caldean</hi> Princes entred the city, <hi>Zedechiah</hi> and the
men of warre fled out of the city by night, but the
Caldeans hoste pursued after them, and overtooke
<hi>Zedechiah</hi> in the desert of <hi>Iericho</hi> and brought him
to <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> King of <hi>Babell,</hi> unto <hi>Riblah</hi>
where he slew the sons of <hi>Zedechiah</hi> before his eies,
and all the nobles of <hi>Iudah,</hi> (a lamentable farewell to
the sence of sight and liberty) for immediatly after
he put out <hi>Zedechiahs</hi> eyes, and put him in chaines,
to cary him to Babilon. <hi>v.</hi> 7. Thus have you heard
how <hi>Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> came to a lamentable &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
end by diseases in their nature not incurable,
but made such by their own wilfulnesse, in not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the voice of Gods Prophets. Did then the
wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of God who out of compassion sent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7862:15"/>
unto them, whilst the first temple stood come
in person himselfe to increase the misery of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
with whom he converst here on earth, or
to destroy the second temple with a more fearefull
destruction then had befallen the first? That this
generation became a prey in the issue to the Roman
vultures, was not from want of good will in him to
gather them, but from their unwillingnesse to be
gathered under his wings; witnesse himselfe <hi>Mat.
23. 37. Ierusalem, Ierusalem &amp;c.</hi> But did he speake
this as God or as man? a captious question. What
if I should say that it was <hi>vox humana</hi> and yet <hi>vox
Dei, the voice of God uttered by man,</hi> the very perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
voice of the sonne of God, as S. Luke testifies,
<hi>He spake as never man spake,</hi> and was so affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> as never man was affected. The
Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> after he had seene that tragedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
acted which he had represented in words, did
wish his head had beene a fountaine of teares that
hee might weepe day and night, for the slain of his
people. The wisdome and sonne of God became a
more sorrowfull spectatour of a second tragedy of
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> not as yet within forty yeares probability
to be acted: when he came neare saith <hi>S. Luke 19.
41.</hi> he beheld the city and wept for it, saying, <hi>Oh if
thou had'st even knowne at the least in this day those
things which belong unto thy peace, but now are they
hid from thine eyes.</hi> These his teares though he
wept as man, were a visible expression of his divine
inexpressible love toward <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and her inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
after they had deserved this ill at his hands
stifly bent to deserve much worse. As yet it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7862:16"/>
to day, but this was a criticall day, and full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
howbeit <hi>Ierusalems</hi> sin was not sealed up untill
the signe of the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> was expired. After his
Resurection from the dead <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had yet forty
dayes for repentance, as <hi>Nineveh</hi> had (for so long
our Saviour remained here on earth) but <hi>Ierusalems</hi>
Children not repenting within that time, as <hi>Nineveh</hi>
did, their estate became as desperate as their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
fore-Fathers had been in the wildernes, they
were to wander forty yeares in the wildernesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any of them could enter into the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
and as many as were aboue twenty yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cut off by oaths from all hopes or possibilities
of entring in at all. This generation, whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
here forwarnes, were to continue in it forty
yeares, which being expired, they and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
haue beene exterminated and banished from it
for almost forty times forty yeares. During the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeares wherein they were permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in it their estate was no lesse miserable then
their fore-Fathers had beene in the wildernesse.
There dyed in the wildernesse almost six hundred
thousand men; of this latter generation well nigh
twice as many within the same compasse of time
did die more miserably, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> being first made
their prison, afterwards their grave, first an heape
of carkasses, and then a heape of stones. Now seeing,
as our Apostle, saith these <hi>Iewes</hi> did not stumble to
the end that they should fall, but rather that by
their fall salvation might come unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> let
us beseech our gratious God, that from <hi>Ierusalems</hi>
ruine we may in time <hi>and whilst it is called to day,</hi>


                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:7862:16"/>
seeke the edification of his Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Roote out, good Lord we beseech thee, all
<hi>Iewish affections</hi> and <hi>Iewish opinions</hi> out of the hearts
of thy people, that so our prayers and supplications
for the prosperity of thine inheritance and thine
Anointed, may be ever acceptable in thy
sight, O Lord our strength, and
our Redeemer. AMEN.</p>

                  <head>THE
SECOND SERMON
VPON 
2. CHRON. 6. 39. 40.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the second generall
proposed, two points there be
which require discussion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;
The first, whether this
petition which <hi>Solomon</hi> here
preferreth to the King of Kings,
were granted according to his
desires.</p>
                  <p>The second, how farre the grant made to him, or
how farre the practices or experiments answerable
to his petition, during the time that this temple
stood, may concerne us, or the times wherein we


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7862:18"/>
live. That <hi>Solomons</hi> petition was fully granted, first
the equity of the matter contained in it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us; for hee requests nothing at Gods hands
which is for substance altogether new; nothing but
that, which out of his free mercy and bounty he
had granted unto his people before, though not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
unto in such a solemne manner, as <hi>Solomon</hi>
now useth and prescribes as a patterne for others
to use. When <hi>Israel</hi> was in his infancy, not able to
speake the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> much lesse to frame
his petitions according to the stile and forme of the
Sanctuary, the God of his father did understand his
cry, and was alwaies ready to give him a better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
then he could desire. <hi>The cry of the children
of Israel</hi> (saith God) <hi>is come unto me, and I have also
seene the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppresse
them. Exod.</hi> 3. 9. Might they have spoken for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the utmost of their request had beene only
for some ease or mitigation of their present servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and grievance; but God (so gracious is he) sends
them full deliverance, and of slaves makes them a
free state, a royall nation. Vpon the sight of <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi>
hoste pursuing them, after they had been set free,
the extremity of feare makes them desirous rather
to returne unto their wonted thraldome, then to
hazard their lives for attaining that liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
God by <hi>Moses</hi> had called them. Whilst thus
affected, <hi>they cry unto the Lord, and he heares their
cry,</hi> although it were mingled with murmurings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Moses. Exod. 14. v.</hi> 10. 11. True it is that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
prayed, whilst they murmured; but God was
more ready to heare, then <hi>Moses</hi> to pray: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7862:18"/>
he saith <hi>v. 15. wherefore cryest thou unto me; speak
unto the children of Israel that they goe forward.</hi> But
for a master to redeeme his owne servants from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
oppression is not so strange, or out of course.
Did God then at the prayer or instance of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
heale his people whom he himselfe had
wounded? <hi>When the people complained, it displeased
the Lord, and the Lord heard it, and his anger was
kindled and the fire of the Lord burnt amongst them,
and consumed them that were in the utmost parts of the
campe. Numb.</hi> 11. 1. The disease was acute and made
quicke dispatch, the medicine was as swift and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<hi>Then the people cried unto Moses, and when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
prayed unto the Lord, the fire was quenched. v.</hi> 2.
One branch of <hi>Solomons</hi> petition is, that when <hi>Israel
should goe forth to battaile against their enemies by
the way which he should send them, that he would then
heare their prayers and supplications, and iudge their
cause.</hi> A lively pledge of Gods favour answerable
to this branch of the petition, and of the immediate
dependance which successe in battaile hath on faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prayers, we have in that story <hi>Exod. 17. v.</hi> 9. 10.
when Iosuah was sent by <hi>Moses</hi> appointment to
fight with <hi>Amalek, It came to passe when Moses
held up his hand, that Israel prevailed, and when
he let downe his hand Amalek prevailed.</hi> Another
branch of <hi>Solomons</hi> petition in this place, is <hi>v. 24.
That when Israel should be put to the worst before
their enemies, that God would be mercifull unto their
sinne, when they should turne againe and confesse his
name and pray.</hi> This was <hi>Israels</hi> case in the siege of
<hi>Ai, Iosuah 17. v. 7. 8. Iosuah</hi> upon the sight of this


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7862:19"/>
wound flies for succour to that medicine which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
happly from his practice prescribes; <hi>For he
rent his clothes, and fell on his face to the earth before
the Arke of the Lord, and cried, alas! O Lord what shall</hi>
I <hi>say when Israel turneth their backe before their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies!</hi>
God heares his prayer, before he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to make an end of praying, <hi>Get thee up, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
liest thou thus upon thy face?</hi> and instructs him
for restoring <hi>Israel</hi> to his wonted estate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by recompencing the way of the wicked upon
his owne head. First he makes <hi>Achan</hi> confesse his
sinne, and give glory unto God, and so removes the
sinne from <hi>Israel</hi> by execution of iustice, which in
like case is equivalent to prayer, at least a necessary
condition of successefull prayers for the publique
weale and safety of kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>2 If after <hi>Iosuahs</hi> death we were to give a generall
title to the sacred history of ensuing times, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
foure hundred yeares, or make an Epitome of
the booke of Iudges, it could not be more briefe then
this, <hi>Israel sinnes and is given up into the hands of the
oppressor; Israel cries unto the Lord, and he sends him
a Iudge and a deliverer:</hi> And yet, as the sacred pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of that story observes, <hi>Israels</hi> repentance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
died with the Iudge which God did send
them, and could not be revived againe but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of affliction. One and the same affliction was
commonly the effect of <hi>Israels</hi> sinne, and the meanes
of <hi>Israels</hi> repentance; his sinne was the efficient
and repentance the finall cause of their oppression.
And so gratious was God towards them, so ready
alwaies to heare their prayers, that he seemed not


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7862:19"/>
to punish them so much for sins past, as to continue
his punishment untill they repented. Among other
calamities of estate whose cure or remedy <hi>Solomon</hi>
here seekes, the plague of pestilence is one, <hi>v.</hi> 28.
with this the land was grievously smitten, even from
<hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beersheba,</hi> in his Father <hi>Davids</hi> daies, by the
immediate hand of God, and in particular for his
Fathers sinne in numbring the people. Yet when
<hi>David</hi> confessed his sinne, and thus prayed, <hi>Behold</hi>
I <hi>have sinned, yea</hi> I <hi>have done wickedly, but these
sheepe what have they done? Let thine hand</hi> I <hi>pray thee
be against mee and against my Fathers house, v.</hi> 17.
the Lord was appeased towards the land, and the
Plague ceased from <hi>Israel.</hi> So ready was God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to heare the prayers of this people, when
they turned unto him, before this Temple was
built.</p>

                     </gap>hen of <hi>Solomons</hi> petition is, that rhe
Lord would be pleased to give his people some
particular or new assurance, for continuing his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mercies or blessings unto them; &amp; that this house
which he had built, might be as a publique Court of
audience, a place wherein it might be free for every
man, and for all <hi>Israel,</hi> to exhibite the petitions of
his heart to his God, and to receiue answere from
him. And so we may obserue, that from this time
forward the consecration of this house, and the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
which <hi>Solomon</hi> here used, did come into the
style and forme of this peoples prayers, made as it
were an additionall to the Covenant <hi>with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                     <hi>Isaac, and Iacob.</hi> But what expresse proofe
have we, that <hi>Solomons</hi> owne prayers at this time,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7862:20"/>
for these prerogatiues of this house were heard? This
fully appeares from the subsequent miracle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
this petition was signed as with the immediate
hand of God, 2. <hi>Ch. 7. 1. 2. Now when Solomon had
made an end of praying, the fire came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and consumed the burnt offring, and the sacrifices,
and the glory of the Lord filled the house: and the priests
could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the
glory of the Lord had filled the house.</hi> This kinde of
answer by fire was alwayes most satisfactory to the
busines or proceedings that were or might be in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
by this answere God did determine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
betweene <hi>Elias</hi> &amp; <hi>Baals Priests;</hi> by the like
effect of fire from heaven (consuming the fat of the
sacrifice) the calling of Aaron to the Priesthood, by
Gods immediate appointment, not by man, was
put out of question. And so was the consecration of
the Sonne of God to his everlasting Priesthood, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the visible apparition of the Holy Ghost
in tongues of fire, which was the accomplishment
of both the former miraculous apparitions from
heaven, the one at the consecration of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the consecration of this materiall Temple.</p>
                  <p>3 But admitting every branch of <hi>Solomons</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was on Gods part fully granted; yet will it
be demanded, whether the practise did pursue the
grant, or what remarkable successe or issue the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
found? To both parts of this demand, two or
three instances, which are upon sacred record, will
suffice. The first from the practise of good <hi>Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi>
in that strange exige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or extremity of danger,
whereunto the Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of <hi>Iudah</hi> was brought in his


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7862:20"/>
dayes, by the malitious confederacie of <hi>Moab, Ammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and Mount Seir.</hi> As was the danger, so was this
good Kings feare exceeding greate; and the greater
it was, the better motiue he had to pray more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
according to that patterne which <hi>Solomon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
2. <hi>Chron. 20. 5. &amp;c. And Iehosaphat stood in
the Congregation of Iudah and Ierusalem, in the house
of the Lord, before the new Court, and said, O Lord
God of our Fathers, art not thou God in heaven, and
rulest not thou over all the Kingdomes of the heathen?
And in thine hand is there not power and might, so
that none is able to withstand thee? Art not thou our
God who didst driue out the inhabitants of this land
before thy people Israel, and gavest it the seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
thy friend for ever? And they dwelt therein, and
have built thee a Sanctuary therein for thy name, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if when evill commeth upon us, as the sword,
iudgement, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before
this house and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this
house) &amp; cry unto thee in our affliction, that thou wilt
heare and help &amp;c.</hi> As the forme of his prayer was
peculiar, such as was not used before this house was
built, so the successe was extraordinary, and such as
this people had never tasted before, unles it were in
the destruction of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp; his mighty army. The
victory which <hi>Gedeon</hi> had over the <hi>Midianites</hi> was
miraculous, in respect of their multitude which was
vanquished, and of their paucity which vanquished
them: yet in that miraculous deliverance, there was
the sword of the <hi>Lord</hi> &amp; the sword of <hi>Gedeon.</hi> They
fought for victory, but in this mighty discomfiture
of 3 nations more potent then <hi>Midian,</hi> which had


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7862:21"/>
combined for the overthrow of <hi>Iudah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> here was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the arme of the Lord; the use of mans sword, or
arme of flesh, is utterly prohibited by the Prophet <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haziel
v. 17. Ye shall not need to fight in this battell, set
your selves, stand ye still &amp; see the salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lord
with you.</hi> All that <hi>Iehosophats</hi> royall presence or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
did undertake or performe, for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this victory promised, was, to exhort his
people, not to bee valiant in fight, but to put their
confidence in the Lord of Hostes. <hi>v. 20. They rose
early in the morning, and went forth into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Tekoah: And as they went forth, Iehosaphat
stood and said, Heare me O Iudah, and the inhabitants
of Hierusalem, believe the Lord your God, so shall
you be established, believe his Prophets, so shall ye pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
And so they did. For this victory was more
compleat and more beneficiall to the King, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
then any victory which <hi>David</hi> had gotten over
the enemies of God, though purchased with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
blood. For as it is <hi>v. 25. When Iehosaphat and
his people came to take away the spoyle of them, they
found amongst them in abundance, both riches with
the dead bodies, and precious jewels (which they stript
off for themselves) more then they could carry away,
and they were three daies in gathering of the spoyle, it
was so much.</hi> For the Lord mighty in battell had
turned the strength and weapons of death and war,
which these confederates had prepared against <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
upon themselves. The most remarkeable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
in this sacred story, was that the coales
and fire of that fatall diffention which brought uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
destruction upon these three armies, did then


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7862:21"/>
begin to kindle, when the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
began to praise the Lord with sweet harmony,
as well of heart and spirit, as of voice <hi>v. 23. When
they began to sing, and praise, the Lord set ambush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against the children of Ammon, and Moab, and
Mount Seir, which were come against Iudah, and they
were smitten. For the children of Ammon, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab
stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to destroy, and slay them, and when they had made
an end of the inhabitants of Mount Seir, every one
helped to destroy another.</hi> Such power there is in the
songs of the Sanctuary, when they are rightly set by
the Priest, and taken up by unanimous consent of
prince, and people, united in heart, with the feare
of God, and with loving affection one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and towards Gods Church. Here was more
then an accomplishment of that branch of <hi>Solomons</hi>
petition in this Chapter. v. 34. They went out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
unto their enemies, &amp; by the way which God
had appointed them, but the way which he had now
appointed them was not to fight with them, but to
believe in him, who can save us, as well with a few, as
with many; &amp; can maintaine the cause of his people,
as well without the industry or endeavours of man,
as with them. And for this cause <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> and his
people did praise him with like confidence, for the
assurance which he had given them by his Prophet
of future victory, as if it had beene already gotten.</p>
                  <p>A victory, or defeate of the enemy without the
active endeavours of men, fully parallell to this we
have in the 2. of <hi>Kings c. 19. v.</hi> 15. to wit, the great
discomfiture of <hi>Senacheribs</hi> army, which had for a


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7862:22"/>
long time besieged <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> Such was the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> prayers, which were conceived in
that forme which <hi>Solomon</hi> here prescribes, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in this house, which he now consecrates. <hi>And
Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said, O Lord
God of Israel, which dwellest betweene the Cherubins,
thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdomes
of the earth, thou hast made heaven and earth, Lord
bow downe thine eare, and heare. Open Lord thine eyes,
and see, and heare the words of Senacherib, which hath
sent him to reproach the living God. v.</hi> 15. 16 To
this petition he receives this answere v. 32. <hi>Thus
saith the Lord, concerning the King of Assyria, he shall
not come into this city, nor shoot an Arrow there, nor
come before it with shield, nor cast a banke against it.
By the way that he came, the same shall he returne, and
shall not come into this city, saith the Lord. For I will
defend this city, to save it, for mine owne sake, and for
my servant Davids sake.</hi> The like joyfull delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was obtained by the prayers of <hi>Elisha</hi> in that
streight siege of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the famine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the city was so grievously pinched, was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
turned into such plenty, that whereas an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
head had beene fold one day for 40 peeces of
silver, the morrow after, two measures of Barley,
and a measure of wheate flowre, was sold for a she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kell.
2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 25. &amp; 7. 18. Heaven, we reade was
shut up for three yeares in <hi>Elisas's</hi> time, the earth
was chapped, and the land of <hi>Israel</hi> wounded with
famine, for want of raine. Heaven is opened againe
by <hi>Elias</hi> his prayer, and the land refreshed, 1. <hi>Kings</hi>
17. 1. 18. 45. So that there is not one branch of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>


                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:7862:22"/>
petition, which the Lord did not really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish,
when this people prayed unto him, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
prescribes them.</p>
                  <p>Through want of such prayers as <hi>Solomon</hi> here
makes, or, at least, for want of that faith, by which
the prayers of <hi>Iehosaphat, Hezekias</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi>
were conceived, <hi>Iehoiakim, Zedekiah</hi> &amp;c. found no
such successe; or deliverance in their distresse, as
these two godly Princes had done.</p>
                  <p>But some men, the better they believe these sacred
stories, concerning the infallible successe of the
Kings of <hi>Iudah's</hi> godly prayers; The more prone
they will be to question in what cases, how farre, or
whether at all, the undoubted grant of <hi>Solomons</hi>
petition may any way concerne us, or the times
wherein we live.</p>
                  <p>The question may seeme more pertinent, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the second generall point proposed by us, may
seeme more questionable, or, (more then questiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
altogether impertinent; because, most of these
victories, or deliverances, which <hi>Iudah,</hi> or <hi>Israel</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by prayers, were miraculous; such as farre
exceed the force of naturall causes, or meanes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and which are without the reach, or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of policy. And what assurance then can wee
have, that our prayers shall bee answered with like
successe, unlesse we may believe, or hope, that even
our prayers or supplications may procure true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
but miracles have altogether, or for the most
part, ceased for these later times; in which, for this
reason, that song of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> might be more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken up, than the practise of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or the


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7862:23"/>
Kings of <hi>Iudah; We have heard with our eares, &amp; our
fathers have declared unto us the noble workes, which
thou didst in their daies, &amp; in the old time before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus to complaine of the times wherein wee
live, in respect of former, all of us are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
too prone; and this pronenesse is one speciall
meanes, by which the fervency of better spirits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
is so much dampned: yet <hi>Solomon</hi> hath told
us, that we are but foolish inquisitors; And if but
foolish inquisitors, then certainly no competent
judges in this case.</p>
                  <p>To say, that these times are not more corrupt then
former, were to flatter them; enough to convince us
of being time-servers; yet to complaine of them, or
to lament them, as men doe which have no hope, or
assurance in Gods promises, were to accuse God; a
spice of infidelity. Certainly, there is no fault in the
times, or in the places, wherein we live, but such as
we our selves respectively infuse into them, some by
wickednesse of life, others by impious or ungodly
opinions.</p>
                  <p>Let us then so use our freedome in speaking the
truth of the times wherein we live, that we doe not
slander the eternall dispenser of times, and seasons;
that we cast no aspersions upon his fatherly care and
providence. God hath not forgotten to be as good,
and gracious unto our times, as he hath beene unto
former ages; but we have forgotten to bee thankfull
unto him; we either are distrustfull of our selves, or,
for the most part, teach others to distrust the extent
of his goodnesse, whose certaine beliefe must bee
the roote of prayers as well for blessings spirituall,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7862:23"/>
as temporall.</p>
                  <p>There is no speedier way, or shorter cut unto
Gods curse, or vengeance, then by distrusting his
goodnesse towards our selves, or by denying the
fruites of it unto others.</p>
                  <p>But to the <hi>Quaere</hi> proposed, How farre the grant
of <hi>Solomons</hi> petition may concerne our selves, or the
times wherein we live, the answere is ready; Our
present interest in that grant, our assurance in Gods
promises for blessings temporall <hi>to that people</hi> may
be as great, our deliverance from dangers immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and unavoidable to the apprehension of
man, may be as certaine and infallible as theirs was;
albeit God doth not in particular promise succour,
or worke our safety by the same, and like meanes as
he did theirs.</p>
                  <p>Admit then it were an Article of our Creed (as
it is not) that miracles in these later times haue cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
may not upon any exigence be expected, that
to seeke after such signes, and wonders, as were
given then, were a tempting of God, as intruth it is
no better; yet all this ought not to weaken our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that the issue of our prayers (so they be as
faithfull as theirs were) shalbe as ioyfull to our
selves, as beneficiall to the state and kingdome, as
<hi>Iehosaphats</hi> and <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> prayers were. Gods
goodnesse towards us, his providence over us is still
the same, and our beleife of this his goodnesse, if
in us it be true, and sound, 'tis the same it was in
them; so will the issue be the same, either in kinde,
or by <hi>equivalency.</hi> Whether the like issue or successe
be wrought by meanes ordinary, or extraordinary,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7862:24"/>
is meerly accidentall to the certaine of it; Not to
embrace the workes of his wisdome with as thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hearts, as <hi>Israel</hi> did the workes of his power,
would be childish and pettish.</p>
                  <p>Hopes of successe, whether by meanes ordinary
or miraculous, must in all ages be grounded upon
the same article of faith, but not at all times upon
the same branch of the same article. It is he that
made us, which only can preserve us, and whiles we
professe that it is hee that made us and not wee our
selves, that he is the maker of all things visible, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
we include as much as the Apostle saith, &amp;
somewhat more then he expresseth in these words,
<hi>In him we move, live, and have our being,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the three speciall branches of Gods power.</p>
                  <p>Miracles, properly so called, consist in some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
manifestation of Gods power, either
adding somewhat unto, or subtracting somewhat
from the ordinary efficacy of instrumentall causes,
or observable course of nature. All miracles may
be reduced to such manifestation either of Gods
creative, or his conservative, or cooperative
power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength, or archievements were truely
miraculous, and did suppose an addition of force
supernaturall to his native activity, or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
measure of Gods coworking power.</p>
                  <p>The victory, which <hi>Iosuah</hi> got over the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
was after this manner miraculous. There was
a power more than naturall, as well in the motion
as in the making of those great stones, wherewith
the <hi>Amorites</hi> were beaten downe. The <hi>three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>


                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:7862:24"/>
againe were preserved untoucht, in the midst
of the flaming furnace, by true miracle, or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
manifestation of Gods power; But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
not in the addition of any supernaturall forces
unto it, but in the meere subtraction of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working
power, without subtraction of his creative,
or conserving power; for so it had ceased not only
to burne, but to be fire. The suddaine withering of
<hi>Ieroboams</hi> hand was a true miracle, but did consist
in the subtraction of Gods preserving power, that
is, that branch of his power, in which, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speakes, all things live that are endowed with
life.</p>
                  <p>That God hath thus wrought the safety of his
servants, and yet is able to worke by these, or the
like more miraculous meanes, wee doe believe, in
that we believe he is the Almighty maker of heaven,
and earth. But besides that absolute dependance
which every particular creature hath on these bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of his power, by which their severall efficacies
may be extraordinarily increased, or diminished,
there is an essentiall subordination of all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rankes of his creatures, with whatsoever strength
or efficacy they be endowed, unto his providence; as
in wisdome he made them all, so in wisdome he
marshalleth, and ordereth them all.</p>
                  <p>Now the contrivance of meanes, or agents, for
their nature, or kinde but ordinary, may be more
admirable, than miracles properly so called, that
is, than his particular workes of wonder.</p>
                  <p>Miracles are in their nature more apt to affect
the sence, but the sweet contrivances of Gods wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7862:25"/>
and providence doe more affect the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
The one workes astonishment, the other
admiration. For this reason were miracles more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in the infancy of the Church, as an awfull
kinde of discipline to inforce unbeleevers to give
audience unto the word of life, and to take Gods
promises (which would otherwise be sleighted) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
serious consideration.</p>
                  <p>But the wayes of Gods wisdome, or sweet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition
of his providence, are more apt to cherish
the seed of life being sowen in mens hearts. Miracles
by continuall frequency would cease to be mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
would not be wondred at; whereas the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
wayes of Gods wisdome, or his indisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble
contrivances of extraordinary successe by
meanes ordinary will uncessantly breed in us mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of admiration. His wayes and contrivances are
still in one kinde or other most admirable, but we
want eyes, or will, to contemplate, or observe them.
Yet let us see whether the greatest deliuerances,
which God wrought for his children of <hi>Israel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that one in bringing them out of the land of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> were not wrought by meanes ordinary and
usuall, if we respect their particular or severall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
and admirable and extraordinary only for
their combination, and contrivance. <hi>When the Lord
turned againe the captivity of Sion, we were like them
that dreame. Then was our mouth fill'd with laughter,
and our tongues with singing. Then said they among
the heathen, the Lord hath done great things for
them: yea the Lord hath done great things for us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
whereof wee reioyce. Psal. 120. v.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7862:25"/>
This was indeed a great deliverance, and so to be
acknowledged by all posterity. For so the Prophet
had foretold, <hi>Ier. 23. 7. Behold the day is come, saith
the Lord, that they shall no more sya, the Lord liveth,
which brought forth the children of Israel out of the
land of Egypt; But, the Lord liveth, which brought up
and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the
North country, and from all countryes, whether</hi> I <hi>had
driven them, and they shall dwell in their owne land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to make comparison betwixt the mighty
workes of God, or not to question whether accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the literall meaning of this Prophecy, the
fame or fresh memory of this second deliverance
out of <hi>Chaldey,</hi> should eclipse the fame of the former
out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> This is certaine aud unquestionable,
that this latter deliverance was a most exact paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell
to the former. And yet, if we could exactly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
all the particular meanes, which did concurre
to the surprisall of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or to <hi>Cyrus</hi>
his setting this people free, we should not finde one
miraculous effect among them; And yet if wee
would but seriously compare all the circumstances
and concurrences of second causes, which <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Xenophon</hi> relate, with the sacred predictions
concerning <hi>Cyrus</hi> his good successe against <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
the intire contrivance of them is most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and such as would, give us a more pleasant
view, or modell of Gods infinite wisdome, then mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
can doe of his infinite power.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in that deliverance of the <hi>Iewes</hi> from <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
conspiracy, there is no extraordinary manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of Gods power, no particular cause, or agent


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7862:26"/>
was in it's working advanced above the ordinary
pitch of nature; and yet the contrivance, or suiting
of these ordinary agents appointed by God, is
more admirable, then if the same end had beene ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by meanes truly miraculous. For a King not
to take kindly rest by night, though in a bed of ease,
is not unusuall. For a King, againe, to seeke to solace
his waking thoughts, by hearing the Annalls of his
kingdome, or the journalls of his owne reigne read
unto him, is more commendable, then rare; But that
King <hi>Assuerus</hi> should lye awake at that time speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
when <hi>Haman</hi> did watch and plot the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that causing the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of his
Kingdome to be read, the reader should light on the
place wherein <hi>Mordecai</hi> his unrewarded good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in discovering the treason intended against the
Kings person, was recorded; this was from the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of <hi>Israel</hi> who neither slumbereth nor sleepeth,
and who was marveilous in his peoples sight.</p>
                  <p>It was his doing likewise, that <hi>Hester,</hi> though by
<hi>Mordecai's</hi> advice, should conceale her nation and
parentage, untill she came in such high favour with
the King. That Queene <hi>Vashti</hi> should be displaced,
and she preferred, about the same time wherein <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was advanced, and by his advancement enabled
to doe a remedilesse mischiefe to the <hi>Iewish nation</hi>
had not the Lord (as the wise man speakes) <hi>made
one thing against another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we would rightly survey that rare deliverance
of <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> and his people before mentioned, the
particular meanes, by which it was wrought, were
but ordinary, not miraculous: but the coincidence,


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7862:26"/>
or concurrence of such meanes was more then mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous.
Seeing the spirit of Godhath concealed the
particular occasions of that unexpected hostility,
betweene the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and the
<hi>Edomites;</hi> we have no reason to suspect them to have
beene any other, then such as the Lord heretofore
hath wrought, and yet may worke betweene the
confederate enemies of this kingdomes peace, for
our good, if we shall be thankfull; or betweene our
freinds, or confederates for the advantage of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
if we shall continue enemies unto our God.
In a word, in that rare and admirable deliverance,
there was no particular rare, or unusuall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of those times, unlesse it were <hi>Iehosaphats,</hi> and
his Nobles firme reliance, not to the arme of flesh,
or probable appearance of meanes ordinary, but
upon the mercy, and loving kindnesse of the Lord;
in whose wisdome they knew was treasured up va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of meanes ordinary, unknowne to them, as
all sufficient to save, as if the whole armory of his
power, by working miracles, had beene used for
their defence.</p>
                  <p>If Christian states would throughly parallell
<hi>Iehosaphat</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> in this; God in this age would
parallell the successe by the like extraordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of meanes ordinary. As his mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for ever, so the treasure of his wisdome, for
effecting their good which love him, is inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
It is not necessary that he should interpose his
creative power, or worke miracles for bringing
forth successe extraordinary, and miraculous; For
of meanes ordinary, whereof he hath infinite store


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7862:27"/>
already created; a small number, by his all-seeing
disposition, may suffice for any purpose. He can
without miracles save with a few, as well as with
many.</p>
                  <p>The letters, or elements of all speech, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
are not many; few more in number than the
yeares of our youth, or non-age; yet the possible
compositions of these few are so various, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
as to afford severall words, sufficient not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to signify the diversity of things that are by
name, but to expresse their natures, and properties;
enough to decipher all the actions or undertakings
of men throughout all ages.</p>
                  <p>How unsearchable then are his wayes? how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
the secret courses, by which he
brings calamity or prosperity upon any nation; who
can with greater facility compose the severall rankes
of his creature, even all things that are, then the
<hi>Printer</hi> can doe his few letters.</p>
                  <p>And albeit all the visible meanes which may bee
thought to conspire for our woe, or for our weale,
may be, to mans apprehension, apparently the same
which have beene manifested in former times, yet
his wisdome, by secret addition, or subtraction of
some petty occurrences, may quite alter the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
which from some former models wee feare,
or hope, with lesse adoe, than a critique, permitted
to correct a presse, can doe the sence and meaning
of the exactest writer, by the dispunction or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of points or letters. How many devices soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
there be in man's heart, yet as <hi>Prov. 19. 21. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
saith, <hi>there is a counsell of the Lord and that
must stand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:7862:27"/>
It was a grave Christian-like advice, which the
heathen <hi>Cambyses,</hi> from some broken apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the great wisdome of his <hi>Gods</hi> or <hi>divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
did give unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> his sonne, when he first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke
that quarrell with the <hi>Armenians,</hi> which
gave occasion to that great warre, which by the
counsell of the Lord he happily acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished against
<hi>Babylon.</hi> The summe of his advise was this, <hi>That hee
should run no hazard either of his owne person, or of his
charge, without sacrificing to the Gods, and receiuing
directions from them. For men</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the choise
of their actions, or undertakings, doe but rove by guesse,
not acquainted with the fountaines, whence true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
must be derived, or the secret issues by which it
runnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many instances hee there brings of men which
had wit, or power to compasse the particulars which
they most affected, which yet have strangely mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
in the maine chance, and as it were ran coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from that end, or marke at which all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
make ayme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The resultance of his many instances, or his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
to this purpose, is,</hi> That humane wisdome
(at the best) hath no more skill to chuse what is best for
it selfe, then as if a man should come to a lottery, where
hee must bee content with the lot which he drawes; he
hath a freedome of will, or power to chuse this before
that, but none to make the prize of what hee chuseth;
that was set before. But as for the immortall Gods they
know all things as well past as to come, and will direct
their friends, being consulted, to chuse that which is
good, and decline evill. But as for such as are not their


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7862:28"/>
friends, there is no necessity that they should take the
like care for them.</p>
                  <p>We may adde, though all men by nature be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
unto the true and only God; yet is there is no
necessity laid upon any so to continue. All the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the earth have better meanes of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto God then the Temple of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or the
service of it was unto the nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it stood: God, saith the Apostle, <hi>was in Christ</hi>
reconciling (not this or that man) <hi>but the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himselfe.</hi> All the nations of the earth, as you heard
before, had their interest in the Temple built by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi>
The demolishing of it, or the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Temple built
by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> reedified and adorned by <hi>Herod,</hi> can
be no prejudice to any particular nation of the earth,
much lesse to any christian nation, least of all to this
most orthodoxall nation.</p>
                  <p>But what? Is that way, or meanes of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto God, which we now have, more excellent
then the <hi>Iewish</hi> nation had whilest <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple
stood? Certainly the Sonne of God did use no <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisme</hi>
or <hi>aequivocation;</hi> He spake more then <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,</hi>
even sacred mysteries, when he said unto
the <hi>Iewes, Destroy this Temple, and in three daies I
will raise it up. Iohn</hi> 2. 19. For albeit his words, as
the <hi>Evangelist</hi> instructs us, were literally meant
of the Temple of his body; and though the <hi>Iewes</hi>
did pernitiously erre in not construing them so; yet
the same words had a farther emblematicall, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,
or spirituall sense, importing thus much, that
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by destroying the Temple of his body,
should destroy that very Temple wherein they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7862:28"/>
and that within three dayes it should be raised
with him to a more excellent state, or manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than it had.</p>
                  <p>The materiall Temple was signed, or marked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
destruction, by the rending of the vaile at the
houre of his death: and though the visible building,
or so much of it as was the worke of mans hands
did stand for forty yeares after; yet it stood but as
a Carkasse, the soule and spirit of it was translated
unto the Temple of his body. For as he said, <hi>Veios
habitante Camillo Illic Romafuit. Rome was at Veii
whilst Camillus,</hi> in whom the life and spirit of the
Ancient Romans did then wholly reside, <hi>had his
residence in that towne.</hi> Or as we say, <hi>the Kings royall
presence makes the Court:</hi> So was it alwayes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
or peculiar presence of God by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation,
which made that goodly edifice, which
<hi>Solomon</hi> now erected, to be the Temple or Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the house of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Now from the time of our Saviours death, God
withdrew his extraordinary presence from the
Temple made with hands; all the priviledges,
wherewith it was endowed, and the secret influence
of his grace, are now wholy treasured up in the
sunne of righteousnesse, or in the body of Christ,
in whom, as the Apostle speakes, <hi>the God-head dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
bodily.</hi> God is not so present in any other body
or place, as he was in the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> not
present any where by way of inhabitation, save on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the body of Christ, and in the members of it,
that is, his Church.</p>
                  <p>But in as much as God is by such speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7862:29"/>
present in Christs manhood, our accesse unto
him, in all our troubles and distresse, is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
than <hi>Solomon,</hi> or his people had any. They
were to pray in the materiall Temple, or towards
it; their prayers had no other accesse to heaven, than
as it were by way of <hi>Echo</hi> from the earthly Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and though by this way they found a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
unto heaven; yet had they not altogether the
same acceptance there, as ours now have, or might
have.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> indeed <hi>beseeched God,</hi> here in my text,
<hi>that his eyes might be open, and his eares attent unto
the prayers, which were made in this place,</hi> to wit, <hi>in
the house which hee had built.</hi> But this hee spake,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>after the manner of men.</hi> For God had
not then the eyes of men to looke upon men, nor
the eares of man, as now he hath, to entertaine the
prayers of men.</p>
                  <p>This is one speciall comfort, that the Sonne of
God, that very Lord unto whom <hi>Solomon</hi> directs
his prayer, is become our high Priest, <hi>not such an
high Priest as cannot be touched with the feeling of
our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as
we are, yet without sinne.</hi> He hath his Temple, or
Sanctuary <hi>at the right hand of his Father,</hi> Act. 3. 26.
where he sits to pray for us, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did for his
people in his name.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but he is placed there, as the Apostle speaks,
<hi>to blesse us with all spirituall blessings,</hi> and what are
these to blessings of states and kingdomes, for
which <hi>Solomon</hi> here prayes? Much every way; or
rather, all in all. For if blessings spirituall include


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7862:29"/>
godlinesse in them, they have blessings temporall
annexed unto them, as appurtenances, <hi>Godlinesse,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>is profitable unto all things,
having the promise of the life that now is,
and of that which is to come.

all the people unto the Priests and Prophets, this man

name of the Lord our God.</hi> The scales of Iustice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus farre turned the right way, the Elders and


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7862:32"/>
Sages of the land sought to keepe them at the point
whereto they were drawne, (more through vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of present motion, then by permanent waight
of reason) by alleaging a former rule beyond
exception. All that the Priests and Prophets
could pretend, why <hi>Ierusalem</hi> having made her
selfe equall to <hi>Shiloh</hi> in sinne, might not bee made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to her in punishment, was this; That albeit
<hi>Shiloh</hi> had beene the place of Gods rest, the Towne
or City where the Arke of his Covenant did reside,
yet it never had the title or priviledge of the place
which God had chosen to place his name in. This
was <hi>Ierusalem's</hi> prerogative amongst all the Cities
of <hi>Israel.</hi> But what prerogative soever <hi>Ierusalem</hi> did
from this title enioy, these had beene the same in
the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> which now they were. And
if in the Iudgement of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> &amp; the state of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
it were lawfull for <hi>Micah</hi> to threaten, that <hi>Sion should
be plowed as a field that Ierusalem should become heapes,
&amp; the mountaine of the house like the high places of the
forrest;</hi> It could be no capital crime in <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to
say, that the Lord would make the Temple like <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh,</hi>
and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a curse to all the Nations of the
earth. Now <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the state of <hi>Iudah</hi> (as these
Elders alledge) were so farre from putting <hi>Micah</hi> to
death, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for his part, did feare the Lord
and besought the Lord. And when it is said, he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Lord, it is included that he did not only pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
heare the Prophet, but truely believe him.
For the feare of the Lord in this place is neither to
be extended further, nor contracted narrower than
thus; He feared least the Lord should put the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7862:32"/>
denounced by <hi>Micah</hi> in speedy execution,
and as is probable, by <hi>Sennacherib</hi> King of <hi>Assyria.</hi>
By what meanes soever the likelyhood was that this
Iudgement should be put in execution; the only
meanes which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> resolveth upon for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or preventing it, was hearty and unfained
praiets. <hi>Did he not feare the Lord, and besought the
Lord? &amp;c.</hi> In this his resolution and successe, these
foure particulars present themselves to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations;</p>
                  <p>First, his wisdome in making choice of prayer
before and above all other meanes, which the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of those times might suggest.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what advantagious successe did accrue
from feare unto the efficacy of his praiers? or, how
feare of God's Iudgements doth prepare mens
hearts to pray?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of the iust occasion of his and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
feare; or of others feare in like case.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in what sense God is said to repent.</p>
                  <p>If I should say that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in thus doing did
shew himselfe a godly and religious King, none
would deny it; but to say, he was in this a wise and
politick King, this will not be granted. For what
policy was therein fearing and praying? Every cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
is capable of the former; and he is a very foole
that, when other meanes faile, cannot practice the
later. Must we then decline all triall of his wisdome
by the received rule of humane policy? This wee
might doe, but this we need not doe. For the depth
of his wisdome and policy will appeare if wee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
it by that rule, or scale of that policy which the


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7862:33"/>
wisemen of this world hold in greatest admiration.
For so a great master of the art of policy tels us,
that when any state or kingdome is either weakened
by meanes internall, as by the sloath, the negligence
or carelesnesse of the Governours (as diseases grow
in mens bodies by degrees insensible, for want of
exercise or good dyet) or whether they be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by causes external; the only method for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
their former strength and dignity is, <hi>ut om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
ad sua principia revocentur, by giving life unto
the fundamentall lawes and ancient customes.</hi> As for
new inventions, what depth or subtilities soever they
cary, unlesse they suite well with the fundamentall
lawes or customes of the state wherein they practice,
they proove in the issue but like empiricall Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
which agrees not with the naturall disposition
or customary dyet of the party to whom it is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.
Of the former aphorisme you have many
<hi>probatum</hi>'s in the ancient Roman state; So have yee
of the later in the state of <hi>Italy,</hi> about the time
wherein <hi>Machiavel</hi> wrote (if we may believe him)
in his owne profession. Admit then the rule or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
were (as, for ought I have to say, it is) without
exception, yet the successe of the practice (how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
soever to the rule) must still depend on
that measure of goodnesse which is contained in
the fundamentall lawes or primevall customes of
every Nation. If these be but comparatively good,
the successe of the practice cannot be absolute: If
they be but seemingly good, or mixed with evill;
the great Philosopher treating of this subiect hath
foretold the successe, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7862:33"/>
                     <hi>whatsoever is either falsly or
but seemingly good, will in revolution of time bring
forth effects truly and really evill.</hi> If the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
lawes of any state be not firme or sound,
whatsoever else is laid upon them, there lyes a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of finking with their owne weight. Where
the <hi>basis</hi> is but narrow, the <hi>fastigium</hi> or roofe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be high. Or where the foundation is both firme
and spatious, yet if the structure be set awry, with
every degree of height it gets, there growes a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell
degree of inclination to its sudden downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall.
Now if <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in making choice of prayer
before any other meanes of policy, did practice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the former rule, that is, as the ancient
lawes of that kingdome, and rules of goverment
prescribed by his Ancestors did direct him, he was
more politickly, wise than any Prince of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in these times could be: than any at this day
can be, besides such as have the like fundamentall
lawes, or take his practice in like exigence for their
patterne. For the fundamentall lawes of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
were absolutely good, as being immediately
given by God himselfe. The best lawes of other
Nations were but the inventions of men. Hence
saith the Psalmist <hi>Psal. 147. v. 19. Hee sheweth his
word unto Iacob, his statutes and ordinances unto Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi>
Yet <hi>Moses</hi> presumed that other Nations, which
had no knowledge of their lawes in particular,
should from the happy successe which was to attend
their due observance, acknowledge in generall that
their lawes were more righteous, and able to make
this people wiser than other Nations could be. For


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7862:34"/>
so <hi>Moses</hi> had said <hi>Deut. 4. 5. Behold I have taught
you statutes, and Iudgements, even as the Lord my God
commanded me, keepe therefore and doe them: For this
is your wisdome and understanding in the sight of the
Nations, which shall heare all these statutes, and say,
surely this great Nation is a wise and understanding
people: And what Nation is there so great that hath
statutes and Iudgments so righteous, as all this law
which I set before you this day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst other Nations some had lawes (in their
kinde) good for warre, others for peace, few or
none, good lawes for both; none, absolutely good
for either. No such lawes as their strict observance
might secure them from their enemies. They could
not be so wise in projecting their owne future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
but their enemies might bee as subtile in
contriving their adversity. They could not bee so
strong in battaile, but their enemies and their Allies
might be as strong as they. They could not bee so
industrious or vigilant for recovering the strength
or dignity of their weakned estate, but their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
might be as vigilant to defeate their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Or albeit one Nation had so farre overtopped
another, as well in councell of peace, as strength of
warre, as to be able to keepe them perpetually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
yet no lawes, no inventions of men could ever
secure the most potent Nation on earth from such
dangers as accrue from the host of inanimate or
reasonlesse creatures, albeit all Neighbour: Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were at peace with them or sworne confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
for advancing their state and dignity. Against
the hosts or armies of men, some preparations may


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7862:34"/>
alwaies be made, because they come not without
notice or preparation; but the severall hosts of the
reasonlesse creatures come upon men, for the most
part, without observation or fore-sight. And one of
them can execute anothers office or charge, or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one accomplish that worke which the Armies of
men did intend, but could not execute.</p>
                  <p>That scarcity of bread, or other calamity, which
sometime suddainly ariseth in some limbe or corner
of a kingdome, by want of trade, or by shutting up
too great a multitude of ships for a long time in one
harbour, whilst the enemy or Pirats annoy the
coasts; how easily might it be much increased, if he
that keepes the windes as in a treasure house, should
shut up a greater multitude of ships for a long time
in the same harbour by a contrary winde, albeit
their enemies in the meane while become their
friends: albeit they were provided of an invincible
navy at an houres warning. Or in case they did know
whence the winde commeth or whither it is going,
or could so covenant that it should blow where and
when they listed; yet if the Lord of hosts be so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
he can bring a greater dearth and scarcity upon
the most fertile provinces of the land, then either
the enemy, or contrary windes can occasion; either
by withdrawing the sweet influence of the heavens,
or by corrupting the seed lately sowne, or corne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be reaped with abundant moisture. Or, admit
any people or Nation by miracle or divine dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
might have authority, not over the windes
only but over the clouds, the raine, and dew: or
such a power of shutting and opening heaven, as


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7862:35"/>
husband-men have of letting in brookes upon their
medowes, and taking them off againe at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
so as they might have seed time, and harvest as
seasonable, their fields as fruitfull, the Sea as open
as their hearts could desire; yet the very freedome
of commerce and traffique (whether with foraine
Nations, or with other members of the same Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
may bring in a greater inconvenience (which
no plenty can hold out) then the enemy, then unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
winde or weather could threaten. Want of
trade and want of victuals are plagues or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
sent by God; but the plague of pestilence,
which is oft times the companion of peace and
plenty, the usuall effect of free trading or traffique,
is more terrible then either of the former wants.
And thus may every part of the reasonlesse host ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
what another had omitted. Now with tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
spirits, or unruly men, good lawes duely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
may take some order; but against unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
weather, against unruly or incommodious
windes, no law of man, no act of Parliament can
provide. Against the plague or pestilence, no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of state or warre, no host or army can secure
themselves, much lesse others. Though they that
besiege and are besieged doe keepe watch and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell
day and night, yet the arrowes of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
messenger flye more certainly to the marke,
whereto they are directed, though at mid-night,
then their bullets doe at mid-day.</p>
                  <p>As there is no counsell against the Lord, so there
is no policy that can prevent, the execution of Gods
judgements upon mightiest kingdomes by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7862:35"/>
of his creatures besides that policy which his
lawes given to <hi>Israel</hi> did prescribe. One speciall
branch of that wisdome which <hi>Moses</hi> ascribes unto
these lawes was, they taught their observers not to
trust in bow or shield, not to put any part of their
confidence in the strength or wit of man, no not in
their owne observation of these very lawes, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
wrought by their rules (as it was theirs)
but only in the Lord of hosts. Hee was their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and he was their strength, whensoever any
danger did approach whether from men, or from
other creatures, their lawes did teach them that
he was absolute Lord over all, that the hearts of
Kings and Governours were under his governance,
that he could dispose &amp; turne them as it seemed best
to his heavenly wisdome. And that alwaies seemes
best to him, which is for the good of such as repose
their whole trust and confidence in him. When <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi>
enemies displeased him, more then <hi>Israel</hi> did,
he made them stronger then their enemies; and
when their waies did please him, he made their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
(as <hi>Solomon</hi> speakes) <hi>to be at peace with them.</hi>
Whilst they faithfully served this Lord of hosts,
they knew hee could command the whole host of
the reasonlesse or livelesse creatures to doe them
service.</p>
                  <p>From this knowledge of God and his lawes did
<hi>Solomon</hi> gather these unerring rules of sacred po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
whose observation at this time did, and might
for ever have preserved this kingdome. There is no
inconvenience of peace, no mischeife of warre, no
kind of calamity which can befall any state or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7862:36"/>
against which the fundamentall lawes of this
Nation and the rules of policy gathered from them
by <hi>Solomon</hi> did not sufficiently provide. The sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
remedies for every particular disease or kind
of calamity, are set downe at large. 2. <hi>Chron. 6. v.</hi> 22.

like inconveniences and calamities is for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
one and the same with that which good King
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> here used, <hi>to feare the Lord, and pray unto
the Lord,</hi> either in the Temple when they had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to resort unto it, or towards the Temple
or the place wherein it stood, when they soiourned
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> were detained Captives in a foraigne land. And
who so would diligently peruse the sacred story,
from <hi>Solomons</hi> time untill this peoples returne from
captivity, and the building up of the second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
shall finde a <hi>probatum</hi> of this Catholique and
soveraigne medicine, in respect of every branch of
calamity mentioned by <hi>Solomon</hi> at the consecration
of the first Temple. I must hold to the instance of
my Text. Another branch of that which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the fundamentall lawes of this kingdome,
and which goes a great deale deeper than the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
rules of any other policy, was this; that of
all calamities which did or could befall them, their
sinnes and transgressions were the prime causes; and


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7862:36"/>
whatsoever afflictions were laid upon them for
their sinnes, could not bee taken off without the
humble supplication of the sinners. Vnto a lower
ebbe then King <hi>Ahaz</hi> did leave it at, the kingdome
of <hi>Iudah</hi> had not beene brought by any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors,
or by any other in their dayes. Now of
all the miseries which at any time befell it by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
by the enemies sword, or by the pestilence, the
only cause which the rule of faith assignes, was their
forsaking of the Lord their God, and the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of his lawes. But to prevent the perpetuity and
continuance of such calamities as king <hi>Ahaz</hi> and
his Adherents had by their foule transgressions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
this kingdome in, no attempt or practice of
Prince or people, whether joyntly or severally, did
ever finde successe, untill they put <hi>Solomons</hi> rules of
sacred policy in practice, as good king <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
did; <hi>Did hee not feare the Lord, and prayed before the
Lord &amp;c.?</hi> The fruits of his prayer, and the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those corrupt times, by giving life unto their
fundamentall lawes, were two. First his prayers
procured an healing of the wounds which by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of his Predecessors had beene given to the
State. Secondly, he prevented the execution of
those terrible Iudgments which in his owne dayes
did hang over this land and people, specially over
their Heads and Rulers. The kingdome of <hi>David</hi>
had sometimes exceeded the most flourishing
neighbour kingdomes, as farre as the Cedars of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi>
did the ordinary trees of the forrest; but was
now brought low. That height, which was left her,
but as a decayed tree markt to the fall; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7862:37"/>
zealous prayers removes the axe from the roote,
after it had made such deepe incision that it was
scarce able to beare its stemme, though dispoiled
of his top or principall branches: it nearely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
every one which hoped for shelter under its
shade, to pray for gentle winds and comfortable
weather, that shee might recover root and branch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
But so <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> and his peoples Successors
did not. <hi>Manasses</hi> his sonne found a people not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward,
as being in some tolerable sort reformed by
<hi>Hezekiah;</hi> but he himselfe a most untoward King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(by his authority and bad example) to undoe
what his good father had well done: to spoile and
marre a greater people than he was Lord of, though
better reformed in <hi>Iosiah</hi> grand-child to this <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
as good a King as could be wished for: a man that
needed no reformation: a fit patterne for reforming
others. But this heavenly starre was placed in an
earthly sphere; hee had to deale with such a lewd
court and naughty people, as choaked the influence
of his goodnesse. And albeit his personall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
in his attempted reformation, were no way
inferior to <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> practice in this place; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his performances nor prayers found the like
successe. He could not plant the feare of the Lord
either in his people or in his owne childrens hearts.
And if we sequester <hi>Iosiah</hi> his attempt of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his time unto the destruction of
the City and Temple; there was sometimes on the
Princes part, sometimes on the peoples part, usually
on all parts, Prince and people, if not a continuall
increase of sinne, yet a continuance in usuall and


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7862:37"/>
wonted sinnes. And where Gods Iudgements have
once seized upon a land or people, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall
of them without publique repentance:
no true repentance without prayer, no prayers
effectuall without feare of the Lord. <hi>Did hee
not feare the Lord, and befought the Lord &amp;c.</hi>
His prayers were earnest and effectuall because his
feare was hearty, and unfained, not affected. But
how feare should performe the office either of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or mid-wife for the bringing forth of succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prayers is a Quaere not to be omitted, and was
the second generall proposed.</p>
                  <p>Pray we may, but our prayers cannot bee successe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
unlesse they be conceived in faith; <hi>And faith</hi> (as
our Apostle tels us <hi>Heb. 11. 1.) is the ground or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of things hoped for.</hi> And what affinity is there,
what agreement can there be, between feare, &amp; hope
or confidence, which is if not the nature, yet, the
native issue of faith. From these words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>[faith is the ground of things hoped for]</hi> haply it
was that some late writers have put <hi>fiducia</hi> or <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
in the very definition of faith. But wee are to
consider that the former words of our Apostle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
rather a character, then a iust description or
definition of faith. Otherwise his words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had beene superfluous <hi>[faith is the evidence of
things not seene]</hi> And under this more generall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
things feared may be as directly conteined as
things hoped for. But have we any Scripture to
warrant us, that faith in some cases may be as truely
the ground of things feared, as of things hoped for?
Yes. <hi>By faith</hi> (saith the Apotle <hi>Heb. 11. 7.) Noah be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7862:38"/>
warned of God of things not seene as yet, mooved
with feare, prepared an Arke for the saving of his
house.</hi> Or if we consider faith not in it's universality,
as it equally respects the whole word of God, but
as it hath a peculiar reference unto his covenant
with this people, that (wee know) was not a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of life only, but a covenant of life and death.
And all the writings of the Prophets which were to
them, and are to us, the truest leaders and guides un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
faith, are as full of threatnings as of promises:
their sweetest hymnes are composed as well of
iudgement as of mercy. So that faith if it be not
lame or defective, hath two hands; aswell a left hand
to apprehend the truth of Gods iudgements threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
whilst we swarve from the waies of life; as a
right hand, to lay hold on the truth of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
whilst we are not conscious of such deviation.
Feare then, which is no other then an expectation
or apprehension of evill, is the left hand of faith; and
hope which is the expectation or apprehension of
good, is the right. And they who place the nature of
faith <hi>in fiducia,</hi> or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fine it unto confidence do utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maime it on the left side; &amp; being maimed or dead
on the left side, it cannot be sound or lively on the
right. That which they terme <hi>fiducia</hi> or confidence
in Gods promises, if it be not supported with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
feare of his iudgements threatned, is in true
language but presumption; It cannot bring forth the
prayers of faith. For prayers made in faith presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and include a sincere renouncing or relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those desires or practises which by nature, or
course of Gods Iustice, are either incompatible


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7862:38"/>
with the blessings which we pray or hope for; or
are the causes of the evils threatned or inflicted. He
that will offer the sacrifice of prayer unto God for
his health, must abandon all excesse and riot; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he doth but mocke God. And he that suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
for the forgivenes of his sinnes, must be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in heart to forgive such as have sinned or tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
against him. 'Tis our Saviours owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the prayer which hee hath taught us.
And hence the heathen Cynick did justly deride
such supplicants and sacrificers as continued in riot
whilst they tendered their prayers and sacrifices to
intreat Gods favour towards themselves for health.
Whilst we retaine malitious or revengefull purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
towards our neighbours, it is to put in a caveat
against our owne suits or petitions in the court of
heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now unto this qualification or preparative unto
prayer, which consists in the abandoning of those
practises or resolutions which stand as a barre or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat
against our petitions and supplications; there is
no meanes so effectuall, no method so compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as hearty and unfeined feare of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
It is the very arme or hand of faith, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooving
all such obstacles. For feare (as wee said
before) is the expectation of evill approaching. And
the apprehension of any remedilesse mischiefe, of
any greater inconvenience or inestimable evill, will
oversway the hope or expectation of any inferiour
good, be it matter of pleasure or commodity by
which two matters onely we are withdrawne from
goodnesse it selfe. And if any man bee altogether


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7862:39"/>
wedded unto temporary delights or contentments,
it is for want of feare. In the beginning of a storme
the Merchant or passenger will be unwilling to cast
any part, especially of his most pretious commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
over board; but in case, stormes increase, to his
sight or observation, if then the Pilot or Mariner can
perswade him, that the ship wherein he sailes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be speedily disburthened, will shortly sinke;
the certaine feare of loosing all will moove him to
part with one halfe, or instant dread of loosing his
owne life, will make him willing (if need so require)
to part with all. The griping Vsurer will be ready
to release the unconscionable interest covenanted
for, if the Lawyer in whom he trusts can perswade
him, that by rigorous exaction of the use he may
come to loose the principall, or to incurre a censure
from which both use and principall will not free
him. The case of <hi>Iudah</hi> in this extremity was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same, if we compare the iudgements threatned by
<hi>Micah</hi> with the nature and quality of the sinnes that
had provoked them) as you may finde in the Prophet
<hi>Micah 3. 9. They build up Sion with blood, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and the Priests therereof teach for hire, and the
Prophets thereof divine for money.</hi> Now untill these
greedy hopes of unlawfull gaine were abandoned,
they could not pray in faith. The ministration of
publique Iustice for private reward, the Priests teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for hire, and the Prophets divination for money,
would (respectively) turne their very prayers into
sinne. Now what meanes could be more effectuall
for abandoning these and the like sinnes then the


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7862:39"/>
iudgement which the Prophet there threatned from
the Lord? <hi>Therefore shall Sion for your sake be plowed
as a field, and Ierusalem shall become heapes, and the
mountaine of the house as the high places of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
Micah</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                  <p>If the heads of the house of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and Princes of
the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> to whom this message is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
did sincerely and truly beleive him that sent
it, they could not but feare, least without their spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
repentance the Lord would quickly accomplish
whatsoever the Prophet in his name had threatned.
Now hearty and unfained feare <hi>that Sion should be
plowed as a field, that Ierusalem should become a heape,</hi>
would move all such as had not their habitation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but the very roote of their livelyhood in them, to
lay a better foundation of their owne, and of their
posterities welfare, than bloud and violence. It
would incline the hearts of their Rulers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
to breake off their iniquity by sincere admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of Iustice: by almes-deeds and workes of
mercy. Feare againe least the mountaine of the
house, that is, the Temple (or whose flourishing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
the livelyhood and welfare of Priests and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
did so depend, as the Passengers life doth on
the safety of the ship wherein hee sailes) would
worke their hearts to an observance of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or qualifications, to the performance of all the
conditions which are required to faithfull and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
praiers. But of the conditions of successefull
praiers, and of the qualification of good Suppliants,
fitter occasion will offer it selfe hereafter. Thus
much towards this purpose wee have gotten from


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7862:40"/>
these generals, that the hearts of men which have
been long accustomed or hardened in perverse cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of grosser sinnes, will hardly be new moulded or
refashioned according or wrought unto the temper
and modell of <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> heart, until they be made
to melt with feare of such Iudgements as <hi>Micah</hi>
here theatened against <hi>Iudah, Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Sion.</hi>
For producing this melting or mollifying feare the
considerations are specially three. First, the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
or apprehensions of such sinnes as specially
provoke Gods anger, or sollicite his Iudgments.
Secondly, a faithfull recounting of divine forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
or monitions past, especially if they have been
grossely neglected or usually sleighted. Thirdly,
the Inspection of the instrumentall causes, or meanes
in probability appointed for the execution of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
threatened; or a diligent observance of the
signes of the time.</p>
                  <p>As these be the speciall meanes for begetting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
feare: so the best method for nurturing up
such feare begotten, that it neither grow slavish nor
wilde, that it end not in desperation, is to know in
what sence, the Lord is said to repent. For the sinnes
which specially provoke Gods fearefull iudgement
against any land or people, wee cannot have a more
distinct view of them in breife, than from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Micah</hi> in the forecited place. Bribery and
corruption in the seates of Iustice: oppressions and
cruelty in the mighty and wealthy, mercenary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizings
in the sonnes of <hi>Levi;</hi> every one of these
diseases is dangerous, though alone: but when they
all meete in any state or kingdome, they grow dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7862:40"/>
Or if <hi>Micah</hi> may be no further allowed of, than
of a single witnesse, we may adde unto him the like
testimonies of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> who lived in the
same time with him. Corruption in the seate of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
did in his time taint the service of the Temple,
turned the prayers of the Rulers into sinne, and
made their sacrifices become abominable. <hi>Esay 1.
14.</hi> The very aversnesse or unwillingnesse of such
Rulers and oppressors as these were, to have the
law laid unto them by the Prophets, was a progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
of suddaine Iudgements approaching, <hi>Isaiah
30. 13. Therefore this iniquity shall bee to you
as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall,
whose breaking comes at an instant.</hi> Now if the
Priests and Prophets, whose office it is to discover
and repaire such breaches, doe but dawbe them
with untempered mortar, and so hide aud cover
them from their sight, whom it concernes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of them; by this doing, they draw the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
within the reach of that ruine and destruction,
which like a trap or snare was ready to fall upon
them. Or least any should suspect that these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnosticks
did serve only for <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> the
same Prophet instructs us, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 47. that it was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and cruelty towards such as <hi>shee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,</hi>
which did draw Gods Iudgements upon
<hi>Babel.</hi> But that which made them to fall so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
and unexpectedly upon them, was the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and man-pleasing humors of her Soothsayers
and Diviners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> were at this time sicke of all
those three diseases, and therefore had iust cause to


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7862:41"/>
feare the iudgements threatned;</p>
                  <p>Quid, quod &amp; hos morbos gravius symptoma sequatur?</p>
                  <p>There is a symptome mentioned by the Prophet
<hi>Micah,</hi> which was worse then the diseases them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<hi>yet will they leane upon the Lord, and say, Is
not the Lord among us? None ill can come upon us.
v.</hi> 11. Elsewhere we reade this people taxed by
Gods Prophets for trusting sometimes in lyes;
sometimes in oppression or violence; oft times for
putting confidence in their owne strength, or in the
strength of their confederates. But of any branch
of this fault they were not at this time guilty; yet
taxed no lesse, as being no lesse taxe-worthy, shall I
say, for trusting the Lord, or rather (as the Prophet
saith) for leaning on the Lord? That is, for presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
on his favour in the consciousnesse of such
sinnes as they now stood charged with. That to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
on Gods wonted favours or ordinary prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the consciousnesse of extraordinary sinnes
is a most grievous sinne against God, (best propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by his sinne against Gods Deputy, who being
infected with some dangerous disease should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to rest himselfe upon the royall chaire,) is a
truth unquestionable. But why this people, being
thus dangerously infected, should at this time spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
leane upon the Lord, and avouch his warrant
upon their protection, may well be questioned, &amp; not
unfitting to be inquired after. The reason (I take it) is
this; These peoples fore-elders, or these very men
themselves, in <hi>Ahaz</hi> time had usually beene indited
of Idolatry, and found guilty, specially of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in high places, aud serving groves and Idols.


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7862:41"/>
But <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the very beginning of his raigne,
remooved the high places, brake the Images, cut
downe the groves, brake in peeces the brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
that <hi>Moses</hi> had made. 2. <hi>Kings 18. v.</hi> 14. Nor
was hee more zealous in repressing all worships of
false Gods or Idolatry, then in restoring the service
and worship of the true God. Albeit hee had found
the Temple so strangely prophaned in the first
moneth of the yeare &amp; of his raigne, as might seeme
to require many moneths labour for it's preparation
&amp; cleansing; yet in the second moneth by his zealous
care, the feast of unleavened bread with the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and other parts of Gods service were celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with such publike ioy and solemnity, as the like
had not beene seene in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from the dayes of
<hi>Solomon</hi> the sonne of <hi>David,</hi> who consecrated the
Temple, as we read 2. <hi>Chron. 30. v.</hi> 26. In all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
the Heads and Rulers, the Priests and
Levites, with other parties principally taxed by the
Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> had gone along with their good
King, and no doubt had entred the same Covenant
with the Lord their God, which he resolved to do
2. <hi>Chron. 29. v.</hi> 10. and having thus returned unto
the God of their Fathers, they presumed that he
was now turned to them, and would be their Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
and Protector against their enemies. Albeit
they had seene their Brethren, the ten Tribes of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
about this time lead into captivity by the Affy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
yet this sad accident, through the deceitfulnesse
of hypocrisy, would in all likely hood adde more to
their presumption than to their feare. They were at
all times prone to iudge others rashly and therefore


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7862:42"/>
at this time would in all likelyhood suspect, that
this Iudgement had befalne <hi>Israel</hi> because they had
this plausible pretence or motive, that <hi>Israel</hi> for the
most part would not ioyne with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in this
reformation of religion, or restauration of Gods
service, but scoffed at his messengers, when they
were solemnely invited thereunto. But this refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
alas, was on <hi>Iudah's</hi> part (the King excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
but a lame or defective reformation. For whilst
they pulled downe idols in the high places, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the idols of covetousnesse, oppression, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
to bee enshrined in their hearts: whilst they
cleanse the Temple from materiall filth or propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and in the meane time harboured propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and uncleanesse in their owne breasts; they did
not turne to the Lord with their whole hearts, as
the Lord in the Law required, and <hi>Solomon</hi> in the
consecration of the Temple did on their part ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate
and covenant.</p>
                  <p>However an halfe reformation was better then
none. Lesse evill it was to have no Idols or Images
in the high places, no prophanesse in the Temple:
then to have Idols both in their breasts, and in the
woods, then to have the Temple of God and their
hearts alike prophaned. This is true; yet whilst they
rest perswaded, that the Lord will graciously accept
of their lame sacrifice, that is, of this superficiall, or
halfe reformation, or that he was tied by promise
to performe the mercies, which he promised to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Solomon</hi> upon true repentance, unto them, as
they were now affected, <hi>Laude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cum crimine pensant,</hi>
this confidence or presumption was worse then the


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7862:42"/>
abuses which they had reformed. To rely or leane
upon the Lord in the consciousnesse of those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying
sinnes, was perfect hypocrisie; And that is,
if not worse farre, altogether as bad, as downe-right
open Idolatry. And the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> would
give posterity to understand, that these delinquents
presumption upon Gods favour, before they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their grosse sins or delinquences, did provoke
Gods fierce wrath against them, more then the sins
themselves did. They presumed God would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
favourable unto them for <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
and <hi>Sion's</hi> sake; at least for the Temples sake, seeing
the Lord had chosen that place to put his name
there. But the righteous Lord by his Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
himselfe to be so farre from this partiality or
respect of persons, that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for their sakes
should become an heape; that <hi>Sion</hi> for their sakes
should bee plowed as a field; that the Temple, in
which they trusted, should for their sakes be made
like the high places of the forrest.</p>
                  <p>The summe or resultancy of all that hath beene
said, is this; That as in every Nation he that feareth
God and worketh righteousnesse is accepted of
him: So in whatsoever place or Nation bribery
and oppression in the laiety, mercenary temporizing
in the clergy, and hypocrisie in most sorts abound,
Gods fearefull iudgements still doe gather as they
encrease; and without repentant prayers and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
are suddainly powred out like a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>showre.</p>
                  <p>But this <hi>thesis</hi> or <hi>Maior</hi> proposition will have the
faithfull assent of all good Christians. All the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7862:43"/>
will bee in framing a <hi>Minor</hi> or assumption,
which shall runne parallell with this <hi>Maior;</hi> That
is to perswade the Magistracy, the Gentry, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of any state or kingdome, that they are respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
as faulty, as deeply guilty of these sinnes, as
men of their ranke and place were in the state of
<hi>Iudah</hi> in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> daies. All that I have to say in
this point, for the present, is to beseech Almighty
God, that every man amongst us whom it concerns
(and it more or lesse concernes all) may enter into
his owne heart, and may unpartially examine
and iudge himselfe, that this land and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be never so iudged of the Lord, as
<hi>Micah</hi> had threatned <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and
<hi>Iudah</hi> should be, in the daies of
good <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N hard taske it would bee to
perswade the Magistracy, the
Gentry and Cleargy of any
state or kingdome throughout
Christendome, that they are as
deepely guilty of these sinnes,
as men of their place and ranke
in <hi>Iudah</hi> were, against whom
<hi>Micah</hi> denounced that terrible judgement.</p>
                  <p>Against all that we can alleage to this purpose,
there is one generall exception, alike common to all
our hearers whom it concernes. They must believe


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7862:44"/>
that the state of <hi>Iudah</hi> was deepely tainted with bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
corruption, and oppression, because the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Micah</hi> hath said it. But moderne preachers are
no Prophets, nor is all which they say to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
any part either of Gods law or Gospell.
The exception indeed is thus farre pertinent, that
the same spirit of God, which taught the Prophets
to foresee evills to come or judgements approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
did likewise notifie unto them many matters of
fact present or past, which did provoke Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But of the like matters of their fact with their
qualities, such as are no Prophets can have no just
notice, can have no better knowledge of them then
by here-say. Now faith commeth not by here-say,
nor may the messenger of God so farre believe, all
that he heares, though from many mouthes, as to
make it matter for the pulpit. Yet one of these two
we must believe, we may be certaine of; either that
the Magistrates, Nobles and Cleargy of this Realm
are as faulty, as men of their ranke and place in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
were in <hi>Micahs</hi> time: or that the people of this
kingdome are more malitious and slanderous, at
least more quarelous then the people of <hi>Iudah</hi>
were. If <hi>Vox populi</hi> were alwaies <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> we might
proceede with warrant of Gods word to make the
same conclusion that <hi>Micah</hi> did, to thunder out
present judgement against the Court, against the
chiefe cities of his kingdome, and against the
Church established in this kingdome.</p>
                  <p>2 But whether are more faulty, Magistrates
and Superiours in giving just occasion to bee thus
thought of, or inferiours in taking occasion where


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7862:44"/>
none is given, or greater then is justly given, this I
leave to the searcher of all hearts, who hath reserved
the judgements of times and seasons and of mens
demerits in them unto himselfe alone by peculiar
right of prerogative. The most usefull point that I
can pitch upon, will be to discover the errours or
fallacies by which we usually deceive our selves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
whilst we endeavour to examine or judge our
selves.</p>
                  <p>3 Now as into cities strongly fortified, well
stored with men and victualls, the enemy oft times
findes entrance, either by the negligence of the
watch, or at some secret places for the time <hi>ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
So into Churches or common weales well
grounded in points of faith and Orthodoxall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and abounding with all spirituall foode, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and ruine (such judgement as <hi>Micah</hi> here
threatned) finde easie passage by a twofold negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or incogitancy, rather then grosse errour. The
first incogitancy common to most is, that we hold
it sufficient to repent us of our owne sinnes or of the
sinnes of our owne times. The second, that even
such as are willing to take an accurate view aswell
of their fore-fathers or predecessors sinnes, as
as of their owne sinnes, or of the sinnes of the time
and place where they live, do often use a false or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
scale. For preventing the first incogitance,
we are to consider, that albeit God do never punish
the children for their fathers sinnes, yet he usually
visits the sinnes of the father upon the children, at
least with temporall plagues or punishments, aswell
publique as private. And this visitation is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7862:45"/>
drawne upon posterity, not so much by a
pronenes to imitate their fore-elders in those actuall
sinnes by which they did first provoke Gods wrath,
as by a promptnesse to maintaine the Arts of their
fore-elders (without addition unto them) especially
if they have beene warranted by any kind of <hi>lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
For children not to confesse the sinnes of their
forefathers, not to repent of them, not to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for them, (so farre as, they have beene iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to men) is by the rule of divine Iustice sufficient
to charge the inheritance, which descends unto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
with the punishments due to their actuall
transgressions from whom it descends. Not to visit
the sinnes immediately upon the first transgressions
or transgressors, but to give them and their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
a larger time for repentance, is a branch of
Gods long suffring and mercy. But to visit the sins,
not duely repented of by the first and second, upon
the third and fourth generation, is a branch of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
declared and avouched by God himselfe in the
second commandement. But this point will meet us
againe in the reformation attempted by the good
<hi>Iosias.</hi> The second incogitance is more pertinent to
this place, and in it selfe more dangerous. And it is
this. Many which carefully endeavour to frame
their lives and actions by the propheticall rule, are
not so carefull and provident to measure theire
transgressions by the propheticall scale, or by the
ballance of the Sanctuary, but according to the rate
of moderne corrupt language. Thus when we heare
the Prophets compare the oppressors or corrupt
Magistrates of their times to ravenous wolves, to


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7862:45"/>
brambles or thorny hedges most men instantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the parties whom Gods Prophets (which
were no slanderers) did thus deepely censure, had
taken away their neighbours lives or goods by
strong hand, by some notorious disturbance of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
peace, by such palpable facts, as with us are
said to be contrary to the crowne and dignity of the
Prince. And by this grosse calculation many Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,
and Magistrates, many that take upon them to
be reformers of others, runne further upon the score
of Gods wrath then the Iewish Rulers in <hi>Mica's</hi>
time did, before they bethinke themselves of any
danger. Many againe of tender consciences in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of divers duties whereof others make no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when they heare or reade the woes denounced
against hypocrites will with the Poet detest such
lying lips, <hi>even as the gates of Hell,</hi> which speake
well, and meane ill; which have God in theire
mouths, and the Divell in their hearts. But he that
measures this sinne of Hypocrisie by this Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
scale, may come to make up the full measure of
it, before he hath charged it upon his accompts, or
bethinke himselfe to be in such arrerrages for this
sinne, as deserves to be called for.</p>
                  <p>4 By the same oversight many people which
firmely believe the propheticall rules to be most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
true, make up the measure of their iniquity,
before they have made up their intended accounts,
or suspect themselves to be in any such arrerrages
as may deserve the Prophets censure, or to be called
upon by threatning Gods Iudgements. The error it
selfe is much what the same, as if a factor which


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7862:46"/>
stands charged with a thousand pounds sterling ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the old hanse or esterling pay should
make up his private reckonings according to the rate
of pounds or coyne this day currant throughout
this kingdome; he which thus accompts for any
great summe, must needs fall into the error of the
Church of the Laodiceans <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. to thinke himselfe
rich or well before hand when hee <hi>is poore and
wretched</hi> and lyable to a debt, unsatisfiable by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
unsupportable by his friends, yet our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts
unto God we make up for the most part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this
manner.</p>
                  <p>5. To make these different calculations agree,
or to reforme or rectify our corrupt language by
the rule of the Sanctuary, that which wee usually
call warrines in dealing, or wit to use the benefit of
the Law, or the advantage of times in making bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines;
<hi>This in the propheticall</hi> language is <hi>hunting
our brother with a net,</hi> and whereas the Prophet
saith of the Iudges and Magistrates of his times, that
even <hi>the best of them was but a bramble and the most
upright amongst them as a thorny hedge.</hi> This is the
very <hi>Scantlings</hi> of the fayrest course of legall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
which poore men in time shall finde. The
least protection which the customary course of law
affords unto them, is but like the shelter which silly
sheepe in a storme, find under a hedge of thorne, or
bush of brambles. However the law may protect
them from the violence which other intend against
them, yet shall they be sure to leave their fleece for
this protection. It is a thing much to be wish'd that
either the courts of temporall law were not so open,


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7862:46"/>
or the doores of the Sanctuary might be closer shut
than they are, specially against such as are upon pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
occasions, farre more ready to spend a hundred
pounds in legall vexation of his neighbour, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
brother, than to give an hundred pence for
Christ's sake, or his Church, be the cause never so
urgent, or iust. That which in the language of great
landlords is no more then to make the most or best
of their owne, is in the Prophets dialect neither bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor worse, then to play the <hi>ravenous wolves to
eate the flesh, and gnaw the bones of their poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It <hi>Micah</hi> or <hi>Ieremy</hi> or <hi>Zephany</hi> were now alive,
and should see many poore hunger-starved wretches
whose freinds and parents had beene undone by
racking of rents, or hard bargaines, or by suites of
law, they would take the boldnesse upon them to
plucke our bravest gallants, our wealthiest Citizens
our greatest landlords, our gravest lawyers by the
sleeves in the open street and tell them to their faces,
the limbs and bones of these poore wretches are in
the beames and rafters of your stately houses, their
flesh and bloud is in your dainty dishes you sucke
their very marrow in your pleasant cups. <hi>The bread
of the poor,</hi> saith the son of Sirach, <hi>is the life of the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
he that deprives him of it is a man of bloud, he that
taketh away his neighbours living slayeth him, and he
that defraudeth the labour of his heire is a bloud-shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Ecclus.</hi> 34. 21. 22. This Character goes deeper
then a murtherer with us. So doth the Prophet <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany</hi>
censure of the corrupt Rulers in his time,
exceed the Notion which we have of Canibals, <hi>the


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7862:47"/>
Princes of the oppressing City are roaring Lions, her
Iudges, are evening wolves, they gnaw not the bones
untill tomorrow. Zephan.</hi> 3. 3. But are not the sonnes
of <hi>Levi</hi> in our times as liable to these Prophets cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
concerning the Priests and Prophets of <hi>Iudah</hi>
in their daies? Hath the Cleargy no portion in the
measure of this lands iniquity? Surely if the
sinnes of this land that at any time within these
forty yeares past had beene divided into tenne
parts, the transgressions of the pulpit and Print-houses
would have largely made up a tenth part.
And they have not in any point more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
then either in giving this people a false,
or in not giving them a true <hi>Scale</hi> of that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
which the spirit of God so much condemnes.
A kinde of hypocrisie there is which consists in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
one thing and meaning another: but this
is so grosse that the very heathens detest it. The
greatest cunning or proficiency that practitioners in
this kinde attaine unto, is to deceive others not
themselves. To applaude their owne wits, men
of this guise may have some occasion, but no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to applaud themselves for extraordinary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
or sanctity of life, whereas to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
more then any others? To thinke themselves
more righteous and religious then their neighbours,
is the inseparable Symptome of hypocrisie truely
pharisaicall, this is a disease of the soule which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be directly intended or caused? It hath it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only by resultance, and it alwaies results from
an extraordinary measure of zeale, but of zeale ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
or not uniformely dispensed throughout


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7862:47"/>
the whole body of Christian religious duties. Now,
wheresoever zeale is not uniforme or free from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
the greater zeale men beare unto some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
duties, as to hearing of the word; or that
which they conceive to be the forme of wholesome
doctrine; or to observance of rules, for avoiding
superstition or prophanesse; the more censorious they
become of others, and more uncharitable towards
all that will not comply with them in their rigid
zeale or curiosity of reformation. It was not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
nicety, but an interanall zeale of strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of gnats which did so blind and embolden
the Pharisees to swallow Camels. They knew
themselves to bee as free from grosse Idolatry,
and were as zealous reformers of it and breach
of Sabboth as any living men could be, yet these
were the two speciall sinnes for which their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
were punished, and out of that deepe
notice which they had in reforming these grosse
abuses they said, as they were perswaded, if
wee had lived in the daies of our forefathers wee
would not have beene partakers with them in the
bloud of the Prophets, and yet by thus judging
their forefathers they did condemne themselves,
and were even then making up the measure of their
iniquity, as our Saviour foretels them. <hi>Mat. 23. v.</hi> 32.
their meere overprising this reformation did bring
forth worse effects in them than worshipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
or breach of Saboth. Their fathers had killed
the Prophets for diswading them from these two
delightfull sinnes. These later <hi>Iewes</hi> put the Prince
of Prophets to death because he would not comply


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7862:48"/>
with them in the rigid reformation of these two
sinnes. This was the very roote of their extreame
hatred against him. Were there any Evangelicall
Prophets or men of Apostolicall spirits amongst
us, they might and would make application of
our Saviours speeches in particular to many
which take the name of professor or of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
religion as their owne peculiar, woe unto
you hypocrites, which say if we had lived in the
daies of the Scribes &amp; Pharisees we would not have
been partakers with them in the blood of the Sonne
of God. There is scarce a Christian which is not apt
to thinke thus charitably of himselfe, and your ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
minister cannot in particular disprove them,
only thus much wee know and forewarne in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<hi>Corruptio optimi semper pessima,</hi> that kind of
hypocrisie spleene or envy which ariseth from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
zeale or partiall observance of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
duties, is worse then that hypocrisie which
sprung from partiall observance of the law. For
men professing Christianity and great zeale unto
truth, to make up the measure of <hi>Iewish</hi> enmity
against Christ, to condemne themselves by judging
the Scribes and Pharisees as greater hypocrites then
themselves, is a matter as easie (God grant not as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall)
as it was for the <hi>Iewes</hi> to make up the measure
of their forefathers sinnes, and to condemne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by judging their Ancestours as more bloody
persecutors then they would have been in like case.</p>
                  <p>And if unto this branch of iniquity divination
for money and teaching for hire, naturally afford
nutriment, our sinnes have beene in these particulars


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7862:48"/>
more faulty then the times wherein <hi>Micah</hi> lived in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
likely-hood could be. The covetous Priests and
Prophets of <hi>Iudah</hi> were not meere hirelings; <hi>Iudah</hi>
I take it, had not many, few or none, whose mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
did wholy depend upon the voluntary bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
of them they were to teach.</p>
                  <p>2 Whereas amongst us the greater number of
such as take upon them to teach Gods people are
meere stipendiaries, and yet contend for the pulpit in
opposition to such as have their lively-hood from
the altar by course of law established, as eagerly as
the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> have done of late a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the chaire in the Vniversities of Spaine. Vpon
these occasions the meanest corporation amongst
us, though consisting for the most part of apron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
have found opportunities to have their fancies
humoured, and their eares tickled by their hireling
shepheards, after a more delicate manner then any
heathen Emperour, or Christian King could ever
procure from their parasites; and the sheapheards
reflattered by their flocks into an higher conceit of
themselves, then any Pope pretends unto. For
though the Roman consistory usurpe the Monopoly
of the Holy Spirit, and of his gifts; yet neither doth
the Pope take upon him to secure the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> nor
the <hi>Cardinals</hi> to secure him, that whensoever either
of them dye, they shall infalliby be saved, and bee as
glorious Saints as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to morrow, if they
chance to dye this day. But why doth the Prophet
<hi>Micah,</hi> when he assignes the causes of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
threatned, mention only the sinnes of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Magistrates, and Clergy? Was not the people


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7862:49"/>
at that time infected with the popular diseases of all
times, as with adultery, murther, luxury of all kinds
and prophanenesse. No doubt they were: and doe
not these sinnes deserve vengeance? They doe. Yet
the iudgements due unto them are usually charged
upon the transgressors themselves, not upon the
land or state wherein they live; unlesse the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
transgressors escape unpunished, by the conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence
or corruption of rulers; in this case the sinnes
of private men become the sinnes of the land, and
solicite publique visitations. So doth oppression,
specially when it is practised by men of authority
upon the poore and helples men. Of others wrongs,
or of wrong done unto others, that which <hi>Eli</hi> said
unto his Sonnes 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. is most ture. <hi>If one
man sinne against another, the judge shall judge him;
but if a man sinne against the Lord, who shall intreat
for him?</hi> Now when iudges and Magistrates suffer
the poore and helplesse to suffer wrong, they sinne
against the Lord: for though he be Lord of all, and
the avenger of all wrongs, yet is he in speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the protector of the fatherlesse, widow, and the
helpelesse; and what can be more iust, then that they
which oppresse their helplesse brethren, should be
opprest by foraine enemies? And how ever men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
of us the Sonnes of <hi>Levi,</hi> we are by Gods
ordinance and appointment, as fathers to our flocke
committed to our charge; and though wee haue not
that coercive authority over them, which <hi>Eli</hi> had
over his sonnes, yet we shall partake of his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if wee prove not more faithfull remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of their negligences and transgressions, then <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi>


                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:7862:49"/>
was to the Sonnes of his body. Finally, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinnes which <hi>Micah</hi> taxed, were their sinnes
which did commit them, so their leaning upon the
Lord in the consciousnesse of such sinnes were the
sinnes of the Priests and Prophets, which should
have forewarned them of the wrath to come, and
have put them in mind of their strange neglect of
warnings past. That the neglect of Gods forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
or summons to repentance, whether these be
meere monitions, or mixt with punishments, is a
fearefull Symptome of a dangerous disease, and,
without repentance, a presage of death, is a point so
common and knowne, as it needs no proofe. The
divers kindes of such fore-warnings, sometimes
given by the hoste of reasonlesse creatures, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by the reasonable, and the danger increasing
by their neglect, are pathetically recounted by the
Prophet <hi>Amos. Chap.</hi> 4. with this item or cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
still repeated at the neglect of every message, <hi>yet
have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord; And I also
have given you cleannesse of teeth in all your cities, and
want of bread in all your places; yet have ye not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto me; saith the Lord. And also I have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
the raine from you, when there were yet three
moneths to the harvest &amp;c. v. 6. 7. I have smitten
you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and
your vineyards, and your fig-trees, and your olive-trees
increased, the palmer-worme devoured them, yet have
ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. I have sent
among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt,
your yong men have I slaine with the sword, and have
taken away your horses, and I have made the stioke of


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7862:50"/>
your camps to come up unto your nostrils, yet have ye
not returned unto me, saith the Lord. v.</hi> 10. The same
burden is twice repeated in the verses following, for
not returning unto the Lord after two calamities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon them, distinct from the former, as well
for time as quality. The space or distance of time
betweene the first and last of these fore-warnings
was so long, that many of them which had knowne
the first, or could take notice of it, were dead before
the last approached; &amp; most of them, whom the last
message did specially concerne, were unborne, when
the first warning was given. And yet the neglect of it
is laid to their charge; &amp; of all these fore-warnings or
chastisements (beside the desolation of some cities)
there is scarce one which hath not beene paralleld
by the like given to this kingdome long agoe.</p>
                  <p>9 To begin with that which most resembles
this fore-warning given by the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this people, <hi>Sion for your sakes shall be plowed as a
field.</hi> This was to them a meere monition, for God
repented of the plague denounced against them;
such was the powder-plot unto us. It was a gentle
monition of a fearefull iudgement. For however
such as foretold it were lying Prophets, Sonnes of
<hi>Belial,</hi> whom no sonne or child of God was bound
to believe, when they threatned iudgement, yet the
warning which God in mercy gave us by them was
truly reall. The sepulchers of our Kings were
neerer the point to have been more pittifully plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then <hi>Sennacherib</hi> intended to plow <hi>Sion,</hi> or the
city of <hi>David,</hi> when in the daies of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> he did
besiege it; Gods mercy towards us was that time


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7862:50"/>
no lesse, then at any time it had beene unto <hi>Sion;</hi> our
deliverance, though not so miraculous, was yet no
lesse wonderfull for valuation, then <hi>Ierusalems</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> army, shortly after this
fore-warning by <hi>Micah.</hi> But did either warning or
deliverance take the same effect with us, as the like
had done with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his people? Herein we
truly imitate <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> not so much in the use,
which he made of this forewarning, as in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
after his recovery from his sicknesse, that
we doe not render according to the reward bestow'd
upon us. An anniversary thanksgiving was upon
our delivery by publique authority presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
and hath since by all sorts of men profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
true religion (to the eyes of men) beene duely
observed. Vnto this day yong and old, whilst they
blesse God for his mercies, accurse the malice of
such as did project that fearefull plague against us:
and his curse be upon him that shall thinke either
their practise, or principles whence they inferred
or sought to warrant it, can bee detested too much.
Yet for all this we may detest their practise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yea we may magnifie Gods mercies towards
us, though never too much, yet much amisse. If our
acknowledgement of his mercies had been, or were
yet sincere and intire; our feare of his judgements e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since that time, would hve held full equipoize
with our hatred or detestation of our adversaries
mischievous imaginations against us. For the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
eye of his all-seeing providence, and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
stedfast hand, by which he wields the scales
of justice, would not have suffered his consuming


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7862:51"/>
wrath to come any nearer to us, then we were come
unto the full measure of our iniquity.</p>
                  <p>10 The first thing which then was, or now is
to be enquired after, is what were the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and speciall sinnes, which drew Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
so neare upon us. These were not the cruelty
of lawes enacted against professors of that religion
which these traitors professed, as they as foolishy as
impiously alleadge; nor was the negligence or
connivence of such as were put in trust with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of these lawes the cause of the iudgement
then threatned, as some others out of misguided
zeale suspect. Of such negligence or omission or of
whatsoever else may give any advantage to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
of our peace and religion, there were some
positive causes in our selves, God only knowes how
many; but of these we cannot but take notice which
the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> expresseth, or some like unto
them, as sacriledge, oppression, and bribery in the
layty; Simony and time-serving in the Clergy;
luxury, prophanenesse, and hypocrisie in both. Now
when the professors of true religion shall give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
proofe of their constant and impartiall
zeale against these foule enormities, or for enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after the most enormous delinquents in all these
kindes; there will bee good hope that the lawes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
enacted or projected against idolatry, against
superstition and false religion, shall have their wished
successe. But suppose that upon the occasion or
opportunity, which these idolatrous miscreants
had in a manner thrust into the hands of our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
the suppression of idolatry and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7862:51"/>
throughout this land had been more exact and
more compleat, then that which <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his raigne, had wrought in <hi>Judah:</hi> Was
there any probability that those other diseases, which
<hi>Micah</hi> mentions, would have beene one jot abated?
any likely-hood that the most amongst us would
not have learned that song or ditty by heart, <hi>is not the
Lord now amongst us;</hi> or the Antiphony unto it, would
have been, <hi>no evill can come upon us.</hi> Other grosse
exorbitancies usually come within the stroake of
the civill sword, and lye open to the execution of
wholesome lawes: but for snipping this secret hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
or presumptuous leaning upon the Lord,
though in the professors of true religion, the severest
execution of wholesome lawes, or exercise of the
civill sword, hath no force or dint, the cure of this
disease properly belongs unto the Divine, and the
method to cure it, is contrary to the ordinary course
of law or physicke; wee must breake a generall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of this people, and teach them not to rare
their affections unto truth by their opposition unto
false-hood, not to measure their zeale and love to
true religion by their hatred of false religion. These
be the very rootes of that hypocrisie or presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which <hi>Micah</hi> so deeply taxeth in the state of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
the chiefe ingredient in the leaven of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees.</p>
                  <p>But lest more of this people should slide into an
errour too common unto many, as if such a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of religion, as they affect, would acquit or
secure the state and kingdome from all danger of
Gods threatned judgements; let us here behold the


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7862:52"/>
severity and mercy of our gratious God. Mercy, I
say, towards us, and severity towards our brethren
professors of reformed religion in neighbour nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whom he hath of late subiected to the enemies
sword, and other calamities of warre; for what
transgression in particular, hee only knowes; but
surely not for those transgressions, which some out
of discontented zeale conceive to be the only cause
of his displeasure against this nation, whensoever
any crosse or calamity befals themselves; for no
man can suspect those foraine Churches, which he
hath visited of late, were deepely guilty either of
connivance to superstition, or to much favouring Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianisme.
However, the righteous Lord by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stising
them doth fore-warne us to examine and
judge our selves, and if we find no other causes or
probable occasions to feare the approach of the like
Iudgements upon our selves; yet even this alone
will in the day of visitation make a great addition
to our generall accompt, that we did not humble our
selves with feare and trembling whilst the Lord did
humble and correct them, whilst his hand was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
upon such of our nation as were sent abroad for
their succour. Our consciences will one day accuse
us (when wee shall have occasion to seeke the Lord)
that we have not for the yeares late past besought
his goodnesse with greater feare and devotion, to
remoove the rod of his wrath from them.</p>
                  <p>But did the Lord in this interim direct no mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
of his wrath unto us within our own coasts?
Did mortality and famine only follow the campe
abroad, or townes besieged in other nations? The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7862:52"/>
(Gods name be praised for it) hath not for
many yeares beene either universally spread
throughout this land, or extraordinary grievous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any greater portion of it, and yet hath left so
deepe impression in some native members of this
great body, as may evidently convince the rest of
great stupidity in not sympathizing more deepely
with them. And stupidity or dulnesse in any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
whilst other suffer, is an infallible Symptome of
a dangerous disease, oft-times a certaine progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke
of death; and hee were but an indocile Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that could not by those knowne calamities,
which much people of this land have suffered from
this messenger, instruct himselfe, how easie it is for
the righteous Iudge to bring such calamity upon
this kingdome by this messenger alone, as would
move even the most malicious and cruell enemies
that we have had, to bemoane our case, although we
were fully assured of a constant peace with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neighbour-nations, that have any power or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to annoy us by the sword, or any practice of
hostility. Rome in her growth, in her height of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and in her declining dayes had received ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
grievous wounds, was subiect in all estates
to fearefull calamities and disasters; yet never in
such a lamentable and ruefull plight as the famine
had brought her to, if wee may iudge of her inward
griefe either by her bitter outcries,<note place="margin">Vid. plura a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Claudia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num initio bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Gildonici.</note> or by the deie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

our selves which will so much affect us, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7862:53"/>
of that which we our selves have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suffered. It will not then, I hope, be unseasonable
to put you in minde, how in these later times whilst
neighbour nations addresse their Embassadors to
to this court, either to condole the death of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes,
or to congratulate our ioy for the happy
continuance of royall succession, there still hath
come one unwelcome or unexpected Embassador
either with them, or before them, to this people.
And however he seeme to plead for the grave, yet
his message is from heaven, and for our peace;
though he find audience for the most part with nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
sicke, or dying men, yet his instructions are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
directed to the living and potent amongst
us, and the tenure of them is in effect thus, thinke
you that those whom the Lord hath wounded with
his poisonous arrowes were greater sinners then
your selves, or that they have suffered more
then they have deserved? I tell you nay, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
yee repent, yee shall all likewise perish; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
you prepare your hearts to meet the Lord
while hee is on the way, a greater plague then the
plague of pestilence, is comming against you.
Yet hath that plague beene twice in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
more fearefull, then in the daies of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.
To omit that great mortality, which was
almost universall throughout this land about twenty
seaven yeares agoe; The calamities which followed
upon the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> arrivall, or returne of this Embassadour
about 5 yeares agoe did leave a live print or chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of that feare, by which the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
the day of the Lord. <hi>Amos. 5. v. 18. 19. The day


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7862:54"/>
of the Lord, saith he, is darknesse, and not light, as if
a man did flye from a Lion, and a Beare met him, and
went into the house, and leane his hand on the wall, and
a Serpent bit him.</hi> Many fled from the great city,
as a man would flye from a Lion, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
safe, if they could get into a ship for some
other port, but sped no better then if they had met
with a Beare, death being as ready, as they were, to
imbarque it selfe as a passenger for every port, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
to execute his commission, as well by sea, as by
land; others comming to the shore were more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourlesse
in the wished for haven, then if they had
committed themselves to the mercilesse waves of
the sea, which way soever they tooke, their case was
like unto a stricken deare, <hi>haeret lateri letalis arundo.</hi>
They could not shift aside from Gods arrow, which
still tooke up some vitall part for his marke?
Some after their arrivall in their native soyle wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
without companions to support them in their
weaknesse, and lastly dyed in the fresh and open aire,
without that comfort which the infected places,
from which they fled, might have afforded them:
without consorts in their sighes and grones, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such mutuall expressions of griefe as Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
of nature brings forth in the beastes of the
field.</p>
                  <p>But amongst the wofull spectacles, which the
calamity of those times presented, none me thinkes
more apt to imprint the terrour of Gods iudgements
deeper, then to have seen men, otherwise of undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
spirits, men whom no enemies lookes or braggs
could afright, afrayd to hold parley with their native


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7862:54"/>
countrey-men that came unto them with words of
love and peace, more agast to embrace their dearest
friends or nearest kinsfolks, then to graspe an adder,
or a snake. The plague of pestilence is above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diseases catching, and such as have beene most
observant of it's course, tell us, men of covetous
mindes or unseasonably greedy of gaine are usually
soonest caught by it, though exposed to no greater,
or more apparent visible danger, then others are.
The course which this messenger of death observes
(if these mens observation of it be true) may leade
our conjecture to one speciall cause why it was sent
amongst us with such large commission, surely if
in the daies of health and peace it had not beene usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
for one neighbour to prey upon another, and to
verifie the saying <hi>homo homini lupus;</hi> the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood
and presence of men of the same nation
and profession would not have become more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto others, then if their habitations had beene
amongst Wolves, or Lions, or other ravenous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But to what end soever this fearefull mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
was sent amongst us, the tenor of his message
either was not well understood, or is not perfectly
remembred. And for this reason his commission
hath beene renewed of late in the times of our
hopes and joy for the continuance of royall succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in a straight line. But Gods name be ever blessed,
who hath hitherto so tempered his judgements with
mercy, that we have more just cause of joy and
thanksgiving for the birth of one, then of sorrow
for the death of many. Yet let not this, I beseech
you, abate our feare of future judgements, or occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

or will repent of the evill which hee hath so often

done. That thus we may doe, let us pray continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>Hezekias</hi> did, that he would teach us to pray, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekias</hi>

comply with the Princes, whose verdict was, that
he was not worthy to die, because he had spoken to
them in the name of the Lord their God. And vpon
this verdict, the elders of the land giue judgment
from a ruled case in the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> who had
spoken more terrible words against both citie and
temple in more peremptory manner, then <hi>Ieremy</hi>
now had done, and yet not therefore put to death,
but reverenced by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as you haue it in the
beginning of this 19. verse. <hi>Did Hezekiah king of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
and all Iudah put Micah at all to death? Did he
not feare the Lord, and besought the Lord?</hi>

as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was could not moue them, yet the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
successe of his practise should in reason allure
them, to deale more mildly with <hi>Ieremy,</hi> then was
intended by them. For vpon <hi>Hezekia's</hi> prayers, and
repentance, <hi>the Lord repented him of the euill which
he had pronounced against Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Sion:</hi> and
when they further adde, <hi>thus might we procure great
euill against our soules,</hi> they imply thus much, that
if this present assembly doe not repent of their ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
against <hi>Ieremy,</hi> the Lord would not repent
of the euill, which by his mouth he had pronounced
against them.</p>
                  <p>The points which offer themselues to be discussed
are but two. The first, in what sense God is said to
<hi>repent.</hi> The second, in what case it is said, <hi>that God
will not repent, or that he is not as man, or the sonne
of man, that he should repent.</hi>

out, <hi>who take vpon them to resolue this point,</hi> is
then said to repent when he doth not effect the evill
which he threatneth, or the good which he promiseth.</p>
                  <p>All this is true; yet no true definition, no iust ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of repentance; either as it is applyable in
Scripture to God or man. Most true it is, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
God is said to repent, it must be conceived,
that he did not effect either the euill which he
threatned, or the good which he promised: But it is
not reciprocally true, that whensoeuer God doth
not bring that euill of punishment to passe, which
he threatneth, it is rightly said or conceiued that he
did repent.</p>
                  <p>A loving father may sometimes threaten to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise,
sometimes promise to reward the sonne

to repent, albeit he neither chastise, nor reward him:
For hee may thus mingle threatnings with incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
with purpose only to try his present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition.</p>
                  <p>Thus we read that God, who is a most loving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to mankind; did command <hi>Abraham</hi> to sacrifice
his only sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> whom he loved. This was a
threatning command, at least in respect of <hi>Isaac.</hi>
Now albeit the Lord did withhold <hi>Abraham's</hi>
hand from executing this command: yet doe we not
read, nor is it to be conceived, that God did repent
of that which he gave <hi>Abraham</hi> in charge. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is because he charged <hi>Abraham</hi> thus to doe, not
with purpose to have <hi>Isaac</hi> then presently sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but only to try the sincerity and strength of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams'</hi>
faith, and obedience; and by this triall to


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7862:57"/>
gaine his assent unto the offring up of the seed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
from the beginning of the world, which was
from this time irreversibly ordained to be the seed
of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For seeing God from the beginning
had determined to give his only sonne for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of man, it was his good pleasure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this promise by oath unto a man, that was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to offer up his only sonne in sacrifice unto God,
and <hi>Abraham</hi> from this very intended worke as
<hi>S. Iames</hi> tels us, <hi>was called the friend of God:</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made to our first parents was now accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by way of contract, or covenant betwixt God
and <hi>Abraham</hi> that the sonne of God and seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
should bee offred up in sacrifice for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
unto all the nations of the earth. This being
the end or purpose of God in commanding <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
to sacrifice his only sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> in whom his
seed was called, there is no semblance of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in God, although he did withhold <hi>Abraham's</hi>
hand from doing that which he had commanded
him to doe.</p>
                  <p>They therefore come neerer unto the meaning
of the Holy Ghost in this particular expression, who
tell us that <hi>Deus tunc poenitere dicitur, quando non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
quod facturus erat. God is then said to repent when
he doth not that which he was about to doe, or that
which hee intended or purposed to have done.</hi> For
without a revocation or reversing of somewhat se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
purposed or intended, there can be no true
notion of repentance whether in God, in man, or
Angels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And this notion, or expression of repentance as


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7862:57"/>
it is attributed unto God in scripture, we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
delivered by the Prophet</hi> Ieremy. Chap, 18.
from v. 7. to the 11. At what instant I shall speake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a nation, and concerning a Kingdome to plucke
up, and to pull downe, and to destroy it; If that nation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom I have pronounced, turne from their evill,
I will repent of the evill that I thought to doe unto
them. And at what instant I shall speake concerning
a nation, and concerning a kingdome, to build and to
plant it: if it doe evill in my sight that it obey not my
voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I
would benefit them.</p>
                  <p>This generall to my observation was first
drawne into a rule or doctrinall forme by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ieremiah;</hi> yet the truth of the former part of it
was experienced long before in the men of <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi>
though contrary to the mind and expectation
of the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> not out of a nescience of this
rule, or Gods usuall dealing with men, but out of a
particular dislike, or discontent, that the sentence,
which God had commanded him to pronounce,
should not be put in execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The sentence was,</hi> yet 40 dayes and Nineveh shall
be destroyed Ionas 3. v. 4.</p>
                  <p>This solemne proclamation the Lord did dictate
unto him as it is. <hi>v.</hi> 2. Did the Lord thus speake to
try the <hi>Ninevites</hi> disposition only, had he no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or thought, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> speakes, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow,
or destroy the citie? Certainly the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevites</hi>
did thinke he had; and yet this their thought
or opinion is commended unto us by the Holy
Ghost under the stile, or title of beliefe, for so it is


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7862:58"/>
said <hi>v. 5. The people of Nineveh believed God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein did they believe in him, or what did
they believe of him?</p>
                  <p>Surely they believed, in the first place, that hee
meant as he spake, that he had a purpose or intention
to destroy them. They knew their sinnes had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
no lesse, and they believed that God was a iust
God, to inflict upon them what they deserved; but
they believed withall, that he was a God of mercy,
and forgivenesse; and out of this feare thus tempered
with hope, they addresse themselves to become as
capable of his mercy, as they had beene of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
<hi>For so it followes, that the people of Nineveh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath
from the greatest of them even unto the least of
them;</hi> and thus they did both by the Kings royall
command, and example: an admirable resolution
in a heathen King, a practise more Orthodoxall
then was the doctrine of the Priests or Prophets,
which questioned <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> for saying <hi>the Lord
would make his Temple like Shilo, unlesse they did
speedily repent.</hi> But what was the issue of the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
repentance? God, saith the text, <hi>saw their
workes, that they turned from their evill way, and God
repented of the evill that he had said that he would doe
unto them, and he did it not. v.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>Did he then but say that he would doe this evill
unto them, without any thought or purpose to doe
it? if hee had but only said it, and not meant it, hee
could not be truely said to repent him of it; his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supposeth his intent or thought, for he said it so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely,
and publiquely, not tentatively, or by way


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7862:58"/>
of triall only.</p>
                  <p>But if God had a serious will or purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
<hi>Nineveh</hi> at this time, and destroyed it not,
how is it true which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, <hi>that hee doth
whatsoever he will in heaven and in earth?</hi> So that if it
be true what we have before delivered, wee shall be
thought by some, to admit either some defect in his
power, or some alteration in his will. Thus litle
children, by turning long round, imagine that the
Globe of heauen and earth runnes round with them,
untill their braines be setled: And men of riper
yeares (unlesse their vnderstandings correct their
fancy) conceipt that towers and steeples, with the
shoares, whereon these or other edifices stand, doe
move from vs, whil'st we swiftly passe by them, or
from them.</p>
                  <p>But to thinke there should be any change in Gods
will, because many things which he seriously wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
are not effected, is an errour a great deale more
grosse, then either of the former: For all the change
is in the object of his will, that is, in the things wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or nilled by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The answere to this obiection, or discovery of
this fallacies originall, was most acutely made, and
punctually delivered by the schoole-men long agoe,</hi>
aliud est mutare voluntatem, aliud est velle mutatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem;
It is not all one for God to change his will, and to
will a change in things created by him.</p>
                  <p>God never changeth his will, it alwaies is as his
nature is, absolutely immutable, or, as our Apostle
speakes, <hi>without shadow of change:</hi> yet by one and the
same unchangeable will, hee may, and doth will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7862:59"/>
of changes, diversity of alterations, in the
things willed by him, or in the sentences denounced
by his Prophets in his name. He worketh all things
by the councell of his will, and as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>
saith, <hi>nunquam mutat consilium, his counsell doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
change or alter; saepius tamen mutat sententiam,
his unchangeable unalterable counsell may worke a
change in all things besides it selfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was his iust will seriously at this time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and this his will or purpose we
will conceive to be more unchangeable, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
then a rocke of Adamant: and <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
whilst she continued her wonted course in sinne, was
like a ship before a full winde, which had outsailed
her watch, whilst the Marriners slept; &amp; by this error
ready to dash against the immoveable rock of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
iustice; had not her Pilots, &amp; governors (awaked
out of their sleep upon the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> summons)
tackt about, and directed their course another way.</p>
                  <p>If whilst we acknowledge Gods will to be most
unchangeable, we consider it withall to bee a most
compleat and most constant rule of equity and
goodnesse, <hi>qua talis;</hi> it will most necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that even in this respect it is a rule most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
and most unchangeable, it must have one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for <hi>Nineveh</hi> raging with cruelty and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
another for <hi>Nineveh</hi> turning from the violence
that was in their hands; one doome for <hi>Nineveh</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in drunkennesse, riotousnesse, and uncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
another for <hi>Nineveh</hi> watching, washing her
selfe with teares, fasting, and sitting in ashes covered
with sack-cloath. One sentence for <hi>Nineveh</hi> pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7862:59"/>
her selfe with pride of heart, with periury and
blasphemy; another for <hi>Nineveh</hi> humbling her
selfe under the mighty hand of God with fasting,
devoutly calling upon his name with teares and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</p>
                  <p>For albeit God knoweth all things, as well
things to come as present, and doth nothing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than from eternity it was determined to be
done; yet even this wee know was determined from
eternity, that every man in every nation should be
rewarded, not according to the identity of their
persons or place, but according to the diversity of
their wayes, to the variety of their workes.</p>
                  <p>Though Rockes in the sea be immoveable, yet we
easily conceive how the distance, or aspect betwixt
them and ships, which saile to and fro, doth vary
every moment, whilst the ships are in motion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
then <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> to bee, as hee truly is, the
immovable Rocke of our salvation, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
a living Rocke, and an allseing rule, and it will be
easier to conceive how the doome or sentence from
eternity awarded to every mans actions doth
hourely change either for quality or degree, as
men doe change their course of life, whether from
good to evill, or from evill to good, from good to
better, or from evill to worse.</p>
                  <p>So then Repentance in these <hi>Ninevites</hi> did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
not only a will of change, but a true change in
their wils and affections. They turned their delight
in sinne, into sorrow for sinnes past, and good reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
not to transgresse so againe.</p>
                  <p>Repentance in God importeth only a will of


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7862:60"/>
change, nor is it the will of every change, but a
change of the doome or sentence denounced, which
the Scripture calls repentance in God. And here I
should have set a period to the first point proposed,
did not some men question, <hi>whether that beliefe</hi>
wherewith the <hi>Ninevites</hi> are said to have beleeved
God, were a true beliefe, or an act of <hi>saving faith?</hi>
however, such it was, as did save them from present
destruction, but so it might be in some mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and yet be but a temporary historicall faith.
For how could they pray in faith according to the
Apostles rule, seeing they doubted whether God
would shew mercy upon them, or noe; For so much
seemes to be included in the resolution. <hi>v. 9. Who can
tell if God will returne and repent, and turne away
from his fierce anger, and we perish not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now thus to doubt, may seeme to argue that
their prayers were not of true faith.</p>
                  <p>But these two sacred maximes <hi>(whatsoever is not
of faith is sinne) (whatsoever is done with doubt or
scruple is not of faith)</hi> are oftner wrested, sometimes
to abette presumption in respect of God, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
disobedience towards his vice-gerents, than
any other maximes in sacred writ besides. For this
present, the limitation of them is briefly this.</p>
                  <p>Whensoever the doubt, or controversy stands
betwixt a mans belly, or purse, and his soule, or
conscience, the Apostles rule <hi>(whatsoever is not of
faith is sinne)</hi> is universally true, whosoever doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing for his belly, or purse, or matters of such
temporall consequence, which he probably doubts,
may wound his soule or conscience, his action or


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7862:60"/>
choice is not of faith, is truly sinfull; In other cases
he that intends to doe much good, must resolve to
doe many things whereof hee cannot but doubt,
whereof hee cannot bee resolved but by the event or
successe, yet not sinne.</p>
                  <p>Thus these <hi>Ninevites</hi> were uncertaine or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
whether the Lord would repent or no, of the
evill threatned against them, and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this doubt, they did well, exceeding well, to
fast and pray that hee might repent; and in thus
doubting and thus doing, they declare not their
workes only but their divinity to have beene much
better than theirs who condemne the like actions of
heathen men for sinfull, because their persons were
not sanctified by saving faith. As for these <hi>Ninevites</hi>
they had a true notion of that truth which the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
teacheth, to wit, that as God is often said to
repent, so some speciall cases there be in which hee
doth not, in which hee wil not upon any termes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and of which the Prophets saying is most true,
<hi>He is not as man, or the sonne of man, that hee should
repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And such, for instance, was the case of <hi>Saul,</hi> the
first King of <hi>Israel,</hi> in the issue, though not from the
beginning of his raigne, or from that point of time
wherein God revealed that branch of his will to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
1. Sam. 15. It repenteth me that I have set Saul
up to be King, for he is turned backward from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, and hath not performed my commandements.</hi>
And he that turnes his backe from Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
shall be sure to meet his judgements in the
face.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:7862:61"/>
                     <hi>But this heavy sentence against</hi> Saul <hi>(as it there
followeth)</hi> grieved Samuel, and hee cryed unto the
Lord all night, but his cryes were not heard, <hi>for so it
followes</hi> v. 35. that Samuel came no more to see Saul
untill the day of his death, neverthelesse he mourned
for Saul, <hi>and in the</hi> 1. v. <hi>of the</hi> 19. chap. Samuel <hi>is
expressely forbidden to</hi> mourne for Saul: <hi>and if hee
might not mourne for him, hee might not pray for
him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A lamentable case that so great a Prophet, so
good a man as <hi>Samuel</hi> was, might not pray, might
not mourne for his soveraigne Lord, whom by
Gods speciall command, he had anointed, but the
cause is intimated <hi>v.</hi> 28. 29. For when <hi>Saul</hi> by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to hold the Prophet from departing from him,
had rent his coate, he returnes this heavy message
unto him, <hi>The Lord hath rent the kingdome of Israel
from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of
thine, that is better then thou: and also the strength of
Israel will not repent for he is not as man that he should
repent.</hi> And <hi>Samuel</hi> had no reason to mourne for
him, or to pray to God for reversing this sentence,
after he knew the Lord would not bee intreated to
recall it.</p>
                  <p>But here the Aliens from the common weale of
<hi>Israel,</hi> or men of <hi>Iultans</hi> disposition would object,
is the God of <hi>Israel</hi> no otherwise affected towards
his people, towards Kings of his own making, then
the Gods of the heathen (whom ye despise) were
towards kingdomes or Monarchies which served
them? Doth hee give his people iust cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of him as the heathen Poet did of his Gods,


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7862:61"/>
when he saw <hi>Rome</hi> so rent and torne with civill
warres, that it could not long stand. <hi>Heu faciles da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
summa Deos, eadem<expan>
                           <am>

                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> tueri—Difficiles!</hi> Will the
strength of <hi>Israel</hi> advance a man to a kingdome
which never sought it, but had it put upon him
whilst hee was seeking his fathers Asses? And will
he not be intreated to keepe him in it after long pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
after many adventures of his body, and effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his blood for supporting it? Will he repent
of the good which he had purposed to doe for <hi>Saul,</hi>
and will he not repent of the evill which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against him? Thus uncatechised flesh and
blood, or men not instructed in the waies of God
would repine. Now it were an easie answer to say,
that God did thus peremptorily deale with <hi>Saul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was his absolute will to depose him and to
chuse <hi>David</hi> in his place. But this or the like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
would make a foolish heathen starke mad, and
move a man that hovered betwixt heathenisme
and Christianity to fall quite from us: whereas we
are bound by the Apostles rule <hi>to give no offence
not only to the Church of God, but neither to the Iew
nor to the Gentile;</hi> whereas this answer gives just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of offence to them all. For sure the scripture
is plaine, and I thinke no Christian will (in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall)
deny, that <hi>Saul</hi> did at this time much better
deserve to be deposed, than either hee or <hi>David</hi> did
to bee elected King; his sinnes were the meritorious
cause of his rejection, but what sinnes in particular
is not so apparent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul,</hi> as some ancient interpreters observe, was
once little in his owne eyes, and then he was a great


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7862:62"/>
man in Gods sight, but hee grew great, exceeding
great in his owne eyes, and the greater he thus grew,
the more hee waned in Gods favour, whose eternall
will, and pleasure is <hi>to give grace unto the meeke and
humble, and to resist and bring downe the proud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this is true, but too generall to give satisfaction
to the doubt proposed: For God doth never so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
reject any lawfull Prince as hee did <hi>Saul</hi>
without hope of repentance, or reversing the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
denounced against him, unlesse it be for some
excessive multitude or full measure of sinne, or for
some ominous, or prodigious sinnes.</p>
                  <p>We read only of <hi>two remarkeable sinnes committed
by Saul before his rejection,</hi> the one was for offering
a burnt offring, and for his intendment to offer a
peace offring before <hi>Samuel</hi> came unto him. 1 <hi>Sam.
13.</hi> 19. &amp; 20. <hi>And for this transgression Samuel</hi> saith
unto him <hi>v. 30. Thou hast done foolishly, thou hast not
kept the commandement of the Lord thy God which he
commanded thee: For now would the Lord have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
the kingdome upon Israel for ever. Saul</hi> then
had Gods promise before for the continuance of his
kingdome. But of this good truely intended to him
the Lord from this time repents, as it followes <hi>verse
14. But now the kingdome shall not continue.</hi> Yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this fact it is not said, that the Lord would not
repent of the sentence denounced against him.</p>
                  <p>But what was <hi>Sauls</hi> folly in all this; or was it any?
for as it is said <hi>v. 8. he tarryed there seaven daies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the set time that Samuel had appointed.</hi>
It was not so great a folly for <hi>Saul</hi> being a king to
stay no longer, as disrespect in <hi>Samuel</hi> not to come


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7862:62"/>
within the time appointed: was it not more fit that
the Prophet should stay for the King, then the King
for the Prophet? The text is plaine that <hi>Saul staid
seauen dayes according to the set time that Samuel
had appointed,</hi> but it is not so plaine out of the text,
nor is it any way probable, that these seauen dayes
were obserued by <hi>Saul</hi> in that season, or to that end
which <hi>Samuel</hi> had appointed.</p>
                  <p>Two good interpreters,<note place="margin">Rupertus &amp; Angelomus</note> and ancient in respect of
our times, have observed an amphibology in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi>
words, and it was <hi>Saul's</hi> folly to make choise
of the sinister or wrong sense.</p>
                  <p>The words you have now written, yet not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
but spoken then by <hi>Samuel chap. 10. v.</hi> 8. And
however the Hebrew text, as it is now pointed, but
especially the Latine and the English, doe cast the
sense of <hi>Samuels</hi> words that way which the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
supposeth, yet the matter it selfe, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
sway the other way, in excuse of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
and aggravation of <hi>Sauls</hi> folly. <hi>Thou shalt goe
downe before me to Gilgal, and behold I will come
downe unto thee to offer burnt offrings, to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
sacrifices of peace offrings.</hi> And here they make
a pause or full sense, and begin another at these
words, <hi>seven daies shalt thon tarry till I come to
thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the originall will beare another sense, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the selfe same words, only altering the pause
or point, as thus, <hi>Thou shalt goe downe before me to
Gilgal, and behold I will come unto thee to offer burnt
offrings, and to sacrifice the sacrifice of peace offrings
for seaven daies:</hi> and then begin the second clause


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7862:63"/>
thus, <hi>thou shalt tarry till I come to thee,</hi> as if hee had
said, see in any case thou tarry till I come to thee, and
shew thee what thou shalt doe. <hi>Samuel</hi> it seemes
went in the meane time to aske counsell of the Lord
as being not himselfe fully instructed in this great
businesse which he was towards.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Saul</hi> did usurpe the Priests office in offring sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
upon pretence of <hi>Samuels</hi> stay, this was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious.
If he tooke upon him only to appoint the
time for the sacrifice or supplication, designing some
Priests for exercising the sacred function, this was
a great deale too much, more then meere folly; for
all this was by God himselfe reserved for <hi>Samuel</hi>
who was the interpreter or spokes-man betwixt
God and <hi>Saul.</hi> The sacrifice, no question, was a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and solemne sacrifice, such as <hi>Solomon</hi> made at
the consecration of the Temple, whose solemnity
lasted <hi>full seaven daies:</hi> and it is probable that this
present solemnity which <hi>Samuel</hi> had appointed, was
the consecration of <hi>Saul,</hi> or establishing him in his
kingdome, had hee not foolishly wronged himselfe
by trenching upon the Priests, or the Prophets fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or upon both.</p>
                  <p>But whether these mentioned, or some others, or
these with others were the principall branches of
<hi>Sauls</hi> folly, certaine it is, that neither any of these,
nor all of these did make his doome to be inevitable,
or his deposition irreversible. For though <hi>Samuel</hi>
upon notice of this his folly did foretell that God
would give his kingdome unto another, yet he did
not expressely adde that the Lord would not repent
him of this evill denounced against him: and this


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7862:63"/>
addition being not made, the sentence was lyable to
the ordinary rule of interpreting Gods threatnings
<hi>Ier.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> by repenting of this folly might have beene
capable of that pardon, whereof he made himselfe
altogether uncapable, by his second more grosse
and more stupid transgression of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
What was that? His indulgence towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag</hi>
and his people. Is it then an unpardonable sinne
in Christian Princes to shew pity unto heathenish or
idolatrous Princes, whom God hath given into their
hands by victory and battaile? No. To gather such
generall doctrines or uses, from particular instances
in scripture, as some have done from <hi>Ezekiah's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing
the brasen Serpent, or from <hi>Ahabs</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<hi>Benhadad</hi> to escape with life, is but the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome
of distempered zeale, misled by ignorance.
Nor will it follow, because <hi>Ahab</hi> was more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
and more severely punished for suffering <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi>
to escape with life, than hee was for putting
poore <hi>Naboth</hi> to death; that therefore this slaughter
was a lesse sinne in it selfe than the other. For we
read that <hi>Ahab</hi> repented him of his unjust and cruell
dealing with <hi>Naboth:</hi> but so he did not of his other
folly in suffering <hi>Benhadad</hi> to escape with life: and
for this reason God repented him of the sentence
denounced against <hi>Ahab</hi> by <hi>Elias:</hi> So did hee not
repent of that other sentence denounced by another
Prophet, <hi>because thou hast &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, this was not all wherein <hi>Saul</hi> was faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
though foulely faulty in all this, more faulty in
sparing <hi>Agag,</hi> than <hi>Ahab</hi> was in sparing <hi>Benhadad;</hi>


                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:7862:64"/>
For God had expressely commanded him <hi>utterly
to destroy Amalek not sparing man or beast.</hi> But so the
the same God commanded the <hi>Israelites</hi> to destroy
the <hi>Cananites,</hi> yet their sinne in entring league
with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> was not equivalent to <hi>Sauls</hi>
transgression; for the condition of <hi>Amalek</hi> and
the Kings was much worse then the condition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heathens, more uncapable of pity from the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi>
then the <hi>Amorites</hi> or the <hi>Hittites</hi> were. For
God had denounced hostility against this people by
solemne oath <hi>Exod. 17. v. 15. 16. And Moses built
an altar and called the name of it Iehovah Nissi, for he
said, because the Lord hath sworne that the Lord will
have warre with Amalek from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Now the <hi>Amalekites</hi> being thus solemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be Gods enemies in so high a degree, the
<hi>Israelites</hi> were bound to wreake his foe-hood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Nation. <hi>Nunc, olim, quocun<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> darent se

                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Saul</hi> was made king of <hi>Israel,</hi> to fight the
battles of the Lord, and at this time expresly enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to destroy <hi>Amalek,</hi> his sinne in sparing <hi>Agag</hi>
and the cattel, was a sinne of like nature, as if a Iudge
or sworne magistrate, being put in trust to doe iustice
in a particular, unto which his soveraigne Lord had
peremptorily and determinately sworne, should
upon bribe or other sinister respects neglect his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and make his master (as much as in him lay)
for-sworne. And for any inferiour judge thus to
doe, deserves more bodily deaths then one. It
would be disloyalty for his dearest friend to sue for
his pardon. It is a most Catholike rule in Divinity,


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7862:64"/>
of which the <hi>Heathens</hi> had an ingrafted notion, the
ancient <hi>Iewes</hi> an vndoubted tradition, and the vse
and doctrine of it unanimously received by primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Christians, that wheresoever we find either matter
of blessing or matter of cursing denounced by oath; there
the sentence is irreversible, God will not repent.</hi> We see
the rule first experienced in those murmuring <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
to whom God had sworne, <hi>that they should not
enter into his rest.</hi> For though they repented of
their folly, and besought God with teares that hee
would revoke his sentence, offering their service
(which before they had neglected) for conquering
the land of promise, yet the Lord would not heare
them, and, which is more remarkeable, he would not
heare <hi>Moses</hi> in this particular for himselfe, because
he was involved as an accessary in that sentence, <hi>for
he spake unadvisedly on their behalfe.</hi> So <hi>Moses</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
doth testifie <hi>Deut. 3. v. 23. &amp;c. And I besought
the Lord at that time saying, O Lord God thou hast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to shew thy servant thy greatnesse, I pray thee let
me goe over and see this good land which is beyond
Iordan and that goodly mountaine Lebanon. But the
Lord was wroth with mee for your sakes, and would
not heare me; and the Lord said unto me, let it suffice
thee, speak no more unto me of this matter, get thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the top of Pisgah and behold it with thine eyes: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this Iordan thou shalt not goe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then God repented him that hee had made
<hi>Saul</hi> King over Israel, because he had the Kingdome
only by meere promise, not by promise confirmed
by oath. But God would not repent of his deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor reverse his sentence, because <hi>Saul</hi> by his


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7862:65"/>
preposterous indulgence unto <hi>Amalek</hi> (Gods
sworne enemy) did by this fact incurre the sentence
of deposition by oath; and more deepely partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
with the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> than <hi>Moses</hi> had done
with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> whom God had cut off by oath
from entring into the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope I shall not bee thought to flatter men,
whilst I blesse the name of our glorious Lord, for
setting a King over us, as farre from <hi>Saul's</hi> or <hi>Ahab's</hi>
disposition as they were from the disposition of king
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> &amp; for giving him a people nothing so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward,
either towards God, or him as the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Israelites</hi> were towards God &amp; his servant <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatsoever hath been said, or is written
concerning the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Iudah,</hi> were written
for our instruction, whether Prince, or people.</p>
                  <p>The most immediate use of the point last discust
concernes great Princes, and their followers: their
followers thus farre, that they never sollicite or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
their soveraigne Lords, or in case they doe,
it deeply concernes Princes, not to suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be wrought by any sollicitation, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
to favour any cause which stands accursed by
Gods eternall law, not to take the persons of any
men into their protection whom the supreame
Iudge hath exempted from his; not to patronage
any, whom the law of God and man, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
unto utter destruction. For by doing such bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
good to prodigious malefactors, they shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
as my Prophet speakes, <hi>great evill unto their
owne soules.</hi> Evils at least temporall unto themselves
and to their people, of which the Lord will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7862:65"/>
For where such favour is shewne unto men, or
rather where favour and pity is shewed unto such
men as God is thus highly displeased with, there can
be no true feare of the Lord. In whomsoever that
feare is, it is <hi>praedominant</hi> and will command all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affections, whether of hope or feare, whether
of hatred, love, or favour to men. Vnlesse such feare
of the Lord bee first planted in their hearts, no
Prince, nor Potentates, no state or Kingdome can iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly
pretend to this blessing which <hi>Hezekia's</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
obtained. For he first feared, and then besought
the Lord before the Lord repented of the evill
which hee had pronounced against him, and his
people.</p>
                  <p>Now it is our hope &amp; assurance that God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of the evill denounced, which makes our feare
of him or of his iudgements, to be a filiall, not a
slavish feare. For no man can feare God with a true
filiall feare, but hee that apprehends him as a loving
father, and one as is sorry for our aflictions, one
that delighteth not in the punishment of his sons or
servants but in their repentance, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
capable of his fatherly mercy, or loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With thee there is mercy,</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shalt thou be feared.</hi> Why? doth any man feare
Gods mercies more than his iustice? No. This was
no part of the <hi>Psalmists</hi> meaning: We feare his
iudgements in and for themselves and as they bring
evil upon us. We feare God himselfe for his mercy,
we are afraid to offend him if we bee his children
because hee is mercifull, and because the greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7862:66"/>
which any man can procure unto his own soule,
is to deprive himselfe of his mercy, who is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
it selfe, the sole fountaine of all the good
which can be derived unto us. Or it may be a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the <hi>Psalmists</hi> meaning, that it was our
apprehension or beliefe of his mercy, which keeps<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth
our feare, whether of him or of his judgements,
within his proper sphere, or limits, as if he had said,
<hi>with thee o Lord there is mercy, therefore shalt thou bee
feared,</hi> hated thou canst not bee by such as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
or believe thy mercies; whereas feare of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or perpetuall punishments, unlesse it be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with hope of mercy, runs out of his wits, and
running beyond its bounds alwayes ends in hatred.</p>
                  <p>It is not possible either for that man not to love
God, which truly beleeves that hee hath mercy in
store for all; or for that man not to hate him, or at
least not to occasion others to hate him, which is
perswaded that he hath reserved iudgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mercy to some men, as they are men; or that hee
hath destinated them to inevitable destruction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he gave them life or preservation.</p>
                  <p>To bee thus perswaded argues an uncharitable
disposition, as well towards God, as towards men:
and from both roote and branch of this error, from
all such heresies, hatred, malice, and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse
good Lord deliver us, that
are thine heritage, thy whole
Church, especially this
land and people.</p>

told him of the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate had ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with their sacrifices.</hi> Who these <hi>Galilaeans</hi> were,


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7862:68"/>
and what was their crime, is no where (to my obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation)
registred in particular; probable it is, that
they were the reliques of <hi>Iudas</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> his Sect,
of whom we read <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 37. This man, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> in
that place relates, rose up (that is in our language, did
rebell) in the daies of the taxe enioyned about the
time of our Saviours birth, and drew much people
after him; and though he perished, and all, even as
many as obeyed him, were dispersed: yet, his sect, or
opinions died not with him: for as <hi>Iosephus</hi> that
great <hi>Iewish</hi> Antiquary tels us, hee left two sonnes
which maintained his doctrine after his death, and
these <hi>Galileans</hi> here mentioned were, it seemes, their
disciples; and their crime, mutiny, or attempt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                  <p>With what intentions the relaters of these newes
did interrupt our Saviour in his serious discourse
unto his auditors, hee best knew. However, <hi>res ipsa
includebat dolum.</hi> With what intention soever they
came unto him, the relation it selfe, before such a
multitude, was captious: Such as would have put a
man but ordinarily wise either to silence, or upon
an exigence. If he should have held his peace, this
had been a disparagement to the opinion which the
people had of his wisdome; and if he were disposed
to reply, there seemes a necessity laid upon him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of censuring these <hi>Galileans</hi> for notorious trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors,
or of taxing <hi>Pilat</hi> of extraordinary cruelty,
to condemne these miserable men after such dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
execution, especially before their country-men
(for such were most of his Auditors, Galileans, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them perhaps their kinsemen) had beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7862:68"/>
To have taxed <hi>Pilates</hi> person of cruelty, or
this his present fact of iniustice, had beene dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
for it was an act of state. And whatsoever pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
edge, or spleene this <hi>Roman</hi> deputy had against
these <hi>Galileans,</hi> that was sure to bee backt by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
supreame Authority. As for <hi>Pilates</hi> person,
place, or fact, that our Saviour (such was his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
meddles not with; hee neither approves, nor
disallowes it. That these <hi>Galileans</hi> were grievous
transgressors, did iustly deserve what they suffered,
hee denyes not. But that they were more hainous
sinners than any other <hi>Galileans</hi> which had not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the like punishment, that hee firmely denyes, in
the 2. <hi>v. Iesus answering said unto them, suppose ye that
these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans,
because they suffered such things? I tell you nay, but
except yee repent <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This speech is directed to his ordinary Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who for the most part were <hi>Galileans,</hi> and our
Saviour at the time when this newes was brought
him, was not in <hi>Iudea,</hi> nor in <hi>Pilates</hi> jurisdiction, but
in <hi>Galilee</hi> or <hi>Peria</hi> which both belonged to <hi>Herods</hi>

                  <p>But these newes-mongers were not <hi>Galileans,</hi> but
inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and for this reason he takes
occasion to put them in mind of as fearefull an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident

of Ierusalem, as most other of his solemne
sentences (if wee had the grace, wit, or will to weigh
them aright) admit a double sence or importance,
and require a twofold consideration. The one as
they are propheticall and of more speciall use. The
other as they are morall and of generall use. Wee
are in the first place to consider these words now
read unto you as they are propheticall. For unlesse
we have a true scale of them as they lye under this
observation wee shall take their morall meaning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> after the same manner that those <hi>Galileans,</hi>
whose bloud <hi>Pilat</hi> mingled with their sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or those eighteene of Ierusalem, upon whom
the tower of <hi>Siloe</hi> fell, and slew them. Now our
Saviours meaning is, that as the end of these few
particular men was exemplary and disastrous, so
should the end of the <hi>Galilean</hi> nation, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of Ierusalem without repentance be; a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
&amp; astonishment to all the nations of the earth,
which should see, heare, &amp; read of it. And to foretell
this nationall disaster so long before was matter of
prophecie well befitting the Prince of Prophets.
A true document that he had the spirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
not by measures, or minute portions, but most
full and entire, that he was not only <hi>vates futurorum,</hi>
or <hi>praeteritorum,</hi> but <hi>certus interpres praesentium.</hi> For
unto all these points the spirit of Divine prophecie
doth respectively reach. <hi>Moses</hi> did declare himselfe
to be as true a Prophet in setting downe the history
of the creation, and the lives of the Patriarks, as in
foretelling what should befall their posterity. So
did <hi>Daniel</hi> in retriving <hi>Nebuchadnezar's</hi> dreame,
which had out flowne his owne memory, as in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the undoubted interpretation of it. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in this place declares himselfe to bee <hi>vates prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritorum,</hi>
in his most infallible recounting that sad
accident in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> without a remembrancer, or
any record of it then extant. For however the thing
it selfe was well known to the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
yet hee did not preach upon <hi>carantoes.</hi> The
ground of this his heavenly discourse was not <hi>vox
populi,</hi> but his owne infallible knowledge of both


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7862:70"/>
these disasters. And both of them were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
signes, or forewarnings unto the <hi>Iewish</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in particular to the inhabitants of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and city of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Yet signes or
forewarnings, whose interpretations none besides
the Prince of Prophets could then have given. And
his interpretation of them is in briefe this, that <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee</hi>
should bee the prime seat of that bloody warre,
and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the centre of all those unparalled cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
whereat the generall signes of the time, and
these two particular disasters mentioned in my text
directly point, and would strike home without spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

<hi>in that very season, or nick of time, who told him of
the</hi> Galileans, <hi>whose blood</hi> Pilat <hi>had mingled with
their sacrifices: What season was that? That point
of time, wherein he said vnto the people</hi> 12. Chap.
4. v. When yee see a cloud rise out of the West, streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
yee say, there commeth a showre, and so it is. And
when yee see the South wind blow, yee say there will be
heat, and it commeth to passe. Yee Hypocrites, yee can
discerne the face of the skie, and of the earth, but how is
it that yee doe not discerne this time? Yea, and why
euen of your selues iudge yee not what is right? And
when the <hi>Pharises,</hi> with the <hi>Sadduces</hi> came tempting,
and desiring him that he would shew them a signe


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7862:70"/>
from heauen, <hi>as it is Math. 16. v. 1. 2. &amp;c.</hi> He answered,
and said vnto them, when it is euening yee say it will
be faire weather, for the skie is red. And in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it will be foule-weather to day, for the skie is red
and lowring: O yee Hypocrites, yee can discerne the
face of the skie, but can yee not discerne the signes of
the times? <hi>And albeit his recited speeches</hi> Luk. 12.
v. 54. <hi>were directed vnto the people, or promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
multitude then present: yet in that multitude
there were (no question) some</hi> Scribes, <hi>which had
the prerogatiue, and portion of the first borne in the
title of</hi> Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>Now our Sauiour's discourse immediately before
my text being of the signes of the time, and a taxe
of his Auditors dulnesse, in not discerning them:
This unexpected intersertion of those <hi>Galileans</hi>
whose bloud <hi>Pilat</hi> had mingled with their sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whatsoever the newes-mongers intended, was
indeed no interruption, but rather an illustration of
his doctrine; It comes in 'its right cue: and the
relators of this sad accident serve his turne as fitly,
as the Chirurgion doth the Physitian, by making a
visible dissection of that part, on which the other
makes an Anatomy lecture. The implication, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of the newes, thus suted by divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
unto the point then handled by our Saviour,
is in effect, as much as if hee himselfe had said unto
his Auditors; If you want other signes of the time
to meditate upon, take these two for your theame,
the unusuall masacre of these <hi>Galileans,</hi> and the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of those eighteene inhabitants of Ierusalem,
<hi>upon whom the tower in Siloe fell and slew them.</hi>


                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:7862:71"/>
These are the first drops of Gods displeasure against
the Nation; but these drops without repentance will
grow into a current, and the current into a river, and
the river swell into a flood, and the flood into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
of publique woe, and tragique miseries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Prophet</hi> Ieremie <hi>long before had taxed their
forefathers as more dull and stupid, then the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonlesse
Creatures, as the birds of the ayre, for not
discerning, or not observing those signes of the
time, which did foreshew Gods judgments vpon
them, with the causes which did provoke them,</hi> Ier.
8. 6. 7. I hearkned and heard, but they speake not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
no man repented him of his wickednesse, saying
what haue I done, every one turned to his course, as the
horse rusheth into the battel; yea the <hi>Storke</hi> in the
heauen knoweth her appointed times; and the <hi>Turtle,</hi>
and the <hi>Crane,</hi> and the <hi>Swallow,</hi> obserue the time of
their comming, but my people know not the Iudgment
of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>This stupidity or senslesnesse in man, whether
<hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> whether <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> in thus
slighting or neglecting the signes of the time, that
is such portendments or prognostiques of Gods
judgments or calamities, as the very booke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or of the visible creatures affords, argues the
nature, at least the disposition of men, in whom this
stupiditie is found, to be farther out of frame then
the nature of the birds of the ayre, or beasts of the
feild. For they commonly fore-see vnseaonable
weather or storme comming, and seeke in time for
some refuge or shelter, but so doe not men for the
most part returne to God, who is their only refuge,


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7862:71"/>
vnder the shadow of whose wings, there is only
hope of safety; albeit he daily giues them more
pregnant prognosticks of wrath ensuing, then the
disposition of the ayre doth vnto birds or foules.</p>
                  <p>From these circumstances of the season, wherein
these newes were brought unto our Sauiour, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
discourse must take its rise by these degrees,
first, of the peculiar signes of times portending
unusuall calamities, and of their generall use. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
of the manner how this prophesy was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
upon the whole Iewish Nation, according to
the scale, or model of these two signes upon these
few <hi>Galileans,</hi> and inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of the morall use, or application of both these
signes and predictions.</p>
                  <p>That the preserver of mankind doth alwayes in
one kind or other gently, yet seriously forwarn eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
city, or nation of such extraordinary calamities,
as hang over their heads, and without repentance
inevitably fall upon them; there can bee no better
proofe than by induction, that is, by the generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Historians whether sacred, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
or heathen, in all ages. Of Historians, whose
workes are entirely extant, or unsuspected to be the
Authors whose names they beare, <hi>Herodotus</hi> is the
most ancient, and he hath made up the induction to
out hands untill his owne times, <hi>Quoties ingentes
sunt eventurae calamitates vel civitati vel nationi,
solent signis praenunciari. Extraordinary calamities,
whether such as befall cities or peculiar Segniories are
alwaies foreshewne by some signe or other.</hi> This author
lived before <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, but after <hi>Cyrus</hi>


                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:7862:72"/>
had taken the city of <hi>Babilon;</hi> and is quoted by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi>
who was <hi>Alexanders</hi> instructor. I referre
his instances or ensamples confirming his former
induction of generall observation to a fitter oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
diverse of them being more paralleld to the
signes of the times in my text, then any I haue read
in any heathen Author. In the age next ensuing, the
Author of the second booke of <hi>Maccabees</hi> (A man
of authentique credit for matter of fact, though not
of Canonicall authority for his doctrine, or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon matter of fact related by him) hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
the like forewarnings, though in another
kind, foresignifying the warres that befell the <hi>Iewish</hi>
nation by <hi>Antiochus, Chap.</hi> 5. 2. 3. To parallel these
with the like in every age since that time, would be
lesse painefull to an ordinary Preacher, then trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to his auditors. <hi>Matchiavel,</hi> a man as free from
superstition, or vaine credulity, as any other writer
that hath bin borne and bred amongst Christians,
out of his owne reading, and experience hath made
the same induction which <hi>Herodotus</hi> did, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more full.</p>

                  <p>But besides the induction made by <hi>Herodotus</hi>
(whose works I doubt, but know not whether <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi>
had red) many other instances he brings out


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7862:72"/>
of his owne observations and experience.</p>
                  <p>But some will aske, what credit is to bee given
to <hi>Matchiavel</hi> or men of his temper? Litle or none
(I must confesse) in point of censure or opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matter of religion or sacred use; But as the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the <hi>Iew</hi> in matter of fact is the most preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
proofe that wee Christians can use against the
<hi>Iewes</hi> themselves, or for confirmation of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so <hi>Matchiavels</hi> testimony in matter of fact of
this nature whereof we treat is most authentique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Atheists</hi> or men of no religion. For this
great <hi>Politician</hi> was so farre from being too supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
or credulous in this kinde, that by his writings
many have suspected him to have been rather irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
more inclining to <hi>Atheisme</hi> then either to
the Christian or <hi>Iewish</hi> nation. And whatsoever in
this kinde he hath observed, as hee himselfe confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
was in a manner evicted or extorted from him
by the evidence of truth. The true cause of such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
signes or forewarnings he professes he did
not know, and we have reason to believe him in this,
because he was ignorant of the right end or use of
them. But this, saith he, all we of <hi>Florence</hi> know, that
the comming of <hi>Charles</hi> the eigth <hi>French King</hi> with
a puisant army was foretold long before by <hi>Ierome
Savanorola,</hi> and likewise foreshewed by many other
signes rife in his times, throughout the <hi>Dukedome</hi>
of <hi>Tuscany.</hi> Now this divination of <hi>Savanorola</hi> was
not gathered from any politique observation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
<hi>Charles</hi> his attempt was in all politique esteeme so
incredible and rash that the grave <hi>Senators</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi>
would give no credence unto the first newes of his


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7862:73"/>
entring into <hi>Italy,</hi> untill one of their ancients better
acquainted (it seemes) with that <hi>French Kings</hi> dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
then the rest, told them that he could more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
believe this rash attempt of that <hi>French King</hi> then
of any of his predecessors. But besides the testimony
of <hi>Matchiavel</hi> for this particular wee have the
undoubted testimony of <hi>Philip de Comtnes</hi> that grave
and religious <hi>Historian,</hi> who was then agent for the
<hi>French King</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and relates this prediction
from <hi>Savanorola</hi> his owne mouth, with more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
then <hi>Matchiavel</hi> mentions; for he expresly
foretold him of that unexpected successe which
<hi>Charles</hi> at his first comming did finde: but this hee
foretold with this <hi>proviso</hi> or <hi>caution,</hi> that unlesse
the <hi>King</hi> his master did faithfully execute the worke
whereunto the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi>
had designed him, he would quickly call in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and bring the <hi>French</hi> armies backe againe
into their owne land with disgrace and losse. The
event did prove both these parts of this prediction
to be most true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This great alteration of state and warres in</hi> Italy, <hi>as</hi>
Matchiavel <hi>confidently affirmes, was likewise por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
or foresignified by such apparitions in the
ayre as the Authour of the second booke of</hi> Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees
<hi>in his</hi> 5. chap. <hi>mentions, that is, by apparitions
of great armies of men joyning battel over</hi> Aretium
<hi>a Towne in</hi> Tuscany. <hi>The words of the Authour of
the second of</hi> Maccabees <hi>before cited are these,</hi> And
then it hapned that through all the city for the space al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of 40 daies there were seene horse-men running
in the ayre in cloth of gold, and armed with lances, like


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7862:73"/>
a bande of souldiers and troopes of horse-men in array
encountring and running one against another, with sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of shields, and multitude of pikes, and drawing of
swordes, and casting of darts, and glitterings of golden
ornaments and harnesse of all sorts; wherefore every
man prayed that that apparition might turne to good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>He instances in another signe or prodigie well
known to all in <hi>Florence,</hi> which did portend or fore-signifie
the death of <hi>Lorenzo de Medices,</hi> who laid
the first foundation of the present <hi>Dukedome</hi> of <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi>
in his family, being a man who by his wisdome
had preserved all <hi>Italy</hi> a long time in peace. For a
litle before his death the roofe of their chiefe
Church or Temple tooke fire from heaven, which
much defaced it. The banishment of <hi>Petrus Soderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
a great peere and pillar of the state of <hi>Florence</hi> in
his time, and the calamities which ensued thereupon,
were likewise fore-signified or portended by the
burning of their <hi>Guild-hall</hi> or <hi>Senate-house</hi> by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or fire from heaven. These examples he brings
from his owne knowledge, another he brings out
of <hi>Livy,</hi> of one <hi>Aeditius</hi> an honest countrey-man,
who was warned and commanded by a voice in the
dead of night more cleare and shrill then the voice
of man, to tell their Magistrates that the Gaules
their enemies were comming to be revenged upon
the <hi>Romans.</hi> So hee concludes his discourse as hee
did begin it, that whatsoever might be thought of
such conjectures or forewarnings, this is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
by experience that some great alterations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
follow upon such signes or forewarnings.
As for <hi>Herodotus</hi> I like his verdict in this kinde the


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7862:74"/>
better, because hee refer'd this observation of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
or signes of the time unto the Egyptian nation,
which was the most ancient and most remarkeable
Kingdome amongst the Heathens. And what reason
the Egyptians had to observe these prodigies and
signes of the time more than others, both Iewes
and Christians canno: but know or may remember,
seeing God had shewed such signes and wonders in
the land of Egypt as had not beene shewne in any
nation before, such as can scarce be paralleld in any
nation since, besides in the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
untill the day of judgement, or the signes which
shall bee given before it come.</p>
                  <p>Vnto matters related by the Author of the second
book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> if not for his own esteeme, yet for
<hi>S. Pauls</hi> or whoever were the Author of the epistle
to the Hebrewes, we owe such an historicall beliefe
as may ground maters of sacred or canonicall use or
application, because that sacred Author hath given
him credit or countenance in his relations of the
persecutions of Gods people long before his owne
time, which are not registred by any ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
now extant, besides this Author of the second
booke of <hi>Maccabees. 2. Maccab. 7. 7. Heb.</hi> 11. 35.</p>
                  <p>They extend an undoubted truth too farre, which
make canonicall scriptures to bee the only rule of
our beliefe, as well for maters of fact, as for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Doctrine or use. For some maters of fact,
though not related in canonicall scriptures, wee
may, and doe beliefe, or know, as certainly, as those
maters which are related by sacred historians. Wee
(all of us) as stedfastly believe, and know, that God


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7862:74"/>
hath often visited this land with the plague of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence
in later yeares, as we doe that he visited the
land of <hi>Iudah</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> time. Many of us believe
or know, that we have beene sicke, grievously sicke;
and this we believe and know as firmely, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that <hi>Hezekias</hi> was sicke even unto death and
recovered, albeit his sicknesse, and the plague
wherewith <hi>Iudah</hi> was visited in <hi>David's</hi> time are
both recorded in scriptures, so are not any visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wherewith the Lord hath visited either our
selves in particular, or this land and people in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
                  <p>But though these or the like matters of fact be not
exprest in scriptures which are the rule of our faith:
yet are the canonicall scriptures the only rule of
faith, how wee ought to demeane our selves, when
we are either visited in particular as <hi>Hezekias</hi> was,
or when Gods visitation is more generall and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
as it was upon <hi>Iudah</hi> in the raigne of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however we may know maters of fact which
are present, or which fall out in our times as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
as we do maters of fact related in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
yet it will be objected, that we may not give
the same credit or beliefe unto any maters of fact
done in former times related by Heathen or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
by ancient or moderne Authors, which we doe
unto all maters of fact, which have beene registred
by canonicall writers.</p>
                  <p>All this is true, yet unto writers as well
Heathens as Christians wee may and ought to
give, though no sacred esteeme or credit, yet
an historicall or morall beliefe, as many by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7862:75"/>
Christians doe not distinctly give unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of fact related by sacred writers, or at least unto
their censures of them.</p>
                  <p>If all, or most of us could but attaine unto such
a distinct historicall beliefe of sacred writers as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have of stories related, as well by ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
as by moderne Christians, we would be more
religious, or lesse irreligious than for the most part
we are.</p>
                  <p>Briefely, though to believe as much concerning
the signes of the times as the Heathens did, though
to make as good or better use of them than they
did, be not sufficient to acquit us from ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
foresignified; yet not to believe as much
as they did, not to make so good use as they did, not
to bee so much affected with them as they were, is
enough and more than enough to condemne us, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to bring that ruine or calamity, which they
portend or foresignify inevitably and in full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon us.</p>
                  <p>Vnto these observations of <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi>
I only adde this one, that the greater the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
or calamities be which are thus foresigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
or portended, the greater commonly, and more
strange the prodigies bee which foresignify them.
The more suddaine the blow, or the fewer the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings
be, the more expresse, &amp; punctuall they are.
Two instances for this present shall suffice, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a little before, or in the time wherein <hi>Matchiavel</hi>
wrote. Both forewarnings were giuen <hi>Vivâ voce,</hi> by
the voyce of men, but of men which no man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
knew, either whence they were, or whither


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7862:75"/>
they went, after the delivery of their message.</p>
                  <p>The one vnto <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth, then Lord and

the gate, and with a loud shrill voyce desired to

comming before the Ghost, and asking him
in private, what secret he would impart unto him,
the other denying that hee was King (but came
disguised to abuse him) with a high, and loud voice
hee said, that since the King would not heare him,
he should shortly perish. And so shortly he did with
the losse of a great part of the Kingdome of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary
not recovered by Christians to this day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is time to come to the use, which the
Hearthens did, and the Christians ought to make
of the speciall signes, or forewarnings, of what
kind soever they bee. Of the Heathens, some in most
ages did utterly contemne, or scorne all presage
from the signes of the time, some not so ill dispos'd,


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7862:77"/>
did slight them, others tooke them into serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
but for the most part made no right use
of them, did grossely erre either in practice, or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> had an accustomed presage
of successe in battle, by the eating of birds, kept for
that purpose. This kind of presage was so farre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
by <hi>Clandius Pulcher</hi> generall for the <hi>Romans</hi>
in the first <hi>Punick<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> warre, that when the sooth sayers
had diswaded him from giving battaile to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
that day, because the birds would not eat,
he commanded them to bee cast into the sea, to see
if they would drinke or no: But the ill successe,
which was conceived to follow upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
did cause the <hi>Senate</hi> to call in his commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and chuse another generall in his place. Howbeit
this kind of presage, I take it, was no signe of the
time, or forewarning exhibited by the true God,
but rather effected by superstitious men.</p>
                  <p>However; the contempt, or scorne of superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or blind devotion, unlesse it spring from a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and well rooted love to true religion, is much
worse than superstitious, than idolatrous practices.
Many instances are extant in unsuspected Authors,
that the irreligious contemners, or scorners of false
Gods have been remarkeably plagued, not by those
supposed Gods, whose service they neglected, but
by the true and only God, who is the just revenger,
as well of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> and irreligion, as of <hi>superstition,</hi>
and <hi>idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Emperour <hi>Vespatian,</hi> though an Heathen,
was in his way devoutly religious, and though no
contemner, yet a slighter of the prodigies, and signes


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7862:77"/>
of the time. For when amongst other presages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
of his death, notice was given him of a
comet which then appeared; he bid the relaters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
this message to the King of <hi>Parthia, Ille comatus
est, ego autem calvus;</hi> seeing the King of <hi>Parthia</hi> did
weare long haire, it was most likely, that this blazing
starre, or <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rinita stella,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> call it, should
portend his death rather than the Emperour <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
who was bald. But the course of destiny as the
Heathens upon this observed could not be diverted
by jerkes of wit, for <hi>Vespatian</hi> died before the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this comet, and the King of <hi>Parthia</hi> outli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
both: <hi>Vespatian</hi> perhaps might have lived the
longer, if upon these summons, or forewarnings, hee
had betaken himselfe to his prayers, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in
like case did, or said in his heart unto the divine
power, which gave him those summons, as <hi>David</hi>
in like case did, <hi>Behold here am I, do with me as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
good in thy eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But error in opinion concerning the use of the these
forewarnings was usuall to the more ingenious, and
devoutest sort of heathens, which did carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
them. Thus farre they are to be commended,
in that they thought these forewarnings to bee sent
by the Gods, or Divine powers as tokens or pledges
of their good will towards men, some of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely

specially, that albeit they did not suspect the Divine

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7862:78"/>
towards men, yet they thought rate, and destiny
were stronger then this Divine power; that the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
calamity, and successe which did commonly
ensue upon such forewarnings could by no meanes
possible be either prevented, or averted, hence was
that or the like exclamation,

                  <p>He speakes not of the Gods in generall, but of one
God, whom he characters under the stile of omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,
who did forewarn <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
only, but abundantly, not to hazard his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
upon a battaile to be determined on one day.
The forewarnings which he there relates were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
and prodigious; some of them portend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Pompey's</hi> overthrow, others <hi>Caesars</hi> victory. His
verdict, or censure upon them is briefly this, they
were such <hi>à quibus appareret coeleste numen &amp; Caesaris

                  </p>
                  <p>But if this heavenly power were willing to inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
<hi>Pompey's</hi> error, how came it to passe that it was

                  </p>
                  <p>But if this <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or heavenly power were; as

                     </gap>
he confesseth, to inhibit <hi>Pompey's</hi> error at this very
time, what law, what necessity, or what lawes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
could resist, or prohibite the execution of his
will? These immutable lawes of necessity if any such
there were might be more truely stiled omnipotent,
then <hi>Iupiter</hi> or that great God, who gives lawes to
man, and Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it was the want of true Logick
which did occasion this errour, or ill expression in
this heathen writer, as it had done and doth the like
in the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> The transposing only of one word, or
placing of one point aright, without alteration of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fillable, or it's signification, would make this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then's
opinion, and expression of himselfe exactly
paralleld to the rule of faith.</p>
                  <p>When hee saith, <hi>Invictaeleges necessitat is &amp;c.
would not suffer Pompey to lay these forewarnings to
heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> he contradicts himselfe, and the truth of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
omnipotent power. Whereas if he had said,
the invincible lawes of necessity did suffer <hi>Pompey,</hi>
not to lay these forewarnings to heart, he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
like a Christian. For there can be no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
law of necessity besides the irresistible will
of the one omnipotent God, and that is a law abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
invincible, and most irresistible; and yet a law
which admits a liberty of choice in the parties
subject to it, or a law for the most part disiunctive. It
was the irresistible will of God that <hi>Pompey</hi> should
have sufficient, or as this Authour speakes, abundant


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7862:79"/>
warning to correct his errour, or to abate his high
spirit or pride of heart, and yet it was one and the
same irresistible will of one and the same God, that
these forewarnings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how prodigious soever, should
not necessitate his will or enforce relentance upon
his present resolution.</p>
                  <p>No matter of fact, or signes of the time can bee
more infallible prognostickes of calamities foresig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by them, then these signes of the time which
it pleased our Saviour to interpret. No prophecie
or prediction, though uttered by an Angell from
heaven, can induce a greater necessity, or argue a
more inevitable futurition of things so foretold
then the expresse prediction, or prophecie of the
Sonne of God himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Though here, or elsewhere he often foretold the
destruction of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Ierasalem;</hi> yet was not the
destruction of either of them from the date of this
prophefie absolutely necessary, or inevitable, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
only upon supposition, or conditionally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<hi>unlesse yee repent yee shall all likewise perish.</hi>
Yea but this proposition might bee true, <hi>if they did
repent they should not perish.</hi> But this doth not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
their repentance to have beene possible: For
<hi>Hypothetica propositio</hi> (as they say) <hi>nihil Ponit in esse;</hi>
this proposition would be true, though in a beggers
mouth. <hi>If I had tenne thousand pound I should bee a
rich man,</hi> yet the truth of this proposition puts no
money in his purse.</p>
                  <p>But he that would apply this Logicke rule unto
our Saviours speech in my text, doth either jeere
our Saviour, or make him to bee a jeerer of the sons

of affliction, which later of two evils is the worse;
for wheresoever the contract or covenant is seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or where the bond or grant is reall, and legall
the condition must be facible.</p>
                  <p>The Prince, or Iudge, that would grant, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
a malefactor, suppose a man-slayer, his life
upon condition, or <hi>provise,</hi> that hee should restore
the party whom he had slaine to life againe, would
be thought rather to mocke him than shew mercy to
him, and to do himselfe, and his authority more
wrong than the other good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> did not mocke <hi>Shimei</hi> when hee gave

As when our Saviour saith, <hi>except yee repent, yee
shall all likewise perish,</hi> This exception, or condition
presupposeth an estate in sinne, yet an estate muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
It presupposeth these men were truly lyable to
destruction threatned, but it presupposeth withall
that the doore of life, and salvation, though now but
narrow, was not utterly shut against them; that as
yet it was called to day with them; yea that after
this time there was a season wherein this sonne of
God did call them to repentance, <hi>when he beheld the
city, and wept over it; Oh that thou hadst knowne this
thy day &amp;c.</hi> After they had cast him off from being
King over them, and exempted themselves from his

                  <p>But here some, who thinke it part of their office
to send off Gods intended mercies from such as
they have marked for reprobates, will tell you, that
our Saviour did then pray not for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but for
the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers: yet <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers they
were not, but <hi>Iewes</hi> of the worst condition, which
stoned the blessed Martyr Steven to death; and yet
he prayed, <hi>Lord lay not this sinne unto their charge.</hi>

to have beene at that time altogether inevitable, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

No publique plagues or calamities whether fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signified
by such signes, as these in my text, or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
foretold by Gods Prophets, or by his Sonne
the Prince of Prophets, become inevitable, unlesse
it bee by contempt, or neglect of forewarnings gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or by deeming all events to be inevitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are foresignified, or foretold by God
himselfe, or by his embassadours.</p>
                  <p>It is true sometimes, that the very inevitability of
ensueing calamities is either expressely foretold
or foresignified: but such presignifications, or predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
can bee no forewarnings, but rather peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
denunciations of some irreversible sentence,
or doome after warnings given, be they more, or
fewer.</p>
                  <p>To scorne, or neglect forewarnings given, is a
Symptome of hardnesse of heart, and contempt of
Gods word. To thinke all calamities are inevitable,
which are foretold, or foresignified, or of which
God himselfe hath given forewarnings, is a branch
of false Doctrine, or an heresie, sometimes adludged
by the lawmakers of this land so capitall, that they
did exempt the maintainers of it (which were then
the sect of the <hi>Anabaptists)</hi> from all benefit of the
Kings royall pardon, as is apparent from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

that it cannot be comprehended by

by signes in the Sunne, and Moone, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by apparitions in the ayre, sometimes by mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
births; sometimes hee makes the murren of

of the ayre to be forerunners of plagues or pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

we say) in kind, and gives them a touch of publique
ruine, or desolation ensuing, without repentance,
by the suddaine disasters of some few men, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in the same nation. So <hi>Herodotus</hi> tels us, that
before the desolation of the people of <hi>Chios,</hi> these
strange signes did happen. <hi>Sed videlicet quoties &amp;c.

<q>The signes were two, One, that of a hundred young
men, whom they had sent to <hi>Delphos,</hi> two onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
the rest being consumed by pestilence: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but a litle after the same time, before the losse
of their Navy and Mariners by sea, the roofe of the
Schoole-house did fall so suddainly, that of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and twenty children, but one escaped with life.
And these signes (as hee conceives) God did give
them of that great disaster, which they had by sea,

our Saviours precedent discourse
concerning such signes of the
time, as did portend, or foresig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the utter ruine of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
nation, and of the visible Church
planted in it. How peremptory so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the forewarnings were, how infallible soever he
was in his predictions of their ruine, yet both were
subject to this exception, or condition, <hi>unlesse ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
ye shall all likewise perish.</hi> The use, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the parable was to admonish them, that
these forewarnings or signes of the time, which God
did give them, whether by the expresse words of
this great Prophet, which was then amongst them,
or by strange matters of fact legible in the bookes


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7862:83"/>
of the visible creatures, were not to continue <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum;</hi>
They had their period set before all times;
from eternity. And however it is elsewhere said,
That <hi>at what time soever a sinner doth repent him from
the bottome of his heart, I will put all his wickednesse
out of my remembrance.</hi> Yet is it no where said, that
sinners may repent them at what time they will, or
find the just fruits of such repentance as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.
But as there is an indefinite or long time,
within which it is possible for sinners to repent, and
a promise universall, that at what time soever, within
this limited time, sinners doe repent, their prayers,
&amp; supplications shall be heard: So there is a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
day set to all nations respectively, after which
there is no accesse by true repentance, no entrance
by such repentance, as they tender unto temporall
safety. <hi>Today</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>If you will heare his
voice, harden not your hearts as in the day of temptation
in the wildernes, when your fathers tempted me, proved
and saw my workes forty yeares: Wherefore I was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with that generation, and said, they doe alwaies
erre in their hearts, and have not knowne my waies; So
I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my
rest.</hi> Heb. 3. v. 7. 8. 9. 10. Psal. 95. 7.</p>
                        <p>The meaning of the Psalmist in that place; is
more fully and plainly expressed by our Saviour
<hi>verses</hi> 24. and 25. of this Chapter, in his answere to
that question, <hi>Lord are there few that shall bee saved?
And hee said unto them, strive to enter in at the straite
gate: for many, I say unto you, will seeke to enter in, and
shall not bee able.</hi> But to what end should they strive
to enter in at that gate at which they are not able to


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7862:83"/>
enter? Shall wee say, that albeit they that strive to
enter be not able of themselves, yet it is possible for
them to enter in by Gods assistance? Or that albeit
they are not able to doe any thing possible, that may
merit their entrance; yet they may doe somewhat,
which being done, God will make the entrance
possible to them, and enable them to enter in? This
answere in some other cases is most true, yet not in
this; it can no way satisfy the question proposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Saviour, it is no way pertinent to the meaning
of his parable concerning entring in at the straight
gate, or this parable of the unfruifull figtree. It is at
some times, at many times, possible for all that heare
the word, to become obedient to the word heard,
and by this obedience to enter in at the straite
gate. But it is not possible for any to enter in at it,
after they have sometimes contemptuously, or often
times carelessely omitted the opportunity which
God had offred them for their easy entrance into
it, or passage through it. The gate is not so straite,
but that all men, which have heard of it, may enter
in at it, whilst it is open, so they seeke to enter in at
it in order, not tumultuously. But after this gate is
shut, none can enter, though many seeke to enter. So
our Saviour instructs us in the twenty fifth verse
of this Chapter, <hi>When once the master of the house is
risen up, and hath shut to the doore, and yee beginne to
stand without, and to knock at the doore, saying, Lord,
Lord, open unto us, and hee shall answere, and say unto
you, I know you not whence you are.</hi> This is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
end and scope of the parable in my text, and of
the parable of the foolish Virgines. For the more


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7862:84"/>
cleere explication of this parable's particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
yee are in the first place to know the meaning
of the single termes, as first, who is in speciall meant
by the certaine man which hath planted a figtree in
his vineyard. Secondly, who is in speciall meant by
the dresser of this vineyard. Thirdly, what is meant
by the figtree planted in it. Lastly, what is meant by
the three yeares, wherein fruit was by the owner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and the fourth yeare wherein the dresser of
the vineyard did petition for the sparing of it upon
further triall.</p>
                        <p>The owner of the vineyard, and of the figtree
planted in it, as best interpreters agree, doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
God the Father, or first person in Trinity. He
it is that exacts satisfaction for all sinnes committed
against the Deity, or divine nature: and he it is which
demands fruit of whatsoever the divine nature hath
planted; that is thankefulnesse of man in speciall, for
his benefits bestowed upon him; but specially of his
Church wheresoever planted. By the dresser of the
vineyard yee are to understand the Sonne of God, or
second person in Trinity. For hee it is which tooke
our nature upon him to till, and dresse it for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
service, and that portion of our nature, which
hee tooke upon him, is as the roote, or stemme to all
the residue which shall bee freed from cursing: So
our Saviour tels us, <hi>I am the true vine, and my father
is the husbandman,</hi> or the owner of the vine. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the Sonne of God, or second person in Trinity,
which doth mediate betwixt God &amp; man, and by his
mediation and intercession our first parents, the
whole nature of man was reprieved from death. By


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7862:84"/>
his mediation, and intercession the execution of
Gods dreadfull, and exemplary judgements upon
the seed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> or people of <hi>Israel,</hi> was for many
ages deferred, though in some part executed upon
them in every age, but never fully executed upon
the nation, untill their contemptuous neglect of these
forewarnings. By the figtree planted in the vineyard,
you are to understand the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> or
the Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as they stood affected for
this present. For in respect of Gods chosen people
then living on earth, or of that one holy catholique
Church, which was then in planting, and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to be propagated throughout the world,
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church or Synagogue then flourishing,
was but as a figtree planted in a vineyard, but as one
figtree for quantity, and a most unfruitfull one for
quality in respect of the charges, care, and paines
which had been bestowed upon it, and of the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
care which the dresser of the vineyard had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of it.</p>
                        <p>By the three yeares wherein fruit was expected
from the figtree, but not yeelded, wee are in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall,
literall, or punctuall sense to understand
the three yeares of our Saviours propheticall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
here on earth, which were before this time
compleat and ended. By the fourth yeare, wherein
the figtree was permitted to grow upon further tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
wee are to understand the yeare current wherein
this parable was uttered, in the midst of which
yeare our Saviour was consecrated here on earth to
his sacerdotall, or priestly function. And forty daies
after his consecration admitted to excercise this fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

in his heavenly sanctuary.</p>
                        <p>But here it may bee demanded, why this figttee,
that is the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, was permitted to stand
after this fourth yeare was ended, since it continued
this yeare more unfruitfull than the former; for it
is imported in the parable, that unlesse it did beare
fruit within this fourth yeare, it was to bee cut
downe. To this demand wee answer, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the parable is not, that this figtree instantly
was to bee cut downe at the fourth yeares end, but
that the dresser of the vineyard would not intreat the
owner any longer for it, in such manner as hee had
done before, but would leave it wholly to his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
how it should be disposed of; or in what time,
or by what degrees it was to bee cut downe. True
it is, that it was not utterly cut downe at this fourth
yeares end, for the Church and the common weale
of the <hi>Iewes</hi> represented the figtree did continue
almost forty yeares after this fourth yeare ended,
but stood like a tree, or stemme of a tree, marked to
bee felled. There did not passe one yeare of forty
wherein it did not receive some chops, or deepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
in the roote or stemme, not one yeare wherein
it was not despoiled of some principall branches.
And during this time the Sonne of God, here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the dresser of the vineyard, stood as a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatour,
made no intercession for it. For after this
people had reiected him from being their King and
and protector, Gods fearefull judgements often
threatned and denounced against it, tooke their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
processe without any prohibition.</p>
                        <p>This Church or people were not to expect any


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7862:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
extraordinary favour or more favourable signes
than other Nations had: yet signes they had many
of their miserable ruine and desolation of their
countrey: which they might have observed, which
if they had observed but in such measure and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as many heathens did the like, they might have
beene acquitted <hi>à tanto,</hi> though not <hi>à toto;</hi> their ruine
and destruction after it became in a manner necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
was not necessarily decreed to bee so inevitable,
as by their owne stubbornenesse they made it in the
issue. Thus much in generall of the sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the owner of the vineyard and the dresser of
it, of the figtree, and of the three yeares wherein it
continued fruitlesse, and of the fourth yeare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was to be cut downe.</p>
                        <p>But as for the figtree and the yeares wherein it
was permitted to stand, besides the former punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or historicall sense, they have an exemplary or
indefinite sense. That which is fore-prophecied of
this particular figtree or Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> holds
true, in proportion, of every particular visible
Church on earth. Every one of them have their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
forewarnings or appointed times for bringing
forth fruit, within which time, if they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
they are exempted from our Saviours speciall
protection, and left open to the ordinary processe of
Gods judgements, as this particular figtree was.
This is the only difference, that the forewarnings of
other Churches and Nations are not in respect of
the time so expresse, so determinate and punctuall
as this figtree had. Now are they mark't to the fall
by the selfe same degrees, that this figtree was; the


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7862:87"/>
time of their fall and ruine after such forewarnings
is not so determinate in respect of us, as the time of
<hi>Ierusalem's</hi> and <hi>Iudah's</hi> ruine after our Saviours
death, and resurrection were. For the time of their
ruine was both foretold by the Prophets, and prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
by matter of fact; as by their fore-elders
wandring forty yeares in the wildernesse, and by the
forty dayes, which after our Saviours resurrection
were given them to bethinke themselves better, and
to make their peace with God, as the <hi>Ninevites</hi> did
upon forewarning given them by <hi>Ionas.</hi> But leaving
these punctuall, or speciall forewarnings, wee are to
follow the forewarnings here mentioned in the 3.
and 4. verses of this Chapter, with the like generall
signes of times ensuing.</p>
                        <p>The province of <hi>Galilee</hi> had its forewarning in
the massacre of these <hi>Galileans</hi> whose bloud <hi>Pilate</hi>
mingled with the sacrifices. The inhabitants of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
had their particular forewaring likewise in
the lamentable disaster of those eighteene, upon
whom the tower in <hi>Siloe</hi> fell.</p>
                        <p>These <hi>Galileans</hi> (were they many or few) did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and their disaster for this reason
was more publique, such as the whole nation of the
<hi>Iewes</hi> could not but take notice of; so that both signes
put together with the circumstances of the time, and
place wherein they hapned, did portend that the utter
ruine of the whole nation should be in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It might be true in part, which the chiefe Priests
and Pharisees had observed. <hi>Ioh. 7. 52. Serch and
looke, for out of Galilee ariseth no Prophet.</hi> Nor was
our Saviour, to whom they apply this observation in


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7862:87"/>
particular, a <hi>Galilean</hi> by birth, but a neighbour-born
unto <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> for he was borne in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the city
of <hi>David.</hi> But at the time of this great Prophets birth,
who was to falsifie their observation in respect of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
times (for he made <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Galileans</hi> more then Prophets) there arose a sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
sect in <hi>Galilee,</hi> which did first oppose the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of tribute unto <hi>Caesar.</hi> And all the opposition
which this rebellious people made against the <hi>Roman</hi>
empire tooke its originall from <hi>Iudas</hi> the <hi>Gaulonite,</hi>
and his sons. And as <hi>Galilee</hi> was the beginning of woe
unto <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, so it was the
first in the plagues and woes here denounced. For
<hi>Vespasian</hi> being sent to quell this rebellion, made
his first invasion upon <hi>Galilee,</hi> and tooke in all the
cities and principall townes within that province,
before hee made any assault upon <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or other
cities of <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The number of <hi>Galileans,</hi> which perished in that
warre, was so great, that I should hardly believe <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
his relations or them, unlesse our Saviour had
foretold this calamity was to bee nationall, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
for all were to perish, besides such as did in
time repent, which (God wote) were but a few.</p>
                        <p>But had those <hi>Galileans</hi> no signes of the times,
besides these forewarnings in my text, to disswade
them from that desperate warre? yes, signes they
had many and most pregnant which did verifie the
literall meaning of our Saviours prophecie, signes
abundant to instruct them, that the Lord had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the <hi>Romans</hi> to rule over them; and these
signes they had partly before, partly after <hi>Vespai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>


                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:7862:88"/>

part against them.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Agrippa</hi> of whom wee read <hi>Acts</hi> 26. in
that excellent oration set downe by <hi>Iosephus</hi> in his
second booke and sixteenth Chapter, did forewarne
them more like a Prophet, than a polititian; but
these forewarnings concern'd the whole Nation as
much as they did <hi>Galilee.</hi> After the invasion made
upon <hi>Galiles</hi> by <hi>Vespasian, Josephus</hi> himselfe, who
wrote the history of those warres in which he had
beene a principall agent, tooke warning by the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
signes of the time, to yeeld himselfe to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
upon the taking of <hi>Iotopata.</hi> But a more feare.
full forewarning they had in the second taking of
<hi>Ioppa,</hi> whither the <hi>Galileans</hi> had fled in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
hoping at least to have escaped the <hi>Romans</hi>
forces by ships, if they were not able to defend
themselves by land; but they found the wind, and
weather to fight more bitterly against them, than
the <hi>Romans</hi> had done. The tempest did drive
them from the Sea, and the <hi>Romans</hi> from the city.
Some were swallowed by the waves, some killed
themselves for feare of being drowned, many were
dashed against the rocks, so that the sea was blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and all the shore was covered with dead bodies.
Such as escaped the Sea, were killed by the <hi>Romans,</hi>
foure thousand two hundred dead bodies were
cast upon the shore. <hi>lib. 3. Chap.</hi> 15. Did the rest
of the <hi>Galileans</hi> take warning by these mens disaster,
or by the destruction of this and other cities, and the
generall desolation of their countrey? They did in
part, but to no purpose. They saw it was in vaine to


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7862:88"/>
defend the cities of <hi>Galilee,</hi> but even the desperate
estate hereof they tooke as a signe of the time, or as
a watch-word to fortify <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the chiefe city,
and <hi>Metropolis</hi> of their Nation. This was the city
which the Lord had chosen amongst all the cities of
<hi>Israel</hi> to place his name there; and God, they thought;
was bound in honour to defend his chosen city. Out
of this perswasion all the men of warre that were
left in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and in other places overrunne by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian,</hi>
did repaire unto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and in the issue of
this resolution they fulfilled that which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
had foretold, that not only the <hi>Galileans,</hi> but
the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should perish.</p>
                        <p>Had those <hi>Galileans,</hi> after despaire of defending
their owne cities, or strong holds or after they saw
<hi>Vespsiaan's</hi> army bent against <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> fled as our
Saviour admonished his followers into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
or dispersed themselves amongst other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they might have escaped that butchery, which
the <hi>Romans</hi> practised upon them, and they upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of their owne Nation. And unlesse they and
others of their owne Nation contrary to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
admonition had floc'kd unto <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (after
they had seene it begirt with the <hi>Roman</hi> forces) the
Burgesses, or inhabitants of that famous city had
submitted themselves unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were
ready to give them better quarter, than now one
Christian Nation will upon like occasion give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But the inhabitants of that city being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowded
with the multitude, which daily flocked
unto them, and which they admitted to be partakers
with them of the legall sacrifices, they became


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7862:89"/>
partakers of that vengeance, which still pursued the
seditious, what place soever they made choice of for
their refuge. Thus by neglecting or contemning the
signes of the time which our Saviour had given
them, the greater part of that Nation, more
then five to one, of such as were then ready to
beare armes, were first shut upon <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as
in a prison, or as so many fatted beasts in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket;
The Temple afterwards becomming as the
slaughter-house or shambles. To recount all the
miseries which they suffered in the city and in the
Temple by the famine, and by the sword, and by the
infection of dead corps, which had no other grave
besides the open streetes, the Temple, and their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
would be a labour infinite, and superfluous for
this place, seeing they are so fully and so pathetically
related by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> whom God had appointed as
the fittest man to keepe the register of them; and you
may at your best leasure without any fee peruse his
records; now more common in our English lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
then the records or Chronicles of our owne
nation. And so no doubt it was Gods will to have
them, that our Nation might take example, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
by them, whom they more concerne then
they doe any Nation since they were first written
by him. My present aime or levell directs me only
to observe the fulfilling of our Saviours words in
my text, and the accomplishment of those signes of
the time, which the owner of this vineyard did give
unto this people, after that the dresser of it (that was
our Saviour) had given over his speciall protection
of them, and left them to the ordinary course of


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7862:89"/>
his fathers justice.</p>
                        <p>The blood of those <hi>Galileans,</hi> whom <hi>Pilate</hi> slew,
did but make a mixture with the blood of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
which they offered; and in this mixture we doe
not read that the blood of these seditious men was
praedominant, or that it was a mixture of the blood
of men and beasts <hi>ad pondus,</hi> or in equall measure.
But after <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was besieged by the <hi>Roman</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<hi>Iosephus,</hi> who relates only the matter of fact,
without any reference to the prediction of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in this place, doth tell us that the Altar did
swimme with the blood of men, the blood of <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi>
as well as of the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in
greater abundance, then at any time it had done
with the blood of beasts. The blood of beasts, or
of legall sacrifices, whilst they were legally offered,
that is, whilst the law was in force, was an infallible
signe unto this people, that God would spare their
persons, and accept of their commutation, that is of
the blood of beasts in liew of the blood of men,
which hee might at all times have justly exacted.
But when the blood of men about the Altar or
Courts of the Temple was shed in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and that by men of <hi>Iewish</hi> progeny, then the
blood of beasts had beene; this was a signe and a
fearefull one, that the righteous Lord would no
longer accept of legall sacrifices, but did require the
blood of those men who had abused the legall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
not as a meanes to pacifie his wrath or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
their deserved punishment, as the blood of
beasts in former time had done, but rather as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
signe, that this was the time appointed for


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7862:90"/>
taking full vengeance of all the righteous blood,
which they, or their forefathers had shed in this holy
city. Or to use our Saviours words, <hi>Luk. 11. 50. 51.
That the blood of all the Prophets which was shed from
the foundation of the world might be required of
this generation from the blood of Able, unto the blood of
Zacharias, which perished betweene the Altar and
the Temple, verily</hi> I <hi>say unto you it shall be required of
this generation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But had this people no other forewarnings to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
from this desperate warre after <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was
besieged by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> besides these prophetical fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warnings
of our Saviour? yes, though the booke of
the Law and Prophets were now sealed up that they
could not read or understand the meaning of it;
though our Saviours forewarnings were quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
or not observed by them; yet the booke of
the visible creatures was still legible; they wanted
not prodigies, or other remarkable signes of the
time, which testified Gods speciall providence in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
all occurrences for the good of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and for their destruction. And these signes were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
even by the Heathens, and others which had
no true knowledge of Christ, or of his prophecies. A
remarkable one was pressed upon them by <hi>Iosephus,</hi>
in his oration unto them; <hi>The fountaines which before
gave you no water, yeild it to</hi> Titus <hi>in great abundance.
You know that before his comming the fountaines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the city and Siloe were so dried up that water was
sold by measure, yet now they flow so plentifully, that
they doe not only serve all the armies, and their cattle
also, but besides that, doe water all the gardens about
lib. 6. c.</hi> 11.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:7862:90"/>
It is a short, but a remarkable observation which
the same Author there makes: <hi>Vespasian</hi> (saith he) <hi>so
gained by warring against us, that hee hath hereby got
the whole empire.</hi> This was a pregnant signe of the
time; for indeed the manner how the <hi>Roman</hi> empire
did within the space of sixteene moneths devolve
from <hi>Nero</hi> upon <hi>Galba,</hi> from <hi>Galba</hi> upon <hi>Otho,</hi> from
<hi>Otho</hi> upon <hi>Vitellius,</hi> rather to crush them than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
them; and the manner againe how the same
empire, after this long tumble, did quietly settle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Vespasian,</hi> and his sonnes, did abundantly testify
even unto the naturall morall man, that this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was wrought by the speciall hand of God. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
sober or civill man which had any notion of
the divine providence, might have cleerly gathered,
that albeit <hi>Nero</hi> had appointed <hi>Vespasian</hi> generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation; yet it was the Lord of
Lords, and King of Kings which had directed, and
appointed <hi>Nero</hi> thus to make this choice, and did
confirme it. Hee againe in those times which had
perused the prophecies might have collected, that
the same Lord of Lords which gave <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>
for his diligent service against the
proud city of <hi>Tyre,</hi> had now reserved the <hi>Roman</hi>
empire for <hi>Vespasian,</hi> as his pay or stipend for the
faithfull service, which hee had done him in his wars
against <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Iudea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The character which the <hi>Roman</hi> historians have
put upon <hi>Galba</hi> was briefe, but pithy; <hi>dignus imperio
nisi imperasset, that hee was in all mens judgments
worthy the empire if hee had not taken it upon him.</hi>
And <hi>Vespasian</hi> himselfe, who afterwards enjoyed


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7862:91"/>
the empire, did esteeme <hi>Galba</hi> worthy of it. Now
that <hi>Galba</hi> enjoyed it, or his life after he was chosen
emperour, so short a while as he did, that was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
seven moneths and seven dayes, this wee may
say, was by the speciall appointment of the Lord, to
the end that <hi>Titus,</hi> being farre on his way towards
<hi>Rome</hi> to present his fathers service, and his owne
unto <hi>Galba,</hi> might upon the unexpected newes of
<hi>Galba's</hi> death turne backe againe into <hi>Iudea,</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the battailes of the Lord against <hi>Ierusalem, and
other cities of the province,</hi> in his fathers absence, who
in the interim was chosen emperour; And this warre
<hi>Titus</hi> managed with as great valour and alacrity as
could be expected of any <hi>Roman</hi> then living, and yet
with greater wisdome and clemency. A man he was
of such a temper and disposition that we may thinke
he was either chosen, or fitted by the maker of all
men, for this purpose, specially that the obstinate
<hi>Iewes,</hi> and all the world besides, might have a visible
model, or character of his owne forme<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> dealing
with this stubborne people.</p>
                        <p>When wee read the sacred story, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. or
the lamentations of <hi>Ieremy</hi> concerning the miserable
massacre of both Priests, and people, of young
and old, and the utter destruction of both city
and temple by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> we cannot much
wonder at such cruelty as was then practised by a
barbarous and cruell tyrant, alwaies willing to doe
his worst against all that did oppose him. But that
these historicall expressions of <hi>Ierusalem's</hi> misery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> a patterne of tyrants, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
true prophecies, that the miseries of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7862:91"/>
at that time should be but as prodigious signes, or
portendment of farre greater miseries under the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Titus,</hi> the flower of curtesy, and mirrour of
affability amongst Princes; this points at somewhat
extraordinary, at somewhat worthy of admiration.
This visible type or shadow hath a body answerable
unto it. <hi>Titus</hi> is the type, or shadow, than whom no
man that day living could have beene more unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
either to practice cruelty upon any private man,
or to bring ruine upon any city or Nation: And yet
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the Queene of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
did suffer farre greater misery under him, than
any city, or Nation of the world besides did ever
suffer under the most bloudy tyrant into whose
hands the Lord had given them. But how unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
soever he was to practice cruelty, or suffer it to
be practised by others under him, yet he was bound
to practice the discipline of warre, not to staine ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his owne worth, or the majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi>
empire by prostituting his native clemency unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
stubborne rebels.</p>
                        <p>That of the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> was never more truely
verified, never more exactly fulfilled in any genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this people, than it was in this last. <hi>Perditio
tua ex te ô Israel, salus ex me.</hi> That this city and
Temple was spared so long, <hi>that this people had so
large a time for repentance,</hi> this was altogether from
God, <hi>who willeth not the death of him that dyes;</hi> and
to testify this <hi>amor benevolentiae, this good will of his</hi>
unto them as they were men, even unto the last end,
and after they had broken off <hi>amorem amicitiae, the
love of friendship,</hi> he sends for a generall against them


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7862:92"/>
not a <hi>Vitellius</hi> but a <hi>Titus,</hi> a man <hi>quoad haec,</hi> or in
this particular after his owne heart, a man as it were
composed of princely valour, and clemency; That
in the issue, the city, the Temple, and people perished
after such a tragicall and unparallel'd a manner, as
they did, this was their owne doing, their owne see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
They themselves did give fire first unto the
Temple, and afterwards by their desperate stubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
provoked the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers to accomplish
the combustion so contrary unto <hi>Titus</hi> his will, and
command, that nothing besides necessity would
have excused them: but thus they and their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
provoked God himselfe to punish and plague
them so often as they were plagued; hee being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
of his owne nature, and goodnesse more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
towards them, than any father can be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his sonne, than any mother towards the fruits
of her wombe.</p>
                        <p>To conclude this point; the blood of these few
<hi>Galileans</hi> which <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with the blood of
their sacrifices, and that disaster which befell those
eighteene by the fall of the Tower in <hi>Siloe,</hi> being
compared with the nationall disaster of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
&amp; <hi>Galilee,</hi> beare but the same proportion, which the
cloud that <hi>Elias</hi> servants saw arising out of the sea,
like a mans hand, did unto that great inundation
which immediatly followed upon it.</p>
                        <p>Now as none but a Prophet could have prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticated
such abundance of moisture from so
litle an appearance: so none but the Prince of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
could have discovered that unparallel'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Galilee, Iudea,</hi> and the <hi>Iewish</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE most vsefull consideration which
these words discussed, compared with
the former chapter, afford us, are for
the generall two.</p>
                     <p>First, they teach us to beware of
rash iudgment, or censuring others as extraordinary
sinners, or more grieuous sinners then our selues,
though Gods visible iudgments vpon them (which
are alwayes most just) be extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they instruct us to lay Gods extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
judgements upon others, or other unusuall
signes of the times unto our own hearts. For these are
the usuall meanes whereby the spirit of God doth
worke sinners to true repentance. Wherein true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
(which is the duties whereunto our Saviour
by these signes exhorts the people) doth consist, is
the subject of other meditations consonant to these
present.</p>
                     <p>To the first point [that rash judgment, or vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
censuring of others, is a foule fault even in best
men] all men, good and bad, doe agree. But not to
censure, or esteeme of others on whom God hath
shewed notorious judgments; as more notorious
sinners then those which escape his judgments, this
may seeme for diverse reasons questionable. First,
as all sober-minded men agree, it cannot stand with
the goodnesse of God to plague, or punish any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7862:94"/>
for some sinne or other. And if thus to deale with
men be a branch of his goodnes, it must be a branch
of his justice to recompence extraordinary and
grievous sinners with extraordinary and grievous
punishments. What fault is it then to judge of the
cause by the effect? why may we not censure them
for notorious sinners, or more grievous sinners than
our selves, whom the righteous Lord hath remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
judged, or grievously punished? If to reward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man according to all his waies bee the irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rule of eternall, and unchangeable justice, what
reason have wee to deny all those to bee most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
sinners, which he that cannot erre in judgment
hath punished most severely?</p>
                     <p>Every part of these <hi>Quere's</hi> would sway much
with any reasonable Christian, if there were no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
reserved by Gods eternall justice for the
life to come. All of them would bee unanswerable,
if the truth of that maxime, or generall rule, <hi>God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
every man according to all his wayes or workes,</hi>
did determine, or expire with our last mortall
breaths. But seeing we all expect, or at least professe
our expectation, that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> shall come to judge
as well all those which are dead, as those which he
shal finde alive at his second comming, we cannot by
rule of faith or reason expect that every man should
be rewarded according to all his waies, before that
last and finall judgment. Wee may not presume that
any man, the least sinner that dyes in his sinnes,
should be punished according to all his deserts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that last and generall assize. After that day, or
after the eternall and most righteous judge hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7862:94"/>
finall sentence, wee may safely say and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
that this man hath beene a more grievous
sinner than that, than we our selves were, because we
see him more grievously punished, or sentenced to a
more grievous punishment, than wee or others are;
but before this day it is not Christian-like, it is not
safe to say or thinke, that this man is a more grievous
sinner than wee our selves are, for than this man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be more grievously plagued, than wee our
selves, or others whom wee thinke well of, so long
as either they or wee have one houres space left for
repentance. To judge of the measure of any mans
sinnes by the manner of his punishments here on
earth, or to determine of his future estate by his
present death or disaster, is to usurpe or trench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> his royall prerogative, which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
by word, or sentence interlocutory, which
to preoccupate by any peremptory or censorious
thought, is more than a <hi>praemunire,</hi> a branch of high
treason, or rebellion against him.</p>
                     <p>Besides this exception, which cleerely infringes
the former allegations for judging of the cause by
the effect, or measuring mens sinnes by the manner
of their visible punishments, many positive reasons
there be, which might perswade us, that our most
good, and gracious God, without impeachment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his unchangeable mercy and justice, may, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
doth in this life shew extraordinary mercy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
sinners, and recompence ordinary sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
men not so sinfull as the best of us account our
selves to be, with extraordinary punishments in this
life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:7862:95"/>
Both parts of this allegation may bee proved by
instance, and by rule, by examples of Scripture, and
by reason grounded on Scripture.</p>
                     <p>First, because such as have beene extraordinary
sinners have obtained extraordinary mercy. There
was not an honest matron, or unmarried woman in
in the land of <hi>Iudea</hi> or <hi>Galilee,</hi> but would have taken
it for a defamation to have beene compared to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Magdalen.</hi> Shee was a notorious sinner in that
notorious sinne of wantonnesse and uncleanenesse,
and yet obtained greater mercy than any woman of
her time, besides the blessed <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> for shee
was endowed with an extraordinary measure of
that excellent gift of love and charity. Our Saviour
gives her this testimony, that shee loved much.
And the reason, why shee loved much, was because
many sinnes, and those of the worst kind of sinnes,
were forgiven her. Here was mercy two wayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.
First, in that shee had many such sinnes
foregiven her. Secondly, in that shee loved much.
For this extraordinary measure of love, through the
same goodnesse of God, by which it was given her,
was to have an extraordinary reward. Againe, what
disciple, or Apostle of our Saviour was there, which
might not have upbraided <hi>Peter</hi> with extraordinary
ingratitude (which is the height of sinne) for denying
his Lord and master three severall times expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in a manner judicially. And yet for all this
Gods mercy, and gratious favour towards him was
extraordinary, even in respect of other disciples and
Apostles, the disciple whom <hi>Iesus</hi> loved only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
<hi>Paul</hi> for a long time was a blaspheamer of


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7862:95"/>
the evangelicall truth, a more furious persecutor of
such as followed the waies of life, then the Prince of
his tribe, King <hi>Saul,</hi> had beene of righteous <hi>David.</hi>
And yet this man from a notorious sinner, from a
persecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> was changed into a zealous <hi>Paul,</hi>
became a valiant champion for the faith, more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in maintaining it, than hee had beene furious in
persecuting such as professed it. And this suddaine,
and extraordinary change was wrought by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
mercy of God.</p>
                     <p>But doe not these and the like instances, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Gods extraordinary mercy, favour and
bounty towards extraordinary and notorious sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
no way prejudice or impeach the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mercy of God, or his impartiall dealing with
men? No, for the extraordinary mercy which hee
shewed, did not extend to them only, but to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
sinners in the like kind unto the worlds
end. His extraordinary mercy, and favour unto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Magdalen</hi> was as a pledge of his mercy, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to all like sinners of her sexe, so they would
by true repentance accept, and embrace his mercy
and favour manifested unto her. If any which heare,
or read of his mercy exhibited to her, doe finally
perish, their perdition is from themselues. If any
truely repent, their salvation and repentance (by
which they become immediatly capable of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
is from the Lord. Gods extraordinary mercy
unro <hi>Peter,</hi> who had in a manner made shipwrack of
his faith, was as <hi>secunda tabula post naufragium, as
a planck, or mast cast out after shipwrack,</hi> not only for
his succour, but for the succour of all the <hi>Iewish</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7862:96"/>
which had denied the Lord that bought them.
As many of this nation as after <hi>Peters</hi> conversion
were converted and saved, their conversion, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
was meerely from the Lord; as many of them
as perished, did therefore perish, because they did
not repent as <hi>Peter</hi> did; and they did therefore not
repent, because they did not lay Gods mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and to their country-men converted by
him, to their hearts. That extraordinary mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
which God exhibited unto <hi>Paul,</hi> yeelds the
assurance of faith, a sure anchor of hope, to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
of the Church whether <hi>Heathens, Turkes,</hi>
or <hi>Infidels,</hi> that there is plenteous redemption with
God in Christ, mercy plenteous to worke repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in them, and (by repentance) compleat redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of body and soule. As many of <hi>Turkes</hi> or other
<hi>infidels</hi> as doe not repent, and by their not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
perish, their perdition or not repentance is
from themselues. Not the saluation only, but the
repentance of such as doe repent is meerely from
God: and this God our Lord, who is rich in mercy
towards all, did worke repentance in <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi>
in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by meanes and
motiues extraordinary, that all such sinners as they
were might belieue and knowe, that no sinners are
excluded from possibility of repentance in this life,
but that the mercy which he shewed to them by
meanes extraordinary, is daily exhibited by meanes
ordinary, that is, by the administration of the word,
and sacraments, vnto all that doe not wilfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
themselues.</p>
                     <p>The second point proposed was, that God doth


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7862:96"/>
award extraordinary visible punishments vnto or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
sinners, without impeachment to his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
justice, or to that ingraffed notion, which
all Christians haue of his unpartiall dealing with
the sonnes of men.</p>
                     <p>It was an extraordinary visitation wherewith he
visited the inhabitants of <hi>Bethshemesh,</hi> and their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.
1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 19. for he smote of the people
fiftie thousand threescore and tenne men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had looked into the Arke of the Lord.
It was likewise an extraordinary punishment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Vzzah,</hi> who being but a <hi>Leuite,</hi> did touch
the Arke of the Lord. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 6. For he was
smitten with suddaine death, from which kinde of
punishment all of us doe pray, or ought to pray, that
the Lord would deliuer us.</p>
                     <p>But may wee therefore conclude that these men
of <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> were sinners above all the men of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
or that <hi>Vzzah</hi> was a more grievous sinner than
any <hi>Levite</hi> of his age on whom the Lord did not
shew like punishments? God forbid, yea our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
who is both our Lord and God, hath in my text
forbidden us to passe the like censure either upon
them, or upon any in after ages, on whom the like
judgements have beene visibly executed. That the
men of <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> did grievously sinne in looking
into the arke of God, no Christian can, no <hi>Iew</hi> doth
deny: But that they were more grievous sinners in
this, than a great part of men (Christians by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession)
are in this our age none but an <hi>Hypocrite</hi>
will affirme. Leaving their persons to be judged by
God, this their particular sinne is more than doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7862:97"/>
by all such, as having neither lawfull calling,
nor abilities to discerne sacred mysteries, will take
upon them not only to looke into the arke of God,
but to determine of his covenant of life and death,
that is of election, and reprobation, the very gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
notion of which termes they understand
not.</p>
                     <p>As for the sinne of <hi>Vzzah,</hi> it was for nature, and
quality the very same, as if a parish clearke in our
dayes should intrude himselfe into a Deacons office,
as if a Deacon should usurpe the function of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
or a Presbyter the office of a Bishop. Now the
delinquents in both these kinds are at this day more
than tenne to one in comparison of the men of
<hi>Bethshemesh</hi> to all the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> or in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Vzzah</hi> to all the <hi>Levites</hi> of his time, which
were not guilty of like sinnes in particular.</p>
                     <p>The judgments which God did shew upon the
men of <hi>Bethshemesh</hi> and upon <hi>Vzzah,</hi> though extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
were yet judgements tempered with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
For God in thus punishing them did forewarne
all posterity not to trespasse in the like kind as they
did, lest a more grievous punishment either in this
life, or in the life to come doe befall them. For as
our Apostle. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. in the like case saith, <hi>all
these were our examples.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But many in this last age, &amp; more than in any age
since our Saviour dyed, and more in this kingdome
than in any one Kingdome under heaven, have pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably
transgressed after the manner of <hi>Vzzah</hi> and
the men of <hi>Bethshemesh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>May we hence therefore conclude that these men


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7862:97"/>
are more grievous sinners than any others of this age,
or Nation, which have not transgressed in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
after these mens example? No, the Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
us to passe this censure, or judgement upon
them: Such as are most free from these presumptuos
sinnes must ever remember that they have often
grievously transgressed the Law of God in some
one kind or other. All of us must lay that saying of
our Saviour to heart; <hi>unlesse wee repent wee shall all
likewise perish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though this place prohibites rash censure and
judgment upon particular sinners, may not wee
which are Gods embassadors pronounce the like u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
sentence, which our Saviour here doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the inhabitants of <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
with the same limitation against this, or any other
Christian Nation, <hi>except yee repent yee shall all perish</hi>
after the same disastrous manner that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did? I tell you nay; this is beyond our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
beyond our instructions, whom God hath
appointed for his embassadors. Our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
hath put in a caveat against all such presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
conjectures, or pretended divinations. The
calamities, and distresses of <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> of
the whole <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation were so generall, and so
tragicall, as no Nation since the beginning of the
world had suffered the like, no other shall suffer the
like unto the worlds end. But then all Nations <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they repent shall perish</hi> after a more fearefull and
visibly disastrous manner, than <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
did. But may wee not in the meane time say, that
these <hi>Galileans,</hi> and inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7862:98"/>
whom this prophecy in my text was literally ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
were sinners above all other Nations or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
in the world, because they suffered such
things as no other Nation, or generation had either
suffered, or shall suffer unto the worlds end? I <hi>tell
you nay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this present generation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> did put
our Saviour, the sonne of God, the God of their
forefathers, to an ignominious death: And this was
the most grievous sinne <hi>quoad speciem,</hi> for its speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
quality that could be committed; A sinne that
could not bee committed againe, for he was to dye
but once, <hi>death hath no more dominion over him.</hi>
But though the sonne of God could dye but once,
yet many this day living may bee as guilty of his
death, as <hi>Iudas,</hi> or <hi>Pilat,</hi> as the most malitious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the chiefe <hi>Priestes,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises</hi>
were. Or admit that those <hi>Iewes</hi> were more deeply
guilty of our Saviours bloud than any generation
since; yet hee that would hence inferre his death to
have beene the chiefe or only cause of all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which be fell that present generation of the
<hi>Iewes.</hi> wherein he dyed, should only proue himselfe
to be more skilfull in laying the charge then in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the iust exoneration, he should shew-himselfe to
be but halfe an accoumptant; but of this elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>But in what sense soeuer the putting our Saviour
to death, was the cause of <hi>Ierusalem's</hi> destruction;
yet this particular sinne in putting our Saviour to
death was not the sinne, or any part of the sinnes
of which they are forewarned by our Saviour to
repent, for this sinne was not as yet committed, nor


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7862:98"/>
so much as thought upon by those <hi>Galileans,</hi> whose
bloud <hi>Pilat</hi> mingled with their sacrifices, or by those
eighteene upon whom the tower in <hi>Siloe</hi> fell. And
no question but these men did perish for such sinnes
as the Nation was for the most part guilty of, and
were forewarned of by exemplary punishments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon these <hi>Galileans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The persecution of our Saviour was but a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome
of those other sinnes of whose deadly issue,
without repentance, they were forewarned by these,
and the like signes of the time. The reason why they
hated the light of the world, after hee had done so
much good unto them, was, because their deeds
were evill <hi>Joh. 3. v. 19. And this is the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that light is come into the world, and men loved
darknesse rather then light, because their deeds were
evill.</hi> What then were those capitall sinnes whereof
they were warned in particular? such in the first
place was their present rebellious disposition, for
which sinne in particular these <hi>Galileans</hi> did thus
perish. But was this all? No, it is one thing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious,
another to bee unrelentingly rebellious.
This unrelentance presupposeth some other fouler
sin then rebellion. As what? Hypocrisie specially, &amp;
when our Saviour upbraids them with this title of
Hypocrisie, as when he saith <hi>Luk. 12. v. 54. Mat. 16.
Yee Hypocrites yee can discerne the face of the skie, and
of the earth, how is it that yee cannot discerne the signes
of the time,</hi> His speech implies that their hypocrisy
was the chiefe cause, why they did not discerne the
signes of the time; Why they were so unrelentingly
rebellious against God and man, that they would


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7862:99"/>
take no warning either from the sonne of God, or
by the calamities of their brethren.</p>
                     <p>Now if any amongst us be as great hypocrites as
they were, they bee as grievous sinners, as guilty of
Christs bloudy death, and liable to as grievous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
either in this life, or in the life to come,
as they were.</p>
                     <p>A Pharisaicall hypocrite none can be, unlesse his
soule bee so wedded to some branches, as hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
them of holy doctrine, or zeale to Gods
word, that he would rather suffer his soule, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be dissolved, then be divorced from his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
That will not be ready as opportunity serves
to persecute all such even unto death, as will not
comply with him, or maintaine his faction. And
this kind of hypocrisie alwaies presupposeth some
other sinnes which breed it, alwaies include some
other sins, or errors which feed and strengthen it.
That error which breeds hypocrisie is a zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be extreamly contrary in all or most points
unto them, whom they undoubtedly know to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the truth as well in some opinions as practises.</p>
                     <p>Satan may instill other erroneous opinions into
his scholars, and yet must be inforced to play the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister
before hee can draw them to admit of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
conclusions, that is lewd, or wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but if he can once insinuate immature perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or strong presumptions of their irreversible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
in Gods favour, hee needs no help of Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
to inferre his intended conclusions. This ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
being swallowed, hee can inforce the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
by good Logicke, by rules of reason, more


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7862:99"/>
cleere then any Syllogisme can make it, then any
philosophicall, or mathematicall demonstration.
For it is an unquestionable rule of reason presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to all rules of Syllogisme<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that an universall negative may bee simply conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as [if no man can be a stone, then no stone can be
a man] the rule is as firme in divinity that if no hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
no envious, or uncharitable man can enter
into the Kingdome of heaven, then no man that must
enter into the Kingdome of heaven, that is irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
ordained to eternall life, can bee an hypocrite,
can be an envious, or uncharitable man. Whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
it will cleerely follow, that if the former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
concerning mens personall, or nationall irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versible
estate in Gods favour have possessed mens
soules and braines before its due time; albeit they
doe the selfe same things that rebels doe, that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
that envious or uncharitable men doe: yet so
long as this opinion stands unshaken they can never
suspect themselves to be rebellious, to be hypocrites
or uncharitable: That which indeed, and in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the holy ghost is rebellion, will bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
interpreted to be the liberty of concience
in defence of Gods lawes; envy hatred, and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablenesse
towards men will goe current for zeale
towards God, and true religion.</p>
                     <p>To illustrate, or confirme these observations
touching the originall, &amp; Symptomes of pharisaicall
hypocrisie by the example &amp; practice of these <hi>Iewes</hi>
according to the order in which they have been now
proposed. The first originall was in the overprising
of the rigid reformation of their forefathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:7862:100"/>
Their fathers worshipped stocks, and stones, the
images or statues of heathen Gods, these latter
sought to bee so extreamly contrary to the heathen,
or to the practises of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> forefathers in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
that they would <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> any civill use of
pictures, and their unrelenting zeale to maintaine this
rigid reformation was the originall of that rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein they perished after they had continued
it seventy yeares more or lesse. For <hi>Herod</hi> the great
having erected a golden eagle upon the wals of the
Temple, not with purpose to have it adored, but in
testimony of his gratitude, and alleageance to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, some of their <hi>Rabbins,</hi> or great
masters did teach their schollars to deface it though
they dyed for it: and death in this holy quarrell was
accounted Martyrdome. Afterwards they were
pressed to admit a statue of the <hi>Roman</hi> emperour in
their Temple, but not urged, as I take it to adore it.
And this did blow the coales of former dissention,
and was the originall of that finall rebellion under
<hi>Nero.</hi> Now if they had not apprehended this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
as an holy warre; or had not affected to become
Martyrs in defence of true religion, they might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have deprecated this eye-sore, or grievance at the
<hi>Roman</hi> deputies hands, as the wiser sort of them
sometimes had done.</p>
                     <p>But howsoever these latter <hi>Iewes,</hi> almost from
the time of their returne from <hi>Babilon,</hi> did increase
the measure of their forefathers grosser sinnes by too
nice and rigid reformation of them, and added pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaicall
hypocrisie unto them, as a new disease of
the soule scarce heard of before; yet this hypocrisy,


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7862:100"/>
though epidemicall to this Nation, had not the
strength to bring forth that monster of uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,
which did portend the ruine of this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
people, untill they were invaded by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
For from the time that this Nation was brought
into subjection by <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, their Church-governours
did allow and appoint dayly sacrifices
to be offered for the peace, and tranquillity of the
<hi>Roman</hi> empire, and security of the emperours. But
a little before the fulfilling of this prophecy in my
text there arose a sect which did condemne this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
after an hundred yeares continuance, as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as contrary to the Law of God, as a pollution
of the Temple. And it is a point observable by such
as read the history of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that of all the iregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,
or prodigious villanies committed in the
Temple during the time of the siege, as the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
deposition of their high Priests, and murther
of them, and others of better place, the faction sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
(by themselves) the <hi>Zealous</hi> were the chiefe
Authors, and a betters. The fruit of this their blind
and misguided zeale was to misinterpret the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their brethren, which would not comply
with them in their furious projects to bee the best
service the only sacrifice then left to offer unto God;
for the daily sacrifice of beasts did cease for want
of provision, they having plenty, or sufficiency of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but of famine.</p>
                     <p>Now, to parallel the sinnes of our Nation, of this
present generation specially, with the sinnes of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Iewes:</hi> As for sinnes against the second table, no
man of unpartiall understanding, or experience can


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7862:101"/>
deny that wee farre exceed them, unlesse it bee for
murther only; disobedience to parents, to magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
adultery, fornication, theft, false witnesse-bearing,
and coveting their neighbours goods are
farre more rife amongst us then they were, or could
be amongst them, at least in the practice. The keene
edge of some few give us occasion to conjecture
what the bloudy issue of misguided zeale would be,
could it once get as strong a back as it had in these
<hi>Iewes,</hi> when there was no King in <hi>Israel,</hi> or in that
<hi>Anarchy</hi> wherein every one did that which was
pleasing in his owne eyes. Againe no man not surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with a <hi>Iewish</hi> slumber, but may cleerly see how
many amongst us, place a great part of religion in
being as extreamly contrary to the <hi>Romish</hi> Church,
as these latter <hi>Iewes</hi> were to the idolatry, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
of the heathen, or of their forefathers. Now
if this zeale of contrariety to <hi>Romish</hi> superstition be
but equall to the like zeale in the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy,
which is the resultance of such misguided
zeale must needs bee more malignant. And easy it
were, if place and time did permit, to demonstrate
how these men condemne themselves by judging
the <hi>Romish</hi> doctrine and discipline, in her grossest er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
&amp; practises. <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But to let this errour passe; if it were a grievous
sinne in this last generation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> to prohibite


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7862:101"/>
the offring of legall sacrifices for the peace and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
for the weale and prosperity of the <hi>Roman</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
whilst the partition wall betwixt the <hi>Iew</hi>
and the <hi>Gentile</hi> was yet for the most part standing;
it cannot be a lesse sinne in such Christians as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
us to offer up the calfes or fruits of our lips, to
wit, the sacrifice of prayer for all men, for all people
in the world, since this partition wall was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
If thus to pray for all men were indeed an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
yet it were, alas, but <hi>error amoris, a charitable
errour;</hi> an errour which deserved pitty, rather then
contempt, and hatred of those who thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wiser in Gods waies than their fathers in
Christ; yet pitty it they doe not, but rather scorne
and contemne it, or persecute such as practise it so
farre as they are able; that is, with bitter and slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
words. And why doe they so? Not out of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
unto mens persons, if we may believe them, but
out of zeale unto Gods word, which forbids the
practice of it, and must be obeyed before any injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Church, which in their construction
are but Lawes of men. But where doth Gods word
so expressely forbid it? Our Saviours practice, as
they alleage, which ought to bee to us a rule more
Saveraigne then any rubrickes in our Church
booke, doth in their opinion by consequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it, as <hi>Iohn Chap. 17. v. 9. I pray for them, I
pray not for the world; but for them which thou hast
given me, for they are thine.</hi> This, for ought I know,
is the only place that can bee pretended against the
practice of our Church. But the question is not
whether our Saviour in this place, or at this time


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7862:102"/>
did pray for his Apostles alone, or for such as
should believe through their report, but what it was
which hee prayed for them only? If our Saviour in
this very place did pray his father not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
some extraordinary gifts upon his Apostles,
and such as they taught <hi>vivâ voce;</hi> but withall for
some visible manifestation of these extraordinary
gifts bestowed upon them,<note place="margin">The extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which our Saviour prayed for, were the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Holy Ghost, and that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable union of soule and mind, and community of goods, and possessions &amp;c. mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 3. 4. &amp;c.</note> this will no way exclude
the world, as it then stood in opposition to true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<hi>in sensu diviso,</hi> from being partaker of his
prayers for gifts ordinary. Now that our Saviour
did thus pray for his Apostles, and the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
to this end and purpose, that these extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gifts bestowed on them alone, might bee an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
to bring the world, and all future genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to bee partakers of ordinary gifts, is evident
from the 20. and 21. <hi>v. Neither pray I for these alone,
but for them also which shall believe on mee through
their word: that they may all be one, as thou father art
in me, and</hi> I <hi>in thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they also may bee one in us:
that the world may believe that thou hast sent mee.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">All which gifts were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to these primitive times.</note>
Our Saviour in this prayer for the world praies not
only that it might bee partaker of the outward
meanes, but of the internall meanes of salvation, yea
of salvation its selfe, for so hee had premised. <hi>v. 3.
This is life eternall, that they may know thee the only
true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So farre then is our Church, or the ancient Church,
whom shee followes, from contradicting our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
meaning in this place, that they tooke his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and practice for their patterne. For as wee are
taught in our Liturgy to pray for all men without


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7862:102"/>
exception we are taught withall nor to pray for all
things for all men promiscuosly, but respectively;
for such things for every man as his estate &amp; conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is immediatly capable of. All men of what Nation
or condition soever, as well <hi>Singula generum</hi> as <hi>genera
singulorum,</hi> are either in the way of truth, or out of it:
This division admits no <hi>medium</hi> or third member.
Now wee are taught to pray for all men, for every
man, that are comprehended in this division; but not
to pray for the same blessings for all. In the first place
wee are taught to pray that God would bring all
those into the wayes of truth as have erred and are
deceived; we doe not pray to God to confirme them
in the way of truth, untill they bee in it; of such as
are in the way of truth (which is the second member
of the universall division) some doe stand, that is
walke in it without stumbling, others fall, others
walke in it, yet but weakely and droopingly: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their severall estates and conditions, wee
pray first, that God would strengthen such as doe
stand; Secondly, that hee would raise up such as doe
fall; Thirdly that hee would helpe and comfort the
weake-hearted or fainting travellers in the wayes
of truth, &amp; finally (not at our first conversion) to tread
downe Sathan under our feet;<note place="margin">Iam. 4. v. 7.</note> For we must resist, we
must encounter him before he will flee from us, and
after his flight we must pursue the victory, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
gotten before we can hope to trample upon him.
But what successe hath our Church found by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
this forme of prayer more than other Churches
which contemne, or deride it? The successe we leave
to God: yet this comfort we have, that albeit many,


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7862:103"/>
or most of them, for whom wee thus daily pray,
may dye in their sinnes, their bloud shall not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at our hands. As for such as maligne, or mock
us for thus praying, let us continue our prayers for
them also, Father forgive us, and forgive them
all our sinnes negligences and ignorances, and
endue us with the grace of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit, to amend our lives
according to thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
word.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS day being the second Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
in Advent drawes mee, as
yee see, unto a new text, being
part of the Gospell for this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.
But my text doth not
draw mee to a new argument.
My former argument, as yee
may remember, was concerning the signes of the
time. And here yee may behold signes of the time
in the frontispice of my text; <hi>There shall bee signes in
the sunne, and in the moone &amp;c. Vpon the earth and in
the waters,</hi> that is, in every part of this great, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
booke of the creature. But of what, or of what
times were these signes here foretold? To the former
part of this question our Evangelist hath made a full


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7862:105"/>
answer. <hi>v. 27, These were signes of the sonne of man's
comming to judgement with power, and great glory.</hi>
By the sonne of man, yee know, is meant our Lord
and Saviour Christ, and his comming was expected
by this people, one, and other. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> knew
this to be the title of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and out of this
Notion or description of his person, and office hee
being in prison sent two of his disciples unto him
with this Embassage, <hi>Luk, 7. v. 19. Art thou hee that
should come, or are wee to looke for another;</hi> And from
this Embassage of <hi>Iohn</hi> the next Dominicall, or
Lords day takes its denomination, or right to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
amongst the Dominicalls consecrated to the
memory of his comming. The <hi>Pharisees</hi> likewise
knew this title of <hi>him that was to come</hi> to belong
unto Christ, <hi>or unto the great Prophet, which God had
promised to raise up unto them like to Moses.</hi> And
out of this notion they propound this interrogatory
unto <hi>Iohn, Iohn 1. 21. Art thou Elias, art thou that
Prophet, and againe, v. 25. Why baptizest thou then if
thou be not that Christ, nor Elias neither that Prophet.</hi>
And from Iohn's answer to these interrogatories
<hi>v.</hi> 26. 27. I <hi>baptize with water, but there standeth one
among you, whom yee know not, hee it is who comming
after mee is preferred before me,</hi> The fourth, and last
Dominicall takes its denomination, or right to bee
enrolled amongst the dayes consecrated to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his comming. The Dominicall, or Lords
day last past takes its denomination from the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
appointed for that day. <hi>Behold o Sion thy King
commeth. &amp;c.</hi> So doth this present day, or second
sunday in Advent take this title from that clause of


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7862:105"/>
the Gospell, <hi>v. 27. And then they shall see the sonne
of man comming in a cloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the comming of Christ, the sonne of man,
and the sonne of God, admits in the generall two
degrees. The first, his comming in humility to visit
and redeeme the world. The second, his comming
in power, and glory, to judge the world. The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells
appointed by the Church for the three other
Dominicalls, or Lords dayes in Advent referre to
the first manner of his comming, to wit, in humility
to visit and redeeme his people. The Gospell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for this present day points at his comming
in power, and glory to judge the world. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
then is, whether this prophecy hath beene in
any sort already fulfil'd, or in what sort it shall bee
hereafter fulfil'd, or accomplished? or if this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
were twice to be fulfil'd, the question is, whether
these signes here mentioned in my text, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
as well the last fulfilling of it as the first? That
this prophecy hath been already litterally fulfil'd is
cleere from the 21. and 32. verses of this Chapter.
<hi>Verily I say unto you this generation shall not passe till
all be fulfil'd. All</hi> what? All that he had said concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the signes of the time, so S. <hi>Matthew</hi> expresseth
our Saviour's meaning more fully then S. <hi>Luke</hi> doth
<hi>Math. 24. v. 34. Verily I say unto you this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall not passe till all these things be fulfilled,</hi> that
is, till the terrors of those times wherof he speakes,
untill the signes of these times in the sunne, in the
moone, and in the starres, should bee exhibited. For
by this generation hee comprehends that present
age, or compasse of an hundred yeares taking their


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7862:106"/>
beginning either from the time wherein hee uttered
this prophecy, or from the birth of these his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the greater part whereof were betwixt twenty
and fifty yeares, and but a few of them to live above
fifty yeares after this forewarning; so that this age
or generation whereof hee speakes was to determine
with the lifes of these Auditors: though many of
them did not, yet some of them did, and more
might have outliv'd these signes here foretold. For
these signes were to bee exhibited unto the Nations
not long after the desolation of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as S.
<hi>Marke</hi> tels us, <hi>Chap. 15. v. 24. But in those dayes</hi> after
that tribulation <hi>the sunne shall bee darkned and the
moone shall not give her light, and the starres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be
shaken.</hi> Or least any man should except that the sun
might bee darkned after the dayes of <hi>Ierusalem's</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
and sorrow, and yet not bee so darkned till
the last day, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath put in a caveat against
this exception, <hi>Mat. 24. 29. Immediatly after the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
of those dayes shall the sunne be darkned, &amp; the
moone shall not give her light.</hi> So that if we can point
out the time, wherein all that our Saviour said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the tribulation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Iury</hi> were
fulfilled, wee may easily finde out the appointed
time, wherein the signes in my text were to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>
                  <p>That which must direct us in the right search of
the tribulations precedent to his comming here lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
meant, is our Saviour's censure upon his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
admiration at the goodly buildings of the
Temple. <hi>As he went out,</hi> saith S. <hi>Matthew 24. 1. and


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7862:106"/>
departed from the Temple, his Disciples came to him
to shew him the buildings of the Temple,</hi> S. <hi>Marke</hi> tels
us Chap. 13. 1. <hi>that one of his Disciples saith unto him,
master see what manner of stones, and what buildings
are here.</hi> And because this one Disciple is not named
S. <hi>Matthew</hi> indefinitely saith, <hi>his Disciples came
unto him.</hi> A strange humour in them (were they one
or more) for how could they imagine that hee had
not observed the goodlinesse of these buildings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But upon what occasion soever (they or he, one
or more of them) did move him to view the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
his reply unto this motion was unexpected,
<hi>For hee saith unto them, see you not all these things?
Verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one
stone upon another, that shall not bee throwne downe.
Mat. 24. 2. Mark. 13. 2. Luk.</hi> 21. 6. And thus much
he had told them with weeping eyes before, <hi>Luk.
19.</hi> 44. But it seemes they were at better leasure to
hearken unto this second prediction of the Temples
destruction, than they were before when their eares
were filled with the joyfull shouts of <hi>Hosanna, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
bee hee that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi> And
hence as he sate upon the mount of Olives, over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Temple, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and
<hi>Andrew,</hi> asked him privately, <hi>tell us when shall these
things bee? and what shall bee the signes, when these
things shall bee fulfilled? Marke 13. v.</hi> 34. All of his
Disciples at least all of them which moved this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
did agree in this prenotion, that all these things
should bee fulfilled at his comming and that at his
comming to judgement the world should have an
end. Hence S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 3. relates the question thus.


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7862:107"/>
                     <hi>Tell us when shall these things bee, and what shall bee
the signe of thy comming, and of the end of the world?</hi>
But this question, though not so intended by them,
was <hi>fallacia ad plures interrogationes,</hi> a question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of two parts, one so different from the other
that one and the same answer could not befit both;
and therefore hee makes answer <hi>distinguendo,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively
to both parts. Concerning the signes of
his first comming to declare himselfe to be the judge
of the world, or the signes precedent to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Temple, he gives them a plaine perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory
answer. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. from <hi>v.</hi> 4. to the 36. And so
againe <hi>Mark.</hi> 13. from <hi>v.</hi> the 5. to <hi>v.</hi> 32. And in this
Chapter from <hi>v.</hi> 10. to <hi>v.</hi> 32. But concerning the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the question when the world should
end, or the signes that should preceede, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceales,
or rather exhorts them not to enquire after
it; <hi>But of that day and houre,</hi> that is, the day of finall
judgement, or the end of the world, <hi>knoweth no man,
no not the Angels of heaven, but my father only. Mat.
24.</hi> 36. And <hi>Mark. 13. 32. But of that day and houre
knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
neither the Son, but the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this answere concernes only the second
part of the former question, to wit, the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the world shall end, is hence evident for that the
Angels, yea and such as understood the Prophets,
at least our Saviour Christ, as man, did know the
time appointed, for the destruction of the Temple,
and the desolation of the holy Citie and land, for
thus much was punctually and litterally foretold by
<hi>Daniel</hi> Chap. 9. 24. <hi>Seaventy weekes are determined


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7862:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finish the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
and to make an end of sinnes, and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
righteousnesse, &amp;c.</hi> No question but <hi>Daniel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and the Angel which instructed him, did know
the precise point of time when <hi>these seaventy weekes</hi>
did commence; although Chronologers at this day
varie a little upon this point, &amp; he that knew the time
when they begun, might easily collect at what time
they were to end. For these <hi>seaventy weekes,</hi> or sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
seavens of yeares, make vp the iust summe of
foure hundred and ninetie yeares, and so long did
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> continue after it was restored againe by
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> and his successors in the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire. And
albeit our Saviours Desciples did not at that time,
perhaps clearely vnderstand the Prophecie of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel;</hi>
yet they might cleerly forsee the time of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem's</hi>
destruction by the signes which our Saviour
gives them in this <hi>Chap.</hi> and in the 24. of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi>
The signes were specially three, <hi>first earthquaks
and strange commotion of warres in severall nations,</hi>
as specially betweene the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and other Nations
subject to the <hi>Roman</hi> empire: Secondly, <hi>the generall
hatred wherewith all Nations did persecute Christ's
Disciples,</hi> which were then no Nation, but the fewest
of any sect or profession: For unto the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
our Saviours death, and the death of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Nero,</hi> that saying of our Saviour, <hi>yee shall bee
hated of all men for my name's sake,</hi> hath speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
And it was most remarkably fulfilled
whilst the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation did flourish, or was in
strength. For that Nation did beare more deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7862:108"/>
to such as professed themselves to bee Christs
Disciples, then they did unto the Heathen. And the
Heathens againe, specially the <hi>Romans</hi> did hate and
persecute the Christians as the worst sort amongst
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> of whom they tooke Christ's little flocke
to be a stemme, or branch, because the governours
of it, Christs Apostles, were <hi>Iewes</hi> by progeny. So
that the Lawes which were ennacted in <hi>Rome</hi> against
the <hi>Iewes</hi> were most severely executed upon the
Christians, besides many lawlesse and barbarous
cruelties, which were practised upon many of them
in the time of <hi>Nero</hi> without any check, or impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This was a second signe precedent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The third was the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of desolation foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by our Saviour. <hi>Mat. 24. 15. For the oversprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of abominations,</hi> saith <hi>Daniel. Chap. 9. v. 27. Hee
shall make it desolate, even unto the consummation,
and that determined shall be powred upon the desolate.</hi>
It is termed by our Saviour the <hi>abomination of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi>
because it was an abomination which did
portend the utter desolation of the city, and of the
Temple, wherein this abomination was practised by
the seditious, or that faction which was called the
<hi>zealous.</hi> And this abomination became most remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
from that time that the seditious begun, first
to depose the high Priests, and afterwards to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
them in the Temple. For then they turned
the house of God, <hi>not into a denne of theeves,</hi> but
into a den of murtherers, even a slaughter house. The
fulfilling of this part of our Saviours prophecy, you
may read at your leasure in <hi>Iosephus</hi> in his sixth


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7862:108"/>
booke of the <hi>Iewish</hi> warre. Chap. 1. <hi>O miserable ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
saith he, <hi>what didst thou suffer at the Romans
hands, to bee compared unto this, although they entred
with fire to purge thee from thy iniquity? For now thou
wast no longer the house of God, neither could'st thou
endure being made a Sepulcher of thine inhabitants,
and having by thy civill warres made the Temple a
grave of dead bodyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the abomination which this desperate, and
gracelessely <hi>Iewish</hi> people did commit in the holy
place; (that is in the Temple and in the courts of it)
which brought that miserable desolation upon the
Temple, upon the city &amp; Nation. The <hi>Romans</hi> were
but executioners of Gods wrath &amp; vengeance against
them. And those interpreters of the Gospell who by
the abomination of desolation understand the <hi>Roman</hi>
forces though many theybe, yet the more they be,
or shall be, the more they multiply a strange errour,
or grosse incogitancy. But after the practice of such
abominations, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> relates, in the holy place,
the doome pronounced by our Saviour against the
Temple, against the city, and Nation, became so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable,
and was to bee executed with so much
speed, as every one that in those times feared God
might see the just occasion, and necessity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
admonition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 16. &amp;c. Then let them
which are in <hi>Iudea flee unto the mountaines, let him
which is on the house top not come downe to take any
thing out of his house, neither let him which is in the
field returne backe to fetch his clothes &amp;c. Then shall
be great tribulation, such as was not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world to this time, nor ever shall bee.</hi> The


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7862:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
same admonitions of our Saviour are related <hi>totidem
dem verbis Marke, 13. v.</hi> 14. to the 20. and by <hi>S. Luk.
21.</hi> 21. to the 26. with some additions. <hi>Then let them
which are in Iudea fly unto the mountaines, and let
them which are in the midst of it depart out, and let not
them which are in the countrey enter thereinto. For
these bee the dayes of vengeance, that all things which
are written may be fulfilled, and they shall fall by the
edge of the sword, and shall bee led away captive into all
Nations. And Ierusalem shall bee trodden downe of the
Gentiles, untill the times of the Gentiles bee fulfilled.</hi>
After Gods wrath had once seyzed upon them, the
execution of it was so nimble &amp; quicke, that if it had
continued but some few weeks, or many dayes, as
it had begun, all <hi>Isaacks</hi> seed according to the flesh
had utterly perished. But <hi>for the elect's sake,</hi> or such
as God had chosen out of that Nation to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Kingdome of his sonne, <hi>these dayes of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
were shortned;</hi> And however the persecution
of both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> did not determine with
the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> yet the number of
Christians did multiply faster then the seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
according to the flesh had done in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now
all these signes, which our Saviour had given of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem's</hi>
destruction, were fulfilled within forty
yeares after his resurrection, and ascension; and the
dissolution of the Temple &amp; of the city which these
signes, or abominations did portend, was accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the Autumne following.</p>
                  <p>Now after the exhibition of these signes, and the
tribulation of those dayes, the fearefull signes here
mentioned in my text were immediatly to follow.


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7862:109"/>
But how immediatly? without any delay, or inter
position of time, of dayes, of monthes, or yeares?
this wee may not say, this wee cannot safely collect
from our Saviour's words. These signes were to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
immediatly, <hi>non immediatione te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poris, sed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatione
signorum;</hi> that is, they were to follow imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
not with reference to the next times ensuing,
but with reference to the next remarkable signes of
the times, of which the world (as well the Christians
then encreased as the reliques of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation
as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (who were the greatest part of the
world) after the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were to take
warning. In this sense wee say that one King is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
immediat successor, if there be no King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, albeit their bee an <hi>interregnum</hi> either
of weekes, or moneths betwixt them. The vacancy
of an Episcopall see for one or two yeares, or more
doth not make the next succeeding Bishop not to be
the others immediat successor, albeit there bee an
intermediat time betwixt the ones death, or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall,
and the others election, or consecration. Thus
albeit the signes in my text did immediatly succeed
the former signes of <hi>Ierusalem's</hi> destruction; yet the
world, as well the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and Christians, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had a convenient time allotted to pause, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
upon the strange desolation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
<hi>Iudea,</hi> before the second ranke of signes here in my
text, were to bee exhibited, for they were not exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
untill the second yeare of <hi>Titus</hi> his raigne.
For seeing the Nations would take no notice of
Christ's Kingdome, or of Gods judgements by the
prodigious destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it was, shall I


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7862:110"/>
say his will, yea an act of his mercy to give
them a second, a more solemne publique warning of
that great and terrible day, wherein that Iesus whom
the <hi>Iewes</hi> had crucified, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had
strangely sleighted, and grievously persecuted in his
members, will come with glory and power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
judgement upon all ungodly men, upon all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,
or rebels against his Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to shew you the particular
manner how this phophecy was fulfilled within
that age current, wherein it was uttered, it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to acquaint you with the strange manner
how the <hi>Iewes</hi> first, and the <hi>Romans</hi> after them did
misconstrue, or pervert the signes of the time, which
God had given them for their good. The Heathen
writers themselves acknowledge there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
fame, or received opinion throughout the East,
that the land of <hi>Iury</hi> in this age should bring forth
one who was to be Lord, and King over the whole
world. This generall fame and opinion tooke its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
from the prophecies of the old testament
concerning our Saviour's birth and resurrection.
And unto these propheticall predictions all the
signes of the time did fully accord; yet seeing our
Saviour's Kingdome was not of this world, though
more universall, seeing the authority which hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cercised
was meerely spirituall not temporall, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he would not take upon him to imprison, to put
to death, or to divide inheritances, or to manage
warres against the enemies of this people, they slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him then as most part of the world have done
his true Embassadors since. For who is there almost


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7862:110"/>
that feares the edge of the spirituall sword, unlesse
it be backed with the temporall. But did the Iewish
Nation then take notice of the former constant
fame throughout the East, concerning the great Lord
of Lords which was then to arise out of <hi>Iury?</hi> or
had they no apprehension of the signes of the time
which did confirme, or seale the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
which occasioned this fame? Yes, the signes
of those times did worke very strange, though very
bad effects, even in the very worst of this people.
Their hearts were so overgrowne with pride, vaine-glory,
and hypocrisy, that the abundance of these
and the like bad humours did turne good Physicke,
even the foode of life it selfe into deadly poyson.</p>
                  <p>For out of this undoubted prenotion, that this
was the very time wherein the Lord had promised
to deliver this people from the hands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
they became so prone (as the event proves
they were) to take armes, and rebell against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
partly about the time of our Saviour's birth,
but especially after his resurrection, when his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
began to bee propagated through the world.
There was no man of greater might, or potency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them which did not take upon him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
this peoples deliverance from the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke,
with which the more they strugled, the sorer it cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
them; and the multitude were as prone to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
every one that would take upon him the name
or title of a Saviour, or deliverer. The fore-sight of
this pronenesse in great ones to promise salvation to
this people, and the peoples promptnesse to believe
them, did occasion our Saviour to give these admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7862:111"/>
to his Disciples, <hi>Beware of false Christs, Mat.
24. v. 4. Mark. 13. v. 6. Luk. 21. v.</hi> 6. which would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
in <hi>Iury</hi> before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with
such faire inticeing promises, and pretences of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
<hi>that if it had beene possible the very elect
should have beene deceived by them,</hi> And no question
but many of our Saviour's Disciples had followed
these false <hi>Christs,</hi> unlesse their master the true
<hi>Christ</hi> had expressely forewarned them to beware
of them; or unlesse hee had instructed them that the
victory which God had promised to give his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at this time over their enemies was not to bee
purchased by strength of sword, but by patient pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
of their owne soules in time of warres and
persecutions. And of these times wherein false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
or false Christs did so prevaile with this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was that saying of our Saviour <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 43. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
fulfilled. <hi>I am come in my fathers name, and
yee receive me not, If another shall come in his owne
name, him you will receiue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wisest amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> and amongst the
rest <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that great states-man, or polititian, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the <hi>Iewes</hi> to have failed so fouly in their
hopes of becoming Lords over the Nations by their
expected King, or <hi>Messias</hi> turn'd greater fooles than
the <hi>Iewes</hi> had beene; for having acknowledged the
truth of the former prophecy which was so famous
and so constantly received throughout the East, <hi>He</hi>
would have it fufilled in <hi>Vespatian,</hi> in that hee was
called out of <hi>Iudea</hi> unto the empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is
(as they interpretit) to be Lord of the whole world.
And which is most strange, <hi>Iosephus</hi> himselfe, a <hi>Iew</hi>


                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:7862:111"/>
by birth and education, and therefore acquainted
with the prophecies, or prenotions concerning their
<hi>Messias,</hi> was either the Author of this foolish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
or the first Author now extant that did
publish it. <hi>Tacitus</hi> addes some credit to <hi>Iosephus</hi> his
report of the constant fame throughout the East, that
<hi>Iudea</hi> should at that time bring forth the Lord of
the whole world, but hee makes no addition to <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
his folly in misapplying that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
had said, and the esterne Nation had received
concerning the King that was to arise out of <hi>Iudea</hi>
unto <hi>Vespatian,</hi> making him and his sonnes of true
and lawfull Emperours, false Christs. Now to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awake
the <hi>Romans</hi> out of this proud fantastique
dreame; the true Christ, the Lord of heaven and
earth, and judge of quicke and dead, did exhibit these
signes here mentioned in my text before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had fully digested their triumphant feast, and
joy for the victory which they had gotten over the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe became the
stage whereon these fearefull spectacles were acted,
and the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire were more then spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators,
if no Actors, yet patients in this dolefull
tragedy. Besides the destruction of the old world
by water and of Sodome, and other foure cities by
fire and brimstone, no history of the world doth
mention any such strange calamities as issued from
the burning of the mount <hi>Vesuevius</hi> in <hi>Campania</hi>
which first hapened in the first, or second yeare of
<hi>Titus</hi> although it hath oftentimes since procured
great annoyance to neighbour provinces. But that
it begun first to burne in the dayes of <hi>Titus</hi> is cleere


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7862:112"/>
from the untimely death of <hi>Plyny</hi> the elder that
great <hi>Naturalist,</hi> Who out of curiosity going to
search the cause of it, was choaked to death with
the smoake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have often put you in mind heretofore that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
historians which either never read the sacred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
or did not minde them when they wrotte
their histories are usually the best interpreters as
well of the prophecies in the old as new testament.
Nor is the fulfilling of any prophecy in the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
more litterally, or more punctually related
either in the old, or new testament, then the fulfilling
of this prophecy in my text is by</hi> Dio Cassius, <hi>a most
judicious, and ingenious heathen writer, in the raigne</hi>
of Titus. The suddaine earthquakes were so grievous
that all that valley was sultring hot, and the tops of the
mountaines sunke downe, under the grouud were noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
like thunder, answered with like bellowings above;
the searoared, and the heavens resounded like noyse;
huge and great crashings were heard, as if the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
had fallen together; great stones leaped out of
their places, as high as tops of hils, and after them issued
abundance of fire and smoake, in so much that it dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the ayre, and obscured the sunne, as if it had beene
ecclipsed; so that night was turned into day, and day
into night; many were perswaded that the Gyants had
raised some civill broyles amongst themselves, because
they did see their shapes in smoak, and heard a noyse of
trumpets; others thought the world should bee resolved
into old Caos, or consumed with fire; some ranne out of
their houses into the streets, others from the streets, or
high-wayes into their houses; otherer from sea to land

                  <p>All that I have for this present to adde unto my
former observations, concerning the burning of <hi>Vesu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vius</hi>
is the admirable disposition of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in that he would not have the fulfilling of this
prophecy in my text to be recorded by any Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,
or other sacred writers, but by this heathen hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian;
A bright ray, or beame of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
you may observe in so disposing the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of these times, as that the Evangelist, S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
who usually relates our Saviour's speeches more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
and more at large then the other three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
doth not so much as mention our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
prophecies, either concerning the signes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or these signes
in my text, which were signes of his comming to
judge the Nations. The reason I take it was, because
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> of all the foure Evangelists did out-live both
sorts of the signes, for hee was alive in the dayes of
<hi>Trajan</hi> the emperour, betwixt whose raigne and the
raigne of <hi>Titus,</hi> in whose dayes these signes in my
text were exhibited, <hi>Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Cocceius Nerva</hi>
did successively raigne over the <hi>Romans.</hi> And it may
be S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did purposely omit the Relation of our
Saviours prophecies concerning these signes, or
prognosticks, whether of <hi>Ierusalem's</hi> destruction, or
of Christ's comming to judge the Nations, because
he knew, when hee wrote his Ghospell, hee was to
out-live them, and for this reason his relation of
them would have beene more lyable to suspition,
or to the exceptions of the <hi>Iewes</hi> or heathen, than


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7862:113"/>
the relations of S. <hi>Matthew, Marke,</hi> or <hi>Luke</hi> were,
seeing they all dyed before the destruction of
<hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But did S. <hi>John</hi> know, or what presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have we to thinke he did know, that hee was
to continue his pilgrimage here on earth untill this
prophecy of my text were fulfilled, that is, untill
Christ's comming to give all the Nations of the
world, as well as <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a solemne warning of
of his power, and purpose to judge the world? This
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> might know, or this he could not but know,
from our Saviour's speeches to him and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by him <hi>Iohn. 21. v.</hi> 18. to the 23. Our Saviour
had signified, or intimated to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> by what
manner of death hee should glorifie God, and bid
him <hi>follow him;</hi> the meaning is that he should be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
as our Saviour had beene. But <hi>Peter</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to know the manner of his own death, turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and seeing <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> saith to <hi>Iesus Lord, what shall
this man doe? And Iesus said unto him, if I will that
he tarry till</hi> I <hi>come, what is that unto thee?</hi> The rest of
the brethren, that is, of Christ's disciples made a
false descant upon this sure ground; for they hence
collected, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> should not dye at all; but this
misconstruction of our Saviour's words S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
himselfe <hi>v.</hi> 23. of that <hi>Chap.</hi> plainly refuses. <hi>Iesus said
not unto him, he shall not dye, but if</hi> I <hi>will that he tarry
till</hi> I <hi>come, what is that to thee?</hi> Yet this his annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or comment upon our Saviour's words did better
refute errors past, then prevent the errors, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constructions
of times ensuing. For surely they erre
which interpret our Saviours words as a meere put-off
to <hi>Peters</hi> curious question, or as if they contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7862:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no such prediction, or prophecy concerning
<hi>Iohn,</hi> as the former did concerning <hi>Peter.</hi> And there
is a medium betweene the construction which the
Disciples then made of our Saviours words, and
that construction which others have made since.
The Disciples hence collected that <hi>Iohn</hi> should not
dye at all, others collect that our Saviours speech
was meerely hypotheticall, or conditionall; yet being
proposed by way of interrogation, it is equivalent
to this assertory, or affirmative, It is my will that hee
should tarry till I come, doe not thou grudge at this
but follow me: Now, as you have heard before,
there is a two fold comming of Christ, the one ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall,
or representative, which is the comming here
mentioned in my text, and meant by our Saviour in
his answer to <hi>Peter, Iohn 21 v.</hi> 22. the other reall, or
consummative, to wit, his last comming to Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Disciples did erre only in this, that they
understood our Saviours words unto S. <hi>Peter</hi> of his
last comming to judgement. And if <hi>Iohn</hi> had beene
to tarry on earth till that time, the consequence had
beene true, hee should not have dyed but as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
speakes, <hi>he should have beene changed.</hi> But our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
speakes of his comming here mentioned in my
text, of which comming S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and others then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
were to bee witnesses, and spectators; And of
this comming the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was a
signe, by which his Disciples then alive might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnosticate,
or expect it before they dyed. But of his
last comming to judgement, at least of the time of
the worlds end, our Saviour in my text gave no
signe, but rather inhibited his Disciples to enquire


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7862:114"/>
after it, seeing it was then reserved to his father on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And if any bee disposed to seeke after the signes
of that day, these he must learne of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
who saw his first comming to judgement
in such a sence and manner, as he had seene the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven come with power, and glory, at his
transfiguration upon the mount.</p>
                  <p>But though the time of Christs comming to
judgement bee uncertaine, though wee may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that hee should come unto us in such visible
manner, as hee did to this generation; yet hee dayly
comes to us in a more reall manner, if wee will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our hearts to entertaine him. For so hee comes
to us in his word, and in the sacraments, and this his
comming shall bee unto judgement, unlesse wee exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and judge our selves. But if wee will judge our
selves, we shall not bee judged of the Lord; yea hee
comes unto us in mercy and loving kindnesse. One
way or other hee comes to all. <hi>Behold</hi> (saith hee) I
<hi>stand at the doore and knocke, if any man heare my
voice, and open the doore,</hi> I <hi>will come in to him, and
will sup with him, and he with me. Revel.</hi> 3. 20. Yet he
which thus knocketh, that we may open, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to <hi>knocke that it may be opened to us.</hi> And
indeed the only way by which wee can open the
doore to him is by continuall knocking at the gate
of mercy, that he would open that unto us, that hee
would come unto us by his grace, by the sweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his owne everlasting sacrifice, Lord heare us
when we call upon thee, and open unto us, and so
come unto us, yea <hi>so come quickly.</hi>

            <head>A briefe appendix to the former treatise of the
signes of the time, or divine
forewarnings.</head>
            <p>OF omnious presagements, or abodings good
or bad whether given, taken, or affected; and
of prodigies, or portendments which are,
for the most part, publique signes of the times
wherein they are exhibited, I had in my younger and
better dayes written a large treatise which hitherto
I have not had the opportunity, or leasure to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
out of which I have borrowed two, or three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in the former treatise. But amongst all the
forewarning signes given to this land, as so many
summons to repentance, none which have beene gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
within my memory did make so durable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon my heart and thoughts, as that late
mighty winde, which having begun his terrible visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
from the utmost point of the <hi>South-west,</hi> did
continue it in one night unto the <hi>North-east</hi> corner
of this <hi>Southerne</hi> province. This was more then a
signe of the time; <hi>Tempus ipsum admonebat,</hi> the very
time it selfe wherein it hapened, being the vigils of
that great anniversary <hi>Novemb.</hi> 5. was a signe, to my
apprehension, most significant, and doth interpret
the meaning of this terrible messengers inarticulate
voice, much better then any linguist living this day,
as well as the Prophets (were any such now alive)
could doe. Both the messenger, and the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he delivered his message, doe teach us that truth,
which hath beene often mentioned in these former
meditations, more punctually, and more pithily


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7862:115"/>
than I could then, or can yet expresse it. Thus much
of his meaning, the serious reader may understand,
that albeit wee of this Kingdome were in firme
league with all Nations of the earth with whom we
have had any time commerce; although our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
enemies should become our greatest freinds; yet
it is still in the Lord almighty his power, and as wee
may feare in his purpose, to plague this Kingdome
more grievously by his owne immediate hand, or
by this invisible, but most audible messenger; or by
other like stormes, and tempests, then at any time
he hath done by the famine, by the sword, or by the
plague of pestilence; to bury more living soules as
well of superior as of inferior ranke in the ruines of
their stately houses, or meaner cottages, then the
powder-plotters did intend to doe, or the powder-plot
it selfe, had it taken effect, could have done.</p>

Kingdome grace to looke into his owne heart and
purposes: and to all in authority, whether superior
or inferior, from the highest to the lowest, to looke
not only unto their owne, but unto others waies of
whom they have the care, or oversight, that these
may runne parallel with the waies of God: which if
