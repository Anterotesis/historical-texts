            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the favours I have received from your Lordſhip oblige me to preſent you with ſome token of my <hi>gratitude:</hi> ſo the eſpecial Honour I have for your Lordſhip hath made me <hi>ſollicitous</hi> in the choice of the <hi>Preſent.</hi> For, if I could have given your Lordſhip any choice <hi>Excerptions</hi> out of the <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Learning, I ſhould (according to our <hi>Engliſh Proverb)</hi> thereby but carry <hi>Coals</hi> to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and but give your Lorſhip <hi>Puddle-water,</hi> who, by your own eminent <hi>Knowledge</hi> in thoſe learned <hi>Languages,</hi> can drink out of the very <hi>Fountains</hi> your ſelf.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to preſent your Lordſhip with tedious <hi>Narrations,</hi> were but to ſpeak my own <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Value,</hi> which his Majeſty, and the Publick have of your Lordſhip's Time. And in brief, to offer any thing like what is already in other Books, were but to derogate from your Lordſhip's learning, which the World knows to be univerſal, and unacquainted with few uſefull things contained in any of them.</p>
            <p>Now having (I know not by what accident) engaged my thoughts upon the <hi>Bills of Mortality,</hi> and ſo far ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded therein, as to have reduced ſeveral great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Volumes</hi> into a few perſpicuous <hi>Tables,</hi> and abridged
<pb facs="tcp:55171:3"/>
ſuch <hi>Obſervations</hi> as naturally flowed from them, into a few ſuccinct <hi>Paragraphs,</hi> without any long Series of <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiloquious Deductions,</hi> I have preſumed to ſacrifice theſe my ſmall, but firſt publiſh'd, <hi>Labours</hi> unto your Lordſhip, as unto whoſe benigne acceptance of ſome other of my <hi>Papers,</hi> even the Birth of theſe is due; hoping (if I may without vanity ſay it) they may be of as much uſe to Perſons in your Lordſhip's place, as they are of little or none to me, which is no more then the faireſt <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> are to the <hi>Journey-man Jeweller</hi> that works them, or the poor <hi>Labourer</hi> that firſt dig'd them from the Earth. For with all humble ſubmiſsion to your Lordſhip, I conceive, That it doth not ill-become a <hi>Peer of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> or <hi>Member of his Majeſtie's Council,</hi> to conſider how few ſtarve of the many that beg: That the irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Propoſals</hi> of ſome, to multiply People by <hi>Polygamy,</hi> is withall irrational, and fruitleſs: That the troubleſome ſecluſions in the <hi>Plague-time</hi> is not a remedy to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at vaſt inconveniencies: That the greateſt <hi>Plagues</hi> of the City are equally, and quickly repaired from the Country: That the waſting of <hi>Males</hi> by Wars, and Colonies do not prejudice the due proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and <hi>Females:</hi> That the Opinions of <hi>Plagues</hi> accompanying the Entrance of <hi>Kings</hi> is falſe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious: That <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a Head too big for the Body, and poſsibly too ſtrong: That this Head grows three times as faſt as the Body unto which it belongs, that is, It doubles its People in a third part of the time: That our <hi>Pariſhes</hi> are now grown madly diſproportionable: That our <hi>Temples</hi> are not ſutable to our <hi>Religion:</hi> That the <hi>Trade,</hi> and very <hi>City of London</hi> removes <hi>Weſtward:</hi> That the walled City is but a one fifth of the whole Pyle:
<pb facs="tcp:55171:3"/>
That the old Streets are unfit for the preſent fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie of <hi>Coaches:</hi> That the paſſage of <hi>Ludgate</hi> is a throat too ſtraight for the Body: That the fighting men about <hi>London,</hi> are able to make three as great Armies as can be of uſe in this <hi>Iſland:</hi> That the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Heads is ſuch, as hath certainly much deceived ſome of our <hi>Senatours</hi> in their appointments of <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,</hi> &amp;c. Now, although your Lordſhip's moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Diſcourſes have well informed me, That your Lordſhip is no ſtranger to all theſe <hi>Poſitions;</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I knew not that your Lordſhip had ever dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them from the <hi>Bills of Mortality;</hi> I hoped it might not be ungratefull to your Lordſhip, to ſee unto how much profit that one Talent might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, beſides the many curioſities concerning the waxing, and waning of Diſeaſes, the relation between <hi>Healthfull,</hi> and <hi>fruitfull Seaſons,</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the City and Country <hi>Air,</hi> &amp;c.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving been born, and bred in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and having always obſerved, that moſt of them who conſtantly took in the weekly Bills of <hi>Mortality,</hi> made little other uſe of them, then to look at the foot, how the <hi>Burials</hi> increaſed, or decreaſed; And, among the <hi>Caſualties,</hi> what had happened rare, and extraordinary in the week currant: ſo as they might take the ſame as a <hi>Text</hi> to talk upon, in the next Company; and withall, in the <hi>Plague-time,</hi> how the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> increaſed, or decreaſed, that ſo the <hi>Rich</hi> might judge of the neceſsity of their removall, and <hi>Trades-men</hi> might conjecture what doings they were like to have in their reſpective dealings:</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now, I thought that the Wiſdom of our City had certainly deſigned the laudable practice of take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſtributing theſe Accompts, for other, and greater uſes then thoſe above-mentioned, or at leaſt, that ſome other uſes might be made of them: And thereupon I caſting mine Eye upon ſo many of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55171:10"/>
General <hi>Bills,</hi> as next came to hand, I found encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from them, to look out all the <hi>Bills</hi> I could, and (to be ſhort) to furniſh my ſelf with as much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that kind, even as the Hall of the <hi>Pariſh-Clerks</hi> could afford me; the which, when I had reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tables (the Copies whereof are here inſerted) ſo as to have a view of the whole together, in order to the more ready comparing of one <hi>Year, Seaſon, Pariſh,</hi> or other <hi>Diviſion</hi> of the City, with another, in reſpect of all the <hi>Burials,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtnings,</hi> and of all the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> and <hi>Caſualties</hi> happening in each of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively; I did then begin, not onely to examine the Conceits, Opinions, and Conjectures, which upon view of a few ſcattered <hi>Bills</hi> I had taken up; but did alſo admit new ones, as I found reaſon, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from my <hi>Tables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Moreover, finding ſome <hi>Truths,</hi> and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly-believed Opinions, to ariſe from my Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon theſe neglected <hi>Papers,</hi> I proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to conſider what benefit the knowledge of the ſame would bring to the World; that I might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my ſelf in idle, and uſeleſs Speculations, but like thoſe Noble <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of <hi>Greſham-Colledge</hi> (who reduce their ſubtile Diſquiſitions upon Nature into downright Mechanical uſes) preſent the World with ſome real fruit from thoſe ayrie Bloſſoms.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How far I have ſucceeded in the Premiſſes, I now offer to the World's cenſure. Who, I hope, will not expect from me, not profeſſing Letters, things demonſtrated with the ſame certainty, wherewith Learned men determine in their <hi>Scholes;</hi> but will take it well, that I ſhould offer at a new thing, and could
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55171:10"/>
forbear preſuming to meddle where any of the Learned Pens have ever touched before, and that I have taken the pains, and been at the charge, of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out thoſe <hi>Tables,</hi> whereby all men may both correct my <hi>Poſitions,</hi> and raiſe others of their own: For herein I have, like a ſilly Schole-boy, coming to ſay my Leſſon to the World (that Peeviſh, and Tetchie Maſter) brought a bundle of Rods where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be whipt, for every miſtake I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe firſt of the continued weekly <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> extant at the Pariſh-Clerks <hi>Hall,</hi> begins the 29. of <hi>December,</hi> 1603, being the firſt year of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign; ſince when, a weekly Accompt hath been kept there of <hi>Burials</hi> and <hi>Chriſtnings.</hi> It is true, There were <hi>Bills</hi> before, <hi>viz.</hi> for the years 1592, -93, -94. but ſo interrupted ſince, that I could not depend upon the ſufficiencie of them, rather relying upon thoſe Accompts which have been kept ſince, in order, as to all the uſes I ſhall make of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I believe, that the riſe of keeping theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, was taken from the <hi>Plague:</hi> for the ſaid <hi>Bills</hi> (for ought appears) firſt began in the ſaid year 1592. being a time of great <hi>Mortality;</hi> And after ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, were reſumed again in the year 1603, after the great <hi>Plague</hi> then happening likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe <hi>Bills</hi> were Printed and publiſhed, not onely every week on <hi>Thurſdays,</hi> but alſo a general Accompt of the whole Year was given in, upon the <hi>Thurſday</hi> before <hi>Chriſtmas Day:</hi> which ſaid general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts have been preſented in the ſeveral manners following, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Year 1603, to the Year 1624, <hi>incluſivè,</hi> according to the Pattern here inſerted.</p>

               <p>IN my Diſcourſes upon theſe <hi>Bills</hi> I ſhall firſt ſpeak of the <hi>Caſualties,</hi> then give my Obſervations with reference to the <hi>Places,</hi> and <hi>Pariſhes</hi> comprehended in the <hi>Bills;</hi> and next of the <hi>Years,</hi> and <hi>Seaſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There ſeems to be good reaſon, why the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> ſhould himſelf take notice of the numbers of <hi>Burials,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtnings,</hi> viz. to ſee, whether the City in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe in people; whether it increaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably with the reſt of the Nation; whether it be grown big enough, or too big, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But why the ſame ſhould be made known to the People, otherwiſe then to pleaſe them as with a curioſity, I ſee not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor could I ever yet learn (from the many I have asked, and thoſe not of the leaſt <hi>Sagacity)</hi> to what purpoſe the diſtinction between <hi>Males</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi> is inſerted, or at all taken notice of; or why that of <hi>Marriages</hi> was not equally given in? Nor is it obvious to every body, why the Accompt of <hi>Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties</hi> (whereof we are now ſpeaking) is made? The reaſon, which ſeems moſt obvious for this latter, is, That the ſtate of health in the City may at all times appear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now it may be Objected, That the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends moſt upon the Accompts of <hi>Epidemical Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and upon the chief of them all, the <hi>Plague;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mention of the reſt ſeems onely matter of curioſity.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55171:15"/>
4. But to this we anſwer; That the knowledg even of the numbers, which die of the <hi>Plague,</hi> is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently deduced from the meer Report of the <hi>Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> which onely the Bills afford; but from other Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations, and comparings of the <hi>Plague</hi> with ſome other <hi>Caſualties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. For we ſhall make it probable, that in Years of <hi>Plague</hi> a quarter part more dies of that <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> then are ſet down; the ſame we ſhall alſo prove by the other <hi>Caſualties.</hi> Wherefore, if it be neceſſary to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the World a good Accompt of ſome few <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties,</hi> which ſince it cannot well be done without giving an Accompt of them all, then is our common practiſe of ſo doing very apt, and rational.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now, to make theſe Corrections upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ignorant, and careleſs <hi>Searchers</hi> Reports, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered firſt of what Authority they were in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that is, whether any credit at all were to be given to their Diſtinguiſhments: and finding that many of the <hi>Caſualties</hi> were but matter of ſenſe, as whether a Childe were <hi>Abortive,</hi> or <hi>Stilborn;</hi> whether men were <hi>Aged,</hi> that is to ſay, above ſixty years old, or thereabouts, when they died, without any curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous determination, whether ſuch <hi>Aged</hi> perſons died purely of <hi>Age,</hi> as for that the <hi>Innate heat</hi> was quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, or the <hi>Radical moiſture</hi> quite dried up (for I have heard ſome Candid <hi>Phyſicians</hi> complain of the darkneſs, which themſelves were in hereupon) I ſay, that theſe Diſtinguiſhments being but matter of ſenſe, I concluded the <hi>Searchers</hi> Report might be ſufficient in the Caſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As for <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> if the <hi>Searchers</hi> do but truly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55171:16"/>
Report (as they may) whether the dead Corps were very lean, and worn away, it matters not to many of our purpoſes, whether the Diſeaſe were exactly the ſame, as <hi>Phyſicians</hi> define it in their Books. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, In caſe a man of ſeventy five years old died of a <hi>Cough</hi> (of which had he been free, he might have poſſibly lived to ninety) I eſteem it little errour (as to many of our purpoſes) if this Perſon be, in the Table of <hi>Caſualties,</hi> reckoned among the <hi>Aged,</hi> and not placed under the Title of <hi>Coughs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. In the matter of <hi>Infants</hi> I would deſire but to know clearly, what the <hi>Searchers</hi> mean by <hi>Infants,</hi> as whether Children that cannot ſpeak, as the word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fans</hi> ſeems to ſignifie, or Children under two or three years old, although I ſhould not be ſatisfied, whether the <hi>Infant</hi> died of <hi>Winde,</hi> or of <hi>Teeth,</hi> or of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion,</hi> &amp;c. or were choak'd with <hi>Phlegm,</hi> or elſe of <hi>Teeth, Convulſion,</hi> and <hi>Scowring,</hi> apart, or together, which, they ſay, do often cauſe one another: for, I ſay, it is ſomewhat, to know how many die uſually before they can ſpeak, or how many live paſt any aſsigned number of years.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I ſay, it is enough, if we know from the <hi>Searchers</hi> but the moſt predominant Symptomes; as that one died of the <hi>Head-Ache,</hi> who was ſorely tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with it, though the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Diſeaſe was in the <hi>Stomach.</hi> Again, if one died <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> the matter is not great, whether it be reported in the Bills, <hi>Suddenly, Apoplexie,</hi> or <hi>Planet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrucken,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To conclude, In many of theſe caſes the <hi>Searchers</hi> are able to report the Opinion of the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,</hi>

who was with the Patient, as they receive the ſame from the Friends of the Defunct, and in very many caſes, ſuch as <hi>Drowning, Scalding, Bleeding, Vomiting, making-away them ſelves, Lunatiques, Sores, Small-Pox,</hi> &amp;c. their own ſenſes are ſufficient, and the generality of the World, are able prettie well to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Gowt, Stone, Dropſie, Falling-Sickneſs, Palſie, Agues, Pluriſy, Rickets,</hi> &amp;c. one from another.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But now as for thoſe Caſualties, which are apteſt to be confounded, and miſtaken, I ſhall in the enſuing Diſcourſe preſume to touch upon them ſo far, as the Learning of theſe Bills hath enabled me.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Having premiſed theſe general Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, our firſt Obſervation upon the <hi>Caſualties</hi> ſhall be, that in twenty Years there dying of all diſeaſes and <hi>Caſualties,</hi> 229250. that 71124. dyed of the <hi>Thruſh, Convulſion, Rickets, Teeth,</hi> and <hi>Worms;</hi> and as <hi>Abortives, Chryſomes, Infants, Liver-grown,</hi> and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid;</hi> that is to ſay, that about ⅓. of the whole died of thoſe Diſeaſes, which we gueſs did all light upon Children under four or five Years old.</p>
               <p n="13">13. There died alſo of the <hi>Small-Pox, Swine-Pox,</hi> and <hi>Meaſles,</hi> and of <hi>Worms</hi> without <hi>Convulſions,</hi> 12210. of which number we ſuppoſe likewiſe, that about ½. might be Children under ſix Years old. Now, if we conſider that 16. of the ſaid 229 thouſand died of that extraordinary and grand <hi>Caſualty</hi> the <hi>Plague,</hi> we ſhall finde that about thirty ſix <hi>per centum</hi> of all quick conceptions, died before ſix years old.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The ſecond Obſervation is; That of the ſaid 229250. dying of all Diſeaſes, there died of acute
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55171:17"/>
Diſeaſes (the <hi>Plague</hi> excepted) but about 50000. or 2/9 parts. The which proportion doth give a meaſure of the ſtate, and diſpoſition of this <hi>Climate,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> as to health, theſe <hi>acute,</hi> and <hi>Epidemical</hi> Diſeaſes happening ſuddenly, and vehemently, upon the like corruptions, and alterations in the <hi>Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. The third Obſervation is, that of the ſaid 229. thouſand about 70. died of <hi>Chronical</hi> Diſeaſes, which ſhews (as I conceive) the ſtate, and diſpoſition of the Country (including as well it's <hi>Food,</hi> as <hi>Air)</hi> in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to health, or rather to <hi>longaevity:</hi> for as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>Acute</hi> and <hi>Epidemical</hi> Diſeaſes ſhews the aptneſs of the <hi>Air</hi> to ſuddain and vehement Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo the <hi>Chronical</hi> Diſeaſes ſhew the ordinary temper of the Place, ſo that upon the proportion of <hi>Chronical</hi> Diſeaſes ſeems to hang the judgment of the fitneſs of the Country for <hi>long Life.</hi> For, I conceive, that in Countries ſubject to great <hi>Epidemical</hi> ſweeps men may live very long, but where the proportion of the <hi>Chronical</hi> diſtempers is great, it is not likely to be ſo; becauſe men being long ſick, and alwayes ſickly, cannot live to any great age, as we ſee in ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Metal-men,</hi> who although they are leſs ſubject to acute Diſeaſes then others, yet ſeldome live to be old, that is, not to reach unto thoſe years, which <hi>David</hi> ſaies is the age of man.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The fourth Obſervation is; That of the ſaid 229000. not 4000. died of outward Griefs, as of <hi>Cancers, Fiſtulaes, Sores, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, broken and bruiſed Limbs, Impoſtumes, Itch, King's-evil, Leproſie, Scald-head, Swine-Pox, Wens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> not one in 60.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In the next place, whereas many perſons
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55171:17"/>
live in great fear, and apprehenſion of ſome of the more formidable, and notorious diſeaſes following; I ſhall onely ſet down how many died of each: that the reſpective numbers, being compared with the Total 229250, thoſe perſons may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the hazard they are in.</p>

The Obſervation, which I ſhall add hereunto, is, That the vaſt numbers of <hi>Beggars,</hi> ſwarming up and down this City, do all live, and ſeem to be moſt of them healthy and ſtrong; whereupon I make this Queſtion, Whether, ſince they do all live by Begging, that is, without any kind of labour; it were not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the State to keep them, even although they earned nothing; that ſo they might live regularly, and not in that Debauchery, as many Beggars do; and that they might be cured of their bodily Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies, or taught to work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> each according to his condition, and capacity; or by being employed in ſome work (not better undone) might be accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fitted for labour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To this ſome may Object; That <hi>Beggars</hi> are now maintained by voluntary Contributions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the other way the ſame muſt be done by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55171:19"/>
Tax; and conſequently, the Objects of Charity would be removed, and taken away.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To which we Anſwer; That in <hi>Holland,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no where fewer Beggars appear to charm up commiſeration in the credulous, yet no where is there greater, or more frequent Charity: onely indeed the Magiſtrate is both the <hi>Beggar,</hi> and the <hi>diſpoſer</hi> of what is gotten by <hi>begging;</hi> ſo as all Givers have a Moral certainty, that their Charity ſhall be well applied.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover, I queſtion; Whether what we give to a Wretch, that ſhews us lamentable ſores, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilations, be always out of the pureſt charity? that is, purely for God's ſake; for as much as when we ſee ſuch Objects, we then feel in our ſelves a kinde of pain, and paſſion by conſent; of which we eaſe our ſelves, when we think we have eaſed them, with whom we ſympathized: or elſe we beſpeak aforehand the like commiſeration in others towards our ſelves, when we ſhall (as we fear we may) fall into the like diſtreſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We have ſaid, <hi>'Twere better the Publick ſhould keep the Beggars, though they earned nothing,</hi> &amp;c. But moſt men will laugh to hear us ſuppoſe, That any able to work (as indeed moſt <hi>Beggars</hi> are, in one kind of meaſure, or another) ſhould be kept without earning any thing. But we Anſwer, That if there be but a certain proportion of work to be done; and that the ſame be already done by the <hi>not-Beggars;</hi> then to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the <hi>Beggars</hi> about it, will but transfer the want from one hand to another; nor can a Learner work ſo cheap as a skilfull practiſed Artiſt can. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, A practiſed <hi>Spinner</hi> ſhall ſpin a pound of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55171:19"/>
Wool worth two ſhillings for ſix pence; but a learner, undertaking it for three pence, ſhall make the Wool indeed into Yarn, but not worth twelve pence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This little hint is the model of the greateſt work in the World, which is the making <hi>England</hi> as conſiderable for Trade as <hi>Holland;</hi> for there is but a certain proportion of Trade in the world, and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is prepoſſeſſed of the greater part of it, and is thought to have more skill, and experience to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it: wherefore, to bring <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Holland</hi>'s condition, as to this particular, is the ſame, as to ſend all the Beggars about <hi>London</hi> into the <hi>Weſt-Countrey</hi> to Spin, where they ſhall onely ſpoil the <hi>Clothiers</hi> Wool, and beggar the preſent Spinners at beſt; but, at worſt, put the whole Trade of the Countrey to a ſtand, untill the <hi>Hollander,</hi> being more ready for it, have ſnapt that with the reſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. My next Obſervation is; That but few are <hi>Murthered,</hi> viz. not above 86 of the 22950. which have died of other diſeaſes, and caſualties; whereas in <hi>Paris</hi> few nights ſcape without their <hi>Tragedie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The Reaſons of this we conceive to be <hi>Two:</hi> One is the <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Guard</hi> of the City by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens</hi> themſelves, and that alternately. No man ſettling into a Trade for that employment. And the other is, The natural, and cuſtomary abhorrence of that in humane <hi>Crime,</hi> and all <hi>Bloodſhed</hi> by moſt <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> for of all that are <hi>Executed</hi> few are for <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Beſides the great and frequent Revolutions, and Changes of <hi>Government</hi> ſince the year 1650, have been with little <hi>bloodſhed;</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> themſelves having <hi>Executed</hi> few in compariſon, upon the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55171:20"/>
Accompt of diſturbing their Innovations.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In brief, when any dead Body is found in <hi>England,</hi> no <hi>Algebraiſt,</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncipherer</hi> of Letters, can uſe more ſubtile ſuppoſitions, and varietie of conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures to finde out the Demonſtration, or Cipher; then every common unconcerned Perſon doth to finde out the Murtherers, and that for ever, untill it be done.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The <hi>Lunaticks</hi> are alſo but few, <hi>viz.</hi> 158 in 229250. though I fear many more then are ſet down in our <hi>Bills,</hi> few being entred for ſuch, but thoſe who die at <hi>Bedlam;</hi> and there all ſeem to die of their <hi>Lunacie,</hi> who died <hi>Lunaticks;</hi> for there is much difference in computing the number of <hi>Lunaticks,</hi> that die (though of <hi>Fevers,</hi> and all other Diſeaſes, unto which <hi>Lunacie</hi> is no <hi>Superſedeas)</hi> and thoſe, that die by reaſon of their <hi>Madneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. So that, this <hi>Caſualty</hi> being ſo uncertain, I ſhall not force my ſelf to make any inference from the numbers, and proportions we finde in our Bills con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: onely I dare enſure any man at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, well in his Wits, for one in the thouſand, that he ſhall not die a <hi>Lunatick</hi> in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> within theſe ſeven years, becauſe I finde not above one in about one thouſand five hundred have done ſo.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The like uſe may be made of the Accompts of men, that made away themſelves, who are another ſort of Mad-men, that think to eaſe themſelves of pain by leaping into <hi>Hell;</hi> or elſe are yet more Mad, ſo as to think there is no ſuch place; or that men may go to reſt by death, though they die in <hi>ſelf-murther,</hi> the greateſt Sin.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:55171:20"/>
14. We ſhall ſay nothing of the numbers of thoſe, that have been <hi>Drowned, Killed by falls from Scaffolds,</hi> or by <hi>Carts running over them,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the caſual Trade, and Employment of men, and upon matters, which are but circumſtantial to the Seaſons, and Regions we live in; and affords little of that Science, and Certainty we aim at.</p>
               <p n="15">15. We finde one <hi>Caſualty</hi> in our Bills, of which though there be daily talk, there is little effect, much like our abhorrence of <hi>Toads,</hi> and <hi>Snakes,</hi> as moſt poiſonous Creatures, whereas few men dare ſay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own knowledge, they ever found harm by either; and this <hi>Caſualty</hi> is the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> gotten, for the moſt part, not ſo much by the intemperate uſe of <hi>Venery</hi> (which rather cauſeth the <hi>Gowt)</hi> as of many common Women.</p>
               <p n="16">16. I ſay, the Bills of <hi>Mortality</hi> would take off theſe Bars, which keep ſome men within bounds, as to theſe extravagancies: for in the afore-mentioned 229250 we finde not above 392 to haved died of the <hi>Pox.</hi> Now, forasmuch as it is not good to let the World be lulled into a ſecurity, and belief of Impunity by our Bills, which we intend ſhall not be onely as <hi>Death's-heads</hi> to put men in minde of their <hi>Mortality,</hi> but alſo as <hi>Mercurial Statues</hi> to point out the moſt dangerous ways, that lead us into it, and miſery. We ſhall therefore ſhew, that the <hi>Pox</hi> is not as the <hi>Toads,</hi> and <hi>Snakes</hi> afore-mentioned, but of a quite contrary nature, together with the reaſon, why it appears otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Foraſmuch as by the ordinary diſcourſe of the world it ſeems a great part of men have, at one time,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55171:21"/>
or other, had ſome <hi>ſpecies</hi> of this diſeaſe, I wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why ſo few died of it, eſpecially becauſe I could not take that to be ſo harmleſs, where of ſo many complained very fiercely; upon inquiry I found that thoſe who died of it out of the Hoſpitals (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of <hi>King's-Land,</hi> and the <hi>Lock</hi> in <hi>Southwark)</hi> were returned of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> and <hi>Sores.</hi> And in brief I found, that all mentioned to die of the <hi>French-Pox</hi> were retured by the <hi>Clerks</hi> of Saint <hi>Giles</hi>'s, and Saint <hi>Martin</hi>'s <hi>in the Fields</hi> onely; in which place I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that moſt of the vileſt, and moſt miſerable houſes of uncleanneſs were: from whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that onely <hi>hated</hi> perſons, and ſuch, whoſe very <hi>Noſes</hi> were eaten of, were reported by the <hi>Searchers</hi> to have died of this too frequent <hi>Maladie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. In the next place, it ſhall be examined under what name, or <hi>Caſualtie,</hi> ſuch as die of theſe diſeaſes are brought in: I ſay, under the <hi>Conſumption:</hi> foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as all dying thereof die ſo emaciated and lean (their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> diſappearing upon Death) that the Old-women <hi>Searchers</hi> after the miſt of a Cup of <hi>Ale,</hi> and the bribe of a two-groat fee, inſtead of one, given them, cannot tell whether this emaciation, or leanneſs were from a <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> or from an <hi>Hectick Fever, Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> &amp;c. or from an Infection of the <hi>Spermatick</hi> parts, which in length of time, and in various diſguiſes hath at laſt vitiated the habit of the Body, and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the parts to digeſt their nouriſhment brought them to the condition of Leanneſs above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p n="19">19. My next Obſervation is, that of the <hi>Rickets</hi> we finde no mention among the <hi>Caſualties;</hi> untill the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55171:21"/>
year 1634. and then but of 14 for that whole year.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Now the Queſtion is, whether that Diſeaſe did firſt appear about that time; or whether a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which had been long before, did then firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its Name?</p>
               <p n="21">21. To clear this Difficulty out of the Bills (for I dare venture on no deeper Arguments:) I enquired what other Caſualties before the year 1634, named in the Bills, was moſt like the <hi>Rickets;</hi> and found, not onely by Pretenders to know it, but alſo from other Bills, that <hi>Liver-grown</hi> was the neareſt. For in ſome years I finde <hi>Liver-grown, Spleen,</hi> and <hi>Rickets,</hi> put all together, by reſon (as I conceive) of their likeneſs to each other. Hereupon I added the <hi>Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growns</hi> of the year 1634, <hi>viz.</hi> 77, to the <hi>Rickets</hi> of the ſame year, <hi>viz.</hi> 14. making in all 91. which Total, as alſo the Number 77. it ſelf, I compared with the <hi>Liver-grown</hi> of the precedent year, 1633, <hi>viz.</hi> 82. All which ſhewed me, that the <hi>Rickets</hi> was a new Diſeaſe over and above.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Now, this being but a faint Argument, I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both forwards and backwards, and found, that in the year 1629, when no <hi>Rickets</hi> appeared, there was but 94 <hi>Liver-growns;</hi> and in the year 1636. there was 99 <hi>Liver-grown,</hi> although there were alſo 50 of the <hi>Rickets:</hi> onely this is not to be denyed, that when the <hi>Rickets</hi> grew very numerous (as in the year 1660, <hi>viz.</hi> to be 521.) then there appeared not above 15 of <hi>Liver-grown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. In the year 1659 were 441 <hi>Rickets,</hi> and 8 <hi>Liver-grown.</hi> In the year 1658, were 476 <hi>Rickets,</hi> and 51 <hi>Liver-grown.</hi> Now, though it be granted that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55171:22"/>
theſe Diſeaſes were confounded in the judgment of the <hi>Nurſes,</hi> yet it is moſt certain, that the <hi>Liver-grown</hi> did never but once, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1630, exceed 100. whereas <hi>Anno</hi> 1660, <hi>Liver-grown,</hi> and <hi>Rickets</hi> were 536.</p>
               <p n="24">24. It is alſo to be obſerved, That the <hi>Rickets</hi> were never more numerous then now, and that they are ſtill increaſing; for <hi>Anno</hi> 1649, there was but 190, next year 260, next after that 329. and ſo forwards, with ſome little ſtarting backwards in ſome years, untill the year 1660, which produced the greateſt of all.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Now, ſuch backſtartings ſeem to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal in all things; for we do not onely ſee in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive motion of the wheels of <hi>Watches,</hi> and in the rowing of <hi>Boats,</hi> that there is a little ſtarting, or jerking backwards between every ſtep forwards, but alſo (if I am not much deceived) there appeared the like in the motion of the <hi>Moon,</hi> which in the long <hi>Teleſcopes</hi> at <hi>Greſham-College</hi> one may ſenſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
               <p n="26">26. There ſeems alſo to be another new Diſeaſe, called by our Bills <hi>The ſtopping of the Stomack,</hi> firſt mentioned in the year 1636, the which <hi>Malady</hi> from that year to 1647, increaſed but from 6 to 29; <hi>Anno</hi> 1655 it came to be 145. In 57, to 277. In 60, to 214. Now theſe proportions far exceeding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of proportion generally ariſing from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Inhabitants, and from the reſort of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venae</hi> to the City, ſhews there is ſome new Diſeaſe, which appeareth to the Vulgar as <hi>A ſtopping of the Stomach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55171:22"/>
27. Hereupon I apprehended, that this <hi>Stopping</hi> might be the <hi>Green-ſickneſs,</hi> for as much as I finde few, or none, to have been returned upon that Accompt, although many be viſibly ſtained with it. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame be forborn out of ſhame, I know not? For ſince the world believes, that Marriage cures it, it may ſeem indeed a ſhame, that any Maid ſhould die uncured, when there are more <hi>Males</hi> then <hi>Females,</hi> that is, an overplus of Husbands to all that can be Wives.</p>
               <p n="28">28. In the next place I conjectured, that this <hi>ſtopping of the Stomach</hi> might be the <hi>Mother,</hi> for as much as I have heard of many troubled with <hi>Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> (as they call them) although few returned to have died of them; which conjecture, if it be true, we may then ſafely ſay, That the <hi>Mother-fits</hi> have alſo increaſed.</p>
               <p n="29">29. But I was ſomewhat taken off from thinking this <hi>ſtopping of the Stomach</hi> to be the <hi>Mother,</hi> becauſe I gueſſed rather the <hi>Riſing of the Lights</hi> might be it. For I remembred that ſome Women, troubled with the <hi>Mother-fits,</hi> did complain of a <hi>choaking in their Throats.</hi> Now as I underſtand, it is more conceivable, that the <hi>Lights,</hi> ot <hi>Lungs</hi> (which I have heard called <hi>The Bellows of the Body)</hi> not blowing, that is, neither vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, nor taking in breath, might rather cauſe ſuch a <hi>Choaking,</hi> then that the <hi>Mother</hi> ſhould riſe up thither, and do it. For me-thinks, when a woman is with childe, there is a greater riſing, and yet no ſuch Fits at all.</p>
               <p n="30">30. But what I have ſaid of the <hi>Rickets,</hi> and <hi>ſtopping of the Stomach,</hi> I do in ſome meaſure ſay of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55171:23"/>
                  <hi>Riſing of the Lights</hi> alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe <hi>Riſings</hi> (be they what they will) have increaſed much above the general proportion; for in 1629 there was but 44, and in 1660, 249, <hi>viz.</hi> almoſt ſix times as many.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Now for as much as <hi>Rickets</hi> appear much in the <hi>Over-growing</hi> of <hi>Childrens Livers,</hi> and <hi>Spleons</hi> (as by the Bills may appear) which ſurely may cauſe <hi>ſtopping of the Stomach</hi> by ſqueezing, and crowding upon that part. And for as much as theſe <hi>Choakings,</hi> or <hi>Riſings of the Lights</hi> may proceed from the ſame ſtuffings, as make the <hi>Liver,</hi> and <hi>Spleen</hi> to over-grow their due proportion. And laſtly, for as much as the <hi>Rickets, ſtopping of the Stomach, and riſing of the Lights,</hi> have all increaſed together, and in ſome kinde of correſpondent proportions; it ſeems to me, that they depend one upon another. And that what is the <hi>Rickets</hi> in children may be the other in more grown bodies; for ſurely children, which recover of the <hi>Rickets,</hi> may retain ſomewhat ſufficient to cauſe what I have imagined; but of this let the learned <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> conſider, as I preſume they have.</p>
               <p n="32">32. I had not medled thus far, but that I have heard, the firſt hints of the circulation of the Blood were taken from a common Perſon's wondering what became of all the blood which iſſued out of the heart, ſince the heart beats above three thouſand times an hour, although but one drop ſhould be pumpt out of it, at every ſtroke.</p>
               <p n="33">33. The <hi>Stone</hi> ſeemed to decreaſe: for in 1632, 33, 34, 35, and 36. there died of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and <hi>Strangury,</hi> 254. And in the Years 1655, 56, 57, 58, 59, and 1660<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but 250, which numbers although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55171:23"/>
they be almoſt equal, yet conſidering the Burials of the firſt named five Years were but half thoſe of the latter, it ſeems to be decreaſed by about one half.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Now the <hi>Stone,</hi> and <hi>Strangury,</hi> are diſeaſes, which moſt men know, that feel them, unleſs it be in ſome few caſes, where (as I have heard <hi>Phyſicians</hi> ſay) a <hi>Stone</hi> is held up by the <hi>Filmes</hi> of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> and ſo kept from grating, or offending it.</p>
               <p n="35">35. The <hi>Gowt</hi> ſtands much at a ſtay, that is, it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the general proportion of Burials; there dies not above one of 1000. of the <hi>Gowt,</hi> although I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that more die <hi>Gowty.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe thoſe that have the <hi>Gowt,</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Long-livers,</hi> and therefore, when ſuch die, they are returned as <hi>Aged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="36">36. The <hi>Scurvy</hi> hath likewiſe increaſed, and that gradually from 12. <hi>Anno</hi> 1629. to 95. <hi>Anno</hi> 1660.</p>
               <p n="37">37. The <hi>Tyſſick</hi> ſeems to be quite worn away, but that it is probable the ſame is entred as <hi>Cough,</hi> or <hi>Conſumption.</hi>

               <p n="38">38. <hi>Agues</hi> and <hi>Fevers</hi> are entred promiſcuouſly, yet in the few Bills, wherein they have been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, it appears, that not above one in 40, of the whole are <hi>Agues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="39">39. The <hi>Abortives,</hi> and <hi>Stil-born</hi> are about the twentieth part of thoſe that are <hi>Chriſtned,</hi> and the numbers ſeem the ſame thirty Years ago as now, which ſhews there were more proportion in thoſe Years then now: or elſe that in theſe latter Years due Accompts have not been kept of the <hi>Abortives,</hi> as having been Buried without notice, and perhaps not in <hi>Church-Yards.</hi>

40. For that there hath been a neglect in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> is moſt certain, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the year 1642, we finde the <hi>Burials</hi> but equal with the <hi>Chriſtnings,</hi> or near thereabouts, but in 1648, when the differences in <hi>Religion</hi> had changed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> were but two thirds of the <hi>Burials.</hi> And in the year 1659, not half, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> were 14720. (of the <hi>Plague</hi> but 36) and the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> were but 5670, which great diſproportion could be from no other Cauſe, then that above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, for as much as the ſame grew as the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Changes grew.</p>

Moreover, although the Bills give us in <hi>Anno</hi> 1659 but 5670 <hi>Chriſtnings,</hi> yet they give us 421 <hi>Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and 226 dying in <hi>Child-bed,</hi> whereas in the year 1631, when the <hi>Abortives</hi> were 410, that is, near the number of the year 1659, the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> were 8288. Wherefore by the proportion of <hi>Abortives Anno</hi> 1659, the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> ſhould have been about 8500, but if we ſhall reckon by the women dying in <hi>Child-bed,</hi> of whom a better Accompt is kept then of <hi>Stil-borns,</hi> and <hi>Abortives,</hi> we ſhall finde <hi>Anno</hi> 1659, there were 226 <hi>Child-beds;</hi> and <hi>Anno</hi> 1631, 112, <hi>viz.</hi> not ½. Wherefore I conceive that the true number of the <hi>Chriſtnings Anno</hi> 1659 is above double to the 5690 ſet down in our Bills; that is about 11500, and then the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> will come near the ſame proportion to the <hi>Burials,</hi> as hath been obſerved in former times.</p>
               <p n="42">42. In regular Times, when Accompts were well kept, we finde that not above three in 200 died in <hi>Child-bed,</hi> and that the number of <hi>Abortives</hi> was about treble to that of the women dying in <hi>Child-bed,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55171:24"/>
from whence we may probably collect, that not one woman of an hundred (I might ſay of two hundred) dies in her Labour; for as much as there be other Cauſes of a woman's dying within the Moneth, then the hardneſs of her Labour.</p>
               <p n="43">43. If this be true in theſe Countries, where wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hinder the facility of their <hi>Child-bearing</hi> by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſtraightning of their Bodies; then certainly in <hi>America,</hi> where the ſame is not practiſed, Nature is little more to be taxed as to women, then in <hi>Brutes,</hi> among whom not one in ſome thouſands do die of their Deliveries: what I have heard of the <hi>Iriſh-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> confirms me herein.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Before we quite leave this matter, we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Cauſes, why the Accompt of <hi>Chriſtninos</hi> hath been neglected more then that of <hi>Burials:</hi> one, and the chief whereof was a Religious Opinion againſt <hi>Baptizing of Infants,</hi> either as unlawfull, or unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. If this were the onely reaſon, we might by our defects of this kinde, conclude the growth of this Opinion, and pronounce, that not half the People of <hi>England,</hi> between the years 1650, and 1660, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the need of <hi>Baptizing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="45">45. A ſecond Reaſon was, The ſcruples, which many Publick <hi>Miniſters</hi> would make of the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Parents to have their Children Baptized, which forced ſuch queſtioned Parents, who did alſo not believe the neceſſity of having their Children Baptized by ſuch ſcrupulers, to carry their Children unto ſuch other <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as having performed the thing, had not the Authority or command of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter</hi> to enter the names of the Baptized.</p>
               <p n="46">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55171:25"/>
46. A third Reaſon was, That a little Fee was to be paid for the <hi>Regiſtrie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="47">47. Upon the whole matter it is moſt certain, that the number of <hi>Heterodox</hi> Believers was very great between the ſaid year, 1650, and 1660, and ſo peeviſh were they, as not to have the Births of their Children <hi>Regiſtred,</hi> although thereby the time of their coming of Age might be known, in reſpect of ſuch Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, as might belong unto them; and withall by ſuch <hi>Regiſtring</hi> it would have appeared unto what <hi>Pariſh</hi> each Childe had belonged, in caſe any of them ſhould happen to want its relief.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Of <hi>Convulſions</hi> there appeared very few, <hi>viz.</hi> but 52 in the year 1629, which 1636 grew to 709, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about that ſtay, till 1659, though ſometimes riſing to about 1000.</p>
               <p n="49">49. It is to be noted, that from 1629 to 1636, when the <hi>Convulſions</hi> were but few, the number of <hi>Chryſoms,</hi> and <hi>Infants</hi> was greater: for in 1629, there was of <hi>Chryſoms,</hi> and <hi>Infants</hi> 2596, and of the <hi>Convulſion</hi> 52, <hi>viz.</hi> of both, 2648. And in 1636 there was of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> 1895, and of the <hi>Convulſions</hi> 709, in both 2604, by which it appears, that this difference is likely to be onely a confuſion in the Accompts.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Moreover, we finde that for theſe later years, ſince 1636, the Total of <hi>Convulſions</hi> and <hi>Chryſoms</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together are much leſs, <hi>viz.</hi> by about 400 or 500, <hi>per Annum,</hi> then the like Totals from 1626 to 36, which makes me think, that <hi>Teeth</hi> alſo were thruſt in under the Title of <hi>Chryſoms,</hi> and <hi>Infants,</hi> in as much as in the ſaid years, from 1629 to 1639, the number of <hi>Worms,</hi> and <hi>Teeth,</hi> wants by about 400 <hi>per Annum</hi> of what we find in following years.</p>

Now it is manifeſt of it ſelf, in which of theſe years moſt died; but in which of them was the greateſt <hi>Mortality</hi> of all Diſeaſes in general, or of the <hi>Plague</hi> in particular, we diſcover thus. In the year 1592, and 1636, we finde the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe dying of the <hi>Plague</hi> in the whole to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55171:26"/>
near alike, that is about 10 to 23. or 11 to 25. or as about two to five.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the year 1625. we finde the <hi>Plague</hi> to bear unto the whole in proportion as 35 to 51. or 7 to 10. that is almoſt the triplicate of the former proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the <hi>Cube</hi> of 7. being 343. and the <hi>Cube</hi> of 10. being 1000. the ſaid 343. is not 2/5. of 1000.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. the proportion of the <hi>Plague</hi> to the whole was as 30 to 37. <hi>viz.</hi> as 4. to 5. which is yet greater then that laſt of 7 to 20.

In ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there died above 4000, in others above 2000, and in but one leſs then 600: whereas in the Year 1624. next preceding, and in the year 1626. next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid great <hi>Plague-year</hi> 1625. There died in the former but 11, and in the latter but 134. of the <hi>Plague.</hi> Moreover in the ſaid year 1625. the <hi>Plague</hi> decreaſed from its utmoſt number 4461 a week, to below 1000 within ſix weeks.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The <hi>Plague</hi> of 1636. laſted twelve Years, in eight whereof there died 2000. <hi>per annum</hi> one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and never under 300. The which ſhews, that the Contagion of the <hi>Plague</hi> depends more upon the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Air,</hi> then upon the <hi>Effluvia</hi> from the Bodies of Men.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Which alſo we prove by the ſudden jumps, which the <hi>Plague</hi> hath made, leaping in one Week from 118 to 927: and back again from 993 to 258: and from thence again the very next Week to 852. The which effects muſt ſurely be rather attributed to change of the <hi>Air,</hi> then of the Conſtitution of Mens bodies, otherwiſe then as this depends upon that.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It may be alſo noted, that many times other <hi>Peſtilential</hi> Diſeaſes, as <hi>Purple-Feavers, Small-Pox,</hi> &amp;c. do forerun the <hi>Plague</hi> a Year, two, or three, for in 1622; there died but 8000. in 1623; 11000: in 24. about 12000: till in 1625 there died of all Diſeaſes above 54000.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Decreaſe,</hi> and <hi>Increaſe</hi> of People is to be reckoned chiefly by <hi>Chriſtnings,</hi> becauſe few bear children in <hi>London</hi> but <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> though others die there. The Accompts of <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> were well kept, untill differences in <hi>Religion</hi> occaſioned ſome neglect therein, although even theſe neglects we muſt confeſs to have been regular, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the numbers and proportions of <hi>Chriſtnings,</hi> therefore we obſerve as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That (when from <hi>December,</hi> 1602, to <hi>March</hi> following, there was little, or no <hi>Plague)</hi> then the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> at a <hi>Medium,</hi> were between 110, and 130 <hi>per Week,</hi> few Weeks being above the one, or below the other; but when from thence to <hi>July</hi> the <hi>Plague</hi> increaſed, that then the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> decreaſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 90.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Queſtion is, Whether <hi>Teeming-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> died, or fled, or miſcarried? The later at this time, ſeems moſt probable, becauſe even in the ſaid ſpace, between <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> there died not above twenty <hi>per Week</hi> of the <hi>Plague,</hi> which ſmall number could neither cauſe the death, or flight of ſo many Women, as to alter the proportion ¼ part lower.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover, we obſerve from the 21 of <hi>July</hi> to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55171:28"/>
the 21 of <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>Plague</hi> increaſing, reduced the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> to 70 at a <hi>Medium,</hi> diminiſhing the above proportion, down to ⅖. Now the cauſe of this muſt be flying, and death, as well as miſcarriages, and Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for there died within that time about 25000, whereof many were certainly <hi>Women with childe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the fright of ſo many dying within ſo ſmall a time might drive away ſo many others, as to cauſe this effect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From <hi>December</hi> 1624, to the middle of <hi>April</hi> 1625, there died not above 5 a Week of the <hi>Plague</hi> one with another. In this time, the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> were one with another 180. The which decreaſed gradually by the 22 of <hi>September</hi> to 75, or from the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 12 to 5, which evidently ſquares with our former Obſervation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The next Obſervation we ſhall offer, is, The time wherein the City hath been <hi>Re-peopled</hi> after a great <hi>Plague;</hi> which we affirm to be by the ſecond year. For in 1627, the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> (which are our Standard in this Caſe) were 8408, which in 1624 next preceding the <hi>Plague</hi> year 1625 (that had ſwept away above 54000) were but 8299, and the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> of 1626 (which were but 6701) mounted in one year to the ſaid 8408.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now the Cauſe hereof, for as much as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſupply by Procreations; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it muſt be by new Affluxes to <hi>London</hi> out of the Countrey.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We might fortifie this Aſſertion by ſhewing, that before the <hi>Plague-year,</hi> 1603, the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> were about 6000, which were in that very year reduced to 4789, but crept up the next year 1604, to 5458, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55171:28"/>
their former ordinary proportion in 1605 of 6504, about which proportion it ſtood till the year 1610.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I ſay, it followeth, that, let the <hi>Mortality</hi> be what it will, the City repairs its loſs of Inhabitants within two years, which Obſervation leſſens the Objection made againſt the value of houſes in <hi>London,</hi> as if they were liable to great prejudice through the loſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants by the <hi>Plague.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. HAving ſpoken of <hi>Caſualties,</hi> we come next to compare the ſicklineſs, healthfulneſs, and fruitfulneſs of the ſeveral Years, and Seaſons, one with another. And firſt, having in the Chapters afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going mentioned the ſeveral years of <hi>Plague,</hi> we ſhall next preſent the ſeveral other ſickly years; we meaning by <hi>a ſickly Year,</hi> ſuch wherein the <hi>Burials</hi> exceed thoſe, both of the precedent, and ſubſequent years, and not above 200 dying of the <hi>Plague,</hi> for ſuch we call <hi>Plague-Years;</hi> and this we do, that the World may ſee, by what ſpaces, and intervals we may hereafter expect ſuch times again. Now, we may not call that a more ſickly year, wherein more die, becauſe ſuch exceſs of <hi>Burials</hi> may proceed from increaſe, and acceſs of People to the City onely.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:55171:29"/>
2. Such ſickly years were 1618, 20, 23, 24, 1632, 33, 34, 1649, 52, 54, 56, 58, 61, as may be ſeen by the Tables.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In reference to this Obſervation, we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent another, namely, That the more ſickly the years are, the leſs fecund, or fruitfull of Children alſo they be, which will appear, if the number of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren born in the ſaid ſickly years be leſs, then that of the years both next preceding, and next following; all which, upon view of the Tables, will be found true, except in a very few Caſes, where ſometimes the precedent, and ſometimes the ſubſequent years vary a little, but never both together. Moreover, for the confirmation of this Truth, we preſent you the year 1660, where the <hi>Burials</hi> were fewer then in either of the two next precedent years by 2000, and fewer then in the ſubſequent by above 4000. And withall, the number of <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> in the ſaid year 1660 was far greater then in any of the three years next afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to this year 1660, although we would not be thought <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> yet is it not to be neglected, that in the ſaid year was the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Reſtauration</hi> to his Empire over theſe three Nations, as if God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had cauſed the healthfulneſs and fruitfulneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to repair the <hi>Bloodſhed,</hi> and <hi>Clamities</hi> ſuffered in his abſence. I ſay, this conceit doth abundantly counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe the Opinion of thoſe who think great <hi>Plagues</hi> come in with <hi>Kings</hi> reigns, becauſe it hapned ſo twice, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1603, and 1625, whereas as well the year 1648, wherein the preſent <hi>King</hi> commenced his right to reign, as alſo the year 1660, wherein he commenced
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55171:29"/>
the exerciſe of the ſame, were both eminently health<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full, which clears both <hi>Monarchie,</hi> and our preſent <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Familie</hi> from what ſeditious men have ſurmiſed againſt them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Diſeaſes, which beſide the <hi>Plague</hi> make years unhealthfull in this City, are <hi>Spotted Feavers, Small Pox, Dyſentery,</hi> called by ſome <hi>The Plague in the Guts,</hi> and the unhealthfull Seaſon is the <hi>Autumn.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THe next Obſervation is, That in the ſaid Bills there are far more <hi>Burials,</hi> then <hi>Chriſtnings.</hi> This is plain, depending onely upon <hi>Arithmetical</hi> computation; for, in 40 years, from the year 1603, to the year 1644, <hi>excluſivè</hi> of both years, there have been ſet down (as happening within the ſame ground, ſpace, or Pariſhes) although differently numbered, and divided, 363935 <hi>Burials,</hi> and but 330747 <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> within the 97, 16, and 10 out-Pariſhes, thoſe of <hi>Weſtminſter, Lambeth, Newington, Redriff, Stepney, Hackney,</hi> and <hi>Iſlington,</hi> not being included.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From this ſingle Obſervation it will follow, That <hi>London</hi> hath decreaſed in its People, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof we ſee by its daily increaſe of Buildings upon new Foundations, and by the turning of great Palacious Houſes into ſmall Tenements. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certain, that <hi>London</hi> is ſupplied with People from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55171:30"/>
out of the Countrey, whereby not onely to repair the overplus difference of <hi>Burials</hi> above-mentioned, but likewiſe to increaſe its <hi>Inhabitants</hi> according to the ſaid increaſe of houſing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſupplying of <hi>London</hi> ſeems to be the reaſon, why <hi>Wincheſter, Lincoln,</hi> and ſeveral other Cities have decreaſed in their Buildings, and conſequently in their <hi>Inhabitants.</hi> The ſame may be ſuſpected of many Towns in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and other places, which probably, when they were firſt allowed to ſend <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> were more populous then now, and bore another proportion to <hi>London</hi> then now; for ſeveral of thoſe <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſend two <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> whereas <hi>London</hi> it ſelf ſends but four, although it bears the fifteenth part of the charge of the whole Nation in all <hi>Publick</hi> Taxes, and Levies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But, if we conſider what I have upon exact en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry found true, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the Countrie, within ninetie years, there have been 6339 <hi>Chriſtnings,</hi> and but 5280 <hi>Burials,</hi> the increaſe of <hi>London</hi> will be ſalved without inferring the decreaſe of the People in the Countrie; and withall, in caſe all <hi>England</hi> have but fourteen times more People then <hi>London,</hi> it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, how the ſaid increaſe of the Country may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the People, both of <hi>London,</hi> and it ſelf; for if there be in the 97, 16, 10, and 7 Pariſhes, uſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within our Bills, but 460000 ſouls as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after we ſhall ſhew, then there are in all <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> 6440000 Perſons, out of which ſubſtract 460000, for thoſe in, and about <hi>London,</hi> there remains 5980000 in the Countrie, the which increaſing about 1/7 part in 40 years, as we ſhall hereafter prove, doth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55171:30"/>
happen in the Countrie, the whole increaſe of the Countrie will be about 854000 in the ſaid time, out of which number, if but about 250000 be ſent up to <hi>London</hi> in the ſaid 40 years, <hi>viz.</hi> about 6000 <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Miſsions</hi> will make good the alterations, which we finde to have been in, and about <hi>London,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the years 1603 and 1644 above-mentioned. But that 250000 will do the ſame, I prove thus, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 8 years, from 1603 to 1612, the <hi>Burials</hi> in all the Pariſhes, and of all Diſeaſes, the <hi>Plague</hi> included, were at a <hi>Medium</hi> 9750 <hi>per Annum.</hi> And between 1635 and 1644 were 18000, the difference whereof is 8250, which is the Total of the increaſe of the <hi>Burials</hi> in 40 years, that is about 206 <hi>per Annum.</hi> Now, to make the <hi>Burials</hi> increaſe 206 <hi>per Annum,</hi> there muſt be added to the City thirty times as many (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of 3 dying out of 41 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies) <hi>viz.</hi> 6180 <hi>Advenae,</hi> the which number multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again by the 40 years, makes the <hi>Product</hi> 247200, which is leſs then the 250000 above propounded; ſo as there remains above 600000 of increaſe in the Countrie within the ſaid 40 years, either to render it more populous, or ſend forth into other Colonies, or Wars. But that <hi>England</hi> hath fourteen times more People, is not improbable, for the Reaſons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>London</hi> is obſerved to bear about the fifteenth proportion of the whole Tax.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> about 39000 ſquare Miles of Land, and we have computed that in one of the greateſt Pariſhes in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> being alſo a Market-Town, and containing twelve ſquare Miles, there are 220 ſouls in every ſquare Mile, out
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55171:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of which I abate ¼ for the overplus of People more in that Pariſh, then in other wilde Counties. So as the ¾ parts of the ſaid 220, multiplied by the Total of ſquare Miles, produces 6400000 ſouls in all <hi>London</hi> included.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are about 100000 Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> the which, although they ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ⅓ part of the Land, nor the ¼ of the People of that Country-Pariſh, which we have examined, yet may be ſuppoſed to contain about 600 People, one with another, according to which Accompt there will be ſix Millions of People in the Nation. I might add, that there are in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> about five and twenty Millions of Acres at 16 ½ Foot to the Perch; and if there be ſix Millions of People, then there is about four Acres for every head, which how well it agrees to the Rules of Plantation, I leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, not onely as a means to examine my Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but as an hint to their enquiry concerning the fundamental Trade, which is Husbandrie, and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Upon the whole matter we may therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the People of the whole Nation do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and conſequently the decreaſe of <hi>Wincheſter, Lincoln,</hi> and other like places, muſt be attributed to other Reaſons, then that of refurniſhing <hi>London</hi> onely.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We come to ſhew, why although in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> exceed the <hi>Burials,</hi> yet in <hi>London</hi> they do not. The general Reaſon of this muſt be, that in <hi>London</hi> the proportion of thoſe ſubject to die unto thoſe capable of breeding is greater then
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55171:31"/>
in the Countrey; That is, let there be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Perſons in <hi>London,</hi> and as many in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; we ſay, that if there be 60 of them Breeders in <hi>London,</hi> there are more then 60 in the Country, or elſe we muſt ſay, that <hi>London</hi> is more unhealthfull, or that it enclines men and women more to Barrenneſs, then the Country, which by comparing the Burials, and Chriſtnings of <hi>Hackney, Newington,</hi> and the other Country-Pariſhes, with the moſt <hi>Smoaky,</hi> and <hi>Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> parts of the City, is ſcarce diſcernable in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now that the Breeders in <hi>London</hi> are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fewer then thoſe in the Country ariſes from theſe reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. All that have buſineſs to the Court of the King, or to the Courts of Juſtice, and all Country-men coming up to bring Proviſions to the City, or to buy Foreign Commodities, Manufactures, and Rarities, do for the moſt part leave their Wives in the Country.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Perſons coming to live in <hi>London</hi> out of curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pleaſure, as alſo ſuch as would retire, and live privately, do the ſame, if they have any.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such, as come up to be cured of Diſeaſes, do ſcarce uſe their Wives <hi>pro tempore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That many Apprentices of <hi>London,</hi> who are bound ſeven, or nine years from Marriage, do often ſtay longer voluntarily.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That many Sea-men of <hi>London</hi> leave their Wives behind them, who are more ſubject to die in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their Husbands, then to breed either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out men, or with the uſe of many promiſcuouſly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As for unhealthineſs it may well be ſuppoſed,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55171:32"/>
that although ſeaſoned Bodies may, and do live near as long in <hi>London,</hi> as elſewhere, yet new-comers, and Children do not, for the <hi>Smoaks, Stinks,</hi> and cloſe <hi>Air</hi> are leſs healthfull then that of the Country; otherwiſe why do ſickly Perſons remove into the Country <hi>Air?</hi> And why are there more old men in Countries then in <hi>London, per rata?</hi> And although the difference in <hi>Hackney,</hi> and <hi>Newington,</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, be not very notorious, yet the reaſon may be their vicinity to <hi>London,</hi> and that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are moſt ſuch, whoſe bodies have firſt been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired with the <hi>London Air,</hi> before they withdraw thither.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As to the cauſes of Barrenneſs in <hi>London,</hi> I ſay, that although there ſhould be none extraordinary in the Native <hi>Air</hi> of the place, yet the intemperance in feeding, and eſpecially the Adulteries and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, ſuppoſed more frequent in <hi>London</hi> then elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, do certainly hinder breeding. For a Woman, admitting 10 Men, is ſo far from having ten times as many Children, that ſhe hath none at all.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Add to this, that the minds of men in <hi>London</hi> are more thoughtfull and full of buſineſs then in the Country, where their work is <hi>corporal</hi> Labour, and Exercizes. All which promote Breedings, whereas <hi>Anxieties</hi> of the minde hinder it.</p>

allow it; for one man his having many women, or wives by Law, ſignifies nothing, unleſs there were many women to one man in Nature alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The obvious Objection hereunto is, That one <hi>Horſe, Bull,</hi> or <hi>Ram,</hi> having each of them many <hi>Females,</hi> do promote increaſe. To which I Anſwer, That although perhaps there be naturally, even of theſe <hi>ſpecies,</hi> more <hi>Males</hi> then <hi>Females,</hi> yet <hi>artificially,</hi> that is, by making <hi>Geldings, Oxen,</hi> and <hi>Weathers,</hi> there are fewer. From whence it will follow, That when by experience it is found how many <hi>Ews</hi> (ſuppoſe twenty) one <hi>Ram</hi> will ſerve, we may know what proportion of <hi>male-Lambs</hi> to caſtrate, or geld, <hi>viz.</hi> nineteen, or thereabouts: for if you emaſculate fewer, <hi>viz.</hi> but ten, you ſhall by promiſcuous copulation of each of thoſe ten with two <hi>Females,</hi> (in ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Male</hi> after conception) hinder the increaſe ſo far, as the admittance of two <hi>Males</hi> will do it: but, if you caſtrate none at all, it is highly probable, that every of the twenty <hi>Males</hi> copulating with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the twenty <hi>Females,</hi> there will be little, or no conception in any of them all.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And this I take to be the trueſt Reaſon, why <hi>Foxes, Wolves,</hi> and other <hi>Vermin Animals</hi> that are not gelt, increaſe not faſter then <hi>Sheep,</hi> when as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of theſe are daily Butchered, and very few of the other die otherwiſe then of themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We have hitherto ſaid there are more <hi>Males,</hi> then <hi>Females;</hi> we ſay next, That the one exceed the other by about a thirteenth part; ſo that although more men die violent deaths then women, that is, more are <hi>ſlain</hi> in Wars, <hi>killed</hi> by miſchance, <hi>drowned</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:55171:33"/>
at <hi>Sea,</hi> and die by the <hi>Hand of Juſtice.</hi> Moreover, more men go to <hi>Colonies,</hi> and travel into foreign parts, then women. And laſtly, more remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, then of women, as <hi>Fellows</hi> of <hi>Colleges,</hi> and <hi>Apprentiſes,</hi> above eighteen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the ſaid thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth part difference bringeth the buſineſs but to ſuch a paſs, that every woman may have an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, without the allowance of <hi>Polygamy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover, although a man be <hi>Prolifique</hi> fourty years, and a woman but five and twenty, which makes the <hi>Males</hi> to be as 560 to 325 <hi>Females,</hi> yet the cauſes above named, and the later marriage of the men, reduce all to an equality.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It appearing, that there were fourteen men to thirteen women, and that they die in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion alſo, yet I have heard <hi>Phyſicians</hi> ſay, that they have two women Patients to one man, which Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems very likely; for that women have either the <hi>Green-ſickneſs,</hi> or other like Diſtempers, are ſick of <hi>Breedings, Abortions, Child-bearing, Sore-breaſts, Whites, Obſtructions, Fits of the Mother,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now, from this it ſhould follow, that more women ſhould die then men, if the number of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> anſwered in proportion to that of Sickneſſes: but this muſt be ſalved, either by the alledging, that the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> cure thoſe Sickneſſes, ſo as few more die, then if none were ſick; or elſe that men, being more intemperate then women, die as much by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Vices, as the women do by the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of their <hi>Sex,</hi> and conſequently, more <hi>Males</hi> being born, then <hi>Females,</hi> more alſo die.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the year 1642 many <hi>Males</hi> went out of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55171:34"/>
                  <hi>London</hi> into the Wars then beginning, in ſo much, as I expected in the ſucceeding year, 1643, to have found the <hi>Burials</hi> of <hi>Females</hi> to have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe of <hi>Males,</hi> but no alteration appeared; for as much, as I ſuppoſe, Trading continuing the ſame in <hi>London,</hi> all thoſe who loſt their <hi>Apprentices</hi> had others out of the Countrey; and if any left their Trades, or Shops, that others forthwith ſucceeded them: for if employment for hands remain the ſame, no doubt but the number of them could not long continue in diſproportion.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Another pregnant Argument to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (which hath already been touched on) is, That although in the very year of the <hi>Plague,</hi> the <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> decreaſed, by the dying and flying of <hi>Teeming-women,</hi> yet the very next year after, they increaſed ſomewhat, but the ſecond after, to as full a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as in the ſecond year before the ſaid <hi>Plague:</hi> for I ſay again, if there be encouragement for an hundred in <hi>London,</hi> that is, a Way how an hundred may live better then in the Countrey, and if there be void houſing there to receive them, the evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of a ¼th, or ⅓ part of that number, muſt ſoon be ſupplied out of the Countrey; ſo as, the great <hi>Plague</hi> doth not leſſen the Inhabitants of the City, but of the Countrey, who in a ſhort time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move themſelves from hence thither, ſo long, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the City for want of receit and encouragement, regurgitates and ſends them back.</p>
               <p n="10">10. From the difference between <hi>Males</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males,</hi> we ſee the reaſon of making <hi>Eunuchs</hi> in thoſe places where <hi>Polygamy</hi> is allowed, the latter being
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55171:34"/>
uſeleſs as to multiplication, without the former, as was ſaid before in the caſe of <hi>Sheep</hi> and other <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> uſually gelt in theſe Countries.</p>
               <p n="11">11. By conſequence, this practiſe of <hi>Caſtracon</hi> ſerves as well to promote increaſe as to meliorate the Fleſh of thoſe Beaſts that ſuffer it. For that Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is equally practiſed upon <hi>Horſes</hi> which are not uſed for Food, as upon thoſe that are.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countries where <hi>Polygamy</hi> is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, if a greater number of <hi>Males</hi> oblige themſelves to <hi>Caelibate</hi> then the natural overplus or difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and <hi>Females</hi> amounts unto; then multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is hindred; for if there be eight Men to ten Women, all of which eight men are married to eight of the ten Women, then the other two bear no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as either admitting no Man at all, or elſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Men as Whores (that is more then one) which commonly procreates no more then if none at all had been uſed: or elſe ſuch unlawfull Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beget Conceptions but to fruſtrate them by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Abortions or ſecret Murthers, all which returns to the ſame reckoning. Now, if the ſame proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of women oblige themſelves to a ſingle life like-wiſe, then ſuch obligation makes no change in this matter of encreaſe.</p>
               <p n="13">13. From what hath been ſaid, appears the reaſon why the Law is, and ought to be ſo ſtrict againſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications and Adulteries, for if there were univerſal liberty, the Increaſe of Man-kind would be but like that of <hi>Foxes</hi> at beſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now foraſmuch as Princes are not only Powerfull but Rich, according to the number of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55171:35"/>
their People (Hands being the Father, as Lands are the Mother, and Womb of Wealth) it is no wonder why ſtates by encouraging Marriage, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Licentiouſneſs, advance their own Intereſt, as well as preſerve the Laws of God from contempt, and Violation.</p>
               <p n="15">15. It is a Bleſſing to Man-kind, that by this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of <hi>Males</hi> there is this natural Bar to <hi>Polygamy:</hi> for in ſuch a ſtate Women could not live in that parity, and equality of expence with their Husbands, as now, and here they do.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The reaſon whereof is, not, that the Husband cannot maintain as ſplendidly three, as one; for he might, having three Wives, live himſelf upon a quarter of his Income, that is in a parity with all three, as-well as, having but one, live in the ſame parity at half with her alone: but rather, becauſe that to keep them all quiet with each other, and himſelf, he muſt keep them all in greater aw, and leſs ſplendor, which power he having will probably uſe it to keep them all as low, as he pleaſes, and at no more coſt then makes for his own pleaſure; the pooreſt Subjects (ſuch as this plurality of Wives muſt be) being moſt eaſily governed.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IN the year 1593 there died in the ninety ſeven Pariſhes within the walls, and the ſixteen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the walls (beſides 421 of the <hi>Plague)</hi> 3508. And the next year 3478, beſides 29 of the <hi>Plague:</hi> in both years 6986. Twenty years after, there died in the ſame ninety ſeven, and ſixteen Pariſhes, 12110, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1614, 5873; and <hi>Anno</hi> 1615, 6237: ſo as the ſaid Pariſhes are increaſed, in the ſaid time, from ſeven to twelve, or very near thereabouts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, the <hi>Burials</hi> within the like ſpace of he next twenty years, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1634, and 1635, vere 15625, <hi>viz.</hi> as about twenty four to thirty one: he which laſt of the three numbers, 15625, is much more then double to the firſt 6986, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes have in fourty years increaſed from twenty three to fifty two.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where is to be noted, That although we were neceſſitated to compound the ſaid ninety ſeven with the ſixteen Pariſhes, yet the ſixteen Pariſhes have increaſed faſter then the ninety ſeven. For, in the year 1620, there died within the walls 2726, and in 1660 there died but 3098 (both years being clear of the <hi>Plague)</hi> ſo as in this fourty years the ſaid ninety ſeven Pariſhes have increaſed but from nine to ten, or thereabouts, becauſe the houſing of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55171:36"/>
ſaid ninety ſeven Pariſhes could be no otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, then by turning great Houſes into Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and building upon a few Gardens.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the year 1604, there died in the ninety ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Pariſhes 1518, and of the <hi>Plague</hi> 280. And in the year 1660, 3098, and none of the <hi>Plague,</hi> ſo as in fifty ſix years the ſaid Pariſhes have doubled: Where note, that forasmuch as the ſaid year 1604 was the very next year after the great <hi>Plague,</hi> 1603 (when the City was not yet re-peopled) we ſhall rather make the compariſon between 2014, which died <hi>Anno</hi> 1605, and 3431 <hi>Anno</hi> 1659, chooſing rather from hence to aſſert, that the ſaid ninety ſeven, and ſixteen Pariſhes encreaſed from twenty to thirty four, or from ten to ſeventeen in fifty four years, then from one to two in fifty ſix, as in the laſt afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Paragraph</hi> is ſet down.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Anno</hi> 1605, there died in the ſixteen out-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes 2974, and <hi>Anno</hi> 1659, 6988, ſo as in the fifty four years, the ſaid Pariſhes have encreaſed from three to ſeven.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Anno</hi> 1605 there died in the eight out-pariſhes, 960, <hi>Anno</hi> 1659, there died in the ſame ſcope of Ground, although called now ten Pariſhes (the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> being added) 4301, ſo as the ſaid Pariſhes have encreaſed within the ſaid fifty four years, more then from one to four.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Moreover, there was Buried in all, <hi>Anno</hi> 1605, 5948, and <hi>Anno</hi> 1659 14720, <hi>viz.</hi> about two to five.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Having ſet down the proportions, wherein we find the ſaid three great Diviſions of the whole Pyle, call'd <hi>London,</hi> to have encreaſed; we come next to ſhew
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55171:36"/>
what particular Pariſhes have had the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhare in theſe Augmentations, <hi>viz.</hi> of the ninty ſeven Pariſhes within the Walls the Increaſe is not very diſcernable, but where great houſes formerly belonging to Noblemen before they built others neer <hi>White-hall,</hi> have been turned into Tenements, upon which Accompt <hi>Alhallows on the wall</hi> is encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the converſion of the Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> houſe, lately the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors, into a New ſtreet, the like of Alderman <hi>Freeman,</hi> and <hi>La Motte</hi> neer the <hi>Exchange,</hi> the like of the Earl of <hi>Arundells</hi> in <hi>Loathbury,</hi> the like of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Palace, the Dean of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and the Lord <hi>River</hi>'s houſe, now in hand, as alſo of the <hi>Dukes-Place,</hi> and others here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Of the ſixteen Pariſhes next without the Walls, Saint <hi>Gile</hi>'s <hi>Criplegate</hi> hath been moſt inlarged, next to that, Saint <hi>Olave</hi>'s <hi>Southwark,</hi> then Saint <hi>Andrews Holborn,</hi> then <hi>White-Chappel,</hi> the difference in the reſt not being conſiderable.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Of the out Pariſhes now called ten, formerly nine, and before that eight, Saint <hi>Gile</hi>'s, and Saint <hi>Martins in the fields,</hi> are moſt encreaſed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanding Saint <hi>Pauls Covent-Garden</hi> was taken out of them both.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The general obſervation which ariſes from hence is, That the City of <hi>London</hi> gradually removes <hi>Weſtward,</hi> and did not the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Bridg</hi> ſtay the Trade, it would remove much faſter, for <hi>Leaden-Hall-ſtreet, Biſhops-gate,</hi> and part of <hi>Fan-church-ſtreet,</hi> have loſt their ancient Trade, <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet</hi> indeed keeping it ſelf yet entire, by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55171:37"/>
reaſon of its conjunction with, and relation to <hi>London-Bridg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Again, <hi>Canning-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>Watlin-ſtreet</hi> have loſt their Trade of <hi>Woollen-Drapery</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-Yard, Ludgate-hill,</hi> and <hi>Fleet-ſtreet;</hi> the <hi>Mercery</hi> is gone from out of <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> into <hi>Pater-Noſter-Row,</hi> and <hi>Fleet-ſtreet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. The reaſons whereof are, that the King's Court (in old times frequently kept in the City) is now always at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Secondly, the uſe of Coaches, whereunto the narrow ſtreets of the old City are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, hath cauſed the building of thoſe broader ſtreets in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Thirdly, where the <hi>Conſumption</hi> of Commodity is, <hi>viz.</hi> among the Gentry, the vendors of the ſame muſt ſeat themſelves.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Fourthly, the cramming up of the voyd ſpaces, and gardens within the Walls, with houſes, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> have made men Build new ones, where they leſs fear thoſe inconveniencies.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Conformity in Building to other civil Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hath diſpoſed us to let our old Wooden dark houſes fall to decay, and to build new ones, whereby to anſwer all the ends above-mentioned.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Where note, that when <hi>Lud-gate</hi> was the onely <hi>Weſtern</hi> Gate of the City, little Building was <hi>Weſtward</hi> thereof. But when <hi>Holborn</hi> began to encreaſe <hi>New-gate</hi> was made. But now both theſe Gates are not ſufficient for the Communication between the Walled City, and its enlarged <hi>Weſtern</hi> Suburbs, as dayly appears by the intolerable ſtops and embareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Coaches near both theſe Gates, eſpecially <hi>Lud-gate.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the Inequality of Pariſhes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. BEfore we paſs from hence, we ſhall offer to conſideration the inequality of Pariſhes in, and about <hi>London,</hi> evident in the proportion of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective <hi>Burials;</hi> for in the ſame year were Buried in <hi>Cripple-gate-Pariſh</hi> 1191, that but twelve died in <hi>Trinity-Minories,</hi> St. <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Southwark,</hi> and <hi>Botolph</hi>'s <hi>Biſhop-gate,</hi> being of the middle ſize, as burying five and 600 <hi>per Annum;</hi> ſo that <hi>Cripple-gate</hi> is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times as big as the <hi>Minories,</hi> and 200 times as big as St. <hi>John the Euangeliſt's, Mary-Cole-church, Bennet</hi>'s <hi>Grace-church, Matthew-Friday-ſtreet,</hi> and ſome others within the City.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence may ariſe this Queſtion, Wherefore ſhould this inequality be continued? If it be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Becauſe that <hi>Paſtours</hi> of all ſorts, and ſizes of Abilities, may have Benefices, each man according to his merit: we Anſwer, That a two hundredth part of the beſt <hi>Parſon</hi>'s learning is ſcarce enough for a <hi>Sexton.</hi> But beſides, there ſeems no reaſon of any differences at all, it being as much Science to ſave one ſingle ſoul, as one thouſand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We encline therefore to think the Pariſhes ſhould be equal, or near, becauſe, in the <hi>Reformed Religions,</hi> the principal uſe of <hi>Churches</hi> is to Preach in: now the bigneſs of ſuch a <hi>Church</hi> ought to be no greater, then that, unto which the voice of a <hi>Preacher</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:55171:38"/>
of middling Lungs will eafily extend; I ſay, eaſily, becauſe they ſpeak an hour, or more together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The uſe of ſuch large <hi>Churches,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi>'s, is now wholly loſt, we having no need of ſaying perhaps fifty <hi>Maſſes</hi> all at one time, nor of making thoſe grand <hi>Proceſſions</hi> frequent in the <hi>Romiſh Church;</hi> nor is the ſhape of our <hi>Cathedral</hi> proper at all for our <hi>Preaching Auditories,</hi> but rather the Figure of an <hi>Amphi-Theatre</hi> with Galleries, gradually over-looking each other; for unto this Condition the Pariſh-Churches of <hi>London</hi> are driving apace, as appears by the many Galleries every day built in them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover, if Pariſhes were brought to the ſize of <hi>Colman-ſtreet, Alhallows-Barking, Chriſt-Church, Black-Friers,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in each whereof die between 100 and 150, <hi>per Annum,</hi> then an hundred Pariſhes would be a fit, and equal Diviſion of this great charge, and all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> (ſome whereof have now ſcarce fourty pounds <hi>per Annum)</hi> might obtain a ſubſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And laſtly, The <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> and <hi>Over-ſeers</hi> of the <hi>Poor</hi> might finde it poſſible to diſcharge their Duties, whereas now in the greater out-Pariſhes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the poorer Pariſhioners through neglect do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and many vicious perſons get liberty to live as they pleaſe, for want of ſome heedfull Eye to over-look them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Have been ſeveral times in company with men of great experience in this City, and have heard them talk ſeldom under Millions of <hi>People</hi> to be in <hi>London,</hi> all which I was apt enough to believe, untill, on a certain day, one of eminent Reputation was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion aſſerting, that there was in the year 1661 two Millions of People more then <hi>Anno</hi> 1625, before the great <hi>Plague;</hi> I muſt confeſs, that, untill this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, I had been frighted with that miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Example of <hi>David,</hi> from attempting any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the People of this populous place; but hereupon I both examined the lawfulneſs of making ſuch enquiries, and, being ſatisfied thereof, went about the work it ſelf in this manner: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Firſt, I imagined, That, if the Conjecture of the worthy Perſon afore-mentioned had any truth in it, there muſt needs be about ſix, or ſeven Millions of People in <hi>London</hi> now; but repairing to my Bills I found, that not above 15000 <hi>per Annum</hi> were buried, and conſequently, that not above one in four hundred muſt die <hi>per Annum,</hi> if the Total were but ſix Millions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Next conſidering, That it is eſteemed an even Lay, whether any man lives ten years longer, I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it was the ſame, that one of any 10 might die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one year. But when I conſidered, that of the 15000

afore-mentioned about 5000 were <hi>Abortive,</hi> and <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> or died of <hi>Teeth, Convulſion, Rickets,</hi> or as <hi>Infants,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoms,</hi> and <hi>Aged.</hi> I concluded, that of men, and women, between ten and ſixty, there ſcarce died 10000 <hi>per Annum</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> which number being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by 10, there muſt be but 100000 in all, that is not the 1/60 part of what the <hi>Alderman</hi> imagined. Theſe were but ſudden thoughts on both ſides, and both far from truth, I thereupon endeavoured to get a little nearer, thus: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I conſidered, that the number of <hi>Child-bearing women</hi> might be about double to the <hi>Births:</hi> forasmuch as ſuch women, one with another, have ſcarce more then one Childe in two years. The number of <hi>Births</hi> I found, by thoſe years, wherein the <hi>Regiſtries</hi> were well kept, to have been ſomewhat leſs then the <hi>Burials.</hi> The <hi>Burials</hi> in theſe late years at a <hi>Medium</hi> are about 13000, and conſequently the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> not above 12000. I therefore eſteemed the number of <hi>Teeming women</hi> to be 24000: then I imagined, that there might be twice as many Families, as of ſuch women; for that there might be twice as many women <hi>Aged</hi> between 16 and 76, as between 16 and 40, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 20 and 44; and that there were about eight Perſons in a Family, one with another, <hi>viz.</hi> the Man, and his Wife, three Children, and three Servants, or Lodgers: now 8 times 48000 makes 384000.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Secondly, I finde by telling the number of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in ſome Pariſhes within the walls, that 3 out of 11 families <hi>per an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> have died: wherefore, 13000 having died in the whole, it ſhould follow, there were 48000 Families according to the laſt mentioned Acccompt.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:55171:39"/>
6. Thirdly, the Accompt, which I made of the <hi>Trayned-Bands,</hi> and <hi>Auxiliary</hi> Souldiers, doth enough juſtify this Accompt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly I took the Map of <hi>London</hi> ſet out in the year 1658 by <hi>Richard Newcourt,</hi> drawn by a ſcale of Yards. Now I gueſſed that in 100 yards ſquare there might be about 54 Families, ſuppoſing every houſe to be 20 foot in the front: for on two ſides of the ſaid ſquare there will be 100 yards of houſing in each, and in the two other ſides 80 each; in all 360 yards: that is 54 Families in each ſquare, of which there are 220 within the Walls, making in all 11880 Families within the Walls. But forasmuch as there dy within the Walls about 3200 <hi>per Annum,</hi> and in the whole about 13000; it follows, that the houſing within the Walls is ¼<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part of the whole, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that there are 47520 Families in, and about <hi>London,</hi> which agrees well enough with all my former computations: the worſt whereof doth ſufficiently demonſtrate, that there are no Millions of People in <hi>London,</hi> which nevertheleſs moſt men do believe, as they do, that there be three Women for one Man, whereas there are fourteen Men for thirteen Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as elſe where hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We have (though perhaps too much at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) determined the number of the inhabitants of <hi>London</hi> to be about 384000: the which being granted, we aſſert, that 199112 are <hi>Males,</hi> and 184886 <hi>Females.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Whereas we have found, that of 100 quick Conceptions about 36 of them die before they be ſix years old, and that perhaps but one ſurviveth

76, we, having ſeven <hi>Decads</hi> between ſix and 76, we ſought ſix mean proportional numbers between 64, the remainder, living at ſix years, and the one, which ſurvives 76, and finde, that the numbers following are practically near enough to the truth; for men do not die in exact Proportions, nor in Fractions: from whence ariſes this Table following.</p>

and <hi>Healthfulneſs,</hi> nor for the contrary. Upon which Tables we obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That every <hi>Wedding,</hi> one with another, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces four Children, and conſequently, that that is the proportion of Children, which any Marriagable man, or woman may be preſumed ſhall have. For, though a man may be Married more then once, yet, being once Married, he may die without any Iſſue at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in this Pariſh there were born 15 <hi>Females</hi> for 16 <hi>Males,</hi> whereas in <hi>London</hi> there were 13 for 14, which ſhews, that <hi>London</hi> is ſomewhat more apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Males,</hi> then the country. And it is poſſible, that in ſome other places there are more <hi>Females</hi> born, then <hi>Males,</hi> which, upon this variation of proportion, I again recommend to the examination of the curious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in the ſaid whole 90 years the <hi>Burials</hi> of the <hi>Males</hi> and <hi>Females</hi> were exactly equal, and that in ſeveral <hi>Decads</hi> they differed not 1/100 part, that in one of the two <hi>Decads,</hi> wherein the difference was very notorious, there were Buried of <hi>Males</hi> 337, and of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi> but 284, <hi>viz.</hi> 53 difference, and in the other there died contrariwiſe 338 <hi>Males,</hi> and 386 <hi>Females,</hi> differing 46.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are alſo <hi>Decads,</hi> where the Birth of <hi>Males</hi> and <hi>Females</hi> differ very much, <hi>viz.</hi> about 60.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That in the ſaid 90 years there have been born more, then buried in the ſaid Pariſh, (the which both 90 years ago, and alſo now, conſiſted of about 2700 Souls) but 1059, <hi>viz.</hi> not 12 <hi>per Annum,</hi> one year with another.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That theſe 1059 have in all probability contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the increaſe of <hi>London;</hi> ſince, as was ſaid even
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55171:41"/>
now, it neither appears by the <hi>Burials, Chriſtnings,</hi> or by the built of new-houſing, that the ſaid Pariſh is more populous now, then 90 years ago, by above two or 300 ſouls. Now, if all other places ſend about ⅓ of their encreaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> about one out of 900 of their Inhabitants <hi>Annually</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and that there be 14 times as many people in <hi>England,</hi> as there be in <hi>London,</hi> (for which we have given ſome reaſons) then <hi>London</hi> encreaſes by ſuch <hi>Advenae</hi> every year above 6000: the which will make the Accompt of <hi>Burials</hi> to ſwell about 200 <hi>per Annum,</hi> and will anſwer the encreaſes. We obſerve it is clear, that the ſaid Pariſh is encreaſed about 300, and it is probable, that three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more went to <hi>London,</hi> and it is known, That about 400 went to <hi>New-England,</hi> the <hi>Caribe-Iſlands,</hi> and <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> within theſe laſt fourty years.</p>
               <p n="7">7. According to the <hi>Medium</hi> of the ſaid whole 90 years, there have been five <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> for four <hi>Burials,</hi> although in ſome ſingle <hi>Years,</hi> and <hi>Decads,</hi> there have been three to two, although ſometimes (though more rarely) the <hi>Burials</hi> have exceeded the <hi>Births,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Epidemical</hi> Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Our former Obſervation, That healthfull years are alſo the moſt fruitfull, is much confirmed by our Country Accompts; for, 70 being our Standard for <hi>Births,</hi> and 58 for <hi>Burials,</hi> you ſhall finde, that where fewer then 58 died, more then 70 were born. Having given you a few inſtances thereof, I ſhall remit you to the Tables for the general proof of this Aſſertion. <hi>Viz. Anno</hi> 1633. when 103 were born, there died but 29. Now, in none of the whole 90 years more were born then 103, and but in one, fewer then 29 died, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55171:42"/>
28 <hi>Anno</hi> 1658. Again <hi>Anno</hi> 1568, when 93 were born, but 42 died. <hi>Anno</hi> 1584, when 90 were born, but 41 died. <hi>Anno</hi> 1650, when 86 were born, but 52 died. So that by how much more are born, by ſo much (as it were) the fewer die. For when 103 were born, but 29 died: but when but 86 were born, then 52 died.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide <hi>Anno</hi> 1638, when 156 died <hi>per Annum,</hi> which was the greateſt year of <hi>Mortality,</hi> then leſs then the meer Standard 70, <hi>viz.</hi> but 66 were born. Again <hi>Anno</hi> 1644, when 137 died, but 59 were born. <hi>Anno</hi> 1597, when 117 died, but 48 were born. And <hi>Anno</hi> 1583, when 87 died, but 59 were born.</p>
               <p>A little Irregularity may be found herein, as that <hi>Anno</hi> 1612, when 116 died <hi>(viz.</hi> a number double to our Standard 58 yet) 87 <hi>(viz.</hi> 17 about the Standard 70) were born. And that when 89 died 075 were born: but theſe differences are not ſo great, nor ſo often, as to evert our Rule, which beſides the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe Accompts is probable in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Of all the ſaid 90 years the year 1638 was the moſt <hi>Mortal,</hi> I therefore enquired whether the <hi>Plague</hi> was then in that Pariſh, and having received good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that it was not (which I the rather believe, becauſe, that the <hi>Plague</hi> was not then conſiderable at <hi>London)</hi> but that it was a Malignant <hi>Fever</hi> raging ſo fiercely about <hi>Harveſt,</hi> that there appeared ſcarce hands enough to take in the Corn: which argues, conſidering there were 2700 Pariſhioners, that ſeven might be ſick for one that died: whereas of the <hi>Plague</hi> more die then recover. Laſtly, theſe People lay long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55171:42"/>
ſick then is uſual in the <hi>Plague,</hi> nor was there any mention of <hi>Sores, Swellings, blew-Tokens,</hi> &amp;c. among them. It follows, that the proportion between the <hi>greateſt</hi> and the <hi>leaſt Mortalities</hi> in the Country are far greater then at <hi>London.</hi> Forasmuch as the greateſt 156 is above <hi>quintuple</hi> unto 28 the leaſt, whereas in <hi>London</hi> (the <hi>Plague</hi> excepted, as here it hath been) the number of Burials upon other Accompts within no <hi>Decad</hi> of years hath been double, whereas in the Country it hath been <hi>quintuple</hi> not onely within the whole 90 years, but alſo within the ſame <hi>Decad:</hi> for <hi>Anno</hi> 1633. there died but 29, and <hi>Anno</hi> 1638 the above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned number of 156. Moreover, as in <hi>London,</hi> in no <hi>Decad,</hi> the Burials of one year are double to thoſe of another: ſo in the Country they are ſeldom not more then ſo. As by this Table appears,

               <p>Now, although the diſproportions of Births be not ſo great as that of <hi>Burials,</hi> yet theſe diſproportions are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55171:43"/>
far greater then at <hi>London:</hi> for let it be ſhewn in any of the <hi>London</hi> Bills, that within two years the <hi>Chriſtnings</hi> have decreaſed ½. or increaſed double, as they did <hi>Anno</hi> 1584, when 90 were born, and <hi>An.</hi> 1586, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were but 45: or to riſe from 52, as <hi>Anno</hi> 1593, to 71, as in the next year 1594. Now, theſe diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both in Births, and Burials, confirm what hath been before Aſſerted, that <hi>Healthfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> go together, as they would not, were there not diſproportions in both, although proportional.</p>
               <p n="11">11. By the Standard of Burials in this Pariſh, I thought to have computed the number of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in it, <hi>viz.</hi> by multiplying 58 by 4, which made the <hi>Product</hi> 232, the number of Families. Hereupon I wondered, that a Pariſh containing a large Market-Town, and 12 Miles compaſs, ſhould have but 232 Houſes, I then multiplied 232 by 8, the <hi>Product</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was 1856, thereby hoping to have had the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Inhabitants, as I had for <hi>London;</hi> but when upon enquiry I found there had been 2100 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants in that Pariſh in the time of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who forced too many into that Ordinance, and that 1500 was the ordinary number of Communicants in all times, I found alſo, that for as much as there were near as many under 16 years old, as there are above, <hi>viz.</hi> Communicants, I concluded, that there muſt be about 27, or 2800 Souls in that Pariſh: from whence it follows, that little more then one of 50 dies in the Country, whereas in <hi>London,</hi> it ſeems manifeſt, that about one in 32 dies, over and above what dies of the <hi>Plague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. It follows therefore from hence, what I more
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55171:44"/>
faintly aſſerted in the former Chapter, that the Country is more <hi>healthfull,</hi> then the City, That is to ſay, although men die more regularly, and leſs <hi>per Saltum</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> then in the Country, yet, upon the whole matter, there die fewer <hi>per Rata;</hi> ſo as the Fumes, Steams, and Stenches above-mentioned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they make the Air of <hi>London</hi> more equal, yet not more <hi>Healthfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. When I conſider, That in the Country ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty are Born for fifty eight Buried, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the year 1600 the like happened in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I conſidered, whether a City, as it becomes more populous, doth not, for that very cauſe, become more <hi>unhealthfull,</hi> I inclined to believe, that <hi>London</hi> now is more <hi>unhealthfull,</hi> then heretofore, partly for that it is more populous, but chiefly, becauſe I have heard, that 60 years ago few <hi>Sea-Coals</hi> were burnt in <hi>London,</hi> which now are univerſally uſed. For I have heard, that <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> is more <hi>unhealthfull</hi> then other places, and that many People cannot at all endure the ſmoak of <hi>London,</hi> not onely for its unpleaſantneſs, but for the ſuffocations which it cauſes.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Suppoſe, that <hi>Anno</hi> 1569 there were 2400 ſouls in that Pariſh, and that they increaſed by the <hi>Births</hi> 70, exceeding the <hi>Burials</hi> 58, it will follow, that the ſaid 2400 cannot double under 200. Now, if <hi>London</hi> be leſs <hi>healthfull</hi> then the Country, as certainly it is, the <hi>Plague</hi> being reckoned in, it follows, that <hi>London</hi> muſt be doubling it ſelf by generation in much above 200: but if it hath encreaſed from 2 to 5 in 54, as aforeſaid, the ſame muſt be by reaſon of tranſplantation out of the Country.</p>

2. I might anſwer by asking; Why ſo many have ſpent their times, and eſtates about the Art of making Gold? which, if it were much known, would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalt Silver into the place, which Gold now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth; and if it were known but to ſome one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the ſame ſingle <hi>Adeptus</hi> could not, nay, durſt not enjoy it, but muſt be either a Priſoner to ſome Prince, and Slave to ſome Voluptuary, or elſe skulk obſcurely up and down for his privacie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I might Anſwer; That there is much pleaſure in deducing ſo many abſtruſe, and unexpected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences out of theſe poor deſpiſed Bills of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;</hi> and in building upon that ground, which hath lain waſte theſe eighty years. And there is pleaſure in doing ſomething new, though never ſo little, without peſtering the World with volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Tranſcriptions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But, I Anſwer more ſeriouſly; by complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That whereas the Art of Governing, and the true <hi>Politiques,</hi> is how to preſerve the Subject in <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> that men ſtudy onely that part of it, which teacheth how to ſupplant, and over-reach one another, and how, not by fair out-running, but by tripping up each other's heels, to win the Prize.</p>
            <p>Now, the Foundation, or Elements of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt harmleſs <hi>Policy</hi> is to underſtand the Land, and the hands of the Territory to be governed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all their intrinſick, and accidental differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: as for example; It were good to know the <hi>Geometrical</hi> Content, Figure, and Scituation of all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55171:45"/>
the Lands of a Kingdom, eſpecially, according to its moſt natural, permanent, and conſpicuous Bounds. It were good to know, how much Hay an Acre of every ſort of Meadow will bear? how many Cattel the ſame weight of each ſort of Hay will feed, and fatten? what quantity of Grain, and other Commodities the ſame Acre will bear in one, three, or ſeven years <hi>communibus Annis?</hi> unto what uſe each ſoil is moſt proper? All which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars I call the intrinſick value: for there is alſo another value meerly accidental, or extrinſick, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the Cauſes, why a parcel of Land, lying near a good Market, may be worth double to another parcel, though but of the ſame intrinſick goodneſs; which anſwers the Queries, why Lands in the North of <hi>England</hi> are worth but ſixteen years purchaſe, and thoſe of the Weſt above eight and twenty. It is no leſs neceſſary to know how many People there be of each Sex, State, Age, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Trade, Rank, or Degree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg whereof Trade, and Government may be made more certain, and Regular; for, if men knew the People as aforeſaid, they might know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption they would make, ſo as Trade might not be hoped for where it is impoſsible. As for inſtance, I have heard much complaint, that Trade is not ſet up in ſome of the <hi>South-weſtern,</hi> and <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſtern</hi> Parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there being ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Harbours for that purpoſe, whereas in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of thoſe Places I have alſo heard, that there are few other Inhabitants, but ſuch as live <hi>ex ſponte creatis,</hi> and are unfit Subjects of Trade, as neither
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55171:46"/>
employing others, nor working themſelves.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if all theſe things were clearly, and truly known (which I have but gueſſed at) it would appear, how ſmall a part of the People work upon neceſſary Labours, and Callings, <hi>viz.</hi> how many Women, and Children do juſt nothing, onely learning to ſpend what others get? how many are meer Voluptuaries, and as it were meer Gameſters by Trade? how many live by puzling poor people with unintelligible Notions in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Philoſophie? how many by perſwading credulous, delicate, and Litigious Perſons, that their Bodies, or Eſtates are out of Tune, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? how many by fighting as Souldiers? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by Miniſteries of Vice, and Sin? how many by Trades of meer Pleaſure, or Ornaments? and how many in a way of lazie attendance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon others? And on the other ſide, how few are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in raiſing, and working neceſſary food, and covering? and of the ſpeculative men, how few do truly ſtudie <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Things?</hi> The more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious not advancing much further then to write, and ſpeak wittily about theſe matters.</p>
            <p>I conclude, That a clear knowledge of all theſe particulars, and many more, whereat I have ſhot but at rovers, is neceſſary in order to good, certain, and eaſie Government, and even to balance Parties, and factions both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> But whether the knowledge thereof be neceſſary to many, or fit for others, then the Sovereign, and his chief Miniſters, I leave to conſideration.</p>
