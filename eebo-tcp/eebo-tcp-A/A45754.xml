            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Project of Composing a <hi>DICTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONARY</hi> for the use of the <hi>Fair-Sex,</hi> (which may serve as a <hi>Secret Oracle,</hi> to Consult in all difficult Cases) being the <hi>First Attempt</hi> of this kind that has appeared in <hi>English,</hi> 'tis hoped 'twill meet with a Courteous Reception from all, but more <hi>Especially</hi> from you, for whose sakes 'twas undertaken; and if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives any Favour at your Hands, <hi>I</hi> shall Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute its Success in the World, to the <hi>ILLU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRIOUS SUBJECT</hi> it Treats on; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Virtues and Accomplishments</hi> of your <hi>Sex</hi>; which are so <hi>many and Admirable,</hi> that no Volume can contain them in their full Extent.
<pb facs="tcp:61704:3"/>
However my <hi>thoughts</hi> and good <hi>wishes</hi> have bid fair in this <hi>Essay,</hi> which is intended for a <hi>General Entertainment,</hi> and will, I hope, prove to the Satisfaction of the Learned and Ingenious of the Age; whose Discretion I need not doubt, will keep them from wresting it to any other end, than what it was designed for; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Benefit and Advantage</hi> of the Modest of <hi>either Sex,</hi> not desiring that this Book should fall into the Hands of any <hi>wanton Person,</hi> whose Folly or Malice, may turn that into Ridicule, that loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proclaims the <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> of an <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Creator,</hi> neither is any thing inserted in this <hi>WORK,</hi> but what I have sufficient Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to back it with ready at hand.</p>
            <p>It is now near a <hi>Twelve-month</hi> since I first entred upon this Project, at the desire of a worthy Friend, unto whom I owe more than I can do for him: And when I considered the great need of such a Book, as might be a <hi>Compleat Directory</hi> to the <hi>Female-Sex</hi> in all <hi>Relations, Companies, Conditions and States</hi> of Life; even from <hi>CHILD HOOD</hi> down to <hi>Old-Age,</hi> and from the <hi>Lady</hi> at the Court, to the <hi>Cook-maid</hi> in the Country: I was at length prevailed upon to do it, and the rather because I know not of any Book that hath done the like; indeed many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Writters there be, who have wrote excellent well of some <hi>Particular Subjects</hi> herein Treated of, but as there is not one of them hath written upon all of them, so there are some things Treated of in this <hi>Dictionary</hi> that <hi>I</hi> have not met with in
<pb facs="tcp:61704:3"/>
any Language. 'Tis true, <hi>MY OWN EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERIENCE IN LOVE AFFAIRS,</hi> might have furnisht out Materials for such a Work; yet I do not pretend thereby to lessen my Obligations, to those <hi>Ladies,</hi> who by their Generous imparting to me their <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> have furnisht me with <hi>several hundred</hi> Experiments and Secrets in <hi>DOMESTICK AFFAIRS, BEAUTIFY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, PRESERVING, CANDYING, PHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SICK, CHIRURGERY,</hi> &amp;c. Proper for my Work, and such as were not taken out of Printed Books, or on the Credit of others, but such as are Re-commended to me from their own <hi>Practice,</hi> all which shall be inserted in a <hi>Second Part,</hi> if this <hi>First</hi> meets with Encouragement, that so both together may contain all <hi>ACCOMPLISH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS</hi> needful for Ladies, and be thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perfect. Nor shall I dissemble the Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which I had from the <hi>Private Memoirs</hi> of <hi>Madam</hi>—a Person well known to all the World, for being both Exact and Curious in those Matters, of which my <hi>DICTIONARY</hi> Treats. And as this Work contains my own Observations on <hi>Love and Marriage,</hi> &amp;c. For many Years, as also the <hi>Secrets</hi> received from Ladies of the <hi>best Quality</hi>; So <hi>Lastly,</hi> That nothing might be wanting to render the <hi>Work</hi> perfect, I have consulted the most valuable Books written <hi>for, and against the Fair-Sex,</hi> as also Dr. <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blounts,</hi> and other Dictionaries, of note, from which I extracted what was <hi>proper for my Work</hi>; for as the things Treated on, are many and various, so were my helps.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> hope Ladies, you will not think it much that as the Famous Limner, when he drew the <hi>PIC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE OF AN EXACT BEAUTY,</hi> made use of an <hi>Eye</hi> from one, of a <hi>Mouth</hi> from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so <hi>Cul'd</hi> what was rare in all others, that he might present them all in one <hi>Entire Piece of Workmanship</hi>; so I, when I was to write of <hi>Love, Marriage, the Behaviour, Dress and Humours of the Female Sex,</hi> have consulted all Books I could meet with on those Subjects, to Compleat my own <hi>Experiences</hi>; So that you'll find here at one view, the whole Series and Order of all the most Heroick and <hi>Illustrious Women</hi> of all times, from the first dawning of the World to this present Age, of all degrees, from the <hi>IMPERIAL DIADEM,</hi> to the <hi>SHEPHERDS CROOK,</hi> of all Regions and Climats, from the Spicy East, to the Golden West, of <hi>all Faiths,</hi> whether <hi>Jews, Ethnicks,</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> (and particularly an Account of those <hi>WOMEN MARTYRS</hi> that suffer'd in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> days: And in the <hi>West</hi> in <hi>85</hi>: And of all <hi>Eminent</hi> Ladies, that have dy'd in <hi>England</hi> for these last fifty years) of all Arts and Sciences, both the graver, and more polite; of all Estates, <hi>VIRGINS, WIVES</hi> and <hi>WIDOWS</hi>; of all Complexions and Humours, the Fair, the Foul, the Grave, the Witty, the Reserv'd, the Familiar, the Chast, the Wanton. What ever Poets have fancied, or credible Histories have Recorded, of the first you have the Misteries and Allegories clearly interpreted and explained; of the latter,
<pb facs="tcp:61704:4"/>
the Genuine Relations Impartially delivered.</p>
            <p>Here therefore (Ladies) as in a <hi>perfect Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> you may behold the lively Ideas of all <hi>laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Qualities</hi> whatsoever, suitable to them in all Callings and Conditions; here you may observe the profoundest of Learning and Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation in the Prophesies of the Sybils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here are Erected the Trophies of Female Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Valour, in several Instances. Here <hi>Queens</hi> may learn the Arts of Splendor and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence from <hi>Nitocris, Cleopatra,</hi> and others. <hi>Wives</hi> here may read how to demean themselves toward their <hi>Husbands</hi> in all Conjugal Affection. <hi>Daughters</hi> may here be taught Examples of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Chastity, from the Vestal Votaresses. Matrons may find here that decent Deportment which becomes their Gravity, and Widows, that Constancy which besits their Solitude. Here is also to be found the true Interpretation, and Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, of Womens Names; with so plain derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of each Name, whether Hebrew, Chaldee, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack, Greek, or Latin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that any ordinary Capacity may understand them.</p>

               </gap>h less willingness blot Paper, then when I am forced in this Work, to lay open <hi>the frailties of your Sex,</hi> before so much commended. But this is my Encouragement to proceed; because I can produce nothing out of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, to the Disgrace of the bad and vicious, which adds not to the Honour of the good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. Were none foul, what benefit were it to
<pb facs="tcp:61704:5"/>
be fair? And if none deformed, what Grace could it be to be featured? There were no honour to be ascribed to Modesty, but that we see the dishonour of Immodesty depending; nor to the temperate, but that we daily find the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences inherent to Riot and Excess. Besides, were all alike fair, what praise were it to be Beautiful? Or if all alike chast, what admiration could be attributed to so rare a Vertue?</p>
            <p>I could not therefore but conclude it the highest of Injuries, that whereas the Actions of Men, had met with so ample and so many memorials, <hi>Your Sexes</hi> being not inferior to them, should meet with so slender and so few, and that to Erect this Monument to their lasting Glory, would be a piece of justice great as their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, in not having a more Judicious Recorder of their Worths then</p>

<p n="1">(1.) <hi>Anger arising in your Breasts, instantly seal up your Lips, and let it not go forth</hi>; for like Fire, when it wants vent, it will suppress it self. It is good in a Feavor to have a tender smooth Tongue, but it is better that it be so in case of Anger, for if it be rough and distemper'd, <hi>There it is an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> Sign, but here it is an ill Cause.</hi> Angry Passion is a Fire, and Angry Words are like Breath to fan them together; they are like the Steel and the Flint, sending out Fire by mutual Collusion: Some will discourse themselves into Passion, and if
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61704:13"/>
those they discourse withal be kindled too, they flame with Rage and Violence.— (2.) Observe <hi>that Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the most excellent natural Cure for Anger</hi>; for he, or she, that daily considers his, or her own Infirmities, make a Neighbours or Servants Errors their own Case, and remember that their is daily need of God's Pardon, and the Charity of our Neighbour; and so neither will be apt to rage at the Lenities, Misfortunes, or Indiscretions of another, of greater than which they consider they are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and more inexcuseably guilty. Let us remember the Examples of those prudent and patient Persons in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and such Histories as we have read, who have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and subdued their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whose firm and constant Souls nothing could trouble or shake: And if we be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Anger in the Action of Government and Discipline to our Inferiours, let us propound to our selves the Example of <hi>God the Father, who at the same time, and with the same Tranquility, decreed Heaven and Hell, the Joys of Angels and blessed Souls, and the torment of Devils and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Spirits, and at the Day of Judgment, when all the World shall burn under his Feet, he shall not be at all enflamed or shaken in his Essential Seat and Center of Tranquility and Joy</hi>; and if at first the Cause may seem reasonable, yet stop your Anger, and proceed in all things with Mildness, and Moderation, that so you may make a better Judgment, and more easily determine what is fit to be done. Anger makes People rush blindly upon things that many times they repent in their ruin. <hi>The</hi> Athenians <hi>were extream angry, and displeas'd with the</hi> Macedonian <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that</hi> Philip <hi>the Father of</hi> Alexander, <hi>as a Conqueror, had set over them; so that when they heard that</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>was dead at</hi> Babylon, <hi>they were imediately for revolting and assuming their former Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; but</hi> Phocian <hi>staid their hasty Proceedings, which their Anger to the</hi> Macedonians, <hi>who were set over them in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, was about upon a meer Rumour to put in practice, which if it had fail'd to have been true, would have been their ruin, by telling them that they ought advisedly to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what they did, and that their rashness, if</hi> Alexander <hi>was not dead, would bring a great Calamity upon them; but on the other hand, if he were dead, their staying for the Assurance of it could no ways prejudice them, for if he was dead to day, he would be as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dead to morrow.</hi> So if your Servants, or Inferiours, deserve Punishment, staying till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row will not make him inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; but it will many times abate <hi>an unjust Anger,</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61704:14"/>
you see your Error, that in your Passion you was blind too. 'Tis the greatest Victory for one to over-come one's-self; <hi>So</hi> Aristotle <hi>finding</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great was causlesly in his Anger determined to put one of his Princes to death, none of the Commanders daring to interceed in his behalf, the Philosopher went boldly to the King, and told him he would that day that he should be a greater Conqueror than ever he had been, to which</hi> Alexander (<hi>admiring to what it should tend, seeing he had made so great a progress in Arms, that he wept to think there was no more Worlds to Conquer</hi>) he would be contented so <hi>to be, why then, says the other, I will that you Conquer your self by subduing your Anger, which is more Glory to a Prince than the Conquering of Armies, for there he is assisted by others and, but here his own Power and Magnanimity is more evident,</hi> upon this a Pardon was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But for all this there is something, that requires our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, but it must be with great Caution, and that is a displeasure against Sin, which is more properly called a <hi>Holy Zeal</hi> than <hi>Anger,</hi> and an Effect of Love to God and our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>For whose Interest we may, like concerned Persons, be passionate,</hi> and if we take care that our Anger makes no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of Scorn or Cruelty upon the Offendor, or of Pride and Violence, and Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on our selves it is not blameable.</p>

honest Family, competently Rich and well known, who having curiously observed a Statue of Marble, excellently wrought, and in a publick place in <hi>Athens,</hi> fell so in love with it, that he could not keep himself from the place where it stood, but be always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of it, and always when he was not with it, he was discontented, and blubber'd with Tears.—This Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came to such an Extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he addressed himself to the Senate at <hi>Athens,</hi> and offering them a good Sum of Mony, beseeching them to do him the favour that he might have it home with him. The Senate found that they could not by their Authority, suffer it to be taken away, nor to sell any publick Statue, so that his Request was deny'd, which made him marvellous sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful even at the Heart. Then he went to the Statue, and put a Crown of Gold upon it, and enrich'd it with Garments and Jewils of great price, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd it, and seriously beheld it, musing always upon it, and in his folly persevered many days, that at last being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden these things by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, he kill'd himself with Grief; this thing was truly wonderful. But if that be true which is written upon <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and affirmed by so many Authors, indeed he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd in Folly all the Men in the World. They say he fell in Love with a Palm-tree, a Tree well known though a stranger in <hi>England,</hi> and that he loved it, and cherished it, as if it had been a Woman.— Seeing then these things happen to rational Men, we may be-believe that which is written of Bruit Beasts, which have loved certain Men and Women, especially when we find it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by great and famous Writers; as <hi>Glaucus,</hi> that was so loved of a Sheep, that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forsook him. Every one holds that the Dolphin is a lover of Men. <hi>Elian</hi> writes in his Book of Beasts a Case worthy be read; He saith, that a Dolphin seeing upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoar, where Children were a playing, one among the rest, which he liked very well, he fell so in love with it, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time that the Dolphin see him, he came as near as he could to the edge of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to shew himself. At the first the Child being afraid, did shun it, but afterwards, by the Dolphin's perseverance one day after another, and shewing signs of love to the Child, the Child was encouraged, and upon the kind usage of the Dolphin, the Child was emboldned to swim upon the Water near unto the Fish, even to go ride upon the back of it, and the Fish would carry him for a good space of time, even to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Water, till the Child made a sign to rise again. —In this solace and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61704:29"/>
sport they spent many days, during which the Dolphin came every day to present himself to the brink of the Sea. But at one time, the Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked, swimming in the Sea, and getting upon the Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin, willing to hold fast, one of the sharp pricks in the Fin of the Dolphin run into his Belly, which wounded him so that the Child died immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Water, which the Dolphin perceiving, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Blood and the Child dead upon his back, he swam presently to the shoar, and as though he would punish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for this fault, swimming in great fury, he leaped out of the Water, carrying with him as well as he could the dead Child, which he so much lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and died upon the shoar with him.—This very thing is recited by <hi>Pliny,</hi> and others with Examples of Dolphins which have born love to Men. And particularly he saith, that in the time of the Emperor <hi>Octavian,</hi> another Dolphin, in the same manner, took love to a Child upon the Sea coast near to <hi>Pusoll,</hi> and that every time this Child called <hi>Simon</hi> (they say this Fish will run at that name) it came presently to the Sea brink, and the Child mounted upon the back of it, and the Child was carried into the Sea as little away as he would and brought back again safe: He saith also that this Child dying by accident of Sickness, and the Dolphin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers times to the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed place, not finding the Child there, died also.—In <hi>Argis,</hi> the Child <hi>Olenus</hi> was affected by a Goose: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Lycidas</hi> the Philosopher, who whould never depart from him, nor be driven out of his Company, but was his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual associate, in publick and private, in the Bath, in the Night, in the Day, without any Intermission, <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. <hi>Glauce</hi> the Harper was beloved of a Ram; a Youth of <hi>Sparta</hi> by a Daw. <hi>Nican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der apud Caelium</hi> witnesseth, That one <hi>Selandus,</hi> Butler to the King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> was belov'd of a Cock, whom they called <hi>Centaurus.</hi> A Cock do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted likewise on a young Lad, whose name was <hi>Amphilochus,</hi> by Nation an Olenian.

When <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, that in <hi>Leucadia</hi> a young Damosel was so belov'd of a Peacock, that the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured Bird never left her in life, and accompany'd her in death: For seeing the Virgin dead, she never would receive Food from any hand, but so pin'd away, and died also. In the City of <hi>Sestos,</hi> a young Eagle (taken in a Nest) was carefully brought up by a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: The Bird being come to full growth, would every day take her flight abroad, and

all such Foul as she could catch bring home, and lay them in the Lap of her Mistress: And this she used daily, as it were to recompence her for her fostering and bringing up. At length this Virgin dying, and her Body being carried to the Funeral Fire, the Eagle still attended; which was no sooner expos'd unto the flames, but the Bird likewise cast her self, with a voluntary flight, amidst the new kindled Pile, and to her Mistresses Hearse, gave her self a most grateful Sacrifice.</item>

She was sent for, according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and (after he had tutor'd her in all things which she should answer) accepted and entertain'd. Her modest Behaviour and fair Carriage, with her tender Love and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence about the Children, won her in short time a good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Master, but a greater Affection from her Mistress. So she was raised from a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid to be a Waiting-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and the only Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Friend of her Mistress: who falling Sick, even to death, ready to expire: her last, so much doted on her new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that she sent for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and besought him, after her decease to make that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his Wife, and Mother to his Children. The Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man soon after dies, he is left a Widower, and the charge of the whole House committed to our new Convert, with the bringing up of his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. Which she executed with such Fidelity, that he casting a more curious Eye upon her Youth and Beauty, and withal remembering his Wives last Words, not knowing for the present how better to dispose of himself (Time, Place, and Opportunity, all things fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering her Preferment) he contracted himself unto her, and they were soon after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Instantly upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of this young Woman, the Gentleman that brought her this Fortune, adventur'd all his Means upon a Voyage which miscarry'd, but scarce had honest Rags to cover his Nakedness, or hide him from shame. It hapned, that just upon his return the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man died too, and left her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd of Eight Hundred a Year. Now just as the follow'd the Herse to the Church this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman by chance coming by, like the Picture of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, the casting her Eye aside, had espy'd him, and presently apprehended him to be the Man he was, and whispering a Servant in the Ear, bad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pounds, bad him furnish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with Apparel and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, and so was ready to take his leave. The other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasi'd with so great a Courtesie from a Stranger, whom he had not seen before, enforced him back, to know what Reason he had to be so Charitable. The other answered, That for the first, his Courtesie was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Worth; his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was his Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and his security, in that he knew him Honest, and told him, some three days after he would call upon him, when he was Habited like himself. When the Gentleman came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Promise, he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glad to see this present Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration; and withal entreated him to walk abroad with him to Dinner, he seemed willingly to assent, not once demanding whether. In the mean time the Widow had provided a great Feast, whither she had Invited all her Suiters. This New Gentleman was neglected, and the Stools being furnisht; She took place at the Tables end only, leaving her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Chair empty, when sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly starting up: Methinks saith she, some one in this Room might be well spared, for we have more Guests then Stools. The Gentleman at there words bit his Lip, and was intreated to sit down by his friends, but whilst they were Straining Courtesie; She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, <hi>Is this a Suitor too?</hi> No question some that either hath barrowed his Cloaths, or engaged all his Credit for this one New Suit, in hope to gain the Widow; but Women are now adays grown wiser. This was sport to the rest, but torture to him, who much blaming her Ingratitude, yet Arming him with Patience (the rather for his friends sake who brought him thither) he sat down silent with an ill Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, eating as little as he spake. Methinks (saith she) we are all very merry, only that Gentleman at the lower end of the Table is Melancholy, but I know the Reason; it is perhaps, because he is placed so low; but if that be his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, I have for it a present Remedy: When walking to him where he sat, she pluckt him by the Sleeve, desiring him to remove. And being drawn by her to the upper of end the Chamber, like a Bear to the Stake, where her late Husbands Chair Stood Empty: Now Sir (saith she, with a more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Countenance than before my New Husband, sit here in my Old Husbands Chair, and <hi>bid these your Guests Welcom.</hi> Still he fretted, and they laught as before when she craving Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for so abusing his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, openly Protested, That this meeting was meerly for his sake: And to make them Witnesses of their present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; for if he refused her to Wife, she vowed never to have

another Husband, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all her Fortunes (next to the Divine Providence) came by his Goodness; and that she knew no way better to express her Gratitude, than to confer them on him, by whom they first came. Thus the close proved better than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and the Banquet of Sweet-meats made amends for the harsh Feast, for they found this last (of all the other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages) to be only serious. They were there Contracted (<hi>the Suitors Witnesses</hi>) and soon after Married. And thus his Vertue and her Conversion, had one joint reward. Mr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</hi>

                     <hi>to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Honour or Quality, or Gentlewomen, either in City or Country.</hi>—Would you endeavour to fit your self for this Employment, that you may be capable of serving a Person of Honour or Quality, you must in the first place learn to Dress well, that you may be able to supply the place of a Waiting-woman, should she chance to fall sick or be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from your Lady, you must also learn to wash fine Linnen well, and to Starch Tiffanies, Lawns, Points, Gawses and Laces, you must likewises learn to mend them neatly, and wash white-Sarsenets, with such like things. Then you must learn to make your Lady's Bed, well, soft, and easie, to lay up her Night-cloaths, and see that her Chamber be kept neat and clean, and that nothing be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which she desires or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be done. Then you must learn to be Modest in your Deportment or Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to be ready at her Call, and to be always diligent, never answering again when she tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth occasion to reprove you, but endeavour to mitigate her Anger with pacifying Words. Be loving and courteous to your Fellow-servants, not gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or idling out your time, or wantoning in the Society of Men, you will soon find the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof. For an honest and sober Man will rather make

that Woman his Wife, whom he seeth employ'd continually about her Business; that one, who makes it her Business to trifle away her own and others time. Neither will a Virtuous and Understanding Mistress long entertain such a Servant, whom she finds of such a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: Be not subject to change, but still remember that a roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stone never getteth Moss, and as you gain but little Mony, so if you tumble up and down you will gain but little Credit. —If you would sit your self to serve a Gentlewoman only (either in City or Country) you must not only learn how to Dress, Wash and Starch ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well all manner of Tiffanies, Lawns, Points, Gawses, and Laces, and to Mend the same; but you must learn to Work all sorts of Needle work, and Plain-work, to Wash black and white Sarsenets, you must know how to make all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Spoon-meats, to Raise Paste, to Dress Meat well, (though not often required thereunto) to make Sawces both for Fish and Flesh; to Garnish Dishes; to make all sorts of Pickles, to see that every thing be served in well and handsomely to the Table in due time, and to wait with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You must also learn to be skilful in Buying any thing in the Market, if you be entrusted therewith, if there be no Butler in the House. You must see that all things be decent and fitting in the Parlour and Dining-Room. You must endeavour to take off your Mistress from all the Care you can, giving to her a true and just Account of what Mony you laid out for her, shewing your Self Thrifty in all your Disbursements. Be careful in over-looking In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Servants, that they waste nothing that belongs to your Master and Mistress. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you must learn to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to perform whatsoever your Mistress commands you, to be neat in your Habit, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest in your Carriage, silent when she is Angry, willing to please, quick and neat handed about what you have to do. If you attain to these Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and be of an humble good Disposition, you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a good Salary, and a great deal of Respect.</item>

But you think, Madam, you are not yet upon the Square with us, and if the pretty (for ought we know) invisible <hi>Armaryllis</hi> won't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lists with <hi>that dreadful Creature Man,</hi> unless she's Arm'd <hi>Back</hi> and <hi>Breast,</hi> we must not be such <hi>Vncourteous Knights</hi> to refuse our Aid and Assistance therein to her or any other <hi>distressed Damsel.</hi>— —Accordingly we Answer to this <hi>first Question,</hi>—There's no such <hi>want of Man</hi> yet thanks to our <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Enemies, that you Ladies should be in such great haste to yield at the first Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Foe—What if you are Cowards at Heart, (as Mrs. <hi>Raysin</hi> in her Breeches) 'tis however decent not to hang out the <hi>White Flag</hi> 'till the <hi>Cannon be drawn down</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides you'll get better Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions if the Enemy does not know how weak you are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. (Forgive Ladies, all this <hi>Warlike Gibberish,</hi> for we had been just reading the <hi>Gazer,</hi> and can't easily get out on't.) But to be less <hi>figurative,</hi> in plain Truth and <hi>English,</hi> as we have often told you, there's <hi>little Faith in us Men,</hi> and perhaps less <hi>Generosity,</hi> and but very few of us can <hi>bear</hi> such a Favour—'Tis e'ne too <hi>lusci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Fare,</hi> as was said before of <hi>Kisses,</hi> for a <hi>Hungery Lover,</hi> who ten to one will Surfeit upon't, and in a little while will naufeat the Giver, Feast and all; Not but that could the Ladies be sure of their <hi>Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Hearts,</hi> that will whip you about like <hi>Jack-a-Lents,</hi> a Mile in a Minute, could ye but <hi>know your Man once,</hi> and had you the good Fortune to light upon a <hi>Generous Lover,</hi> (as great a Phenix as the <hi>Eel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Sack of <hi>Snakes,</hi> &amp;c. —you know the Story) in such a Case the less <hi>Ceremony</hi> the better, (except the grand one of the <hi>Ring,</hi> and <hi>Sack-pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi>) and he must be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably the <hi>better</hi> as he is the <hi>happier</hi> Lover, being <hi>surpriz'd into Bliss,</hi> and the <hi>mighty Joy</hi> heapt upon him before he's aware on't: And besides, all the World knows, as well as <hi>Seneca,</hi> that a <hi>Benefit</hi> is so much the greater by how much the more unexpectedly and speedily 'tis conferr'd. All the Fear here Ladies, is, least <hi>Love</hi> should put a Cheat upon you, infect you with his own <hi>Blindness,</hi> and make you take the Lovers for as errant Angels as they do you, and be perhaps

But for this piece of the <hi>Art of Love,</hi> as is before said, we believe Women need little Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, since tho' you were all as Innocent as <hi>Eve</hi> in Paradise, you'd have the Wit to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your Lovers as she did our great Grand-father, Who even before she knew she was Nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cou'd tell <hi>Adam,</hi> unless Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> slanders her.—<hi>You long should Court, and we should long Deny.</hi>—Quest. 2. <hi>If our Lovers Sing to us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to Praise 'em.</hi>— —<hi>Answ.</hi> There seems no great matter in't of one side or t'other—but o'th' two 'tis more Civil to Praise 'em than otherwise, since if they <hi>Sing Well,</hi> you ought to do it out of Gratitude, if <hi>Ill,</hi> out of Pity, if not Justice too; since if they know it themselves, you are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word 'tis almost an impossible thing for a Lady so to deny a Lover as to please him—for as 'tis wittily said of a very Ingenious Person in the Case of Rivals— <hi>We are all</hi> Ishmaelites <hi>to one another if a Woman's in the Case</hi>; so ten to one but a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gets an Enemy when she refuses a Lover—who is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally so unreasonable an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, that he does not consider, <hi>One poor Woman can suffice at once but for one Man</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if a Fam'd Beauty, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, she can never content all Pretenders—unless she had as many Bodies as she has Faces when she looks in a Multiplying Glass. But tho a Woman of Prudence can't satisfie her Lovers, she may herself, by doing what becomes her, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they resent it. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then for her Behaviour is —as to the swarm of Fools that buz about her, e'ne to let 'em alone to pretend on, since they think too well of themselves to believe she scorns or refuses 'em, tho' they were he're so often told so by her own Mouth.—But if there be any Person of Sense, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity and true Worth, who appears to be really in Love with her, when her Heart is before engag'd, we think she'd do very handsomly to let him know as much in as Obliging Terms as possible, that he might as soon as he cou'd wean himself from a <hi>Fruitless Amour</hi> —Quest. 4. <hi>How shall we most decently give our Consent in Marriage.</hi>—<hi>Answ.</hi> For the Time, what has been said of Widows, may be partly apply'd to't, as well as what has been said in Answer to the first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.

The Man, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of good Will, gave to the Woman a Ring, which she was to wear upon the next Finger to the little one of the Left-hand, because unto that Finger alone, a certain Artery proceedeth from the Heart. The <hi>Sabine</hi> Women, they continu'd a Custom, that the Man should come and take away his Wife by a seeming Violence from the Lap or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of her Mother, or her next Kin.

Understanding their Will, he took a corner of the Veil wherewith the Woman had her Head cover'd, and a corner of the Man's Gown, which he ty'd together on a Knot, and so led them thus ty'd to the Bridegroom's house, where there was a Hearth kindled. Then he caused the Wife to go Seven times about the Hearth, and so the marry'd Couple sat down together, and the Marriage was contracted. —In other parts of <hi>New-Spain,</hi> they used other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Rites; at <hi>Thaxcalla</hi> the Bridegroom and Bride polled their Heads to signifie that from henceforth all childi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he hath a Child, he lieth not with his Wife in two Years after, lest she should be with Child again before the other be out of danger. Some suck twelve Years, and for this cause they have many Wives. —The <hi>Dutch-men,</hi> who are well acquainted with <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> tell us, That at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of their Daughters, in those Parts, they give half an Ounce of Gold to buy Wine for the Bridal; the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self giveth no other Portion. The Bride, in the presence of her Friends, sweareth to be true to her Husband, which the Man doth not.

The Parents make the Contracts, not asking the Childrens consent, neither do they ever refuse. As for their Concubines, every one keeps according to his Pleasure and Ability, respecting in them especially their Beauty; and buy them for the most part, their price being an Hundred Crowns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or less. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People also buy their Wives, and sell them at their Pleasure. The Magistrates Marry in their own Rank their Legitimate Wife. This chief Wife only sits at Table with her Husband, the rest (except in the Royal Families) are as Servants, which in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of either of the former may not sit, but stand.— If any Merchant resort into <hi>Pegu,</hi> he shall have many Maids offer'd him by their Parents, to take his choice, and having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the Parents, he may for the time of his abode use her as his Slave, or his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, without any discredit to her. Yea, if he come again after she is Married, he may for the time he <hi>slayeth there, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her in like sort to his use.</hi> And when a Man marrieth, he will request some of his Friends to lie the first night with his Bride.—The Marriages of the <hi>Bengalans</hi> are after this sort; The Man and Woman come to the Water side, where standeth a <hi>Bramane,</hi> or Priest, with a Cow and Calf, or a Cow with Calf: These all go into the Water together, the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> holding a white Cloth of four yards long, and a Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket cross bound, with divers things in it.

But for the Entertainment of the latter, we must consider the Almighty as a Torrent of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the Fountain of Honour, an inexhaustable Treasure; and all that can be wish'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd of Joy and unspeakable Pleasures flow from him; and therefore seeing our Vertues have such proper and desirable Objects, it is highly reasonable that we should turn all into Love: For certain it is, this Divine Love will turn all into Virtue, and give us here an earnest and taste of Heaven, and hereafter Joys and Glorys Inexpressible.</item>

They likewise shew'd him Silver, Gold and Gemms, which he survey'd with as little regard. The King at length commanded certain beautiful Virgins, and richly attir'd, to be brought into his Presence, whom the Prince no sooner beheld; but with a strange Alacricy in his Countenance, and Ecitasie of Spirit, he demanded what kind of Creatures they were, by what Names they were call'd, and to what use Created.

And first, <hi>Love is little</hi> because 'tis a <hi>Boy,</hi> and pretty because 'tis little, and soft because 'tis young, or if you please, because it has Wings, and consequently the Body on't must be downy. But the sage Querist asks further —what do you mean by a <hi>Thing,</hi> O the Philosopher! Why by a Thing we mean a Thing, and believe that's all the rest of the World means by it. But if we must be more Explicit, have at Metaphysicks—and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we tell him for once that <hi>Res</hi> and <hi>Ens</hi> are synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that <hi>Ens</hi> is — <hi>Quod habet Essentiam</hi>;—and now we have wonderfully Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syed the Ladies, who may be apt to think there's some harm in all this Latin, tho' there's indeed no more than there is Nonsense in English.—But we had like to have forgotten one main part of the Doubt— <hi>Why does this little pretty soft thing play about the Heart</hi>? O Sir! Because this cunning young Rogue of a <hi>god,</hi> loves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like <hi>Lesba's Sparrow,</hi> to lye in Ladies Bosoms; and besides, whenever he shoots at 'em, he as certainly splits their Hearts in two, as ever <hi>Adam Bell</hi> did the Apple upon his Childs head; for, little <hi>Vrchin</hi> as he is, he's such a <hi>Dad</hi> at his Bow and Arrows, that ne're a <hi>Fins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> Archer of 'em all, can pretend to come near him. But still <hi>how shall we know this thing from another thing that plays about the Heart</hi>? What other thing is't that this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rift finds so troublesome in his Doublet? If it be a Louse, the rest of the Description shows the difference, for that's not soft, nor pretty, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps little neither: If it be a <hi>Flea,</hi> he has had the Very Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies of it formerly, <hi>Numb.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61704:108"/>
cou'd make a shift yet to find out another Explanation— We call Love little by a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and more endearing way of speaking, usual in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in things of that Nature. Thus the Latins use <hi>Corculum</hi> —which may be Translated, <hi>little Heart, little Rogue,</hi> or what the Reader pleases. We call it pretty, because 'tis so pleasant and agreeable a Passion; soft, because its Effects are so, and describe it playing about the Heart, because that's the Seat of the Passions. After all, we pretended not to give an Exact starcht Definition of it, but a looser Description on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and we are sure a little, pretty, soft thing comes nearer Love than a great, ugly, rough thing, which neither is Love, nor so much as like it, any more than a Lover; nor are the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ever likely to entertain it for such, tho' it shou'd talk of Love this hundred Years. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>

have upon Confidence of your Virtue, been intrusted with you and by you again, upon the like Confidence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Party you entrusted with your own, who upon breaking with you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiously, discloses them: Therefore keep to your self a Reservedness, and try all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways the strength and constancy of Fidelity before you trust too far; for if you lay out your Friendship at first too lavishly, like things of other natures, it will be so much the sooner wasted; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it by no means to be of too speedy a growth, considering, that those Plants which floot up over quickly are not of long duration, comparable with those that grow flower and by degrees.—Choice of this kind ought to be made with the greatest Wariness imaginable, since you are to be responsible to the World for the Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of those in some measure that you contract an Intimacy with; for whatsoever her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is, you will, in the Esteem of many, bring your self under the same, being liable to bear your part with what you have so freely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, for Choice imployeth Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving; and certain it is if in to strict a manner you contract Friendship with one again, which the common Vogue is given, you may be sure you will not be thought to be averse to her ways of Living, since it did not discourage you from admitting her to your Bosom.

<p>Thus were this Noble Sex restor'd to that right which Nature hath bestowed on it, we should have all <hi>Quiet</hi> and <hi>Serene</hi> in <hi>Common-wealths, Courts</hi> would not be taken up with <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and <hi>underminings,</hi> but all would flow into <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> Instead of molding of <hi>Armies,</hi> we should be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Masks,</hi> and instead of despressing of <hi>Factions,</hi> we should have <hi>balls</hi> and <hi>amorous</hi> appointments.</p>
                     <p>Withal we know, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it is in every <hi>Statesman</hi> to be Master of all the <hi>Artifices</hi> and <hi>fleights</hi> that may be to gain upon them he deals with.

                     <p>We must therefore conclude, that as Women <hi>bring forth</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the World, as they <hi>mulitiply</hi> themselves into these <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>corporeal</hi> Souls, and after they have brought them forth, are most tender and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>bring</hi> them <hi>up</hi>: So it is most fitting, having all these <hi>preheminences,</hi> and <hi>indulgences</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> that when they are brought up, they should also have the <hi>Government</hi> of them: For a Potter would think it a hard measure, if after the Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er were made, it should fly in his Face.</p>

This happens more to Phlegmatick Constitutions than others, because the Humours more abound, making the face and other parts of the Body look green, pale, dusky, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceeding from raw indigested Humours; nor doth it only appear outwardly in the discolouring the Body, but it very sensibly afilicts the Parties with difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pains in the head, palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart, unusual beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and small throbbings of the Arteries in the Temples, Neck, and Back; many times if the Humour by very vicious, casting them into Feavors, creates a loathing of Meat, and the distentions of the Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack part, by reason of the Inoridnate Efflux of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous Blood to the larger Vessels; also by the abundant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour we find sometimes that the whole Body from the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of these Causes is pester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, swelling at least the Thighs, Legs and Anckles, and a universal weariness over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreads the Microcosine, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle World.</p>

Beer or Ale, for sharp things shut up the passages, and retard the Humours from flowing to those places where they may be Evacuated; and if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions are not to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or removed without requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring great difficulty, take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Steel, Roots of Scorzone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Bezora stone, and Oyl of Chrystial, of each a dram, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Roots, and mingle the Powder with the rest, and beat them well together, then take a dram at a time in a Glass of small Wine, and by a short using of these measures, the Humours will decrease, and in the end the force of Nature will recover it's power to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate In a temperate calm man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and then the Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will return, and the Body be full of Vigour and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and by Leagueing with Temperance and Sobriety, be ever after more Healthful.</p>

                  <item>The Husband abandoning his Pleasures and Hony-moon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and that's the greatest pleasure in the World, for a Man to be able to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; he brings home his Wife, puts on his ordinary Weeds, and begins to consider what he has to do. And I hope there is never a <hi>Manichean</hi> of 'em all, but will confess it to be very great pleasure to a Man to look after his own Business; and if he sees his Wife no less diligent in her Station, that's as great a pleasure as any can be. There is no Man in the World so silly, but that before he goes about to Marry, he has so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight into the World, as to know that the best House-wife in Nature can never be able to shew her Art, her Education,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61704:138"/>

Now there is no Woman in the World can shew her House-wisery, and her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in an House where there is nothing but bare Walls. <hi>They that go a borrowing, go a sorrowing,</hi> says the Proverb. That Woman is in an ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that must be forced to send to her Neighbours for every Skillet, or Stew pan, or Washing.Tub she wants, which are many times denied, and as frequently lent with an ill will. But she that has all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary about her need never be beholding to her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And therefore in my Opinion, it ought to be so far from being an undergrateful Sound, that it should be like the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick of St.<hi>Pulchers</hi> Chimes in his Ears, when his Wife ask him for Money to buy Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.

The Faults and Passions of Husbands brings them down to the Wives, and make them the better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live upon equal Terms, make them less uneasie in that, than faultless men would be; for man is generally found ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry haughty and proud of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, till humbled by common weaknesses and defects, which in the corrupt State of humane Life do work more toward's the reconciling us to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than all the Precepts of <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Philosopher's</hi>; so that where the Errors of mens Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures make amends for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages of yours, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, Ladies, your business to make your Advantages of the Benefit; but then it must be done discreetly, and not by such sinister ways as may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward create offence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances, considering there can be no lasting Happiness, where there is not a lasting Peace and Quite. <hi>Husbands</hi> sometimes are <hi>Cholerick</hi> and <hi>Passionate,</hi> or <hi>Ill humoured,</hi> yet this by an ingenious observant Wife may be so tempered and ordered, that they at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

beyond an easie disengagement; however, there may be said to be more Comfort with a Wife Prudent Husband, because less care and more Credit in his Company and Conversation, and knowing how to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he will not suffer her to feel the weight of Government, yet give her all reasonable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as it she had the Power in her own hands; one whose Authority is so softened by his kindness, that he finds his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness gains him a just esteem in return of it: insomuch that she will never want Power, though it may be of little use to her, as having no occasion to exert it; and such a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is as much above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kinds of them, as a <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Subjection to a Prince Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in himself, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the uneasiness and disquiet of an unlimited Liberty.</hi> —Having brought matters thus far, and showed the best ways to make a Life Easie and Comfortable in a <hi>Marriage-state,</hi> by turning seeming disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the advantage of a Wife under her various Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, we now come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what is to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore a Wife the better to endear a Husband to her, must carry her self friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and obliging towards his Relations and Friends, which requires the most refined part of her Understanding to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage her self in as she ought, for she must Study how to live with them, with more Care than she is to apply to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of her Life, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at first, that she may not stumble at her setting out; for the Family into which a Young Lady is to be ingrassed, will be apt to expect she should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to their Mode and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as is exacted from a Stranger in a Forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and not bring in a new Model by her own Authority, for that will not be admitted without great Contesting; for they will stand up against such an Invasion, and not give over till they have frustrated the design of it, and made void its purposes: Therefore, if she would live in Peace and good Esteem, she must be Cautious to avoid the least appearances of any thing of this Kind, but rather by avoiding to give the least offence, strive to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her Interest by gaining them to her side, and that she may afterward with less difficulty give her Directions, she must at first be sure to receive them from her Husbands Friends, that they may be the better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in them; and by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, she will soon see a kind of an Emulation amongst them who shall best direct and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her; so that taking Root by degrees, the power in a little time will wholly devolve on her; so that she then being settled in her Husbands Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, may Act Independent of his Relations; for she must

consider, if when but a New Comer, she begins too brisk at first, they will how pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently soever she manages her self, be finding faults, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie little Failings; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times if they have Power and Interest with him, incense the Husband to a dislike of her Carriage, and so plant the first Seeds of Domestick Jarrs and Discontents; and if this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not, yet all prudent Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for their own sakes will have their relations respected and considered, whereby a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er value is set on the Family; for he takes it upon him as his own Concernment, not to have his Relations neglected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it makes way for a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to break in upon himself: And here if a Wife bring any Servants into the Family with her, she is in a great degree answerable, for their Failings in their respects, if she does not reprove and reform them; and therefore it may be more advisable for her to gain the Servants she finds in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than to tye her self too fast to those she carries with her, for that will rather make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and those Parties raise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances, which will be of Ill consequence; and when any appearances of such things put forth, she must labour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their growth, if she would secure her own ease: for it may be said, that the greatest streams are made up of the smallest drops at the head of the springs from whence they are derived: So the greatest Circumstances of Life will in some degree, directed by these seeming Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, which having the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of being the first Acts of it, have a greater Effect than in their own Natures singly they could pretend to. But to conclude this Article, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is, that a Wife as much as Nature will give her leave, ought to forget the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence she has found at home from the gentle Discipline of tender Parents; because what she finds abroad at first, will be of another Nature, tho' up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her being transplanted into another Family, the Usage may prove very kind, and afford no justifiable reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; her Mind must be how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever composed to entertain and welcome it, and not start and fall into disorder at the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of different Scenes; for being a while used to the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, it will become more Natural and agreeable, and grow more suited to her Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which being made up with a Husbands Kindness, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to encrease upon her, till she is under sail in the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ocean of Happiness, and Matrimonial Comforts.</item>

And in giving them their liberty in these Affairs, let it be freely and willingly, not making them stay to watch your Humour, or Work it out of you by their own Arts and Insinuations, which will make them ascribe it to their Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in wheedling, and not to your Kindness; when on the contrary, it would lay a strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Obligation of Love and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Respect upon them.

Hair upon the account of it's Colour to be despised, is a Declamation by those that do it against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a Grand Affront up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Supream Creatour.

These things considered, we must attribute this Aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Fancies only of those who are much taken with them of their own Complexion, or to the spight of some Dowdies, who (perceiving all those that are Yellow-haired to have fair

But be it how it will, Ladies, you to whom Nature has given this Colour, ought not to have a less value or esteem for your selves; we hope, it you were to make your own Markets, you would choose Wife and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Men, and such are not so soon caught by a Fair out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of what Complexion soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as by a Beautiful Mind; they regard not your Hair, but your Virtue; keep but up to that, and you need not despair of a Happiness, transcending what any thing else can afford you; she that Marries one that admires her out-side only, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a Picture-Gazer, and a <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Baby may as well serve him in one respect, as a Wife; we declare, Ladies, we highly approve of this Colour, and if over much Modesty draw not the Curtain of too great an obscurity, no Clouds of Despair in speeding, ought to over shadow your Fair Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but Triumphs of Joy and Success be ever attending on your Smiles, to Crown you in the Elizium of Love, and give no common Felicity to those that will admire you.</item>

she squeak again, it is a sign of lasting Love and Constancy, as they term it; but it through the pain it occasions, he timerously lets go his hold, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is expected, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it most commonly occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the breaking off the Match, though never so near Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. It is to be wished for weighty Reasons, that Young People could well understand each others humours, before they come to tye the lasting Knot. <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, one must eat a Bushel of Salt before he makes choice of a Friend, that is, it must not be done Rashly or Unadvisedly, but upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Deliberation: so to prevent Jealousie, and the Misfortunes that attend on it, ought we to do in Cases of Marriage, to weigh every thing that we scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not answer our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, and when the Parties who are to have their Lots are well assured of her or his (for it may extend to either Sex) Behaviour and Qualities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are not, if they intend it a Happy Marriage, to prefer Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Birth or Beauty, before good Education and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. A merry Fellow says, that <hi>Conquage</hi> styled the God of Cuckolds, is to Accompany the Goddess Jealousie, they by the appointment of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> being always to follow the fairest: So that Beauty is not always accounted the happiest Lot, though very much coveted; straight and comely Personage; have many times crooked and deformed Conditions, yet it is something hard, if men should marry deformed and ill-shapen Wives on purpose to prevent Jealousie, or go on purpose for that Reason to fetch one from the Temple of <hi>Cassandra,</hi> which was once held to be a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for homely Maids, and yet when he has done all that, he may be deceived, as the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> was, who having a defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Dowdy to his Wife, and catching her one Morning in Bed with a Fellow, he cryed out, O thou miserable wretch! what necessity brought thee hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he had Reason, for the Cuckold-maker must needs have a good Stomack to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast on so course a Dish: he who marries a Wife of a suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Fame, if she play false with him, ought to lay his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Heart, and rest conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by Reason his Bargain is no worie, than he had Reason to expect it would be; but when all's done, if you would not be Plagued with Jealousie, marry a Virtuous Wife, tho' but tollerably handsom, and behave your self toward; her as a good Loving Husband ought.

Madness by laying the fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coelestial Bodies, thro' whose influence say they, it is inevitable to some Persons; and there are not wanting some who pretend to Astrology, who lull them in this opinion to compass their own ends, in causing divers to resort to them for no other design than to gull them of their Money, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the wisest of them all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, how often their own <hi>Venus</hi>'s are in Conjunction with the Mercurial and Martial Sparks of the Town in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Orb, should they reduce the Essence of their Art into a Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell the better to be informed. Indeed hot Countreys, that are most Subject to Lust, give great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Causes of Jealousie, but what can we say, when it is known for the most part to be incident to those that have no cause at all to be Jealous: we are not ignorant, that the greatest Cuckolds are the most Contented, Quiet and Peaceable Men, the most kind and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Wives; this indeed they urge, though lamely, in Vindication of the Starry influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which say they, predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate over some more than others; but leaving these wide or rather wild Notions, we now come nearer to the Point, and conclude it to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Madness that Men and Women bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by giving too much Scope to their Passions, and indulging the Temptations that the grand Enemy of Mankind lays to destroy their Peace, and the quiet repose of their Minds, as well knowing such disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will hinder them from entertaining good Thoughts, Meditations, Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and truly any thing that may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them in the way to their Eternal Happiness, and indeed we cannot Conjecture other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than that the Devil is the source and Fountain of such bitter Streams, and those that are possessed with it, if their Reason or Serious Thoughts would give leave to make a true Judgment, would agree: Some hold that Women are more prone to it than Men, by Reason of the weakness of their Sex, and by a Modern Poet it is thus further described:

Strange it is to observe with any Seriouness, that an old Man marrying a Young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

immediately grows Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, suspecting his Wives Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; this makes him rave and grow Mad without a Cause, he fancies his Antlers shaddow his Brows, and hinder the light of the Sun from shining on his Face, as it was wont. If she chances to cast her Eye on any one more comely than himself, he concludes that an Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made by the Language of her Eyes, and a smile in Company goes to his Heart with as Keen a Point as a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Mendoza</hi> the Jealous <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> when he remained as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in <hi>England,</hi> complained of Men and Womens being at Church together, without high Blinds or Partitions between them, according to the Custom of his Countrey, the most Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Nation under Heaven, saying it was a filthy Custom; but had a Tart reply, that it was so in <hi>Spain,</hi> where they could not contain themselves from wanton and lascivious Thoughts, even in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not so in <hi>England,</hi> where Modesty was a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent restraint; but we wish this last saying may hold good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Ogling Sparks</hi> and Ladies that come to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their fine Cloaths, more (if we censure not too hard) than out of Devotion; if a Woman have an itching Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to part with her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, according to the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, if a Man had more Eyes than <hi>Argus,</hi> or they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled the number of his Hairs, he would be as successless in preventing her <hi>Scapes</hi> as <hi>Argus</hi> was in securing <hi>Io</hi>; they have a thousand Wiles, Pretences and feigned Excuses to give him the slip, sometimes an <hi>Aunt</hi> is just come to Town, and she must go meet her at the Inn, at another time such a Cousin is sick and must be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited, an old procuring Nurse comes perhaps to call her up at Midnight to such a Kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans labour.

And Virtue can only be the secure Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of a Womans Honour, if that be mistaken, you need fear nothing, but force and violence can overcome her, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seldom happens to Women, though a little push as some will have it, throws them down when there is a kind of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to fall backward: When <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> left his Chast Wife <hi>Octavia,</hi> to wanton in the adulterous embraces of <hi>Cleopatr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a</hi> Queen of <hi>Egypt,</hi> she was far from revenging her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in giving up her self to another, though he had utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsaken her.

As, if the Father were jealous of his Daughters Continence, if by Kissing her he perceived she had drunk Wine: But Kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and Drinking both are now grown (it seems) to a greater Custom amongst us, than in those dayes with the <hi>Romans</hi>: Nor am I so austere to forbid the use of either, both which, though the one in Surfets, the other in Adulteries, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused by the Vicious; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily at Customary Meetings. and laudable Banquets, they by the Nobly disposed, and such whose Hearts are fixt upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, may be used with much Modesty and Continence.— Kissing, among other Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Love,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Kissing an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Love, also Coyness,</hi> &amp;c.</note> is not the least Charming; to Kiss and to be Kissed, where there is a pariety or equality of Comliness, is as a Burden in a Song, a Battery very forcible, that makes a Breach in the Fort for Love to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it Insuses a Kind of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that generates Affection. <hi>Aretines Lucretia,</hi> when she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to overcome and put Chains upon her Admirers, took them about the Neck, and with her soft Lips tenderly pressed theirs, often repeating it with pleasing Murmurs, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with kind Expressions, as, <hi>O my dear, how pleasing are you to my Eyes! how I doat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you,</hi> &amp;c. And by this means she made them speedily and willingly Condenscend to what she desired, moving thereby the inmost part of their Souls with her Nectoral and Ambrosial Kisses: And these, says ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Change Hearts and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Affections in the raptures of their sweet Kisses, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing rather a Connexion of

Kissing and Embracing are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Men and Women, and worthy of Commendation, when they are decently and modestly observed; but when unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and too violent, not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; because they tend more to Lasciviousness than pure Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and indeed often end in that; for when you come to such Kind of close and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated Kissing, you have passed the long Entry of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremonies, and are come to the Gate of the Pallace of Enjoyment, as the Poet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what describes, though a little Lamely.

Kindness finds out many allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bring Kissing in; Winks, Nods, Jests, Smiles, Tokens, Valentines, and the like, are Introductions, though many seem Coy, and protest against Love Kisses, yet press them to it, and as Experience satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us, you'll find but a feeble Resistance:
<q>
                        <l>She seems much Coy, but won she is at length,</l>

Kisses are Coveted by most, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever some seem averse to them, yet many there are that lie open, and are most Tractable and Coming, Apt, Yielding, and willing, drawing back and then half meeting, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Temptation and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the delight: Some have more Art in it than others, Insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to draw on their Lovers to play and dally, and when they spy their advantage seign Coyness, then Close again, and upon every little turn of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Humour changable as the Wind to outward appearance, though Inwardly the same; at some times you may have the Freedom of her Lips till you are tired, at other times no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty will prevail, not a Kiss for a Kingdom; though I, says one of the fair Sex, was by Art and Nature Beautiful and Fair, yet by these Tricks I seemed to be far more Amiable than I was; for that which Men ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly seek and cannot Attain,

draws on their Affection with a most Furious Desire: I had, Continues she, a Suitor that dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved me, and the more Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents he made me, the more earnestly he loved me, the more I Neglected and Scorned him; the more desirous he was of my Favour, some times I treated with Pouts and Frowns, and would not let him have a Smile or a Kiss for a considerable Time, and then he Bought it very dear; and all this I did to Chain him to my pleasure, and Gull and Fetch him over; and it effectually wrought my desire. Nor is this way unpractised in our Age with success; and moreover when the party they design upon is in their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they Cause one or other to bring them Presents as from Great Men, and shew them Gloves, Rings and rich Attire, which they say was given them by such a Rich Merchant, such a Courtier, and the like, though bought with their own Money; this creates a fear of Rivalship, and that a more ardent Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then nothing is too dear for her; no Service, how painful or hazardous soever, to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, if she Command it. <hi>Philena</hi> in <hi>Lucian</hi> was her Arts Mistress at these kind of sleights; for she frowned at <hi>Diphilus</hi> her Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart, and would but rarely vouchsafe him her Company, tho' she had a Kindness for him, but kissed <hi>Lampridus</hi> his Corrival before hs face, and all this, as she Confessed to her Mother, who Chid her for it, to whet his Love by Jealousie, and make him come with greater Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, believing her Favour was not so easy to be had; she would take occasion to fall out with him, and pick quarrels with him, upon no other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than that he might sue to her to be reconciled again. Love (as the old saying is) is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by Injuries, as the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams are more glorious after long cloudy weather, and many hold, if a Lover upon flight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions be not Jealous, Waspish, Angry, or apt to fall out, sigh and protest, he is no true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: To Kiss, Collogue, and hang about a Mistresses neck, are but ordinary Sypmtoms; but if he be Jealous, Angry, or Apt to Mistake, then, Lady he is your own; but if you let him alone, Humour and Please him, without any Corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, finding no opposition to whet it, his Love by degrees will Languish. <hi>Ampelis</hi> tells <hi>Chrisis,</hi> that she knew this way to be the most taking by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; for says she, I had one <hi>Demophantus</hi> a rich Man that Courted me, yet I seemed to neglect him, and gave Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to <hi>Callsades</hi> a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; at this he was Angry and went away in the great Chase; but soon after came and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly begged to be reconciled, protesting he loved me most dearly, and all that he had was mine, for a Smile, or a kind Kiss, or if I refused him these
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61704:170"/>
Favours, he swore he would Kill himself; therefore (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues she) dear Sister <hi>Chrisis,</hi> and all you Maids that are Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, or but Indifferent, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you not to use your Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters over familiarly Kind, lest they grow Proud and Insolent, but now and then Estrange your self, and Reject them: and by this means you shall bring him, if he truly loves you, to yield to what Conditions you will propose. Some seign Letters to themselves, and care lesly drop them that their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may take 'em up, and find there a supposed Rivals Name subscribed, and by this means many a Love that has been in the wair, has been recovered: Some such usage occasioned a Young Gentleman thus to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.

If we take Love universally, it may be defined to be a desire, as being a Word of more ample Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.

Love va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in its Object, though that Object is always good, amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, gracious and pleasant; and indeed there is a Native ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of desire to those things that are so; for no one Loves before he is in some measure delighted with Comliness and Beauty, let the Object be what it will, and as the fair Object varies, so frequently Love varies; for indeed every thing that we do Love, we think at that time to be amiable, by which means it becomes gracious in our Eyes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a value and esteem in our Affections. Love has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways amiableness for its Object, and the scope and end of it, is to obtain it, for whole sake we so Love, and the which our Mind covets to enjoy, Beauty shining by Reason of it's splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, that shining Creates Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; and the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly the Object is sought, the fairer it appears: If we take <hi>Plato's</hi> rule to define it, he tells us, that Beauty is a lively shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or glittering brightness, resulting from effused good; by Ideas, Seeds, Reasons, Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, exciting our Minds to be united by this good, and centring in one, by setting a just value upon what is good: some again give their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Beauty is the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, caused out of the congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Symmetry, order, measure and manner of parts, and the comeliness proceeding from such Beauty is styled Grace, and from thence all fair and beautiful things are accounted gracious; for Grace and Beauty being mysteriously annexed, gently and sweetly win upon our Souls, so strongly alluring our Affections, that our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are confounded, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not distinguish aright, for these two are like the radiant Beams of the Sun, which are divers, as they proceed from the diverse objects in pleasing and affecting our several Senses; for the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Beauty taken in at our Eyes and Ears, is conveyed to and stamp'd upon the Soul; and of all these Objects, though so innumerably various, beautiful Women are the most attractive as to material beings, which caused the Ancients to allow <hi>Venus</hi> the Queen of Beauty, three of the Graces to attend her. Love is divided by <hi>Plato</hi> into good and evil, or a good and bad Angel; because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Love is misused and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, till it degenerate to evil ends, and <hi>Lucian</hi> in like manner says, that one Love was born in the Sea, meaning <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who is said to spring from thence, and therefore is as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and raging in the Breasts of the younger sort, as the Sea it self, occasioning Fury and unlawful Lust; and that the other is, that which was let down in a golden Chain from Heaven, ravishing our Souls with a Divine Fury, and stirs us up to comprehend the innate and incorruptible Beauty, to which once we were created, which Opinions occasioned these verses.

Love, in her twofold Division, is allowed by <hi>Origen</hi> and others, and there is degrees of Love in all Creatures; even in the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Element, Love generates a kindly heat to support it self, and some will allow even Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getives to have some sense and feeling of Love, as that the Male and Female Palm-trees will not bear nor flourish asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and many other the like Relations.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61704:182"/>
so hainously, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Care taken of her, upon the visible Change and Melancholly it occasioned, she strangled her self with one of her Gatters, though this Stratagem is sending the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was only to wean her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from him; so that Love in this Case, proved as strong as Death. Love has had such an ascendant over the <hi>Indian</hi> Women, that where there have been more Wives than one belonging to a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and which the Custom of the Countrey allowed, when he dyed, they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, which of them should leap into the Funeral Flames to bear him Company, as they fancied in the other World; and she to whose Lot it fell by Decision, has embraced it with Joy and Triumph, and counted her Fate most Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Love in its Operation, works stupendious matters, it has built Cities, united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Kingdoms, and by a perpetual Generation makes and preserves Mankind, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Religion; but in the height of its Rage, it is no more than Madness or Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and turning into Lust, turns the Glorious Fabricks it has raised into Confusion, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins Families, and brings a croud of Miseries upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: <hi>Sodom, Troy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> have felt the Effects of its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Fury, much Blood has been shed upon that account, as well in Private as in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it has tumbled Kings from their Thrones, and laid much Honour in the Dust; Wives have destroy'd their Husbands, and Husbands turn'd Barbarians towards their Wives; it has opened a door for Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, and that has let in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and all the cruelties that witty horrour could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; yet knowing all these things, some will wilfully suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves to be carried away with a violent Passion, as with a Rapid Torrent into the deep Gulf of Misery, where they inevitably perish: this by the way; but now we come to something more of Love Heroical, incident to Men and Women, Chast Nuptial Love, of which we may truly say.

It is all her Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, all her study, how to wear her Cloaths neat, to be <hi>Terse</hi> and <hi>Polite,</hi> and to set her self out; and on the other side, no sooner a young Man sees his Sweet-heart coming, but he rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and makes himself as smug as he can; hitches up his Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that were falling about

When <hi>Hermophroditus</hi> came to visit <hi>Salama</hi> his beloved Mistress, though she earnestly longed to see him, yet she would not leave her Closet, till she had spruc'd her self up; that she might be the more Attracting, as it thus express't.

Some tell us, though we believe few will Credit it.

When all his done, says <hi>Avicenna,</hi> there is no safer or speedier course, than joining the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties together according to their Desires and Wishes; as the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom and Form of Law allows, and so we have seen those quickly restored to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer healths, that languished till they begain to stumble at the brink of the Grave, and wanted but another step to be in it: After their desires were satisfied, their Discontents cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and we thought it strange: our opinion is therefore, that in such Cases, Nature is to be obeyed. <hi>Aretus</hi> gives us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a young Man, who was so relieved and restored, when no other means could prevail; but this Happiness is many times hindred by Parents, Guardians, want of Fortune, Nobleness or Gentility.

I am all alone, and dare not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my Mind to any; what if I acquaint my Mother with it? O bashfulness forbids that! Well then, what if I should tell some of the Lords the Secrets of my Breast? No, Audacity is wanting: O then that I might confer with him in Person, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I could let fall such Words as might discover mine Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Love in such a Case fires the Breasts of many and yet fear and bashfulness keeps in the Flame that torments them: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny modest Maids may this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr to: says one, I am but a poor Servant, what shall I do? I am, says another, Fatherless, and want means: I am, says a third, Buxom and Blithe Young and Lusty, but alas. I can't tell what the matter is, I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Suitor? though I stand in the Market upon Sale, no Body cheapens me; this is a mournful Song for Young Persons to sing or rather sigh out. Love, thus we see Dances in a Ring, and <hi>Cupid</hi> hunts it round about; one that Doats is perhaps Doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on at the same time, and knows it not, or at least where he Loves, though he is not beloved again, yet another whom he despises, doats on him; but when all is done, the only Happy Love, is to Love where one is, or doubts not but to be beloved again.

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61704:188"/>
attract or draw our Affections to admire or love them; or on the contrary, to despise and have no regard for those that are represented to us, as vicious or deformed either in Body or Mind. Lovers many times breaking off upon little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Cavils, sometimes upon Jealousie of Rivals or the like, return like a low Ebbing of the Sea, with a greater Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuation of Passion; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we give is, because Love is in this Case to be compared to flame, that is encreased the more, the stronger Impression the gathering blasts of Wind make upon it with united force, by whose feeble defect it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seemed for a time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or to the same purport: Love augmenteth by some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour, that one Lover recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth from another, so as they are for some time unassociated and retired; but after they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a Reunion of their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it is reinforced with greater Ardour, and a Passion more irresistible, as fearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to hazard what they were so near losing, through Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, Peevishness or Ill-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Love again is found to augment where Rivals are in the Case, and though but cool before, grows hot and is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and the Reason we give you for this, is, because that Jealousie blows up and kindles that affection, which before lay as it were securely sleeping, as it were in its Embers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting any Disturbance or Molestation, or dreaming of any Prevention; which now it is forced to rouse and stand upon its guard to hinder by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition. Love sometimes is attended with extream bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in either Sex, and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the power of Free-speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so that though we are willing, we cannot at least without Haesitation or abrupt Stammering, utter our Mind; when in all other Matters we are Volatile, open and free. And this is, because and amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Appetite is not necessary in matters of free Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the others are, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, Practice thereof is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, by being frequently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Censure: Love that is modest, fancies it ought to be very Private, and more than all this, the Mind being preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in its retirement upon a matter of so great moment, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so suddenly dilate or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it self to the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or through timerousness of speaking amiss, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently giving offence, is not so ready to frame apt-words into Expressions, that it fancies suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently pleasing. Love has strange habits, various Effects upon the Bodies of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, sometimes casting a pale Shroud over them, at other times a rosy Blush; and again, sometimes they seem to be in a dead Calm, and at other times in a very quick Motion; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hot and sometimes cold:

To this we answer, they are pale and wan, when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are in fear or despair of the Success their Love had hopes of, or aimed at; because such Passions constrain the Blood to retire to the Interiour parts, to give succour to the afflicted Heart; by reason whereof the Extremities of the Bodies are left destitute of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient heat to maintain a lively Colour; but when on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand is an Expectation of what is so earnestly coveted and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then the Blood flowing into the Exteriour Parts, gives a Vermillion Blush, and the Heart being disencombered of grosser Matter, attracts the more rarified Spirits, which enliven and give it quicker Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; of which by its dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Operation, the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick participates in a greater Measure. Love in Men and Women, has been variously censured, and disputes have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risen, over which of them it has the chiefest ascendant. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> and other Poets, have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the fair Sex of extream Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Inconstancy; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless it seems evident to us, that Reason and Experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in as much as they are cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Men, and the Nature of Cold is to include or shut up; when heat which abounds more in Men, disunites and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves; and by Experience it is generally perceived, that they are more Firm and Constant in Love, and Men less faithful and permanent, being oftner deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and disappointed than they deceive or fail in their Love and Affections: from this we proceed to a very nice Query, yet seeing it falls in our way, we must answer it as well as we can; and that is, Why Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bear a more ardent Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to those that have first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed them, which is many times seen, than to any other, though upon second Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Opinion in this Case, is, Because the Female receives her Perfection in Copulation with the Male, as a matter by Union with the Form, which inclines their Love more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those who were Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in giving them a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Perfection: Or because those who have depucillated them, hold the fairest and richest Gage of their Love, which is their Virginity. Love we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently find, is more powerful in Mothers towards their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than in the Fathers; and the Reason to be given for it, is, that they cost them more Dear in carrying them in their Womb, and bringing them forth; and not only so, but that they contributed towards them in a larger degree, by so long nourishing them with their Blood in the dark Cell of Nature and produced them in the World with the Peril and Hazard of their Lives; when on the contrary, the Fathers have only the Pleasure in begetting
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61704:189"/>
them, and after that little or no other concernment relating to them, till they are grown to strength, and in a manner able to shift in the World; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the providing necessaries, which usualy pass through the Mothers Hands. Love again is to be considered in another Case, and that is, why it more fervently descends from Parents to Children, than ascends form Children to Parents; and in this Case, three Principal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are to be assigned. The first is, that the Parents Love their Children as part of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and begin early to do so, even from their Birth; for which Reason their Love is more strongly settled and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and Children Love springing up afterward (aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Childish fondness, which lasts but for a time) from Judgement and Knowledge, which many times a misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or some fancy'd ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usage very much hinders in its encrease, takes not so firm a root in the Affections. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Nature has so ordained that all Creatures shall have a special Care to their Helpless Young, least by their neglect they perish through their inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of subsisting, and the ends of Creation cease; when as Parents grown up in years of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, so provide for themselves, that they rarely stand in need of their Childrens assistance, and only require from them Duty and Obedience, which God enjoyns them to yield, in Love of long and happy days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thirdly, the like Love remains in them to descend to their Posterity, which verifies the old saying, that Children cannot be fully sensible of the Love and Tenderness of their Parents towards them, till they become Parents of Children themselves; and have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced that Cordial Affection, by which Nature hath linked them together; for she always has regard to the Conversation and Promotion of the Species, which she maintains in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Succession and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her Individuals; looking still forward to carry on her workings regularly to the end of the World, that so keeping all things in their proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, she may finish her great task, and give up her account fairly stated to him whose Vicegerent she is, in managing the Generative part of Affairs in the lower World; however, though Nature does not so strongly encline the Love of Children to Parents, as that of Parents to Children, yet we conclude, they ought to Love and Reverence them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of their Power, assisting them to their abilities in all that is reasonable and requisite, to stand by them in Poverty and Affliction, and to what Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soever they are raised, to own and acknowledge them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, as the genual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of their Being.

Love conceived at first sight seldom lasts long, therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate with your Love, least it be mis-guided; for to fall in Love as it were at first Look comes rarely to any good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: Portion may wooe a Worlding, Proportion a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wanton, but it is Vertue that wins the Heart of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: admit he have the one to purchase your Esteem, and the other to maintain your Estate; yet his Breast is not so transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as to see through it the Badness of his Disposition; if you then take his Humour on Trust, it may prove so perverse and peevish, that your expected Heaven of Bliss may be turned into a wild Wilderness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and Sorrow. <hi>Themistocles</hi> the brave <hi>Athenian</hi> General, being asked by Nobleman, whether he had rather marry his Daughter to a vicious Rich man, or an honest Poor man, returned for Answer, That he had rather give her to a Man without Money, than to Money without a Man: whence it was that the beautiful <hi>Porcia</hi> being asked when she would marry, replied when she could find one that sought her and her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: there is no time requires more modesty from a young Lady, or Gentlewoman, than in wooing time, a bashful Blush then best commends her, and is the most moving Orator that speaks in her behalf, like <hi>Venus</hi> Silver Doves, she is ever brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on the Palms of Peace, whilst her Cheeks speak her love more than her Tongue; there is a pretty pleasing kind of wooing drawn from a conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet a concealed Phansie;

                     <p>But this Affection with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son has greater Power in the Souls of humane Parents; thò indeed it's Impression is deeper in some than in others, so that sometimes it extends even to a fault, where it is placed on such Children whose stubborn Natures turn such tender In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to evil purposes; yet we see when it so happen, as it do's too freequently, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents fondness decreases not. Love towards his Sons and Daughters, had so settered the Affection of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, that he could seldom endure them out of his fight; and when he went any long Journey he took them with him; and being one time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, why he married not his <hi>Daughters,</hi> and suffered his Sons to travel? with a Sigh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, He was not able to bear their Absence. <hi>Selucius</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> being told that his Son <hi>Antiochus</hi> Sickness proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that extraordinary Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he bare to his beautiful Queen <hi>Stratonice,</hi> though the Father loved her entirely, yet fearing his witholding her might occasion the loss of his Son, he freely resigned her to him. <hi>Aegtius</hi> by a mistake thinking <hi>Theseus</hi> his Son to be

dead, threw himself from the Rock where he stood to watch his return, and there perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Love in Women on this account has always exceeded that of the Men, who to save their Children have rushed through Flames, and on the points of Swords, regardless of their Lives, as the Poet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it.

For wherever we find Piety and Reverence, that is due to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, there is a kind of Earnest given of a prosperous and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Person; for the Child ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this way entituled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Promise of God, whatsoever happens to others, he shall find Happiness and Comfort in it. It is certainly a very great and grievous Sin to be unmindful of those, who next to God are the Authors of our Being, and have taken care of us, when we were not able to help our selves.—Love in this Case appeared extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in <hi>Antipas</hi> and <hi>Amphinomus,</hi> who when Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> sent out Rivers of flaming Sulphur, and by the Eruption the Earth trembled under them, every one minding to hurry away their Goods, and flying in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion; these pious Brothers mindful of their aged Parents more than all earthly Riches, took them on their Backs, and carried them through Torrents of Fire to places of Safety, leaving their Goods to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed; saying, What more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Treasure can we secure

Love and Duty appeared excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the Daughther of a noble <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, who being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Praetor, her Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was delayed by the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor to starve her in Prison, that the People who were offended with the Sentence might not see her publick Execution; her Daughter all this while had leave to Visit her, but was nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly searched that she should bring no Food with her into the Prison; however, her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subsisting beyond what could be suspected, the Jaylor watched the Daughter, and at last found she had supported her with the Milk from her Breasts; which known, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul</hi> pardoned the Mother, and highly praised the Daughter; and in Memory of this, <hi>An Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar was raised to Piety in the place where the Prison stood.</hi>— Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> being Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> at the same time that his Father was a Judge of the <hi>Keng's Bench,</hi> he would always, at his going to <hi>Westminster,</hi> go first to the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> and ask his Fathers Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing before he went to sit in the <hi>Chancery.</hi>— There happened in <hi>Sicily</hi> (as it hath often) an Eruption of <hi>Aetna,</hi> now called Mount <hi>Gibel,</hi> it murmurs, burns, belches up Flames, and throws out its fiery Entrails, making all the World to fly from it. It happened then, that in this Violent and horrible breach of Flames (every one flying and carrying away what they had most precious with them) two Sons, the one called <hi>Anagias,</hi> the other <hi>Amphinomius,</hi> careless of the Wealth and Goods of their Houses, reflected on their Father and Mother, both very old, who could not save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the fire by flight; <hi>And where shall we,</hi> said they, <hi>find a more precious Treasure then those who begat us?</hi> The one took up his Father on his Shoulders, the other his Mother, and so made passage through the Flames. It is an admirable thing, that God, in consideration of this Piety, though <hi>Pagans,</hi> did a Miracle: for, the Monuments of all Antiquity witness, that the devouring Flames staid at this Spectacle, and the Fire wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and broiling all about them, the way only thro' which these two good Sons passed, was tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stried with fresh Vendure, and called afterwards by Posterity the Field of the Pious, in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this Accident,— Love in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times when Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attended the Hymenial Rites,<note place="margin">

I would have all high Lookers and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to great Fortunes to consider, 1.

                     </gap> a blooming Sprig, which he has nourished with so much care and tenderness; what showers of Afflictions fall upon both af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards! 2. Consider what a high piece of Imprudence it is for a Man so dangerously to venture himself with a Young Creature, whose fickle Fancy turns like the Wind, and whose Love quickly may turn into Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, which may bring his Life at her Mercy. Again consider the greatness of the Offence of <hi>Marrying without Friends Consent,</hi> from this, that Nature has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Parents an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power over their Children, making far greater Distinction here than in any other Persons whatsoever. As Parents Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is great, so ought Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Obedience to be great too. And as Marriage is the greatest concern, and that which a Parent takes most care in; so for a Son or a Daughter to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, in this we is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est piece of Rebellion, as well as Ingratitude. Next proceed to consider the Female Sex: And as they are of a more soft and flexible Disposition than the Male, they are more adapted to Obedience: And that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Compliance in them seems more convenient and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. This will more easily appear, if we consider the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steady Nature, and unsatisfied Disposition, especially of the Female Sex, whose Reasons are generally byass'd by their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and not strong enough to search into those things that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61704:208"/>
are best for a Married Life: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain if we consider the Modish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the generality of Young Ladies; when we consider ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Tempers, a Person that would gain them, needs only fine Cloaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an Impert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of such Persons Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-Masters, and Singing-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters have frequently made a Prey. The chief Spring, that moves so many young Mens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, is Beauty; but this is so far-from procuring their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Consent, that it many times is the primary Cause of the greatest Miseries that befal a Married Life.

This is a Misfortune, that lights more upon the Heads of great Persons than others, and more on the Female Sex than on Men. I might shew the greatness of this Injury by several Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I shall only mention one or two. 1. All the Pains and Cares that a Parent is able to take or perform for a Child in this sad Case, can never make amends for it, the misfortune being often so great that 'tis beyond the Power of Man to relieve or give ease to. 2. For a Parent to shew all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, tenderness and care ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable toward his Children, from their very Birth up, and yet by his over-violent Zeal and too eager desire after his Sons Happiness, by an unlucky blow to ruin him at once beyond all relief, is most unaccountable. <hi>Parents Lives are often like those of Poets, and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For Parents, I would have them seriously to consider the great account they must give at the last day, for many of their Childrens failings; especially those woful misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes they have brought upon them by their own means, with the Heinous sins of Perjury and Treachery; therefore let them dread the thoughts of all such <hi>unhappy Matches.</hi> To conclude, I advise every Person, Old or Young, to beware of Marrying to one of a <hi>different Religion</hi>: For, whatever other good things attend a Marriage, this one thing is enough to ruine all.</item>

that as they would to clear their Faces from any stain or blemish. Meekness is not only recommended to all, as a Christian Virtue; but is in a more peculiar manner enjoyned to Women, as one main accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of their Sex; and is not only esteemed by Men, but very highly by God himself; his Holy Word attesting, that a Meek and Quiet Spirit is in his sight of great Price; and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore to all that will not enter Dispute with God, and Contest his Judgment, it must likewise be so; however, though Meek<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness in it self be no more than a single entire Virtue; yet it is diversified, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vers Faculties of the Soul, ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is therefore of the most important concern, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie that part which lies so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to assaults, that it may be secure against all Attempts and Insinuations.

In the absence of the Husband, it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the Wife to discharge the Duty: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And more especially, those several Duties, which in private, and apart from the other Family-ones, are of most Concernment; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed alone also, yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, but joyntly and mutually; as to conferr, Read, Pray, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Sins, and give thanks: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They ought to be joynt in Duties of <hi>Charity,</hi> relieving those that are in want, or on whom God has laid his afflicting hand, whom by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion God offereth to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; mutual Harmony in all religious Relations must be kept up and Consorted; and there is especial reason for this Duty: <hi>First,</hi> God is not the God of them apart, as before, but joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Married, and made one Flesh, as likewise of their Seed; and therefore he must be sought joyntly by them both: <hi>Secondly,</hi> The good things which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God, though they pertain to their several Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, as their <hi>Faith, Hope, Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. yet they reach to the furtherance of each others Grace; if they be bound to have Intercourse with the whole Communion for the encrease of Grace, how much more then ought it to be one with another? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whatsoever they enjoy, good or evil, in a manner they enjoy it in common. Their Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are common, each suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and feeling a share of the Calamity that falls: Their Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, as Health, Wealth, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are common, their Calling and Business common, tending to the common good of them and their Children, their Crosses, their Misfortunes, their Dwelling, their Posterity, and the like, are in common; Why then should their God be seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, their Relighion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship disjoynted? certainly it must be mutual, Wants and Needs must reconcile and unite them to one God with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Consent.— <hi>Fourthly, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is the Golden Cement of all Fellowship and Unions, both to knit and to sanctifie the same more firmly and closely toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that Union that is not thus fastened, is but like the <hi>Foxes

Then to look how they stand affected to the Band of their Union (we mean Fellowship in Religion) Faith, Hope: now let us Examine this <hi>Truth,</hi> but only in one Prime and chief Act of Religion, and that is <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>All-Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Providence,</hi> and that will teach us the rest; what is the Marriage Estate, some only a Stage of worldly Care to act her part; single Persons never come effectually to understand what Care means, but married People, let them be never so wealthy and loving, have peculiar Cares and Consideration of this: in some Countries they were used to hang a Cloth in the Bride. Chamber on the Wedding-day, called a <hi>Care-Cloth,</hi> that it might allay the Excess of Joy in the married People, by minding them they must expect some Bitterness to be mingled with their Sweet; and indeed it may always be Fancied to hang in every Bride-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, unless Faith take it down, and fastens their Care upon his Providence that careth for them, cutting off all superfluous Care of things in worldly Matters: now this Grace belongs joyntly to both of them, to prevent great Evils, that else may follow in being <hi>over careful for the things of this Life,</hi> and by a too eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of them (perhaps by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful ways) to heap up Riches, they squander away that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time allowed them to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for eternal Happiness; till a Cloud of Age comes on, and at it's Heels the Night of Death, in which none can work out their Salvation; and then the main end for which they were made is utterly lost, and it had been better they never had been made. But when the Burthen of their care by Faith, and a firm Relyance on God, is thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he will sustain them, and make their Cares easie and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to them.

Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really intended between Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Party, after Liking, Courtship and Settling of Love, promises are the Antecedents to the Contract; for we must know, that although an Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit or Express Contract hath in it the greater force, external be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, to tie the Parties to Marriage; yet the Mutual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of them both Jointly made, before or after, seriously and with solemnity of mind, are binding before God and in their own Consciences; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the difference between such a promise made between Party and Party only, and a Contract before Witness, is not formal but accidental, and both are true real Contracts and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants; and if there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the expressed Contract which is not in the other, in respect of outward Obligation, the being of the Express Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract rests in the Deliberate, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, Mutual and Honest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of the Parties among themselves, which being past give the Essence to Marriage before the other came, and is the Foundation and Ground of the latter; for otherwise it might

be said, that any passage of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression between two, before Witness, falling from Parties in Rashness or Sport, or upon a Question demanded, might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the force of a Contract, which no one of any Sense can imagin, by reason that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Contract before witness implies a Formal, Mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent between themselves, not now to be <hi>questioned,</hi> yet for spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Causes to be more solemnly, publickly testified, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y Inconveniencies that might otherwise arise. The Parties who before such promise made were at their own dispose, but after such a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al promise they cease to be their own, and pass over themselves each under God to the other, insomuch that whatsoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promise should be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly made, by both of them or either of them, to any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides themselves, if confessed, doth disanul it self, and is <hi>ipso facto</hi> void by virtue of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingagement; but although it be denied, yet nevertheless they are bound before God, so that they shall be ever culpable before him without extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for we must allow that a private Promise ought to have the same force as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Contract; for though man cannot make a right Judgment of the sincerity of Intention in such cases, yet God discerns their most secret thoughts, and if they invoke him to witness what they intend not, or tho' they really intended, and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intervening disgust perform it not, they in so doing dishonour his holy Name, and he will most assuredly punish the Affront done to his divine Majesty; for the true nature of self-renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and self-resigning, resides as fully in a private solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, as in a witnessed Contract; therefore they are not two things, but the same with divers Circumtances, as we shall show hereafter. Many times it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that Love is depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Parties, and there are some reasons to be given why the Marriage is delayed, as not of years to possess an Estate, make Joynture, or the like; and then if the young man comes to hear any one is Courting his Love, though as yet he has made no certain Promise to her of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Marriage, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main free at their own dispose, if he then comes to her and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires her not to accept the offer, because he is resolved to marry her as soon as is convenient, and she again promises him she in such Consideration will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Addresses of no other to any effect, then such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is binding in Conscience, and ties the Party to marry her before God, and if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny withness of it, stands good in Law; because by the hopes he has given her, that she shall be his wife, he defrauds her (if he deserts his promise) of a possibility of equal Advantage, by putting off those who were desirous to enjoy her in such a state: and so again when a man
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61704:224"/>
has desisted from prosecuting his Love-suit for some time, tho' a kind of an amicable League continues, and the woman, (for what cause we determine not) is minded to go beyond the Seas, or to reside at a great distance; and the man hearing of it, and fearing by that means to lose her, goes to her, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>esses his Love with more Earnestness, telling her that it will be a great affliction to him, to part with her so far out of his reach, he really intending to marry her, if she will stay; and upon that if she puts off her intented Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or Journey, it implies a Consent, and is Equivalent to a promise of Marriage; though before she was tree and at her own dispose; and in Conscience she cannot break off. And now it may be demanded by some, what promise do's realize mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage before God? To which we answer, That such a promise so binding must first be mutual, Secondly, Voluntarily made, with free Consent, without Compulsion, Aw or Fear: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It must be without Error, that is, such an Error as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws and contradicts it self. First, then again it must be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and equal, not of one to the other, but of both reciprocal to each other; for if such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise be a putting one's self into the power of another, then as no one can put him or her self into anothers power, without an act of the Resignation of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before had and possest, so can neither each of the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties give up their Liberties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mutual Consent, each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For in marriage the yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the right of one receives a right in another, and therefore it must be mutual and reciprocal, if one shall lay claim to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the other, and yet sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his own, as thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to tie the Party to his own time, and leasure, himself being free, he is deceived: <hi>For Marriage Consent must be mutual,</hi> and that party withdrawing as it were by such delays, his Consent doth in that respect Extinguish and make void the others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise from the snaring the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miser, except afterward the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party shall as freely come in as the other did, and so make the promise mutual and equal. We have read of a sad Accident upon this Account, that befell a Suitor to a young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for having won her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he had no regard to marry her, but growing proud of his Conquests, boasted of her Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and so left her without any deep Engagement or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern on his side, which slight neglect in a little Time, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Love into Hatred and Disdain, and being of a good Family and Rich, she wanted not Suitors, but quickly gave her self in Marriage to another, of which he had no sooner Knowledge, but at a time when he was playing upon his Lute he suddenly starting up broke his Lute to pieces, and ran de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, being justly punished by his own folly.</item>

and it is then we may say with the Scripture, that the Devil makes use of the Windows of our Bodies for Death by sin to enter into our Souls; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>Patriot Job</hi> had a mind to teach us this Truth, when he declares, that <hi>he had made a covenant with his Eyes,</hi> to the end that he might not think on the beauty of a Maid. Let us then remember that maxim of the Great St. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that <hi>it is a mighty piece of impudence to look upon that which we are not permitted to desire. David</hi> sinned for being too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal and free of his looks, and one single Glance sufficed to make him fall into sin. That Prince was <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> on whom by accident he cast his Eyes, was <hi>innocent</hi>; but she was <hi>naked</hi>; <hi>David</hi> saw her in that posture, and there needed no more to make <hi>David</hi> loose his Holiness, and <hi>Bathsheba</hi> her Innocence. Who is this proud one that will refuse to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by so great an <hi>Example,</hi> and who, after this Example, will not avoid with care the sight and address of a Woman that openly exposes <hi>all those Charms</hi> which she thinks are most beautiful and surprising. Surely then they cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from blame who do shew their <hi>Breasts and Shoulders</hi> at so extream a rate, since they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be ignorant that that <hi>nakedness</hi> must needs be much more powerful than words to excite the Motions of <hi>Concupiscence</hi>; for who does not know that the <hi>Eyes are the Guides of Love,</hi> and that it is through them that it most commonly steals into our souls. If the Devil sometimes makes <hi>use of the Ear to seduce our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> he does a most always make use of the Eyes to disarm it, and to bewitch our hearts. <hi>A naked breast and bare shoulders.</hi> are continually speaking to our hearts, in striking and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Eyes; and their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as dumb as it is, is so much the more dangerous as it is not understood but by the mind, and the mind is pleased with the understanding it. The <hi>Beauty of a Neck</hi> which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to our Eyes, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what attracts and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures us, and as it does not cease speaking to us in its way and manner, nor cease solicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and being pleasing to us, it at last <hi>triumphs over our liberty,</hi> after it has abused and betrayed our senses—Men do very well know how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it is to look upon a <hi>naked bosome,</hi> and your vain and light Women are sensible how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious it is to them to shew it. Men say, and say again to the Women how much they are smitten at the <hi>sight of their Necks and Shapes</hi>; The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men know the pernicious Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which the beauty of their Shapes and Necks produce in the minds of men, when by their <hi>naked Breasts</hi> they do not only expose themselves to the loss of their Reputation, but they do greatly run the hazard of losing their Innocence too; Their Chastity is even struck

and wounded by <hi>every glance of a loose and wanton Eye,</hi> and their modesty is shockt by the vain Approbations which are given them; the Idea of their <hi>Breasts</hi> does not less enter into their imagination than into that of the men, who consider it attentively, and commend it; and, as they most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do, joyn <hi>the Idea of all the Body</hi> to that of their Breasts, being persuaded that they shew the beauty of the one to make that of the other be better judged of.

After this what can there be alledged for the <hi>Justification</hi> of those Maids and Women who affect going with naked Necks? Will they say that they ought to be suffered to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their <hi>Necks,</hi> &amp;c. since 'tis lawful that they should go with their Faces bare? It may be answered them, it is only through condescension that the Church allows them to go without a <hi>Veil</hi> over their heads, and that this relaxing of the modesty of the <hi>First Christians</hi> cannot serve for a reason to give them greater liberty, and to conform themselves wholly to the <hi>Vanities of the Age.</hi> In my Opinion, nothing discovers lightness so much as to make strange Eyes familiar with the knowledge of your <hi>Breast.</hi> No serious Judgment can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt less than lightly of such exposed beauty; which that Epigrammatist glanced at hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, when seeing one of these amorous Girles, who had no meaning to lead Apes in hell, but would rather impawn her honour than enter any Vestall Order, attyred in a light wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>Habit,</hi> and breast display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this in Lent time; when graver attire and a more confined bosome might have better becom'd her; he wrote these Lines:

of these, it is necessary that a Woman be cold and moist in the contexture of her frame, that so she may be temperate and fruitful, and that the fruit she produceth may be without any natural defect; For all Philosophers and Physicians hold, that cold and moisture, moved with a little temperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing heat, produce the most effectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And indeed it is past, all Exception that the qualities that render a woman fruitful, are mainly cold and moisture, that might she be capable of breeding much Phlegmatick blood, to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for the forming and supporting the child in the womb, and breeding store of milk; for should there be much beat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the blood would be made unfit for the Gendering of milk, and so the babe would pine a way for want of Norishment; for with that <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen affirm</hi> it is nourished and Relieved all the time it remaineth in the mothers womb.—And now, though we Consider, women cold and moist, in the General, made so for the sake of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet the fruitfulness and Advantage or disadvantage, is more or Less, according to the degrees of cold and moisture, for some are so in the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ians have so exactly distinguished these degrees, that a woman may Expressly know in what degree she is, and so the better dispose and order her self for the bringing forth fair and wirty Children, we will confider something to give them a Light into it, from the Effects these Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities do work in women; and these are divers; therefore we may reasonably divide them under these seven particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> The first, by the wit and abilities of the woman. The second, by her manners and Conditions. The third, by her big or small voice. The fourth, by her spareness or Corpulency. The fifth, by her colour. The sixth, by her Hair; and the seventh, by her
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61704:236"/>
fairness or swarthyness. As to the first, we may know, that although the wit and Ability of a woman flow chiefly from the brain, yet the vessels of Generation are of great force and vigor to alter; for if they be found hot and dry, cold or moist, or of what soever tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, the other parts, saith <hi>Galen,</hi> will be of the same Tenour. Now if we grant that cold and moist are the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that work an Impaire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the reasonable part, and that their contraries, <hi>viz.</hi> Hot and dry, give the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Encreasment of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, we shall find her who sheweth much wit and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, partake of cold and moist but in the first degree, and if she be deficient in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and of a very shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low brain, it is a sign that she is cold and moist in the third degree, and this too may be known by sound sleeping, and much dreaming of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant things, though much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness of conceit, is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily accompanyed with Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wit; but if she pertakes of both these Extreams, then she stands in the second degree. A voice hoarse, big and sharp, <hi>saith Galen,</hi> is a token of much heat and dryness, and a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voice denotes a woman but cold and moist in the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but if a very fine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Effeminate voice, then in the third degree; and if she have the natural voice of a woman, then the partaketh of the second degree, as being between the two Extreams. Much flesh or corpulency, denotes much cold and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; and to be Lean, on the contrary, denotes heat and dryness; and to be meanly fleshed, neither over much nor over little, denotes her to be in the second degree; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the extreams and their pleasantness and Curtesies, sheweth the degrees of these two qualities; much moisture makes the flesh supple and soft, and the want of it makes it rough and hard, the mean is the most commendable; the colour also of the faces and body discovereth the extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or remiss degrees of these two qualities. When the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is very white (<hi>saith Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi>) it betokeneth much moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture and cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the contrary, she that is swarthy and brown, is in the first degree thereof, of which two extreams is framed the second degree, of white and well coloured; to have much hair, denotes the first degree of cold and moist, for hair requires much heat and Dryness to Engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and the black more than any other; and she that is in the second degree, is not overloaded with hair, but it is however decent and very comly, and those that are in the third degree, their hair ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times comes off, by reason of the great cold and much moisture. Foulness and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness helps us likewise to make a true Judgment of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of cold and moist in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61704:237"/>
It is a miracle, to see a woman of the first degree ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair, by reason the seed whereof she was formed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dry, hindered that sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of complexion, that a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tempered matter would have produced; and in the second degree, of cold and moist, a woman proves very fair and comely; but in the third, by reason of too much cold and moisture, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unwieldly, and wants a good colour and complexion; and therefore those in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree are to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for beauty, good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and fruitfulness, before the other two. And thus having<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in some measure, given women an Inspection into the state and conditions of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as to their tempers and constitutions, contributing to fruitfulness and producing of fair children, It comes next to be considered what tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in men come nearest, and most agreeable to them, in begeting children that may answer their expectations, and be pleasing in their Eyes. They must understand then, amongst the many Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Humours, that reside in the body of man, that nature according to the opinion of <hi>Galen,</hi> useth only one to serve her ends mainly in Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is termed whey or wheyish blood, and whose Engendering is in the Liver and veins, at such time as the four humours, Blood, Phlegm, Cholour, and Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do assume the form and substance they ought to have, and thus Likewise nature u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to resolve the Norishment, and to work, that it may pass through the viens, and through the straight passages, conveying subsist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This work being finished, she again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth the veins, whose office is to draw unto them, the over abundant humour, and purge it out again, for the Exoporating the body, and keeping it free from any afflictions, by the too much pressing of Excremen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ious humours; for she advizing, that man has certain qualities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Generation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided two veins or vessels that should carry part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Genitals and semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vessels, together with a small quantity of blood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by so much might be formed as was requisit for procreation, and in that end she placed one vein or vessel in the Reins, on the right side, which end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the right testicle, and of the same is the right seed vessel framed; and the Like on the Left, and according to the greater or Lesser Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heat communicated, the male or female births are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Some Historians tell us, but by what warrant we know not, that women, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the world, and a Long time after, had generally two children at a birth, <hi>viz.</hi> A male and a female; which might be indeed, that there

Much Wine is a great Enemy to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this matter, because by its heat and inflaming it chills and disorders the orderly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and natural heat of the body, which is that alone which works to farther the Ends of Generation. Excess likewise impairs the health; and <hi>Plato</hi> commends the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for prohibiting it to married people by a Law, for a limited time, when they were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for conjugal duty.

It is true, beside any thing that we may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably call <hi>supernatural knowledg,</hi> or that proceeding more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the soul, our natural senses instruct us in some things which contribute to the furtherance of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, as our keeping in memory what we heard whilst we were children, or what our Eyes gave us a prospect of, or that was communicated to us by feeling, smelling, tasting, &amp;c. But none of these can give that understanding which may be properly taken for Wisdom, or a discerning Knowledge of things on a sudden, that have been stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to our natural senses, as penitrating into abstruse mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and what the learned term <hi>Arcana's,</hi> or <hi>Secrets,</hi> or making right Judgments where we are left to gain a light into what is before us. <hi>Solomon's</hi> Wisdom was not so much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in knowing Herbs and Plants, as he confesses he did, even from the <hi>Shrub</hi> to the <hi>Cedar,</hi> as in discerning where the falsity lay in the case of the Two Harlots that came to him for Justice.

who are properly their shelter and protection, for in counsel, as the wise man says, there is safety, but where it is disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, danger. It is agreeable to Virgins Modesty, even in cases of Marriage, to make it rather an Act of obedience than choice. And they that conclude their friends too slow in the matter, and press eagerly forward to out run them, give cause for suspicion that they are spurred on by some what too warm desires. —Obedience we must allow to have a Large circumference, yet it does not give parents a power to compel their daught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Marry, where they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Love nor like; for a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice in the case is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as much their right as their parents; however 'tis Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the virgins should well examine the grounds of her Aversion, and if they prove only fancyful and frivilous, she may endeavour to correct them by sober consideration, but if after all she cannot do it, she ought not to proceed to Marry against her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Parents Indeed have a Lawful Authority to hinder her from Matching where they are convinced it will be unfortunate to her, though her self approve it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have a right to her, and consequently to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. But in the other case, what greater Injury can parents do their children, than to prompt them on to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a sacrilegious Hypocricy, so solemnly to vow they Love, when at the Instant they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abhor the parties they wed; and where it is begun with such <hi>perjury,</hi> 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it continues at the same rate. That other parts of the vow be also violated, and she observe the negative part no more than the positive, and as Little forsake others as she do's heartily cleave to her husband; then however obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is to be observed, and this to be avoided.</item>

He has strictly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned it towards himself, our Parents, and such as are set over us; for without being obedient to his Commands, none can serve him in purity of spirit; and if we say, we obey and serve God, and are disobedient to our Parents, and those he has set over us, we contradict our selves, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reasonably gain credit with men. And this obedience, or duty, extending to children of either sex, may be branched out into these particulars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Reverence, Love, Obedience, and all these are considered as a due debt, even to the worst of Parents, so far as stands with what is lawful and reasonable to be done, and no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Will or Word of God. And though their
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:61704:245"/>
Infirmities, and Failings, may be such as may give others just occasion to despise them, the children must be no means, suffer so much as a thought of meaness and contempt of them to harbour in their minds, nor in any manner of behaviour towards them, let it appear they have any slighting or neglect of them; but rather, if they cannot redress them, they must labour to cover their Infirmities, and conceal them, as much as is possible, from the Eyes of the VVorld, always having in remembrance the Curse that sell upon the younger son of <hi>Noah</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding his Father, though he saw him in a very ridiculous and unseemly posture; and how the other Two were blessed for covering his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness with a Garment. We wish we could not say, it is too frequent in our days for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to have too low and mean a thought of their Parents, and rather carp at their Vice than imitate their Ventures, dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their Imperfections; and as <hi>Michael</hi> did by <hi>David,</hi> when he danced before the Ark, many times misconstrue their Actions, and despise them. But such as do so, must, like that Lady, have the Curse upon them, to be child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, or if they have children, to expect a retaliation of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. We meet with a pleasant story of an Age. Country Gentleman, who to advance his son in Marriage to a Considerable Fortune, made all his Lands over to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving to himself nothing, but the priviledg of Living with him, and dieting at his curtesy; but having thus weakly given the staff out of his hand, the young Lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought home, grew in a while squemish at his cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and spiring, and found, or rather took many cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less occasions to cavel with him, filling her husband ears with complaints of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his father gave the house, and servants, who listening, to her, removed him to an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, over the gateway in the fore Court, and caus'd his diet to be brought to him at usual times, with which the good old man, to avoid any difference that might arise upon the matter, was extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; and here he Lived, like a Hermit in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness some years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had a son that began to tattle and talk prettily, with whom the father playing one day, and pleased, with his childish Innocent discourse, told him, that if he would be a good boy he would buy him a Cockhorse, a Sword, and a hat and feather, and one day he should be master of that Great house, pointing, at his own; to which the child Innocently reply'd, That will be brave, father, but then you shall lye in the Gate-house, as my Grandfather does. This coming so unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, from one so young. made a strong Impression
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61704:246"/>
upon his mind, and as if the hand of Heaven had Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately touch this heart, he could have no rest, or quiet in his Thoughts till he had restor'd his Father a great part of his Estate back again, and with it his filial duty and obedience. And indeed we may justly suspect, that those who have disobedient children have in one degree or other been so themselves; and so Heaven repays them in their kind. But this is no sufficient ground or warrant for children to transgress the express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God. He threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them with very severe punishments, besides the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening their days. In the Old Law the punishment of death was inflicted upon disobedient, stubborn and rebellious chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if brought and accused by their Parents before the Magistrates. And we find it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.17. That <hi>the Eye that mocketh his Father, and dispiseth to obey his Mother, the Ravens of the Valley shall pluck it out, and the young Eagles shall eat it up.</hi> That is, many Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties shall upon them, and even the Fowls of the Air shall rise up as a Reproach against them; for it is observed, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the Eagles, when the Old ones Bills are grown over, so hooked, and distorted with Age, that they cannot feed themselves, the Young ones get the Prey for them, and nourish them, in requital of the care and tenderness they had in bringing them forth, and feeding them when they were helpless. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by some Authors, That the Old Ravens being sick, and spent with Age, the Young ones keep them Company, and take all kind care of them, mourning in their manner at their Death, and burying them in the secretest place they can find.—And as the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of children (in which we include even those that are grown up) ought to be respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive towards their Parents, so likewise ought they to show them all the demonstrations of Love imaginable, striving to do them all the good they can, shunning every occasion that may administer disquiet. You must consider them as the Instruments of bringing you into the World, and those by whose tender care you was sustained and supported when weak and helpless. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if you could make a true Judgment (not being yet a Parent) of the Cares and fears required in bringing up children, you would judge your love to be but a moderate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, in compensation thereof; But the saying is certainly true, that none can truly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the great love of Parents to Children, before they are made truly sensible of those tender affections, in having Children of their own.— love and affection to Parents Obedient is to be expressed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways; as, first, in all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of behaviour, carrying your selves not only with Awe
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61704:246"/>
and Reverence, but with Kindness and Aflection, which will encourage you to do those things they affect, and so you will avoid what may grieve and afflict them. Secondly, This filial love and affection is to be exprest in praying for them, and imploring God's blessing on them, and their Endeavours; for indeed you stand so greatly indebted to your Parents, that you can never acquit your selves with any tolerable satisfaction, unless you invoke God to your Aid and Assistance, in beseeching him to multiply his blessings towards them; and indeed in so doing you labour for your own happiness, in desiring they should be so, because the blessing reflects from them to you. If they have been any thing rigid, or severe, let not that grate upon your memory, but rather turn it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of your love towards them, in concluding they did it for your future advantage, since too great an indulgence ruins more children than se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. If they be over severe, you must be industrious to let them see you deserve it not; and by your patience and humility in suffering, without any reasonable cause, you will molisie and oversome the most rough and unpolished Tempers. Hearken, by no means, to any that speak Evil of them, or would incense you to think hard of them.— In no wise let so much as the lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, If you are grown up, and have abilities, and your Parents are fallen to decay, you must, to your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, assist them, and not imagine any thing too much for them that have done so much for you. If they are weak in Judgment, you must assist them with your counsel and advice, and protect them against Injuries and Wrongs, advising them always upon mature deliberation, that you put them upon nothing that is rash, or to their disadvantage, ever observing that Riches or Poverty, Wisdom or Imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in a Parent, must make no difference in the Obedience and Duty of the Children; and if any could be allowed, they would approve themselves best to God and Man, when it is payed to those who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Frown of Fortune, or to whom Wisdom is in many degrees a stranger. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see how any one can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to God's Favour, who comply not with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of this Nature: He, indeed, is properly our Father, for he made us, and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

therefore since he who has the supream Right, has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was to be obedient to our Earthly Parents, in obeying them, we obey him, and in displeasing them, we displease him. If the Summ of the Commands consists in loving God, in admiring and adoring him, as the prime Author of our being, and well being, and in loving our Neigbour as our selves, as we have it from the best and wisest Oracle that ever spoke, no doubt they are so dependant one upon the other, that they are not to be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And then where can our Love and Affections better center, as to Earthly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, than in our Parents? Marriage indeed claims a share of our affections, but that must not lessen them to those that had the first right to them.</item>

Many husbands have gotten the bare Notion, That a Woman ought to go 9 months with the birth before she can delivered, or else they conclude <hi>she has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her pleasant Recreation in</hi> Venns <hi>Grove, before the Gordian Knot of Marriage was ty'd</hi>; when indeed, in many cases, it is only a Vulgar Error; To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move which hinderances of Peace and Quite, we shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to lay dowu the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of those judicious men who made it their study to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel the mystery of Nature in her various and wonderful Operations. And though some alleged, and we allow, that it is not very usual for a Child to be so long born and live before the usually accepted time, yet we must aver, it is probable and possible, because it has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently been demonnstrated. If a controversie ariso on this matter, in law, the Physicians are to pass their Judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Child, who beiog Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Persons, can by their Skill, in inspecting the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Symptoms and Deficiency of Nature, which not having supply'd it with Nails, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else that is proper to it, tell how long it has been in the Womb, and their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in such cases, are usually taken. <hi>Paulus,</hi> the Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, has a passage to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in the Ninth Book of his Pleadings. where he tells us, <hi>That it is Received Truth that a perfect Child, as to the Limbs and Lineaments, may be born
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61704:250"/>
within seven months, and live</hi>; and he quotes <hi>Hippocrates</hi> for his Authority, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who affirm, in lawful Matrimony seven months will produce a Child, which in time will be lusty and strong. <hi>Gallen</hi> in his Third Book, Chap. 6. argues upon the same matter; but rather according to mens Opinions than according to what the matter will reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bear; as supposing there is no certain time limited for the bringing forth of children; and <hi>Plinny says,</hi> a Womun went Thirteen months with Child; and another, that it may be any time between Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Thirteen months. but as to the seventh month, <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> tells us, That he knew di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers married People in <hi>Holland</hi> that had Twins, who liv'd and flourish'd, their minds apt and lively; not upon their first being marri'd, which might there, as well as here, have bred suspicion; but when they had been married many Years, and no ground or room for so much as the shadow of it was left of their being spurious, because born within that time. He goes on, and tells us an Example of his own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <q>There was, <hi>said he,</hi> a great disturbance, which had liked to have occasioned much bloodshed, and some was spilt about it, happening upon the account of a Virgin, who descending from a Noble Family, had her Chastity violated, and this violation of her Honour was charged upon a Judge, President of a City in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who absolutely denied it, and having seen the Child, said, he could make it a appear to be a child of seven months, and that at the same time he could prove himself to be some hundred miles off for a continuance of Time. Physicians were hereupon consulted, as also Experienced Women, by Order of the Judges before whom the Hearing was; and they made diligent Enquiry into the Affair, and without respect to any thing but their own Consciences, they made their Report, That the Child had been carried in the Womb but Twenty Seven Weeks and some odd Days; but that if it had its full time of Nine months, it would have been more firm and strong, the body more compact, the skin faster, and the breast-bone, that had a kind of a Ridge, like that of the breast-bone of a Fowl, would have been more depressed. It was a Female Infant, and wanted Nails, having only a thin film or skin instead of them; and this they concluded was for want of heat, which more time would have matured.</q>
We might produce a cloud of Testimonials to remove these Falling out, Charges and Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, that make Marriage unease and uncomfortable; but these we hope may suffice as to these particulars.</item>

hold it, and call upon it, and worship it, with such obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and percinacity, that the people were ashamed of his foolish and and ridiculous love, so that they forbad him to approach, or resort to the Image any more. Then the youngling seeing himself to be deprived and kept back from that which was more deer to him than his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppressed with grief, for sorrow killed himself. For the vertue of this passion is so great, that after it hath enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken full root in the heart of men, it walketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable by the most livelyest and sensible parts of the body, and being in full possession of us, she causeth an infinite number of tears and sighs to be pour'd out so wholly, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it taketh away our life. The which the great Philosopher <hi>Apolonas Thiane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> confirmed to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who most earnestly pray'd him to shew him the most grievous and cruellest torment that he might invent by all the secrets of Philosophy, for to punish or chastise a young Gentleman whom he had found a bed with one of his Damosels which he favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The greatest torment, saith the Philosopher, that I can shew thee, and iuvent for to punish him, is for to save his life; thou shalt see by little and little, the burning heat of love to get so much on him, as it hath already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, that the torment that he shall endure will be so great, that he shall not imagine nor find remedy therefore: and he shall find himself so stirred and provoked with divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations and thoughts, that he shall burn aud consume in this flame, as the Butterfly doth in a Candle, in such sort that his life shalll be no more life, but a very death, more crueller than if he passed through the hands of all the Tyrants and Tormenters of the world. Here is in sum, the cause why I let my pen ruu at large on this passion of Love, which is the whole decay of the most part of Youth in our Age; For have they never so little set their Foot or Minds on the pleasures of this World, they prepare themselves to Love: Then Youth, Liberty and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are greatest provoken in this World, and in those wicked Occupations they lead without fruit the best part of their life.</item>

Those Parents that correct their children for Faults themselves are guilty on in their sight or hearing, can have hale hopes to reclaim them; and indeed deserve correction more than their children— Good Parents decline to well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and embrace the first Essays of sin in their children, as knowing it very dangerous and destructive to them: For as Weeds and Trash, Eldar buds, Nettles, Clivors and the like, are accounted Herbs in the Spring, and much pleasing, though afterward rejected; so they see that many over fond Parents are pleased with the Early Evils and Licentious Wantonness of their children in their Infant tattle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain it not, though God is displeased and oftended at it, till they begin to see their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, when it is grown up rank, even to a loathing and detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themselves, with what before they were satisfi'd and contended; they therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their children Early in the ways of Piety, and by Example and Advice lead them in the way they should go, that although they are Young they will not forget it when they are Old; and if they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children, they place their Affections Equally on them, making no distinction, nor difference, however Nature has favour'd and befriended some with beauty more than others. If there be any inclining, it is to those that are most obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to them, and strive to please God, that he may continue to show'r down blessings on the Family. They take it to be Partiality and Tyranny to afflict and dispise those children that Natures too rough hands has rumpled into deformity, and look upon it as a breaking those whom God hath bow'd before. They allow their children maintenance, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their quality and ability, to keep tkem from low and sordid company, and from such things unworthy of them, as Necessitty might prompt them to. So that a necessary supply even to children, is oonveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and redounds not only to their credit, but advantage; for having but a little mony, they learn early how to husband it, and make wary bargains, tho but for trifles; which when grown up, improves them in thriftiness and politick manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their affairs; For we rarely see a young person co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to a plentiful Estate, that has been kept severely in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury, as to his Purse, but he has either many Extravagant Debts to pay, which he under hand contracted, to supply him as it were by stealth, and for which he engag'd five times the value receiv'd; or coming out of a Land of Famine for Pleasures, when he once finds them plenty, and stowing in

                     </gap>ding Women will have one Sweetheart in bed, another in the Gate, a third sighing at home, a fourth busy'd abroad, in obeying her commands; and all this the manages so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that every one thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sure of her, and knows nothing of the Favours she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon his Rivals. They can also, upon occasion, so weep that one would conclude their very hearts would dissolve within them, and slow from them in tears from their Eyes, when we perceive them like Rocks dropping Water; and yet all this is but in Jest; for they can wipe away their tears like Sweat; weep with one Eye, as the saying is, and laugh with the other; or like some Children, who cry and laugh both at a time; and Old <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in his home-span Rhythme, says,
<q>
                        <l>For half so boldly there can none</l>
                        <l>Swear and Lie as Woman can.</l>
                     </q>
But this must not reflect upon all Women; for some are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously Conscientious to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. And another upon their tears has this:
<q>

                     </q>
And so says another, there is no more pity to be taken of a Womans weeping than there is of a Goose going barefoot; and indeed a General of an Army Besieging a City, has not so many stratagems to take it as some of the Fair Sex have to take those they design to gull, and flatter into a belief of their Faith and Conscience, being both Active and Passive, doing or suffering any thing that may be instrumental <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Therefore to prevent the danger, we ought at first to be moderate in both, and not sip in more than we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably bear, and work off again; for in one sense a man may as well be drunk with love as Wine; and it is indeed the worst of the two, because more lasting; when the other, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, is but a Nights debauch, this many times stupifies the senses all the days of Life, locks up his Reason in the Dungeon of headstrong willfulness and self-blindedness, placing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly passion, as Goaler, to keep it strictly in Chains; so that a man or a woman thus divested, may justly be term'd an irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Creature, acting in some degress worse than they. <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> had such a love to <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatria,</hi> that none could wean him from it, first, by giving himself up to sloath and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toness, lost that great Name he had gain'd in War, then the love of his Soldiers, and lastly, the Empire of the <hi>East,</hi> and for dispair and madness kill'd himself, and brought <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and other Countrys, into an Extream Calamity.

to comply with him, and she would in the dark take her place, and in conclusion make him see his Folly and Error, which may be a means to refrain him.

Now pray give us leave to demand with what Reason or Conscience this Gentleman could be Jealous of his Wife; the Woman in this case was Innocent; and tho her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was as much a Cuccold as a Cuccold cau be; yet she was guiltness, because her mind and intention contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to the Fact; and so we acquit her, and hold her not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding to be an honest Woman, for the Body is not capable of sinning, unless it be first formed in the mind, and in this case no such thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and the Gentlemans wisest way had been to have

This put her upon revenge, which otherwise perhaps had not come into her thoughts, she took opportunities to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit a young Gentleman, that had the freedom of the House, not with words, for that she durst not, but with her Eyes, and some Dumb Love signs, of which Language he was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; but how to compass their desires they knew not, but upon consideration the Lady was to make a Visit to a Couzen of hers, or she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do, and having her Governant at her heels, just as she was about to enter the Door, a pail of water came sousing upon her out at a Window, as by accident, which wet her all over; but Love and Expectation had too much warmed her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

The same <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us the reason hereof, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because she is as nets, snares, and bands; where if a man be once in, he is fast enough for getting out. <hi>I find,</hi> saith he, <hi>more better then death, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose heart is as nets, and snares, and her hands as bands: he that is good before God, shall be delivered from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</hi> O, that flesh and blood would listen to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise of the spirit, and follow the counsel of the man! <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not,</hi> saith he, <hi>her beauty in thine heart; neither let her eye-lids catch thee: for by a whorish woman a man is brought to a morsel of bread: and the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress hunteth for life, which is pretious.</hi> Again he saith: <hi>Albeit the lips of an harlot drop as an hony comb; and the roof of her mouth be softer then oyl; yet her latter end is bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword.</hi>

                     <hi>of Sundry Kinds, relating to the Fair Sex.</hi> Questions are easily ask'd, but not so soon resolv'd, especially to purpose and satisfaction. Many rather employ their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions in raising and starting of Questions, than their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in determining them. The one, however, makes Learning fruitful of Disputes, the other of Works. <hi>Asking of Questions</hi> proceeds commonly from some pre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notion of that which the party demands; which occasion'd that Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> to think, that all Knowledge was but only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. It is a great par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Learning not to teach only what to assert or affirm, but prudently to ask. Those that are very forward in asking do often use the same liberty in telling, like Vessels that want bottoms, they receive most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vent most. In cunning m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n they are dangerous; for Questions in them are like beggars Gifts, a Gift with an Hook in it, only to draw some thing <hi>back</hi> again, by way of answer, to find out your abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Sudden Questions</hi> do often procure the truest Relation of matters, which on considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they do begin to colour. They must, in weighty matters especially, be very warily rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; for as delight in humane Learning is inferiour to that which is divine, so Faults committed in Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are more dangerous than those in humane. But laying this aside, we now come to the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:61704:287"/>
matter intended, which is to answer <hi>divers Questions</hi> of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry natures. —<hi>Queries have been put, why the External parts of the bodys of those that are in Love, are more subject to have their sudden changes of cold and heat, than others?</hi> To which we answer, That the passions of the mind in such are more stirring and agirated than in such as are not at all, or at least less concerned; and when any Grief or Discontent is conceived, the natural heat passes away, with the blood, into the Internal parts of the body; which gives the cold a greater opportunity to possess the Vacancies it lest in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. So that the outward parts become cold, and for the same Cause paleness takes place, and a cloud of sadness hangs upon the countenance. But on the contrary, when hopes of success, inspir'd by smiles, and a prospect of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our desires, restore joy and alacrity, then a Spring Tide of blood flows again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every part, brings along with it the retreated heat, and both of them produce colour and warmth; and for this cause Love is frequently painted sometimes pale and wan, sad and dejected, and other times sprightly, Gay and blushing. And Poets seign <hi>Love</hi> to be a <hi>Firebrand</hi>; and the Reason they give for it, is, because that the minds of Lovers are sometimes in suspence, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times incumbered with hopes and fears; the one making them soar towards the Object of their desire, and being too ardently scorched with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent passion, in approaching too near the flame, the wax of their <hi>Icarian</hi> Wings melted by some Repulse, send them fluttering down again, and startles them with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But 'tis otherwise with the married man, whose house furnishes him with safer Delights, and his Wife and Children are as well a Guard to him, as he the instrument of their preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.— 'Tis easier to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent than retrieve a mischief; ans in transgressing with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if we believe the wisest of men, he tells us, <hi>that none that go unto her return again</hi>: that is, few do, if they have drank deep of those stolen Waters.

Is she fair, rich, witty, and not vertuous? Neither the wife nor the rich man will make her his <hi>Choice.</hi> And as marriage abates the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular lives of men, so it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a <hi>sober,</hi> and well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Posterity</hi>: How often do we see <hi>mothers</hi> vie with their Neighbours in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Divinity</hi> of their children, in which they have not only the Praise of men, but the Encouragement of a Sacred Promise, <hi>viz.

                  <item>The true Vertue of Silence cannot be too much commended. It is such a Quality that I want words to express its worth. I cannot well tell which I should most commend to <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> either <hi>Speech</hi> or <hi>Silence,</hi> since the one of them doth too much, and the other too little; Speech enricheth, and corrupteth, but silence is poor, but honest.

Thus having the terms, we shall direct such as need it how to cut up some of these, by which means being brought dexteriously to handle their Knife and Fork, they may the better mannage the rest, To life a Swan, slit her right down in the middle of the breast, also through the back bone, from the Neck to the Rump, and so laying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided parts in the Dish, the inward parts downwards; let your Sawce be chaldron, apart in Sawcers, and then every one may cut as best likes the party. To rear or break a Goose, is to take off the legs very fair, then to cut off the belly piece round, close to the lower end of the breast, and with your Knife lace her down, quite through the breast on each side, a thumbs breadth from the breast bone, then take off the wings on each side, with the Flesh you first laced, raising it from the bone, and then cut up the Merry-thought, and having cut up an other piece of Flesh which you formerly laced, then turn the Carcass and cut it asunder, the back bone above the Loyns, take the Rump end of the back and lay it at the sore end of the Merry thought with the Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny side upward, then lay your pinions on each side contrary, set your legs on each side contrary behind them, that the bond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd of the Leg may stand up in the Middle of the Dish, and the wing pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the out sides of them put under the wing pinions on each side, the long slices of Flesh which you cut off the breast bone and let the ends meet under the leg bones. To deal in like manner with a
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:61704:325"/>
a Turky or Bustard, raise the leg very fair, then open the Joynt with the sharp point of your Knife, but take not the legs off, then lace down the breast on both sides, and open the breast pinion, but take it not off; then raise up the Merry-thought between the breast bone and the top of the Merry-thought; lace down the Flesh on both sides of the breast bone. And raise up the Flesh called the Brawn, turn it outwards on both sides, but break it not, nor cut it off, then cut off the wing pinions, at the Joynt next the Body, and stick on each side the pinion in the place where you turned out the Brawn, but cut off the sharp end of the pinion, take the middle piece, and you will find it just fit the place: and in the like manner a Capon, Pheasnt, and most Fowls of largeness may be cut up. A Capon cut up in this manner, only differs in placing, slit the Gizard, in the place where the pinions, of the Turkey, as aforesaid are laid. In dismembering a Hern, take off both the legs and lace it down the breast, then raise up the Flesh, and take it quite off with the pinion, then stick the head in the breast, and set the pinion, on the contrary side of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass, and the leg on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, by which means the bones ends will meet cross over the Carcass, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wing crossing over, on the top of the Carcass. To unbrace a Mallard, raise the pinions and legs, but take them not off, raise the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought from the breast, and with your Knife lace it sloaping on each side the breast. To unlace a Coney, place the belly upwards, and take off the flaps from the Kidneys, then put in the point of your Knife between the Kidneys, and loosen the Flesh from the bone on each side, then turn up the back, and cut it cross between the wings, and lace it down close by the done on each side, then open the Flesh from the bone against the Kidneys, and pull open the legs softly with your hands, but not quite off, then thrust in your Knife, between the Ribs and Kidneys, and slit out, and lay the Legs close together. In displaying a <hi>Crane,</hi> unfold his Legs, and cut off his Wings by the Joynts, then take up his Wings and Legs and sawce them with Mustard, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, Salt, and Powder of Ginger well mixed together: The same Sawce is for a Hern, and though a <hi>Biltern</hi> is to be dismembered, after the same manner, yet seldom any thing is used with it, except Salt: And for a Partridge minced, Wine, Ginger and Salt over a Chafin-dish of Coals, and the like for Quails. In allaying a Pheasant, you must raise the Wings and Legs,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:61704:325"/>
and cut it up as a Capon. — This may give an Insight to the Art of Carving, which however it may be disesteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some, and thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath their Notice, yet we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A Wife has a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incumbent on her that has several Aspects. First, as it relates to the Person of the Husband. Secondly, to his Reputation. And Thirdly, to his Fortune Love is a Debt due to his person, which we find to be the prime Article in a Marriage Vow, and is indeed the most essentially requisite, without which all happiness is banished from a Matrimonial State. 'Tis Love only that cements Hearts, and where that Union is wanting, it is but a shadow, a meer appearance, but no real or substantial Joy; a Carcass of Marriage without a Soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is very necessary to bring some degrees of this to this state; so 'tis no less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to maintain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it in it; this is it which facilitates all other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Marriage; Makes it an easie and pleasing Yoak to be born: The Wives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should study to preserve this Flame, that like the

But on the contrary, shall live when she dies; when she resigns her breath, she shall improve her Being unto one more glorious: The Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Poor, like benigne Gales, shall gently bear up her Soul to the Regious of Bliss, and she who has che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished the Afflicted Members, shall there be indissolubly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to their glorious head. — Widdows indeed are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Marriage, and many of them after they have wept a while, and shed a few Tears to the Memory of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> throw off their Veils, dry their Eyes, and look out for new Embraces, which is very indecent and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gravity of a Widdow, since Marriage is so great an Adventure, that once for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reasons, seems enough for the whole Life, for whether she has been either adverse or Prosperous in the first, it does almost discourage the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond attempt. It was the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Young Widdow Lady, when her Friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised her to a second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that she had two reasons to object against it, <hi>viz.</hi> That having had a Husband, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished from her by the hand of Death, whom she loved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Earthly things, and he as entirely cherished her. If it should fall out, she should be matched to one of a cross and a stubborn nature, it would break hier tender Heart, and if one as kind and obliging as the former, she should always be in fear of losing him, which would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate her a doubt grief; but we do not find many Rich, and Beautiful young Widdows in our Age of her Mind. All Civiliz'd Nations however, have by custom set a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Death of one Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and the Marriage of another. <hi>Numa</hi> made a Law that no Widdow should Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under ten Months, and if she transgressed, she was to sacrifice as for a Crime done; so that <hi>Octavia</hi> could not be Marryed to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> till three degrees of State had passed to supercede that Law. — Widdows in their Choice, ought to consider how they make it, left by unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness it reflect upon their Reputations, and their former Prudence, and Conduct of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs be brought in Question: When the Year therefore, that modesty Allows with us (though some have made but a Spider VVeb of that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom) is expired, then she may chear up her Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and put on her former brightness of Beauty that has so long been hid under a cloudy Veil; but avoid all wanton Amorous Glances, and Toying, and if Age has stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon her to any Degree, it will not be in the least commendable to go in gaudy

flanting Apparel, but rather grave and modest Attire. Marriage in all degrees is so close a Link, that to have it easy, the proportion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties must be considered, and first in respect of Fortune and Quality. It is always to be wished that there should be no considerable disproportion; those that come together upon the Level, are of all the least subject to such Upbraidings as frequently attend a great des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of either party; 'tis therefore no prudent motive, by which many VViddows are swayed, who having good Estates of their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Marry bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a large Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, without considering their happiness in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which brings them in a short time into the contempt of their Husbands, of which we have had many Examples: And on the other hand, for a VVoman to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry very meanly, and far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her self, is the worst of the two, for such kind of Matches are generally made in a transport of Passion, but when that abates, and is no longer, leaving her to sober Reflections: How many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders does it create in her Mind? VVhat anger does it create in her against her self, and Accusations of her rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Folly, when too late to be remedyed? and this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates contention and strise. — VVe find that a state of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is a little sweeten'd by the dignity and worth of the Ruler, for as it is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, so it is likewise more easy to be born: The basest Spirits, of all others in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, being most Imperious, and it will not certainly a little grate a VVoman of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, when she reflects how she has made one of a Servile mind Master, who perhaps before would have thought it a favour to have been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd as her Menial Servant, and what adds more to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content! Such Matches fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reflect on the modesty of the VVoman; censorious People making such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions on it, as first jump into their empty Sculls. It being presumed, that when the distance was so great, the Advance must be on her side, or the other would not have had presumption enough to attempt it; so that she is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blamed than pittyed; too frequently, we must confess, such matches have been clapt up, and proved very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

There is no Precept commands that Application over the mind, as the power of Love; it draws the Affections by a kind of sweetness, whereas Rules do it by distortion; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it's like <hi>Circes</hi> Wand, sometimes like <hi>Mercuries Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such amorous Conceits have the easier Access to. Every Soul is imprinted with the Character of this Desire, which being turned from the love of the Creatures to Piety, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Divinity: It makes all things seem pleasant; and therefore some have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd, That we should not be without a strong Affection; Glances and Gestures do often procure Affection, whether it be by strengthening the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination or not, we do not undertake to determine: It is most fervent when most opposed; nor is it without

a Mystery in nature. The secret attracting of Affections between particulars, without any knowledge or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their conditions; for there are certain Vertues that want a Name, which is the cause some can hardly give a reason of their Love. It is prevalent sometimes in the wisest of either Sex, which shews, it has a proximity with good: Youth is most subject to those Inclinations, which shews, That it is for the most part the child of Vanity: whilst he is steep'd in his Affections, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like a Dew that falls in the Morning of Youth, when he is scarce got out of the Night of his Ignorance, and is expelled by the rising Sun of his knowledge: and it is found, That Young are Amorous, the Middle Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Affectionate; and those of Elder Years run into the Follies of Dotage, when Natures Fires are quenched in them, and only Ice and Snow, of chillness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency being about them. — Such as those are like Gamesters, That have lost all at play, yet keep a sumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Box, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der others that have Lustly Betts to lay. Love indeed carrys a kind of an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in it's effects, sealing up our Lips that we cannot speak our mind, though fain we wou'd; our words heave upward for vent, but cannot get a passage: We might have the Object of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires perhaps for speaking for, yet are ashamed or fearful to ask for what we so much covet, which caused one to admonish his Friend in such a condition, to take more courage, and boldly let the Fair One know, for what he languished, in these lines.

                     <p>But now we come to give some cautions as to trust and distrust in these Affairs; both of them being very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the occasion may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. It cannot be denyed, but the latest Rule to trust to, not to be deceived, is to prefer distaste before too much credulity: As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, a Religious Suspition is a good Antidote against the Poyson of Vice, which still the Devil instills into the hearts of Men, with a deceitful pleasure, putting an Imposture upon their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: So a dissembling Lover dresses up his words in the most beautiful Forms, covering his Hippocracy and Dissimulation with guilded Promises, to gain Credit and Belief, that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deceive: And therefore such Ladies as would avoid being taken in a Snare, must have a generous distrust, till they are very well assured how they may trust They must joyn to the Innocency of the Dove, and the Wisdom of the Serpent, and not think every shining thing to be real, and no counterfeit. It's the stile of Pollicy to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust, whereby probability of Appearance, it may give se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. But to let every<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing receive our own Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are formed in the weak moddel of a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fancy, distracts Judgment; and though these that are most sensible of their own Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, will soonest expect deficiencies from others: yet, it is safe to think, there is somewhat lyes hid which he doth not apprehend; for it collects the Understanding, and admits not of any thing without due Examination; for many through want of venting the Extasies of their minds, have become pale, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd and envious, even with themselves, which have put the whole Frame of their composition out of joynt: And for this reason, we may well decline from too much trust in others; when it is not always safe to trust your own heart: <hi>The heart of man is deceitful,</hi> which like a Magick Glass, represents the Form of things which are not. Therefore, first proceed from a knowledge and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your self, to that of others; so it may prove a wholsome Exors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore let them be viewed in Reasons Light, and the other as things imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mixed and obscured. <hi>Machiavell</hi> has done well to acquaint the World with the common practice of men; for

it induces Vigilance to fair seeming Actions and Gestures, pretending to Love and Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when they are perhaps but painted Dissimulations; for some Men will give you the smoothness of their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be taken hold of, whilst they are studying E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion by the slipperiness of their Fancy.

If you can handsomly fix upon a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fortune, some Person whose Relations by prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their way, may make a fair Addition to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Portion, though not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver large; it may do all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as well, if not more successful, because it comes to assist you in your urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, many times when you expect it not; how often have we seen those that have been akin to Estates, though a great way off, have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless enjoyed them, when they least expected Deaths Kindness; and therefore, though most covet their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Portions, where there is nothing to be expected beond, are not always to be preferred; for Money is a disposable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and in the passage does easily stick to the Hands of those that have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to transmit it: But Land is an Apparent, Visible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, which the Law hath so well and prudently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, for, that it cannot be diverted or concealed. — Young Men Marrying Wives, though with a small Fortune, whose Friends have been much Interested in business, and able to advance, have found it better than a Portion, especially the Wife being Frugal and Industrious, the good word and Countenance of a Relation, has furthered many, though they have kept at a Distance. There is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a kind of a Smock-Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that has proved very gainful, which in this case may be allowed, though not in others; when a Man may be Son in Law, or Kinsman to the next good Benifice,

                     <p>Zeal, though it be good in it self, is frequently abus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mistakes and absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; but when it is pure, Streaming from an uncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fountain, it is highly to be prized. That Zeal is only good which in servent Love has temperate Expressions: For let the Affection swell up as high as it can, yet if it run over i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Remember always that Zeal is something proceeding from Divine Love, when true: And that it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must contradict no Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Love: Love to God includes love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and therefore no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Zeal for God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, must make us uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to one another. — zeal in the ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

parts of your Duty as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly as if all the Salvation of Mankind, the Confusion of the Devils, and all you hope or desire did depend upon every one Action. Let Zeal be seated in the will and Choice, and regulated with prudence and a sober Understanding, not in the Phancies and Affections, for they will render it only full of Noise and Empty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, when the other will take it deep and smooth, materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and devout; that Zeal to be sure, is safe and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which directly encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Charity. Let your Zeal, if it must be Expressed in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, be always more severe against your self, than a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst others, which will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish it from Malice and Prejudice.</p>
