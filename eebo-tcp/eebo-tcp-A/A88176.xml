         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE betwixt Lieut. Col.
JOHN LILBURN, cloſe priſoner in the Tower of
London, and Mr HUGH PETER; upon Friday
May 25, 1649.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His preſent Friday Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> with one Doctor <hi>Mayſey</hi>
of <hi>Kingſton,</hi> and a Captain of M. <hi>Burton</hi>'s Congregation
that I have known formerly in Major General <hi>Craford</hi>'s
Regiment of Foot, with the Lieutenant of the Tower,
and my Keeper, came into my Lodging, where they
found my wife and my ſelf at dinner; and after ſalutes
of each other, Mr. <hi>Peter</hi> told me to this effect, That he had at or neer the
Cuſtome houſe, received an affront, for which he came to the Lieutenant
of the Tower for reparation, and ſo was reſolved to ſee me, being here,
and kill two birds with one ſtone; and being newly come from ſea, and
hearing I was here, he meerly came to give me a viſit, out of no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
in the world, but meerly a bare viſit. I replyed to this purpoſe; Mr.
<hi>Peter,</hi> I know you well enough, and you know that I know you to be
one of the ſetting-dogs, or ſtalking-horſes of the great men of the Army,
with fair and plauſible pretences to inſinuate into men when they have
done them wrong, and to work out their deſignes when they are in a
ſtrait, and cover over their blots that they have made, when they grow
ſo viſible, that they cannot well be hid, but will appear to their ſhame.</p>
            <p>He wondering that I entertain'd him with ſuch a guage for his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
viſiting me (as he call'd it) I told him in effect, it was no halting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a creeple, for I knew him well enough, and thoſe to whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed.</p>
            <p>But he ſate him down and ate and drunk with me, and fell a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
at all the ſtirs here, and what ſhould be the cauſe of the late bloud
that was ſhed. I told him in effect, his great Maſters could better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him of that then I. Said he, <hi>They ſay, Your bustling hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
it.</hi> Truly Sir, I ſay, their injuſtice, oppreſſion and tyranny hath
done it: and I am ſure, I fetch'd not them out of White-hall, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154041:2"/>
of their Lodgings; but they fetch'd me out of <hi>Winchester-houſe,</hi> out
of my bed and habitation, from my wife and children, and carried me to
their thing called a Councel of State, who (like a company of righteous
Judges, the clean contrary way) committed me to priſon in the nature
of a Traytor, before ever they let me ſee accuſer, accuſation, proſecutor,
or witneſſe, or any due proceſſe of Law: and yet time was, when the
King impeached <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the five Members, and preferred a Charge
of ſeven Articles againſt them of high-treaſon in the higheſt nature, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>1. Part Book Decl. pag.</hi> 35. and onely failed in a ſingle punctilio of
due Proceſs of Law, that they cryed out, it was ſuch an invaſion of the
peoples Liberty, that four or five <hi>peccavies</hi> and recantations from him,
recorded in their own Declarations, would never ſerve their turn: but
yet forty times more illegalitie exerciſed by themſelves upon me, muſt
be legall, juſt, and right in your great, juſt and righteous Maſters, that now
have a prerogative and priviledge, they can neither ſay, do, nor act evill,
although they commit me to priſon without any crime pretended, or
without ever letting me ſee accuſer, or accuſation, proſecutor or charge;
and yet into the bargain, deal worſe with me then ever the Heathen and
Pagan Romans dealt with <hi>Paul,</hi> who had nothing but the depraved light
of Nature to guide them, and yet in all his impriſonment never forbad
or hindered any of his friends to viſit or relieve him, although he were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
for a peſtilent fellow, and a turner of the world up ſide down:
but they lock me up in a cloſe room, with centinels at my door, and will
not ſo much as at a diſtance let me ſpeak with my friends; nay, and for
ſeverall days would not ſo much as let me ſee my wife: And yet, Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
theſe are your religious, godly, conſciencious Maſters. And if this be
the fruits of their ſaint-ſhip and religion, I do aſſure you, the Divel is as
good, if not a better Saint: for he beleeves and trembles, which is more
then I think they do: and if the Sun ſhining upon the dunghill, make it
ſtink, whether is the fault in the Sun or the dunghill?</p>
            <p>So, being at dinner with a Summers diet, the Lieut. of the Tower
told me, I fared ſutable to my allowance. <hi>What?</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Peter, Do
they give him allowance?</hi> I, ſaith the Lieutenant, they would allow him
twenty ſhillings a week, and he refuſeth it. Sa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d I to this purpoſe, Sir,
forty ſhillings a week (as diet is now) will not provide me ſuch meat:
and beſides, Mr. <hi>Peter,</hi> do your great Maſters think, that my captivitie
ſhall make me value my ſelf at the rate of ſuch a ſcoundrell fellow (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been a Lieutenant Colonel in their Service) as to accept of twenty
ſhillings a week, when the King (whom they beheaded for a Tyrant)
allowed to the meaneſt ordinary man that ever he ſent hither, three pound
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154041:3"/>
a week. I am ſure, they have five times the Kings Revenue, and things
are twice as dear as they uſed to be: And if they will imitate him in all
his baſeneſſe, nay, and far out ſtrip him, I will hold them to it a little, to
imitate him in ſome of his vertues; and therefore, unleſſe they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me the allowance that is the cuſtome of the place, I will have none
of it: and you may tell them from me, I ſcorn to be fed by them with a
bit and a knock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A little after, Mr</hi> Peter <hi>caſting his eye upon my Law-books, takes up
one of</hi> Cook'<hi>s</hi> Inſtitutes, <hi>and profeſſed,</hi> I was meerly gull'd in reading or
truſting to theſe Books, for there was no Laws in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwered to this effect, That I did beleeve what he ſaid; for they
(meaning his great Maſters, <hi>Cromwel, Fairfax,</hi> &amp;c.) had deſtroyed them
all.</p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> I tell you, there never was any in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No (ſaid I)? and taking up my Statute-book, I turned him to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Right, and asked him whether that be a Law or no?</p>
            <p>No, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> it is none: and I would fain have you to define what Law is.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaid I, I will not take upon me to define what Law is in your
ſenſe, or in my own; but I will turn you to a definition in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſenſe in their own book of Declarations; which I read to him, as
followeth: <q>The Law is that which puts a difference between good and
evill, betwixt juſt and unjuſt: If you take away the Law, all things
will fall into confuſion, every man will become a law unto himſelf;
which in the depraved condition of humane nature, muſt needs produce
many great enormities: Luſt wil become a law, and Envie will become
a law, covetouſneſſe and ambition will become laws; and what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates,
what deciſions ſuch laws will produce, may eaſily be diſcerned.</q>
So, Mr <hi>Peter,</hi> here is a definition of Law by the Parliament in the days of
their primitive puritie, before they had corrupted themſelves with the
Common-wealths money. And elſewhere it is their language, <q>That
the Law is the ſafeguard, the cuſtodie of all private intereſts; your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
your Lives, your Liberties and Eſtates are all in the keeping of the
Law:</q> without this every man hath a like right to any thing. And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
the Law is called <q>that right line that diſcovereth that which is
tort crooked, or wrong; the Law is that right line that meaſures it
ſelf and a croked line:</q> the Law is the beſt birth-right the Subject hath;
for thereby his Goods, Lands, Wife, Children, his Bodie, Life, Honour,
and Eſtimation are protected from injury and wrong, <hi>being the ſureſt
ſanctuarie that a man can take, and the ſtrongeſt fortreſſe to protect the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all.</hi> To every one of us there comes a greater inheritance by right
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154041:3"/>
and the Law, then by our Parents. Yea, and it is further ſaid by their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
<hi>It is a miſerable ſervitude or bondage where the Law is uncertain, or
unknown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He anſwers to this effect, I tell you ſaith he, for all this, there is no
Law in this Nation, but the ſword, and what it gives; neither was there
any Law or Government in the World, but what the Sword gave and
ſet up.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Unto which I Replyed to this purpoſe, Mr <hi>Peter,</hi> I look upon you as
one of the principall Guids of the Army, and a man that doth from time
to time ſpeak very much the ſence of the Leaders of the Army, being you
lie in their boſomes, and know their ſecrets, and is much uſed by them,
to trumpet abroad their Principles and Tenents; But Sir, let me tell you
withall, if your reaſoning be ſound and good, then if ſix Theeves meet
three, or four honeſt men, and becauſe they are ſtronger then they, rob
them, that act is righteous, ſound and good, becauſe their ſwords are
ſtronger then the others; and if any Power be a juſt Power that is upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
becauſe it is up, I wonder how you of the Army, and they of the
Parliament can acquit your ſelves of being Rebels and Traytors before
God and man, in reſiſting and fighting againſt a juſt Power in the King,
who was a Power up, &amp; fenced about with abundance of Laws ſo reputed
in the common acceptation of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, by the expreſſe Letter of which
I am ſure of it, all thoſe who ever they be that ſhall riſe in Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Traytors; and I would faine know, if it were not
for the preſervation of the Laws, that holds out the peoples Liberties &amp;
Freedomes, that the Parliament and Army engaged in Theirs, againſt the
King a juſt Power, becauſe he was up upon your own grounds; what
can you or any other make rationally to be the ground of the the Wars?
But Sir, in ſhort and in plain Engliſh, let me tell you, that if there be now
no Law in <hi>England,</hi> nor never was, that then you and your great Maſters,
<hi>Cromwell, Fairfax,</hi> and the Parliament, are a pack of arrant bloody
Rogues and Villaines, in ſetting the people together by the ears, to fight
for the preſervation of their Laws, in which their Libertie is contained
(which is the principall declared cauſe of the Warre from the beginning
to the end of the War never) if there were no ſuch thing in being as Law
in <hi>England:</hi> At which Mr <hi>Peter</hi> was much ſtartled, and much condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
my harſh language, though it be farre ſhort of what Chriſt himſelfe
uſed to his <hi>(viz.</hi> Mr <hi>Peters)</hi> brothers, the Scribes and Phariſees, upon the
like occaſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 14. where he ſaith, <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and
Phariſees, Hypocrites; for yee devoure widowes houſes, and for a pretence
make long prayer; therefore yee ſhall receive the greater damnation:</hi> and in

Verſe, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 31, 32, he ſaith, <hi>Wo unto you,
Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites; for ye pay tithe of mint, and aniſe, and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,
and have omitted the weighty matters of the Law, judgment, mercy,
and faith: theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye
blind guids, which ſtrain at a gnat, and ſwallow a camel. Wo unto you, Scribes
and Phariſees, hypocrites; for ye make clean the outſide of the cup, and of the
platter, but within they are full of extortion and exceſſe. Thou blind Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,
cleanſe firſt that which is within the cup and platter, that the out-ſide
of them may be clean alſo. Wo unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites;
for ye are like unto whited ſepulchers, which indeed appear beautifull outward,
but are within full of dead mens bones, and of all uncleanneſſe. Even ſo ye alſo
outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Wo unto you, Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites; becauſe ye build
the tombs of the Prophets, and garniſh the Sepulchers of the righteous, and ſay.
If we had been in the dayes of our Fathers we would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the Prophets. Wherefore ye be witneſſes unto your
ſelves, that ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets. Fill ye up
then the meaſure of your Fathers.</hi> And in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> when the Jews
in their works and actions denyed <hi>Abraham</hi> and God to be their Father,
and yet in words owned them both for their Father, verſe 39. 41.
Chriſt in the 44 verſe, tels them plainly, <hi>Ye are of your father the devill, and
the luſts of your father ye will do: he was a murtherer from the beginning, and
aboade not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him. Wh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But after he had ſufficiently condemned my language in ſpeaking plain
Engliſh, which I ſay, is the whole current of the Scripture to incorrigible
diſſembling men as they are: he again and again proteſted and deſired the
Company to beare Witneſſe, that he in ſaying, there was no Law in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
did not ſpeak the ſence of the Army, but his own proper opinion,
and alſo proteſted, he had no deſign in comming to me, but a bare viſit;
and wondered I would be ſo hot at him for his love; and he was farre
enough from any of their Deſigns: I Replyed to this purpoſe, Mr <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
You know I know you well enough, and I tell you, in a Play, every
Player hath his part, yea even the ſeeming Fool, and many times they Act
with a ſeeming violence, and againſt one another; but they all Center in
this end to get the Spectators money from them; I leave you to make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication:
And I tell you moreover, the laſt year, when the ſtirs began,
when Sir <hi>John Maynard,</hi> and the four Aldermen were priſoners here at the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154041:4"/>
Tower, You came and took up your lodging at Col. <hi>Whits,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of repoſing your ſelfe, and being nigh your buſineſſes, being bound
in all haſte to <hi>New-England</hi> as you ſaid, although you never intended it,
I am confident of it, in the leaſt, but meerly came hither upon a Deſign
finely coloured over, to work a complyance in Sir <hi>John Maynard,</hi> and the
four Aldermen to your great Maſters, that ſo ſeeing the City baffled of
their Liberty, they might come off with as little loſſe of Reputation in
their deliverance as might be; and I believe ſome ſuch thing if not worſe
in the bottom of your viſiting of me at this time: But he Replyed very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
and earneſtly, againe and againe, calling God to witneſſe, he had no
deſign the laſt year upon Sir <hi>John Maynard,</hi> and the Aldermen, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Tower, nor upon me in his comming to viſit me; and told me,
<hi>I need not be ſo paſſionate, there was no feare of the loſſe of my life:</hi> To which
I Replyed, to this effect; Sir, I know you, and your Maſters ſo well, and
that you have ſo couzoned and cheated all Parties and Intereſts that ever
you dealt with, ſo viſibly and evidently, never keeping either faith, promiſe,
or engagements with any of them, longer then it ſerved your preſent
turns; it being beyond a maxime long ſince amongſt ſome of you ſo to
do, that I doe proteſt unto you, both for you and them, I will not believe
one word yee ſay, ſwear, or proteſt, but the more earneſt you or they
are in any of them, the more jealous I will be of you; and therefore
know this for hereafter, that where ever I meet your Maſters, or any
of their under depending tribe, I will be upon my Guard, as though I
were amongſt a company of the arrenteſt cheaters and deceivers in the
world; by whom I hope I ſhall never be cozoned any more with credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and honeſty; for I will never hereafter believe you, though I ſhould
bee glad you would deceive me once againe in doing good to the
poore Nation, for it is eaſily in you power; but I believe you will never
doe it; and for my life, if I were to lay it down to morrow, I would
ſcorn to beg or intreat for it, from any of your Maſters; and if it be in
no danger, it is no thanks to them, for I am confidently perſwaded in my
very heart, it is not mine an hour longer, then they dare take it away, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by hook or crook, but it may prove a choak pear to them, when ever
they goe about it. But Sir, ſaid I, I thought I had been ſafe enough, when
I ſquared my actions by the Rules of thoſe Laws that they have often
ſworn, declared, and promiſed year after year, and month after month to
maintain and defend; and make as the ſtandard or touchſtone betwixt
them and the people, as they have done with the Petition of Right, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I but ſaith he, <hi>I will ſhew you your great miſtake in that particular, and that your ſafety

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154041:5"/>
then where are you?</hi> I but Sir, ſaid I, I cannot take notice of what is in their mindes
to obey that; but the conſtant Declaration of their mindes, (without ever ſo much as
in any one Declaration contradicting it) as that they will maintain the Petition of
RIGHT, and the Liberties therein contained, muſt bee the rule of my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
And the Petition of RIGHT, by reaſon of their conſtant Declarations to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it, I make the rule of my obedience and actings amongſt men, and think I ſhall
be ſafe thereby: but when they ſhall publiquely declare, They ſcorn the Petition of
RIGHT, and will neither maintain that nor any other Laws or compacts amongſt the
men of this Nation, but what flows daily from their wils and pleaſures; I ſhall alter
my minde, and expect no benefit by the Petition of RIGHT; but when that is, let me
tell you, I ſhall rather deſire to live in Turkie under the great Turk, then in <hi>England</hi>
under your Religious Maſters at White-hall and Weſtminſter, for there is no ſuch Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
or perſecuter in the world, as an Apoſtate, that one turns his back of Juſtice, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and truth: But Mr. <hi>Peter,</hi> as for things at preſent, tell your Maſters from me,
That if it were poſſible for me now to chuſe, I had rather chuſe to live ſeven years under
old King <hi>Charls</hi> his government, (nothwithſtanding their beheading him as a Tyrant
for it) when it was at the worſt before this Parliament, then live one year under their
preſent Government that now rule: nay, let me tell you, If they go on with that tyranny
they are in, they will make Prince <hi>Charl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> have friends enow, not only to cry him up, but
alſo really to fight for him to bring him into his Fathers Throne, that ſo they may have
their juſt deſires of perfidious cruel bloody Tyrants, and the people of the Land ſome eaſe
and reſt from their inſupportable burthens and oppreſſions: Yea, and for my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
I muſt aver unto you, I had rather by many degrees chuſe to live under a regulated
and wel-bounded King without tyrannie, then under any Government with Tyranny.
Here is the ſubſtance of my diſcourſe with Mr. PETER, ſaving I pinched him a little
particularly upon his great Maſters large fingering of the Common-wealths money,
which was no better then Theft in them, and State-Robbery in the higheſt, (as I told
him.) <hi>I but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>

beſides, if he have not, what need he, when his Father-in-law gets ſo much for them
both, as 3 or 4000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> at one clap; with well-nigh twenty thouſand pounds
worth of wood upon it, if Parliament mens relations may be beleeved: beſides, the
People that know them, know the Father and Son piſs both in one gullie; though they
ſeem ſomtime to go one againſt another, yet it is but that they may the more eaſily and
throughly drive on the main deſign of them both: viz. <hi>To make the People ſlaves.</hi>
And ſo farewell Mr. <hi>Peter.</hi>
