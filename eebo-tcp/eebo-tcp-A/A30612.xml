         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Landgrave of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father

in a better age.</p>
            <p>The Landgrave moved with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by ſo long and laſting a vertue, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this illuſtrious old man worthy of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
eurioſity, and did him the honor to viſit
him at <hi>Mentz;</hi> by miſhap the gout ſeiſed
on him the next day after his arrival,
which although it uſed to treat him
gently, it being rather indeed a forced
repoſe then a true grief, yet was he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to receive it like a ſick perſon, and
to keep his bed ſo long as it laſted. This
Fit retained him longer then he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
in a place where he could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
have been tired; which gave
us alſo the means the better to conſider
him.</p>
            <p>Being a Prince who loved learning,
he employed his ſpare hours, and the
intervals of his grief, either in reading
good Books, or converſing with ſuch
learned men who beſt underſtood them.
There was then one with his Highneſs
whom he particularly eſteemed, and
<pb facs="tcp:55953:3"/>
who in effect was no ordinary perſon,
whom he uſually called HIS ARISTIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUS,
and ſometimes his LEARNED
WISE-MAN, to explicate that name of
<hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> which he had given him.</p>
            <p>He was a Gentleman of an exquiſite
Judgment and of a conſummate Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the Catholick Religion, a
French man by birth, and originally
from Germany, of Fity five years of
age or thereabouts: He had the gift
to pleaſe, and was learned in the Art
of perſwading. Beſides he knew both
the old and the new Court; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obſerved in divers Journeys which
he had made, the manners and natural
inclination of Princes and of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
there was to be found hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in him a treaſure of the things
of our time, beſide other knowledges,
which he had drawn from Antiquity,
and aquired by Meditation.</p>
            <p>I was ſo happy as at firſt ſight to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
a friendſhip with him; he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to the Landgrave, and gave a
good Character of me to his whole
<pb facs="tcp:55953:4"/>
Court, he gained alſo his Highneſs good
liking that I ſhould aſſiſt at thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
which they had after their
repaſts. At his coming out of <hi>Germany</hi>
they had choſen <hi>Corn. Tacitus</hi> to be the
Companion of their travels, nor were
they ill accompanied; he had diverted
them at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and on the way, and
when they were arrived at <hi>Metz</hi> they
were at the beginning of <hi>Veſpaſians</hi>
Reign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> was Reader, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter;
after having read, he made
reflections on the things read ſomtimes
in few words, and with light touches
on them, and ſometimes making ſtops
and diſcourſes at length, as either the
matter required, or as the Landgrave
exacted it from him. It was a pleaſure
to hear a Philoſopher diſcourſe of the
Court; and if that Sophiſter who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
himſelf ridiculous before <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
had not ſpoken worſe concerning
War, I cannot fancy that <hi>Hannibal</hi>
would ever have ſcorned him.</p>
            <p>Publick Affairs are often foul and full
of ordure, whereby with the leaſt touch
<pb facs="tcp:55953:4"/>
a man contaminates himſelf, but the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
is more honeſt then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of them; that's performed
with innocency and purity: the Pictures
of Dragons and Crocodiles having no
venome which offends the ſight, may
have colours which rejoyce the eyes.
And I muſt confeſs, the world which
in it ſelf ſo much diſguſts me, would in
the converſation of <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> ſeem to
be delightful and full of divertiſement.</p>
            <p>In this rich and learned converſation,
as in a Tower neighboring Heaven, and
built on the ſhore, we ſecurely regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the agitations and tempeſts of the
world. We were ſpectators of all the
parts which were acted through <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:
Ariſtippus</hi> formed arguments of
thoſe which were yet to be acted, &amp; his
acquired as well as natural prudence,
which knew all both the paſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
taught us alſo ſome new things for
the future. He had chain'd me to his
tongue from the beginning to the end
of his Entertainment, and I heard him
with an attention ſo little diverted, that
<pb facs="tcp:55953:5"/>
not the leaſt word of his eſcaped me;
but to make way for what he was to
ſpeak the next day, retiring my ſelf into
my Chamber, in the evening I wrote
down the Diſcourſes of the afternoon,
and diſcharged my ſelf on the paper <hi>of
a burthen of Pearls and Diamonds,</hi> as
honeſt Monſieur <hi>de Coeffeteau,</hi> to whom
I the next morning uſed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
them, was wont to call them.</p>
            <p>At that time I had as much reaſon
to commend the fidelity of my Memory
as I have now cauſe to complain of the
treacheries wherewith it now afflicts
me. <hi>Senecae</hi> the Father tells us of the
wonders of his, in the Preface to his
Controverſies; I dare not go ſo far as
he, nor will I prefer any thing of mine,
which ſents of the Mounteback. But
its very true that the ſame year theſe
converſations of <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
having heard a Sermon of two
hours long, after my return from Church
I wrote it entirely out, without indeed
ſubjecting my ſelf ſcrupulouſly to the
words, neither did I loſe the leaſt part
<pb facs="tcp:55953:5"/>
of the ſubſtance of the things.</p>
            <p>There are witneſſes ſtill alive of
what I ſay. I can name ſome of eminent
quality, who are full of life. Nor need
any man think it ſtrange, that after ſuch
an effort of Memory, which was then
thought no ſmall matter, I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
ſeven Diſcourſes of a mean ſize
which <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> made in ſeven days
one after another. One line of <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
Hiſtory ſerved him for a Text to
begin, and the Landgraves entreaties
obliged him not to leave off in haſte.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak of the merit of the Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
I think it nothing neceſſary; Nor
will I alleadge the approbation they
have had both on this and on that ſide
of the Mountains. It will ſuffice to
ſay that they have been read by thoſe
who correct Edicts and Ordinances.
and that the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> having
carried them with him into <hi>Italy,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
them to me at <hi>Paris</hi> as he came
from that fatal voyage of <hi>Lyons;</hi> nor
was this performed only with very civil
words, but with moſt obliging notes;
<pb facs="tcp:55953:6"/>
wherewith he had marked the Margent
of the Manuſcript: <hi>This pleaſeth me; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could have been ſaid more prettily.
This may be called excellent. I know
whom he means,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe kind of marks which he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
made on the compoſitions of
other men, were well known to thoſe
who ſaw him in his privacies, and
who are admitted into his Cabinet,
during his hours of leiſure and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement.
So that his Eminency had ſo
much goodneſs as not to take to himſelf
any thing thats to be read in theſe ſeven
Diſcourſes. He diſtinguiſhed times and
places, and did me the favor to conſider,
That when <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> ſpoke at <hi>Metz,</hi>
himſelf at that time was but Biſhop of
<hi>Lucon,</hi> and that Monſieur <hi>Luynes</hi> was
not as yet Conſtable of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUt it's not a time to relate the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of Diſcourſes, ſince they
are not yet finiſhed, and that they are
yet to make another voyage to the
<pb facs="tcp:55953:6"/>
furtheſt parts of the North. Nor
ought their Elogy to be drawn from
the Teſtimonies rendred them in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Italy.</hi> They muſt expect the
judgement of the QUEEN in <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
to whom I ſend them; Being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
to the height ſhe is, ſhe will
better know them by their appearance
then by the relation of others, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing
that ſhe deſires them, it's
more fit at firſt to content her curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then to tire her patience with a
long Preface.</p>
            <p>Let's not uſe ſo much artifice in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
this Preſent of ours, and let's
bring <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> to appear before her
as ſoon as poſſible: Let's not offend
our ſelves with the uſeleſsneſs of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,
which moſt commonly embraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
what's neceſſary. It ſpends too
much time in Civilities and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in Good Morrows and Good
Evenings. I thought it fit therefore to
cut off all ſuperfluities, and preſent
things pure and ſimple, as I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
them with care amongſt my
<pb facs="tcp:55953:7"/>
papers, after having collected them
with pleaſure from the mouth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtippus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed, It will not be
improper to do even as <hi>Ariſtippus</hi>
would do if he were ſtill in the world,
and were himſelf his own Hiſtorian;
having begun with a name which will
afford felicity to the Book, without
delay let's render it thoſe homages
which are due unto it.</p>
            <p>The vertue of CHRISTINA
deſerves ſomewhat extraordinary;
but the preſent time is too poor for
ſuch an acknowledgment. We muſt
ſeek honors for her in old <hi>Rome,</hi> and
in the Country of Triumphs; and why
ſhould we not in this place renew the
antient cuſtom of acclamations, which
were the triumphs of every day? Theſe
require no pomp, as others do, and their
expence may be made even by Poverty
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore praiſe, let us
<pb facs="tcp:55953:7"/>
bleſs the Daughter of the Great
<hi>Guſtavus,</hi> the Great, the Incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> for the good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
which ſhe gives to ſo wicked
an Age, for having made an end of
War, and for having made a Peace,
for knowing how to reign, and for
her not being ignorant of any thing
which deſerved to be known. It's
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> who hath oppoſed Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm,
who returned, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Muſes who were flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
It's ſhe who Sovereignly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
the Sciences and the Arts.
She ſets a price on the operations of
the Mind. As ſhe receives the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
of all People, ſhe returns Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in all Languages; From whoſe
opinions there is no Appeal, not even
for Poſterity.</p>
            <p>If this be ſo, and that ſhe approve my
Book, either it will be ſure of publick
approbation, or it will not ſtand in
<pb facs="tcp:55953:8"/>
need of it. But we muſt not do that
wrong to the publick to think that it is
capable of a contrary thought to
that of <hi>CHRISTINA.</hi> The
World would never diſpleaſe a perſon
which doth it that honor and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſheth
it ſo much, by contradicting
a perſon ſo ſound in judgment, and
ſo well grounded in Opinion.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T's a ſingular opinion of ſome
Philoſophers, <hi>That a Wiſe man
ſtands not in need of any body;
and whatſoever is ſeparate from
him, is to him of no uſe.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they take away Friendſhip from the
number of neceſſary things, placing it ſimply
amongſt thoſe which are delightful. Yet
others more civil then they, I mean the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
of <hi>Plato's</hi> family, and thoſe of
<hi>Aristotle's,</hi> did believe, that without Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
Felicity were imperfect and deficient,
Vertue weak and impotent. They ſaid,
Friends were the moſt profitable and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55953:9"/>
moſt deſireable of all outward goods: They
conſidered them <hi>not as the ſports and muſings
of a Wiſe man in picture,</hi> but as <hi>the helps and
props of a man of this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is none but God only who can be
fully content in himſelf, of whom we ought
to ſpeak in ſuch high and magnifick terms.
It's he alone, who being rich in his own
eſſence, enjoys a moſt happy ſolitude, which
abounds in all kind of good: He only who
can operate without inſtruments, as he can
act without labor: He who draws forth all
from within his nature; for as much as
things are thence in ſuch a manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
that yet they forbear not to continue
therein. Men on the contrary can neither
live, nor live well; neither be Men, nor
be happy without one another: They are
linked together by a common neceſſity of
Commerce.</p>
               <p>It's not ſufficient for every Particular to
be but One, unleſs he endeavour ſome way
or other to multiply himſelf by the help of
others. And to conſider us all in general, it
ſeems that we are rather ſo many divided
Parts which Society reunites, then ſo many
ſeveral entire Bodies.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are offended, demand juſtice;
the weak ſtand in need of help; and the
afflicted, of conſolation: But all men uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
want Counſel; it's the great Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Civil life; it's hardly leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
then fire and water. And thoſe two
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55953:9"/>
means wherewith Nature hath furniſhed us
for action, relate to this end; <hi>REASON</hi>
and <hi>SPEECH,</hi> which were principally
given us for <hi>CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NSEL.</hi> Beaſts are
carried away by the ſwift impetuoſity of
their natures, and by the preſence of the
firſt object: Men have the conduct of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by Deliberation and by Diſcourſe:
Having the gift to ſeek and to chooſe, they
may inſtantly paſs from the preſent to the
future, and from the firſt to the ſecond,
and ſtop there if they ſo find it fit.</p>
               <p>Pyrates make uſe of Counſel, nor do the
Savages live without it. With far more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is it therefore entertained amongſt Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
people. But every-where wiſe men
muſt borrow it from others, becauſe their
own wiſdom is to be ſuſpected to them in
things which reſpect themſelves. Man is ſo
near himſelf, that he can find no place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both, no free ſpace for to debate the
counſel he would give himſelf: He cannot
hinder thoſe two Reaſons which deliberate
in him, from confounding themſelves in
communication; That which propoſeth,
being too much mixed with that which
concludes.</p>
               <p>He who counſels therefore, muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
perſon diſtinct from him who is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell'd.
There muſt be a proportionable
diſtance betwixt the objects, and thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
which judge of them: And as the
moſt quick-ſighted can never ſee themſelves,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55953:10"/>
ſo the moſt piercing Iudgments want
perſpicuity when it concerns their own
intereſts. What natural knowledge ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have, and what light ſoever
comes down on us from above, yet ought
we not to reject humane means, nor to
deſpiſe this advantage of reaſon, and this
great illuſtration of the truth which is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Conference.</p>
               <p>Let us acknowledge the imperfection of
Man ſevered from Man, and the prevalencie
of Society above Solitude. Since the Friend
of God, and the Conductor of his people,
although a miraculous cloud march'd before
him by day, although a Pillar of fire did the
ſame by night, placing themſelves in the
place where they were to encamp, did not
forbear to take a Guide, to ſerve him in
other difficulties which during the journey
might occur; ſhould any man after this
not ask for a Guide, nor ſeek aſſiſtance?
Who is it that can truſt ſo much to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of his birth? who is it that can
ſo negligently ſleep on thoſe favors which
he expects from heaven, as to imagine that
the aſſiſtance of others is uſeleſs? as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that his fortune alone and his onely
wiſdom are ſufficient for a good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and a good Conduct?</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are raiſed far above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
condition of men, have raiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by ſome degrees. It is not Chance
which caſt them above others; nor is it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55953:10"/>
their own Vertue which hath done all:
They often meet with the ſervices of ſome
one perſon, amongſt the wonders of their
lives. And it's viſible through the courſe of
all Ages, that thoſe Princes who have gotten
moſt, are thoſe who have been the beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded.
Of ſo many Examples, a crowd
of which are to be found in Hiſtory, I ſhall
only make choice of that on which we
yeſterday diſcourſed, and which oblig'd his
Highneſs for this day to make me ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VEſpaſian</hi> had lived under the Tyranny
of <hi>Nero,</hi> and had ſaved himſelf from
his hands by miracle: But he contented
not himſelf with his own ſafety, after that
Monſter was dead; He took heart and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
greater matters for the publick
good. Obſerving that there were other <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's</hi>
which threatned the World, and that
new Monſters unchain'd themſelves, he
hazarded himſelf to preſerve the World,
by ſeiſing on the Empire: He embraced
the Protection of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> the
glory whereof was almoſt all fallen, either
by the ſword, or by poiſon, and the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which was left was daily exhauſted
to fill Iſlands and Dungeons. He had ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
there, at his good will and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
He had ſeen all the laſt Lights of
the Senate extinguiſhed, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
periſh before his face, but for the
powerful ſollicitations, and the vigorous
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55953:11"/>
purſuits of <hi>Mutius,</hi> who as it were by force
plac'd the Crowe on his head, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
of him made him Emperor.</p>
               <p>He at firſt ſtagger'd the mind of <hi>Veſpaſiar.</hi>
which was then fixed on preſent occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
although he approved them not; nor
durſt he be the Author of that Change
which he deſired. And after having caſt
him into an irreſolution, he urged him with
ſo many reaſons, and perſwaded him with
ſo much eloquence, that he at laſt conſtrain'd
him to make an end of the deſign, and to
engage himſelf in the Publick cauſe by an
open Declaration.</p>
               <p>Now it's fit you ſhould know, that <hi>Mutius</hi>
was not a man who engaged in a Party
with fair words only and good wiſhes; but
preſently he fortifies <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> with men
and with money; He acquired him Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
and brought him Legions: He ſpared
not his own perſon; when he thought it fit,
he laid his life at ſtake, and would needs be
the Executor of moſt of thoſe things which
he counſelled.</p>
               <p>Princes which are to be made, cannot be
without ſuch perſons; and Princes already
made, have great uſe of them. There never
was any One ſo ſtrong, who by his own
ſtrength could bear the burthen of the
whole Government: Never was there any
ſo jealous of his Authority, as to be able to
reign alone, and to be indeed <hi>a Monarch,</hi>
to take the word in the rigor of its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55953:11"/>
Neither is it other then a paſtime and
invention of the <hi>Platonians,</hi> to ſlatter Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
and place it above humane condition,
to ſay, <hi>That God endowed Kings with two
ſpirits, that they might govern well. Plato</hi>
often ſports himſelf after this manner; He
philoſophiſeth poetically, and mixeth Fable
with his Theologie. This double ſpirit is of
his conceſſion: And it were better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
it of the Kings ſpirit, and of that of
his Counſellor, then to have recourſe to
Miracles, which muſt never be made uſe of
but in caſe of neceſſity, not even for the
honor and for the glory of Kings.</p>
               <p>It is certain, they have a burden ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable
to the weakneſs of One,
that did they not truſt to the ſupport of
many, they would from the very firſt ſtep
which they took catch but a moſt certain
fall. Did they not call their friends to their
ſuccor, and did they not divide the Globe
of the Earth, they would ſoon be puniſhed
for the temerity of their Ambition, and ſink
under the weight of their own Fortune.
That multitude of Cares which from all
parts aſſaults them, would not afford them
a free reſpiration; The crowd of Affairs
would ſtifle them at the very firſt Audience
they gave.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral degrees of Servants,
which all have a place in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a State. There are Spirits of a mean
capacity, which untangle, which prepare
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55953:12"/>
and diſpoſe affairs: Theſe are fit to begin
the work; they make way, and take away
the difficulties which embroil things. Theſe
Spirits are employed by the Prince for
every day, and he diſchargeth himſelf on
them only of the groſſer functions of his
Royalty.</p>
               <p>There are other Spirits of a higher ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which he may truſt in more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
employments, and afford a more
noble ſhare in his deſigns. Theſe govern
under him and with him; nor are they
evil Pilots in the ſweet ſeaſons, nor on thoſe
ſeas which ſuffer but little agitation.</p>
               <p>But how happy is that Prince, and how
is he lov'd by Heaven, if in his time he meets
with ſpirits of the firſt rank, ſouls equal
with Intelligences in light, in force, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeneſs!
Men whom God creates expreſly,
and whom he extraordinarily ſends to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
or force the evils of their Ages, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor
to calm the ſtorms of their Countries!</p>
               <p>They are the Tutelar Angels of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and the Familiar ſpirits of Kings:
They are the Seconds to the <hi>Alexanders</hi> and
to the <hi>Caeſars;</hi> They eaſe the Prince in all
his toils; They with him partake ſaving
Diſquiets, without which there would be
no Tranquility in the World. If in the
States wherein we live there are ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
let us bleſs their Watchings, which
are ſo neceſſary to the Publick Repoſe, under
whoſe protection we ſleep ſecurely and at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55953:12"/>
eaſe. Theſe excellent Watches, are they not
the cauſe (my Lord) for which the Grecian
Poe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s gave the Night the name of <hi>Wiſe</hi> and
<hi>Counſellor?</hi> For ſo I fancie it; and the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians
do ſomtimes give the Poets further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetch'd
explications.</p>
               <p>The Poets, Your Highneſs knows it better
then I, were the firſt antient Preceptors of
Humane kind; they taught them the firſt
Principles of Policie and of Morality. Here
then, as elſwhere, they have diſcovered and
pointed out the Truth unto us. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
have ſince diſplaid it, and brought
it to its full light. Having acknowledged
this neceſſity of Society, and the defects
which accompany Solitude; beſides their
<hi>Jupiter the Counſellor,</hi> and their <hi>Minerva
the Counſellor,</hi> beſides the Gods and Demons
who alwayes went in company of their
Hero's, they have yet beſides that given
them Men to aſſiſt them in their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
or other Hero's to undertake and
act with them. Whilſt <hi>Hercules</hi> cuts off
the heads of the <hi>Hydra, Iolas</hi> applies fire
to it, to hinder them from ſpringing up
again. <hi>Diomedes</hi> doth nothing without <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes.
Agamemnon's</hi> actions ariſe from the
counſels of <hi>Neſtor:</hi> And this Prince being
to make a wiſh which might comprehend
all others, deſires neither more powerful
forces then his own, nor that wealth he had
not, nor the deſtruction of the Empire of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> nor the greatening of that of <hi>Greece,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55953:13"/>
but only Ten men which were like unto Neſtor,
Agamemnon</hi> ſhewing us thereby, That the
fear he was in to loſe <hi>Neſtor,</hi> in reſpect of
his extreme age, made him apprehend he
ſhould want men to ſubſtitute in his place.
And <hi>Homer</hi> makes it appear, That one <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi>
may ſometimes be found in an Age; but
that ten <hi>Neſtors</hi> are only to be wiſhed.</p>
               <p>This wiſh did nothing wrong the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of <hi>Agamemnon; Greece</hi> never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
him for having ſuffered himſelf
to be governed by <hi>Nestor;</hi> Nor was the
King of Kings eſteemed for that leſs wiſe
or leſs worthy of the Soveraign authority.
On the contrary, it is an Axiom in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
which paſſeth for the Propoſition of
an eternal truth, and is as old as Policie
it ſelf; THAT AN UNABLE PRINCE
CAN NEITHER BE WELL COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELL'D
NOR WELL SERV'D.</p>
               <p>If to receive Counſel, preſuppoſeth ſome
advantage to him who gives it; the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
(on the other ſide) of him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it, forbears not to have its merit: He
in his turn is the Superior; He retakes the
firſt place, when he ſets his hand to the
work, and when by the execution of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated
things he changeth Rules into
Examples, and fair words into good effects.
For although it hath been ſometimes ſaid in
<hi>Rome,</hi> That <hi>Lelius was the Poet, and that
Seipio was the Actor;</hi> And that it ſhould be
true, That he who compoſeth Verſes, act
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55953:13"/>
more nobly then he who recites them; yet
is it not therefore true, That that perſon
who executeth glorious undertakings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
a leſs relevated operation then he
who only counſels them. The Counſellor
preſerves his advantage but during the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of things, but loſeth it in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent;
and even in the commencement of
them he hath it not entirely: Nor doth he
who is counſell'd remain uſeleſs and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
motion, during that time the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
action laſts.</p>
               <p>Nature ſeems to prove what we ſay, and
hath form'd I know not what lineaments in
the ſoul of man: where the Intellect, which
we call the Patient, which is the ſeat of
Learning, although it be enlightned by the
light of the Intellect-Agent, yet ſuffers not
in that manner, but that it acts alſo of it ſelf.
It judgeth of the Knowledge which it hath
received; it revolves, it removes, it diſplays,
it diſperſeth in it ſelf this Knowledge: After
having compared it with others, it from
thence recollects conſequences and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
And ſo we may ſay, it works in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and if it ſuffer, it's with the faireſt
kind of paſſion, which neither ſpoils nor
corrupts, as that of a Wound or Burn;
but finiſheth and perfects, as that of Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in the Air, and of the Reception of
Images in the Eyes.</p>
               <p>Let us ſpeak leſs ſubtilly, and in a more
popular phraſe; Let us conclude, that it's
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55953:14"/>
neceſſary to have hands, that one may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
make uſe of tools; and to have Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to uſe as one ought that of another
man's. Wiſdom it ſelf is irreſolute and but
little aſſured, when ſhe wants approbation,
and is reduced to her own teſtimony. A
concerted Reaſoning deſpoils us not at all
of the firſt apprehenſion we have of the
truth of things. And our <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hereupon
tells us, <hi>That Salt doth not at all harm Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh;
and that Oil ſeaſons Olives.</hi> A ſtupid
and intereſſed Courtier puts affairs in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
and ruines in ſtead of building up.
But a wiſe and faithful Miniſter, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
divides his affection between the
King and the State, renders the greateſt
ſervices to both of them, and with reaſon
according to my opinion may call himſelf
<hi>The Temperament of the power of One, and
the Common good of the Republick.</hi> But my
particular opinion were ſlight, nor would
it have force ſufficient to form and conclude
this Diſcourſe, did I not confirm it by the
acknowledgments of the Publick towards
perſons ſo uſeful to the general good of the
world, and by thoſe reſplendent proofs of
affection and eſteem which Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have rendred to the wiſdom and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of their Miniſters.</p>
               <p>I omit <hi>Greece,</hi> where they have reigned
with their Kings: I forbear <hi>Perſia,</hi> where
their Kings rul'd by them, and where they
were called <hi>The Kings eyes;</hi> That is to ſay,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55953:14"/>
as an excellent perſon explicates it, The
Kings eyes which are always open and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
watching for the Kingdoms ſafety,
which at one and the ſame time look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
backwards, to the right and to the
left.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only inſiſt on <hi>Rome;</hi> where the
Emperors, to correct that bitterneſs which
is to be found in the words of <hi>Servitude</hi> and
<hi>Subjection,</hi> have honored ſuch like Servants
with the title of <hi>Friends;</hi> They have call'd
them <hi>their Companions;</hi> ſometimes, <hi>the
Companions of their cares, the Companions
of their wars and of their victories.</hi> And
even thought fit that the People ſhould call
them ſo.</p>
               <p>They have cauſed Statues to be erected
to them near their own; They have made
them depoſitories of their ſwords, with
permiſſion to uſe them againſt themſelves,

               <p>The Inſcription is ſingular, and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Princes Father nothing common,
at that time when the ſeat of the Empire
had not yet been transferred from <hi>Rome</hi> to

Thoſe jeering Verſes particularly touch at

of the place of the Roman Eagles, and that
then the Emperors were become dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
of the Faith, and members of the
Church, of ſtrangers and of perſecutors
which they were before; I thought they
might have borrowed that term from the
Holy Writ, and from the diſcourſe of the

               </p>
               <p>That great Miniſter glorifies himſelf in

HIM FOR A FATHER TO PHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAOH,
(although perhaps he was younger
than he) THAT HE WAS ESTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLISH'D
PRINCE OVER ALL
THE ROYAL FAMILY, AND
LORD OF ALL THE COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRY
OF EGYPT. And the ſame
ſacred Hiſtory tells us a little before, That
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> took off his ring from his finger,
and put it on <hi>Joſeph's;</hi> That he cauſed him
to ride in a Triumphal chariot; That he
commanded by a publick cry, That all the

               <p>Nothing can be added to ſo illuſtrious a

And it is but a commenc'd good, unleſs it

                  <hi>LET YOUR PEOPLE BE
YOUR FAVORITE,</hi> was Advice
formerly given to a great Prince, but by a
Philoſopher ſomwhat too ſevere. To deny
Kings the ſweeteſt uſe of their Wills, and
to deſpoil them of the moſt humane of the
Paſſions, were to be the Tyrant of Kings,
and not ſuffer them to be Men: It were to
tie them to the greatneſs of their condition,
and to nail them to their Thrones. What a
ſeverity were it, that we would never have
them appear in a ſhape like ours? that they
ſhould never diveſt themſelves of that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
which incommodates them? Is it a
crime to have a Confident, in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
a man may after labor ſeek repoſe,
and divertiſement after buſineſs?</p>
               <p>Vertue is not ſo auſtere, nor ſo ſavage:
ſhe deſtroys not Nature, ſhe only corrects
its imperfection: ſhe knows how to render
Juſtice, but ſhe alſo knows how to do an
act of Grace. In Charity ſhe affords a place
to whomſoever; the Stranger is received
there as a Gueſt, and the <hi>Barbarian</hi> as well
as a <hi>Grecian:</hi> But ſhe reſerves Friendſhip
for a ſmall number; ſhe eſpouſeth not all
ſhe embraceth.</p>
               <p>In Heaven, where the Idea's and the firſt
forms of things are to be found, are there
not beneficent Aſpects and favorable Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
rather towards theſe, then thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whence there are born on Earth the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate
and the Elect? Was there not a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55953:17"/>
choſen People which was preferr'd before
all other Nations; which was called <hi>The
portion and the inheritance of the Lord?</hi>
The Lord told them, I WILL BE
THY GOD, AND THOU SHALT
BE MY PEOPLE. In the family of
the Patriarchs, this preference was ever
found on one ſide, whilſt all the reſt were
excluded? The Cadets carried away the
right of Elder brothers; and the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Nature gave place to the Decrees
of God.</p>
               <p>And when the Son of God himſelf came
into the world, beſides the Seventy two
Diſciples who were of his train, and who
had devoted themſelves unto him, he call'd
Twelve Apoſtles, to render him a more
particular ſubjection, and be neareſt to his
perſon. Even amongſt thoſe, there were
Three to whom he declared himſelf more
familiarly then to the reſt: He ſhewed them
thoſe marks of his Divinity, which he hid
from their companions; He communicated
many ſecrets of the future, during the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his approaching death, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the diſquiets of his laſt thoughts.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, he witneſſed more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for one of the three, then for the two
others. <hi>S. John</hi> without difficulty calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the Beloved and the Favorite of his
Maſter: He every-where glorifies himſelf
of that favor; And methinks he uſed it
with liberty enough, whenas he ſlept in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55953:18"/>
the boſom of ſo great and dreadful a Maſter.
Conſider him but in the Picture of the Holy
Supper, and ſee how he careleſly reſts his
head on a place whereto the Seraphins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
their looks with devotion.</p>
               <p>Since the Author and Conſummator
therefore of Vertue as well as of Faith, hath
had his Inclinations and his Friendſhips,
and would not always command Nature;
A Prince ought not fear to love after an
Example of ſuch Authority which yields
him a full permiſſion; And by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of a more wiſe Philoſophy then was
that of <hi>Zeno</hi> or of <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> he may be
ſenſible, without being call'd Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>The motions of his Soul need only be
juſt and well regulated. Let him do good,
but let him obſerve a proportion and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in the diſtribution of the good he
doth. Let him not preſently thruſt into
his Council thoſe whoſe converſation was
grateful to him: We ought to make a
difference betwixt perſons which delight
us, and thoſe which are profitable to us;
betwixt the recreations of the Mind, and
the neceſſities of a State. And if he take
not an eſpecial care in the examen of the
different Subjects he imployes, he will
make Equivokes for which his Age will
ſuffer, and which will be reproch'd him
by the Ages to come.</p>

which takes a pleaſure to do ſtrange things;
To aſtoniſh the world by Prodigies, To

               <p>Is it not on the contrary a ſerious and
deliberate error, a cheat to true fidelity,
done to ones ſelf by ones ſelf, help'd by
the impoſture of Appearance, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diſguiſeth men in ſuch a manner, that

It's certain, that moſt commonly they wear

Occaſion? For, it's ſhe who commonly
offers Servants to Princes; She obligeth
them to take what comes to hand, and what
comes in ſight. Their impatience being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to ſuffer delay, and their ſoftneſs being
an enemy to all manner of trouble; to
ſpare themſelves the tediouſneſs of enquiry,
and the difficulties of choice, they ſet to
work the neareſt Inſtruments, and retain
as it were by cuſtom thoſe whom they
took but by chance.</p>
               <p>To conclude: This Favor which raiſeth
it ſelf to this height without any foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhould it not rather be an effect of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love
and a complaconcie, which no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fufeth

be our honor which we conceive engag'd in
the perfection of our work? Should it not
be a leven of that natural pride hid in the
minds of men, which particularly ſwells
the hearts of Kings, when the maintaining
of a fault which they have committed is in
queſtion, that ſo they might not confeſs that
they can erre.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever this Favor is, it's none of

thoſe monſtrous productions of evil times;
Blind times, times full of darkneſs, unhappy

opinion, was there ever any ſolitary perſon
ſo eſtranged from Court, who was ſo little
intereſſed in the things of this world, who
without diſdain could look on things ſo
disjointed, and ſee the world overturned
after ſuch a manner? Was there ever ſo
calm a Contemplative, who without emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could ſee people of nought wreſt into
their hands the conduct of great States,
and ſeat themſelves at the ſtern, although
they ought only to have been at the oar?
Yet hath this been ſeen, and that often too.
The Conſulare was profan'd more then
once by infamous perſons; And he who
under anothers reign muſt have been hid

of an Army.</p>
               <p>But beſides the <hi>Euſebiuſſes</hi> and the <hi>Eutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piuſſes,</hi>
the Hiſtory of the Empire of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient
wants not many ſuch ſhameful exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
It ſhews us miſerable Eunuchs, who
had only learn'd how to comb women and
how to ſpin, lifted up all at once to be
Heads of the Council and Captains General.
And other more recent Hiſtories produce
ſuch as were Barbers, Tailors, Grooms of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55953:21"/>
the Chamber the evening before, the next
morning chang'd into Chamberlains, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
&amp;c. employed about the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Negotiations and moſt illuſtrious
Offices of their Country. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
our Man can ſay, He who admires
the Court and the Arts of Court, audacious
Ignorance hath often preſided in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of humane things. Although he ſwears
that he hath ſeen rays about the face of
Monſieur the Duke of ***, this falſe light
is but a deception of the ſight and an illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his mind. Fools have often held the
places of Wiſe men; and there was a time
when thoſe who ought to have dictated the
Laws and pronounc'd Oracles, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
write nor read. It was not that their
common ſenſe was the clearer, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſng
imbroil'd in any ſtranger knowledges.
They neither had the goods of Nature, nor
any acquir'd goods: They only had what
commonly follows natural and acquired
goods; I would ſay, a good opinion of
themſelves, accompanied with the deſpiſing
of others. Although it is not the common
courſe to know affairs by revelation, and
that they are to be learn'd by Experience,
unleſs we can outgo Experience by the
ſtrength of Reaſon. They perſwaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that Authority ſupplied all that;
and that immediately after their promotion
God was obliged to endow them with a
ſpirit of well-governing, and to render the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55953:21"/>
Princes election valid by a ſudden illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not ſo to be ordered. It's all
what God hath been pleaſed to do for the
Miniſters of his only Son, of whom we
have ſaid ſomewhat at the beginning of this
Diſcourſe. It's whereby he mocks proud
Philoſophy: He hath confounded humane
Prudence, by taking thoſe new and groſs
ſouls to be the Conſidents of his Secrets,
filling them very full (as an antieut Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſays) becauſe he found them very
empty. He hath taken from their cabins
and from their ſhops, thoſe whom he would
make the Kings and Doctors of Nations.
Other Ignorants muſt never pretend to be
ſo enlightned; Nor that in ſtead of the
Spirit of Prophecie, explicating of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and the gift of Tongues, they ſhould
expect from hence the knowledge of paſt
things, the penetration into things to come,
the light which diſembroils the intrigues of
the Court, the ſcience of making War, and
the dexterity of treating Peace.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they commonly ſucceed very ill
in a Proſeſſion which they never learn'd,
and in the exerciſe whereof they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly
caſt themſelves without the help
of any preparative diſcipline, without any
ground of experience, without knowing ſo
much as the firſt elements of Civil wiſdom.

the burning of one part, and the freezing

run this hazard, and are engaged in this
continual danger; I mean, of loſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and of loſing their Country, even
when they have refin'd their Ignorance by
the Cuſtoms of Court; and that two or
three good ſucceſſes which come from the
pure liberality of God, have made them
have a good opinion of themſelves, and
made them believe they did the good which
they did but receive.</p>
               <p>All their Actions are then out of frame;
they are the falſe Meaſures of a falſe Rule.
In ſtead of knowing where to ſtop at ſuch
a point of Occaſion, ſo much enquired after
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55953:22"/>
by the wiſe, and ſo neceſſary for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting

or after it; either they paſs beyond it,
or they attain it not. To day, out of anger,
they declare a War; To morrow, out of
cowardlineſs, they beg a Peace: They flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the natural Enemies of their Country,
and offend the antient Allies of the Crown.
In <hi>Spain</hi> they would give Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
In <hi>France</hi> they would introduce
the Inquiſition. The Frontiers are naked

               </p>
               <p>But the Elections which they make of
others, are very worthy of that which was
made of them. For an Ambaſſage to <hi>Rome</hi>
they propoſe to the Prince an expert Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of a Troop, who hath ſignaliz'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in divers battels. Upon their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
an old Prodigal is plac'd in the
Exchequer, who in his youth ſpent all he
had, but who ſpeaks admirably well of Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy.
They require the Charge of Chief
Juſtice for a man who is indeed of the Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe,
but renown'd for his little knowledge

               <p>You ſmile, my Lord, and are aſtoniſhed
at the great literature of this man of the
Long-robe. He made many other Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voques,

nothing ungrateful. It was he who thought
<hi>Seneca</hi> was a Doctor of the Canon-Law, and
that in his Book <hi>de Beneficiis</hi> he had fully
handled all matters concerning Benefices.
One *** of that time made him believe
that <hi>Morea</hi> was the <hi>Moors</hi> Country. And
there is nothing more true, then that he
ſought a whole day in his Map for <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi>

               <p>It were a pleaſure to be Learned under

               <p>Theſe underſtand Men and Buſineſs, as
you ſee. After having diſſipated the Revenues
of the State in evil and ridiculous expences,
that they may appear parcimonious, they
ſuffer an important Occaſion to be loſt for
want of Fifty crowns, which they will not
allow for the diſpatch of an Extraordinary
Courier: They expect the day of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

This leſſon being taught them,
they make a Myſtery of every thing; they
expreſs themſelves but by caſts of their eys,
and by motions of their heads: At leaſt
they ſpeak only in the ear, even when they
praiſe their Maſter, and ſay, That he is the

to thoſe who are to execute them, ſo much
are they afraid to diſcover what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
in Council. They attentively hearken
to an Alchymiſt, who promiſeth them
mountains of gold: With open arms they
receive a Baniſh'd perſon, who with eaſe
diſcovers to them the Conqueſt of his own
Country: And truſting on the faith of one
or other, they imbarque themſelves in ſome
great Deſign, and begin a huge War, which
the ſecond day after they are tir'd withall.
They do a thouſand ſuch like things. And
if theſe Examples are not to be found in
this Age, they were certainly in the paſt.

The miſery of the Times, (It's better to

miſery, which hath caus'd Money to
be made of Iron and of Leather, which
hath ſet a value on the vileſt things, hath
alſo brought in requeſt ſuch men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd
them into the Cabinet of Kings;
whither they have drawn along with them
all the ordure of their births, and all the
vitious habits which ſervile minds were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of. For this is one Chapter of their
their Hiſtory, which ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
And it's certain, that their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
never laſted much longer at Court,
then that of the firſt Man's did in the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial
Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>At firſt, although perhaps they were not
born wicked, they did believe they ought
to become ſo, and ſo diſcharg'd themſelves
of their Conſciences, that with leſs encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
they might manage the affairs of
State. Moreover, they thought that Pride
was well becoming their dignity; That
ſhould they appear the ſame they formerly
were, their condition would be nothing
chang'd, and their Civility would replace
them into that Equality whence they had
newly forc'd themſelves with ſo much
trouble. Thus they apprehended not to
fall into hatred, that they might ſhun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
They have made themſelves feared,
being not able to make themſelves reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They eſteemed that there was no way
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55953:24"/>
left to blot out the memory of their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
baſeneſs, but by the preſent object of
their Tyranny; nor could they hinder

but by employing them to weep for
their own miſeries, and complain of their
cruelties.</p>
               <p>With theſe fair Maxims and theſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliges
which I have rough-caſt, they have
govern'd the world; but they govern'd it
after a ſtrange manner: They have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
what they would have maintain'd;
they have broken what they had a deſign
to fix: They have caus'd as many ruines,
as they intended to make eſtabliſhments;
they have ſpoil'd as many things, as they
have undertaken. The falls of Princes, and
the loſs of States, have been the ſucceſſes
of their Adminiſtration. Having ſeiſed on
the Soveraign power, (I conſider them
again in their innocent infirmity) they
have exerciſed it as children do knives,

               <p>It was the opinion which a Roman

nothing; and yet this Nothing
hath been the beginning of Tragedies,
wherein ſo much blood hath been ſhed,
and ſo many heads made ſlie. It's but a
Cloud which paſſeth, and a ſtain in ſome
corner of the Air, which vaniſheth rather
then abides: And yet it's this light Vapor,
it's this almoſt imperceptible Cloud which
raiſeth thoſe fatal Tempeſts which States
are ſenſible of, and which ſhake the very
foundations of the Earth. Yet ſome foer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
have imagin'd, that it was their
Maſters Intereſts which enflam'd all the
World, when it was only their Servants
Paſſions.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> made
moſt ſpecious pretences to juſtifie his Arms
when he came into <hi>Greece,</hi> and but that
his Manifeſts told wonders of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
He wanted neither Pretences nor
Right: He forgot not, that the great King
came only to chaſtiſe the petty Tyrants,
and that he offer'd the People a rich and
plentiful liberty, in ſtead of a poor and
barren ſervitude. He falſified his deſign
ſeveral ways; and yet ſwore, perhaps, that
this deſign was immediately inſpir'd him
from the immortal Gods, and that the
Sun was the primary Author of it. Not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55953:28"/>
withſtanding ſome Manifeſts which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
abroad, and ſome color of Juſtice
and of Religion which he color'd his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
withall; This was the truth of the
buſineſs:</p>
               <p>A Grecian Phyſitian, the Queens Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
having a mind to review the Port
of <hi>Pyreum,</hi> and to cat the figs of <hi>Athens,</hi>
put this fancy of War into his Miſtreſſes
head, and got her to engage her Husband
in the Deſign. So that the King of Kings,
the powerful and redoubted <hi>Xerxes,</hi> raiſed
an Army of Three hundred thouſand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants,
cut the Mountains, dryed up
Rivers, overburthen'd the Sea, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to bring back a Mountebank
into his Country; methinks this gallant
perſon might well have gone the journey
with leſs expence, and with a leſs nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
company.</p>
               <p>But there preſents it ſelf to my memory
(my Lord) another thing which deſerves
to be known, which you will find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ungrateful. It happen'd in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> more then fourſcore
years before the birth of King <hi>Philip;</hi> at
the time of that famous Conſpiracie,
which of one State made two, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Court, the Towns, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Melcagers</hi> Wife, Governor of a
Frontier-town and General of the Cavalry,
who oblig'd her Husband to revolt, and that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55953:29"/>
ſor a very worthy ſubject. The King having
heard of the ſpirit and gallantry of that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he had a mind to ſee her one day pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.
It was nothing difficult for him to
obtain a favor which ſhe eaſily granted to
leſſer great Lords, and to leſs civil perſons
then himſelf: She accuſtom'd not herſelf
to tire the conſtancie of her Lovers, nor to
cauſe any of them to die for deſpair. The
King being come to the place aſſign'd, and
by misfortune finding her to be no ſuch
thing as he had fancied her, he at firſt ſight
witneſs'd his diſguſt, and went away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
with very little ſatisfaction. This af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
was ſo briskly reſented by her who
took it, and who had no ill opinion of her
own merit, that from that very hour ſhe
vowed revenge: And being unable to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it better then by corrupting her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
fidelity, and debauching him from
the ſervice of his Maſter, ſhe to that end im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
all the charms both of her mind and
countenance. She on ſo credulous a ſpirit
made uſe of the moſt ſubtile inventions
which an artificial ſoul is capable of. And
you need not doubt but in the heat of her
revenge ſhe would have had an infinite
many Huſbands, to have engag'd an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of Enemies againſt the King,
and to have demanded ſatisfaction with
more ſwords of the offence which ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
ſhe had received.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Meleager</hi> quit the ſervice of his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55953:29"/>
King, and imbark himſelf in the Party of
a Tyrant, without knowing what motion
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rove him, nor what paſſion he reveng'd.
He acted a perſon he underſtood not; He
was his Wives ſoldier, and thought himſelf
one of the chief Heads of the League. So
eaſie, you ſee, it is for a man to deceive
ſelf in the judgment which he makes of the
actions of men; ſince men themſelves who
act, are themſelves he firſt deceiv'd, the
true cauſe being not always known unto
them. They are often blind inſtruments,
and are without knowledge of the intereſts
or paſſions of another.</p>
               <p>The Speculatives of <hi>Macedonia</hi> forbore
not to publiſh paluſible and ſpecious reaſons
for <hi>Meleagers</hi> revolt. Some ſay, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
which the King caſt on him in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Theſſalian Ambaſſadors, did ſo
deeply ſtrike him to the heart and made ſo
wide a wound, that it could never be cur'd,
That the careſſes and favors which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
ſince that, were uſeleſs plaiſters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to his wounded heart; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of an injury, took from him
the ſenſe of a thouſand benefits. Others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage
the refuſal of an Office he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
for his Son; which indeed was not
given to another, but was ſuppreſs'd, to
keep him from entring into his family.
There were ſome who excuſed this his
change by the love he bore his Country
and his zeal for the antient Religion, which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55953:30"/>
pretence the Tyrant took to make war
with the King. All Hiſtories hereupon
exerciſe their ſubtilities, and were all ſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

ingenious and ſubtile. They ſought the
ſource of this ill, ſome on this ſide, and
ſome on that, and none found it; None
of them ſpoke of <hi>Meleager's</hi> Wives di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which was the onely cauſe of her Huſbands
defection; which indeed was never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
till by the after-age, and long after the
Kings, the Tyrants, and <hi>Meleager's</hi> death.</p>
               <p>THeſe two Inrodes which we have made
into <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> were in our
way, and I dare believe they were nothing
diſpleaſing to Your Highneſs. But I believe
further, That You judge as well as I, that
it's much more fit to divulge Viſions in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
then at the Council; and that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility,
when it's amiſs, is leſs dangerous
when it relates things done, then when
we deliberate what is to be done. And
here, that we may ſay nothing which can
be worſe, It's the cauſe why things are not
done at all.</p>
               <p>The People of <hi>Athens</hi> are too able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the People of <hi>Thebes:</hi> Thoſe plant
their nets ſo high, and theſe flie ſo low,
that they muſt do ſomething extraordinary
to be taken. I ſay moreover, The <hi>Athenians</hi>
ſometimes employ their ſubtilities to make
themſelves believe ſo, and thereby deceive
themſelves. From their falſe. Principles
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55953:30"/>
they muſt neceſſarily draw falſe Concluſions,
and can never negotiate happily, nor ever
bring their Adverſaries about to them,
keeping themſelves always in terms ſo far
from them, and coming ſo little near them,
that they are ſo far from joyning together,
that they cannot ſo much as know one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>It's hard to hear better Orators, or to ſee
Opinions better debated. But you muſt look
for no more: They therein place all their
care and all their induſtry: They make it
ſo much their ſtudy, as if Diſcourſe were
the principal end of Deliberation, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
above Action it ſelf. They had rather
make their Eloquence appear to the ruine
of the State, then to preſerve it without
ſpeaking word. They eſteem it a greater
advantage to bear away the bell in Council
from the reſt of their Companions, then to
beat their Enemies in the field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that
they accompt as nothing the diſgraces of
War, hoping always to have their revenge
at the next Treaty. And yet there they
meet with ſome Mind of ſeel which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of perſwaſion, which will cut what
it cannot untie, and with a firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Negative break all their ſnares and all
their wiles, without troubling it ſelf to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel
them.</p>
               <p>Witneſs that Governor of <hi>Figeac,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a Conference which Queen <hi>Catherine</hi>
held with the Deputies of the King of <hi>Navar</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55953:31"/>
and the <hi>Huguenot</hi> Party; which was to
make them quit, before the time agreed
on, thoſe Places of ſecurity which had been
put into their hands: She had brought from
<hi>Paris</hi> a man almighty in words, to whoſe
Rhetorick nothing till then had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.
He from the beginning makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
admir'd by the Aſſembly: In purſuit
he raiſeth ſweeter paſſions in the hearts of
the Deputies; and after having overcome
their minds, he gains their wills: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
the moſt miſtruſtful had forgotten
the Maſſacre, and would no longer have
any Places of ſecurity: They acquieſced on
the word of the King, and the Treaty was
about to be concluded to the great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Queen; when in a moment
all their labor was loſt, and all her Orators
Eloquence was overthrown, by that brisk
anſwer which the Governor of <hi>Figeac</hi> made.
This Princeſs had addreſs'd herſelf to him
with a triumphing Mine; and having asked
him (rather to crown a thing done, and to
gain applauſe, than that ſhe thought ſhe
wanted his opinion) what he thought of
the Speech he had heard: MADAM, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
he, with a voice ſo ſtrong, that it
broke the Articles of the already half-concluded
Treaty, METHINKS
THIS GENTLEMAN HERE
HATH STUDIED VERY WELL;
BUT NEITHER MY COMPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIONS
NOR MY SELF ARE
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55953:31"/>
OF OPINION TO PAY FOR
HIS STUDY WITH OUR
HEADS.</p>
               <p>Yet this Gentleman, of whom I ſhall
ſpeak in another place, was a very expert
Negotiator, who had in other occaſions
ſucceeded moſt happily; And although he
reign'd in the Art of Well-ſpeaking, yet was
he not of thoſe men who can do nothing
but ſpeak: He made this Science ſerve a
better, and preferr'd not with them the
glories of his Mind before the good of his
Maſters ſervice.</p>
               <p>Our Men in effect are rather Declamators
then Miniſters; rather Sophiſts then Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors.
They are not ſo much offended at
the ill ſucceſs of affairs, as they are pleaſed
with the honor they have gotten for having
well oration'd on every one of the debated
Propoſitions, and for having made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
admir'd by the Deputies and by the
Aſſembly. Their vanity eaſily conſolates
their misfortunes. It's ſufficient for them
to treat on the Deliberative Gender accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the precepts of <hi>Quintilian,</hi> and to
know how to manage things through all
thoſe ways which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth. Theſe
are the bounds of their Ambition: If they
have not ſinn'd againſt the Rules of Art,
they are fully ſatisfied. And therein I find
them like a Phyſitian of <hi>Milan,</hi> whom I
knew at <hi>Padua:</hi> This man being content
with the poſſeſſion of his Science, and (as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55953:32"/>
he ſaid) of the <hi>enjoyment of the Truth,</hi> did
not particularly enquire into Medicine the
Cure of Diſeaſes: Nay, he once boaſted,
That he had kill'd a man with the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Method in the world; <hi>E morto,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>canonicamente, e con tutti gli
ordini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In eaſie buſineſſes they ſow thorns, that
they may reap them. In the leaſt Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
which preſents it ſelf, they raiſe a
thouſand difficulties: They find as many
Expedients, and moſt commonly form no
Reſolution: The very many things which
they ſee in every Subject, taking from
them the liberty of choice; and Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
rendring them poor. They entangle
themſelves in the multitude of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and moſt commonly ſtop at the worſt.
And this is the reaſon: It's becauſe the
worſt is the laſt Endeavor of their already
tired Fancy; and that it having been to
ſeek beyond Common ſenſe, which was
already drawn dry, it ſeems to be more
theirs then the reſt which were drawn
from that publick ſpring, or which they
had taken from Experience.</p>
               <p>At this rate, what a good thing is <hi>That
ſobriety of knowledge and of underſtanding,</hi>
ſo much eſteem'd by the ſacred Scriptures?
Let's confeſs it to the ſhame of Humane
Reaſon, and of the Subtility of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts:
A great Mind being alone, is a
great Inſtrument to commit faults; And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55953:32"/>
if a neceſſary Judgment weigh it not down
and clear it not, to ſubject it to uſe and
accommodate it to example and practice,
doubtleſs its penetrating vivacity would be
far more fit to agitate Metaphyſical Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then to give good Counſel, then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
or to act as one ought. In effect,
humane actions muſt be humanely mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that is to ſay, by poſſible and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
means, in a way which holds from
the Body as well as from the Mind; with
Reaſons which ſometimes fall under ſenſe,
and which do not always abide in the upper
Region of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Refiners who act otherwiſe, are
good to embroil Negotiations, and are
nothing worth to bring affairs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion:
They are excellent Diſorderers to
confound a State, but ill Miniſters to govern
it. They ſucceed in Diſorder, and as the
Spirits of the Air they mingle themſelves
amongſt Thunder; but they have no more
force as ſoon as a Calm appears, the point
which dazeled us being but a light of
Lightening; it's very dangerous to make
uſe of ſuch like addreſs in the variety of
accidents, and in the ſeveral diſtortings of
a civil life.</p>
               <p>But were it a true and continual light
whereby they are guided, were it the Sun
it ſelf which conducted them, it makes not
that they muſt always find the end they ſeek,
and that they muſt arive whither they tend.

thing to bring forth, as it is to conceive;
to execute, as it is to diſcourſe. In Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and in Diſcourſe, it ſeems as if all
laugh'd, and that all would pleaſe us. To a

Mind employed in a delightful Exerciſe,
in the ſearch of what it deſires, and in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving

condition it receives them as the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights

which ſpring from new Opinions, and from
the diſcovery of the Truth, or of ſomewhat
which reſembles it. So long as the Mind
thinks, and ſo long as it reaſons, no body
diſquiets it in the poſſeſſion of its Object:
It maſters Deſigns and Enterpriſes; it runs
after fair Idea's which ſuffer themſelves to

               <p>But neither is this all: It muſt at laſt quit

Then it is that things take a new face, when

a ſlight grimace to ſpoil all the reſemblance,
and to make another thing, even a contrary

               <p>I ſhall leave you, my Lord, to think on
the ſecond part of this Compariſon, and
conclude, That Affairs have days, byaſſes and
poſtures; which are neither to be ſeen nor
obſerv'd but in the affairs themſelves, which
embroil all the draughts and all the notions
which out of it could poſſibly have been
form'd of it. There are certain motions and
certain times which render our own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

prevent them, Diſcourſe cannot ſever them

could never be but by Miracle. In effect,
what are theſe Affairs and theſe Enterpriſes
but bold and magnifick Dreams, which flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Imaginative part, and unprofitably
amuſe Reaſon? What are they but admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Tales, and impoſſible Hiſtories?</p>
               <p>After this manner the Speculatives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Romances in their Counſels, and form
Propoſitions ſomewhat like thoſe of that
Artiſt who was ſo famous in the Hiſtory of
<hi>Alexander:</hi> You know he found <hi>Coloſſuſes</hi>
which were little, and <hi>Pyramides</hi> which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55953:36"/>
were low. He would have made a Statue,
which in one of its hands ſhould have
borne a City, and pour a River out of the
other.</p>
               <p>Theſe men alſo dote magnificently, and
their thoughts are no leſs vaſt nor leſs irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.
There is no proportion of that Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which they conceive, to the Meanneſs
of what is feaſible. Matters are not capable
of their forms; and their Peeces cannot be
acted, becauſe they cannot be fitted for the
Theater; there needs too many Engine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and too many Machines; there are no Actors
in all <hi>Europe</hi> to act ſuch Parts: The repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of them would be difficult to a
King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and yet for ſuch they choſe
the Prince of <hi>Miranda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do not fancie, my Lord, that I intend to
laugh. The firſt journey I made into <hi>Italy,</hi>
I met with one of theſe gallant Spirits, who
propoſed the Conqueſt of <hi>Greece,</hi> and was
but little more powerful then he whom I
but now mentioned. But Your Highneſs may
obſerve, if you pleaſe, by the way, That this
brave Man's Father was a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> and
his Mother of <hi>Florence,</hi> and that they had
taken care he ſhould be bred at the Court
of <hi>Rome.</hi> It's true, they choſe a means very
proportionable to the end, and they did
raiſe a great Enemy againſt the <hi>Great Turk:</hi>
Muſt he not have been confident of a great
many Miracles, to have thought to have
done any thing with ſuch ſmall Forces?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55953:36"/>
Yet muſt I in his favor confeſs the truth;
I never met with ſo fruitful, nor ſo hot a
Fancy as his; There never was ſo quick a
diſcourſe, which ran over more, or which
with more difficulty could return to its
ſource. But this fertility and this capacity
did nothing but furniſh matter to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancie,
and give but the more ſcope
to his fond thoughts: The farther his
Reaſon went, the farther it ſtragled from
his end.</p>
               <p>After a long Conference I had with him,
I knew that the great Deſign, which he
call'd <hi>The Interest of God, and the Buſineſs
of the Virgin Mary;</hi> which he was going
about to ſollicite in the Court of Princes;
had no other foundation but the deſire of
an Intelligence with the <hi>Coſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ues,</hi> the
hope of ſome Revolt in ſome place or
other, the word of a Greek Hermit, and
the Viſion of a Melancholy perſon. Yet
was he, as I at firſt told you, a very good
Wit; There was a great deal of pleaſure
to hear him: And out of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
and <hi>Greece,</hi> about which his extravagancie
rowl'd, he forbore not in other matters
to be wiſe enough. I have heard him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
Oracles, and ſpeak things which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
were Revelations; ſo far did I find
them beyond the common reach of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſpirit. He err'd only in ſubtility; he had
too much of that which lifts up and moves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and too little of that which ſettles and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55953:37"/>
fixeth it ſelf. His very Reaſon was agitated;
He dictated Diſpatches at dinner; He ſlept
with his eyes open: And I ſhall tell you,
my Lord, from one of his Domeſticks who
is yet living, and who commonly lay in my
chamber, That from his open eyes there
commonly iſſued ſuch frightful rays, that
he was often frighted with them, and was
never well accuſtomed to them.</p>
               <p>To a Man of this Temper, the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to govern himſelf well might be given,
as was to one for his health. One muſt tell
him, if he would give the World leave to
ſpeak; <q>Thicken your blood a little, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
your Fire with your Plegme: Make
not uſe of all your Reaſon; Be not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Intelligence, and all Light: Make
your ſelf a Beaſt ſometimes; that is to
ſay, ſtop at the neareſt object; and enjoy
this day, without tormenting your ſelf too
much about to morrow. Suffer not your
mind to be overcharg'd with this infinite
Foreſight, which ſeeks out evils as far
the ends of the Earth, and even to the
laſt of Poſterity; which throws it ſelf ſo
far into the future, that it forgets the
preſent, and forſakes thoſe things which
are, for thoſe which may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Did you never hear ſpeak of the Soul of
that Philoſopher, which commonly went
out of his Body to run races and to take
journies? Once when this wandring Soul
would have return'd as it was w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:55953:37"/>
it found no more a Body in condition to
receive it, his having been aſſaſſinated du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that interval of time it was away. If
<hi>Greece</hi> be not a lyar, this poor Philoſopher
meditated longer then he ought to have
done, and his Meditation coſt him his life.</p>
               <p>But this is the moral ſenſe of the Fable;
which tells us, that if we will live, we muſt
not altogether unlink our ſelves from our
bodies, nor ſeparate our ſelves from matter.
Our Reaſon muſt not eſtrange us from our
own preſent intereſt, and from the buſineſs
in agitation: It muſt not think to flie at all,
and carry all before it; Nor fancie to beat
the <hi>Turk</hi> with words, or conquer the
World with ſubtilities.</p>
               <p>In ſome occaſions let's take a Septentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
ſoul, mixt of more earth then fire;
and let's quit this Oriental ſpirit, whoſe fire
is ſo ſubtile, that it rather ſeems an illuſion
then a truth. Let's miſtruſt the Eloquence
of <hi>Athens,</hi> and the Wiſdom of <hi>Florence;</hi>
ſince this hath been nothing profitable to
thoſe who practiſed it, and her Doctors are
become ſlaves for teaching it. I ſhall go yet
further: what beyond the Mountains is
call'd <hi>The French Fury,</hi> hath more then once

Field and in War; I ſay at <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſay in
the Conclave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the great Buſineſs of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which is the Camp of Policie, which
is the Theatre of Prudence.</p>
               <p>But here is wherewith very much to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55953:38"/>
aſtoniſh the perpetual ſubtility and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Ratiocinations which our Diſtillers of
<hi>Tacitus</hi> his Maxims make. Here are four
words (without more ado) in oppoſition
to all the babble of that inſolent Policie,
which in deſpight of Deſtiny, even to the
excluſion of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> would preſide over
the Government of humane things.</p>
               <p>Prudence it ſelf counſels us, that we
ſhould not always take its Counſels: ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſeth
us, that ſhe meddles not with the
regulating of extremities, nor with the
conduct of Deſpair: ſhe in ſome encounters
diſpenſeth us from thoſe things, which in
others ſhe ordered us. Without offending
her, we may croſs the fields when there is
danger on the right and left, and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an exceſs may not cure us, when other
remedies have ill operated; and caſt our
ſelves into the arms of an Enemy, when
ſhe is no longer able to defend us.</p>
               <p>Thus, as you ſee, with the conſent of
Prudence, one may be Imprudent. And to
this purpoſe it will not be unhandſom for
me to tell Your Highneſs, what one day
happen'd to me as I was in Treaty with a
French Lord, who till then had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
happy, and yet with ſome elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancie
had taken party in an Occaſion
wherein it was neceſſary to hazard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
Being urg'd to conclude and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſolve,
<hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>but if I do it, I ſhall yield much
to Fortune.</hi> I could not avoid anſwering
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55953:38"/>
him, <hi>You owe as much (Sir) to Fortune, you
have receiv'd as much from her: You cannot
therefore give her much, you can only return
her ſomwhat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, as Fortune commonly goes
where ſhe uſeth to go, and will not loſe her
firſt benefits; ſo ſhe will alſo have thoſe ſhe
favors confide in her, ſhe will have them
make ſome advance, and not demand a
reaſon of her for all ſhe doth. A man muſt
not always be ſo regular and ſo methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
A man muſt be bold, to be happy:
But it is not properly thoſe whom we ſpeak
of to day, who want courage and boldneſs.
We may look on thoſe wiſe timerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in our next Conference, wherein I ſhall
endeavor out of my memory to deſign their
Picture; Your Highneſs hath ſo ordered me
to do, ſince you oblig'd me abſolutely to
remember all what I moſt willingly would

               <head>THE FIFTH
DISCOURSE.</head>
               <p>THE Court hath been govern'd by
another kind of Men; and there
are ſtill ſome of them to this day.
The People call them Wiſe men:
And in effect they want neither Senſe nor
Experience; They know the Nature of
Affairs, and the Poſſibility of every thing.
But commonly their Knowledge remains
hid in their mind, and produceth but a vain
and idle Contemplation, which is fertile
only in barren thoughts. It's a Vertue
which finiſheth in itſelf; It's a Power which
is never reduc'd into Act: whether it be
that they feel themſelves not ſtrong enough
to undertake the good which they ſee, and
that their eyes are better then their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or whether their advantage being more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the preſent, they prefer it before a
good which is not yet.</p>
               <p>Howſoever it be, They adviſe themſelves,
rather then counſel their Maſter; They
anſwer his ſentiments, and not his demands.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55953:39"/>
And if they fear the rigor of the Times, or
the incommodity of the Ways, they would
decline propoſing him a journey in <hi>January,</hi>
or perſwading him to paſs the <hi>Alps,</hi> if their
buſineſs lay at <hi>Paris.</hi> Their advice iſſues all
from the inferior part; they are all terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial
and material: Intereſt always carries
it with them beyond Honor or Reaſon. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſible of no more powerful temptation
in their ſouls then that of Gain, they ground
their opinions on the ſame baſeneſs and on
the ſame conſiderations that a Farmer or
a Receiver would do, were he but ſeated in
the ſame place.</p>
               <p>Let the Ship which carries them periſh,
if it will, and let the Publick run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard;
They eaſily comfort themſelves for
the ſhipwrack of the State, ſo as there
be but a Skiff in which they may but gain
the ſhore and ſecure their own family. We
ſhould very much deceive our ſelves, if we
took them for thoſe violent Zealots, <hi>who
would be Anathema's for their Brethren,</hi> and
who earneſtly deſire <hi>to be blotted out of the
Book of life,</hi> ſo as thoſe of their own Nation
were pardon'd.</p>
               <p>Yet a man cannot abſolutely ſay, that
they have ill deſigns againſt the State, and
that they deſire its ruine: They reſerve only
to themſelves their firſt and moſt tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
Excepting their own Intereſt, I
believe their Maſters would be very dear
unto them. But the miſchief is, that they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55953:40"/>
are never without their Intereſt, no more
then from themſelves; They find it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they caſt their eyes: Their particular
Profit preſents it ſelf every where, as his
own ſhape did to that Antient ſick perſon,
who perpetually had it before him. They
cannot divide themſelves from Buſineſs, to
look on it with the leaſt freedom of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
They cannot extract out of their
ſoul their Reaſon ſimple and pure, without
mixing it with their paſſions. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they diſcover a Conſpiracie which
is hatching, yet they oppoſe it not, for ſeat
of offending the Conſpirators, and to leave
their Children ſuch powerful Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They have not courage enough to utter a
bold Truth, if it be never ſo little danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in reſpect of the eſtabliſhment of their
fortune, although moſt important to their
Maſters ſervice.</p>
               <p>A wretched and miſerable Prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They conſider not, that a Spy who gives
advice, is not more miſchievous then a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel
who ſays nothing; And that they are
as well the cauſe of the Princes loſs by their
ſilence, as the others by their treachery.
They conſider not, that leaving him to that
danger whence they could withdraw him,
they do no leſs contribute to his ruine then
thoſe who drive and precipitate him into
it. They perceive not, that Infidelity do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:55953:40"/>
This being ſo, my Lord, Is it not of them
the Spirit of God would ſpeak in <hi>chap.</hi> 22.
of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> when it placeth the
<hi>Timerous</hi> in the number of Poiſoners and
Aſſaſſinates, and other execrable men, when
it condemns them all to the ſecond death,
to that death which is ſo ſtrange and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to that <hi>lake burning with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not the true intention of the
Holy Ghoſt, and will not aſſure you that
they are compriſed under that rigorous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
But yet I very well perceive, that
they are the laſt and the worſt of all Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;
and that it is not ſo ſhameful to flie in
a Battel, as to give a timerous Counſel. For
at the leaſt, if we fall into misfortune in
war, a man may excuſe himſelf either from
the diſadvantage of the Place, or from the
number of the Enemies, or lay the fault
on his own Men; and as Duſt, the Wind
and the Sun merit the glories of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
ſo alſo are they guilty of the loſs of
the Vanquiſh'd. At worſt, a man juſtifies
himſelf by accuſing Fortune, which in all
Ages hath been eſteemed the Miſtreſs of
Event, and the Soveraign Arbiter of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo with Politick Aſſemblies,
whereinto this blind Power is not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
where the Mind acts freely and without
conſtraint; where Prudence quietly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth
its operations, and finds none of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55953:41"/>
thoſe obſtacles and impediments which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves to the effects of valor. For
which cauſe, all the excuſes of Soldiers and
of Captains have no place amongſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
and Miniſters. A wiſe man cannot
warrant ſucceſs; but he ought to anſwer
for his Intentions and for his Advice.</p>
               <p>There's therefore no baſeneſs like to that
which begins at our Chamber, and removes
not ſimply by the approaches and preſence
of Danger, but which cannot endure the
onely imagination of it, but which ſhakes
at the leaſt mention made of it. And to
ſpeak truth, It muſt needs proceed from
the entire annihilation of that liberty which
is born with Man, and from the laſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of that Principle of Generoſity, and
of that ſenſe of Honor which we all have;
ſince it's the cauſe we even deny to own or
to conſent to the Truth, ſeeing in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
a Man is not ſo much as capable of
the propoſition of a difficult Good. There
is no way left to obtain ſo much from them,
as to ſet a good face on it, even in a place of
ſecurity, to do ſo much as declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
without danger, for the good of their
Country; to diſpute their Rights in a chair,
and ſerve but for its tongue. A ſtrange thing
They would rather accept of Servitude,
under the title of Peace, then to reſolve
on a Defence which were to be effected
with the arms and the blood of other Men.</p>
               <p>We may alſo obſerve ſome Men, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55953:41"/>
till ill Fortune be arriv'd, that they
may be aſtoniſh'd at it: They have a bold
ſpirit, although they have a timorous ſoul.
Theſe Men ſpeak high, when there is Time
and Ground enough betwixt them and the
Danger. <hi>Cicero</hi> was after this manner cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious:
Never did the leaſt word eſcape
him, which was not worthy of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Commonwealth. He at leaſt
was valiant in the Senate; and he, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
proteſts in ſome of his Letters,
<hi>That had he been invited to the Feaſt of
the Ides of March, he ſhould have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such a Citizen is not fit to fight a Duel;
He would not willingly in his doublet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himſelf amongſt Musket-ſhot. He takes
more care then other Men for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his life, becauſe he eſteems it worth
more then theirs, and that it's nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom
to fear the loſs of a thing ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.
He fears Death, or, to ſpeak more
civilly, Nature fears it in him; but he fears
neither Envy nor Hatred; but he equally
deſpiſeth the threats of Great men, and the
murmure of the People. If his Forces are
not ſufficient to throw down Tyranny, he
makes uſe of his voice and of his breath to
ſtir up others to the recovery of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
He at leaſt calls Men to Arms as loud
as he can, and contradicts Ill, if he cannot
reſiſt it. All his opinions flie high for the
Greatneſs and Glory of his Maſter. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55953:42"/>
enmity with all the enemies of the
State: Diſgrace and Poverty are nothing
grievous, when he ſuffers them for a good
cauſe; And Death it ſelf, if it ſurpriſe him
not, and gives him but time to conſider i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
well, he at laſt reſolves to receive it like an
honeſt man, and puts on valor out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity:
By a long and ſerious meditation
he forms to himſelf an acquired Courage
which is no leſs ſtaid then the natural.</p>
               <p>Our Prudent perſons arrive not at this
height. Beſides Death, they admit of ſo
many other kinds of extremity, that they
ſtill meet with ſome one or other which
ſtops them the very firſt ſtep they make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Good. They deſpair, before they
ought ſo much as to be afraid: They have
always very great motives and very ſtrong
conſiderations, very important cauſes,
(theſe are the terms which they uſe) that
thereby they may avoid the performance
of their duty. And becauſe there is no
Maxim in Policie, which is not combated by
another Maxim as certain and as probable
as that, and that the Future hath as many
ſhapes and faces as our imagination can
fancie; They turn it about to look upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
only on that ſide which terrifies them, and
ſo with Reaſon defend themſelves againſt
Reaſon. They always conſider, that the
actions of men are expoſed to many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences;
and never conſider, that all
the ill which may happen, happens not:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55953:42"/>
whether it be that God by his grace diverts
it, or that we by our addreſs ſhun it, or
whether the imprudence of the contrary
party breaks the blow; it being moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that our faults often caſt us into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
from whence thoſe of our Enemies
withdraw us. But they taking things at
worſt, and preſuppoſing as certain all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul
accidents, they regulate their deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as if they neceſſarily were all to happen,
and commonly act not at all, becauſe they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain would act but too ſecurely. Or perhaps
they do not dive ſo deep into buſineſs; and
very ſeldom it is they bring them to the laſt
point: They content themſelves with a light
mediocrity of ſucceſs, and with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of good hap; they dare not promiſe
themſelves the continuation of them to the
end in the leaſt thing: So that with this their
cold and heavy wiſdom they may defer the
fall, but they cannot eſcape it; they ſhore up
the ruines which they are not able to rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate:
They at moſt gain but ſome days, or
weeks, and keep their affairs in hand till
ſome who are more bold operate on them
more efficaciouſly. It's an obſervation of
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That as the vivacity of <hi>Alcibiades</hi>
his mind became extravagant towards his
children, the ſolidity of <hi>Phocion's</hi> chang'd
into matter of weight when it deſcended
from him to his race. But let's ſay more
then <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> That the wiſdom of theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
is not ſo long a time in degenerating
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55953:43"/>
into weakneſs, into languors, and into cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe.
Before it paſs thus corrupted to their
children and to their poſterity, it ſpoils its
ſelf from its very iſſuing out of the ſoul, and
before ever it come to action. It appears
weak in their Propoſitions and in their
Counſels, which can be call'd neither pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
nor wiſe, without ſpeaking impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
without doing an injury to ſuch
fair Names, without offence to true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>What an error it is! As if Wiſdom could
never be couragious; That it muſt always
fear, and always tremble. Theſe new
Wiſe men are acquainted with the Wiſe
men of Antiquity: They have read <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
as well as we, and yet have not profited
by that old Oracle which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reports;
THAT A MAN MUST CALL
DANGER TO THE RELIEF
OF DANGER, AND SAVE
HIMSELF FROM ONE EVIL
BY ANOTHER EVIL.</p>
               <p>How deplorable ſoever the condition of
the preſent is, they cannot reſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for Novelty or Change: They would
rather ſuffer Change then make, and
expect it, then prevent it. In ſtead of
obeying the Oracle, and tempting a ſecond
Danger, they accuſtom and make themſelves
familiar with the firſt: In ſtead of doing an
endeavor to withdraw themſelves from an
evil courſe which they are fallen into, they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55953:43"/>
ſeek a ſupportable poſture to abide in. They
are engag'd in Evil ſo, as the Evil preſſeth
them not, and ſo as they recoil to the laſt
extremity: It's ſufficient for them, ſo as
Death be remitted to another time, and
that they in the mean time may enjoy only
the intervals of an ill life. Doubtleſs they
would be of the opinion of a Spaniſh Poet,
who ſaid, <hi>That a Quartan Ague was a good
thing, becauſe a man was ſecure to live a year
with it, at least to live ſix moneths, at least
from a ſudden death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What they do therefore, is not to reign,
is not to conquer, is not to triumph; It's
only to live, and that alſo after a ſtrange
manner: It's to ſpend the time from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till after-noon, and ſo to draw on till
the next day. Their Government is neither
Peace, nor War, nor a Truce: It's a Reſt
of Idleneſs; it's a dead ſleep which by
artifice they procure the People, which is
neither good nor natural.</p>
               <p>They know not how to cure, but only
how to paint the ſick and make them look
well. They would reclaim Rebellion by
Careſſes; they glut it with benefits and
with gratifications: But they thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it more powerful, and nothing the
better; They increaſe it's force, nor do
they diminiſh its malice: They ſometimes
take from it ſome Men which are to be ſold,
and ſuch Advantages as ſerve to no purpoſe,
and they perceive not that it is to cultivate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55953:44"/>
diſorder thus lightly to touch its branches
and its buds, and not to put the iron to the
hody and to the root.</p>
               <p>All their Experience is but the Hiſtory of
Misfortunes, which happen'd to thoſe who
durſt, and did undertake. All what is not
eaſie, they call impoſſible; and fear magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
objects, and almoſt infinitely multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every individual, when three Malcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
retire themſelvs from Court with their
Train, they fancy an Army of Enemies in
the field, which draws along with it Towns
and Communalties without reſiſtance: And
afterwards they do not put themſelves in
poſture to chaſtiſe them, but they ſeek to
ſweeten them; and in ſtead of viſiting them
with Canons and Soldiers, they ſend them
Gown-men, employed with Offers and
Commiſſions, and promiſe them far more
then they could hope for by the Victory.</p>
               <p>Thus they oblige a Prince to deſcend
from his throne to treat with his Subjects,
They make a Soveraign a Private perſon,
and a Legiſlator an Advocate. By this breach
they break that diſtance which ſeparates
him from the People, and change Power
into Equality: The Guilty aſcend the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
and deliberate concerning their
own fact with the Judge; they name the
place of the Conference, and it's accepted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they chooſe for this Parley ſuch perſons as
they moſt confide in, and they are granted
them: And they there ſpeak neither of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55953:44"/>
Grace nor of Pardon; theſe terms would
be of too harſh ſound and would offend
their ears. But the offended Maſter ſolemnly
declares, That all was done for the good of
his ſervice, and thinks himſelf beholding to
thoſe unfaithful ſervants for the injuries they
have done him.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the Deſign of theſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely to licenſe the Company, and to
divide the Allyes: they grant them more
then they demand; they are prodigal of the
Publick Faith; they husband not the Kings
name; and after this manner they bring him
to the brink of two extremities equally
dangerous: For whether it be, that he will
keep his word by the ruine of his Affairs, or
whether he will eſtabliſh his. Affairs by the
violation of his word, he is ſtill reduced to
a moſt deplorable condition, either to hazard
his State by being faithful, or to forfeit his
Honor that he may continue King.</p>
               <p>But if before all this, whilſt things being
ſtill whole, he deſires to take a generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and worthy of himſelf, if he will no
longer have his bounty a rent and a certain
revenew to Rebels; if he be wearied to ſee
his Coffers exhauſted to pay his Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and every day to purchaſe what he
never gets; then do theſe able Counſellors
repreſent unto him with ſeveral geſtures
and grimaces that he muſt not ſharpen bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
That wiſe men yeild to the violence
of times, as the gods do to the neceſſity of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55953:45"/>
Fate: That Princes which reigned before
him never durſt ſtir that ſtone: That it
were preſumption to think to do better
then our Fathers have done; That War is
an ill means to reform a State; That to
pluck a body in pieces to make it new again,
is the remedy of a Magician; That to burn
a houſe to make it clean, is the advice of an
Enemy, and the reſolution of a furious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Neither is this all, They in purſuit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
great Common-Places in praiſe of Peace
and Repoſe; they employ all the skill of
the Rhetorician to exaggerate the miſeries
of war; They forget not the profanation
of Temples, nor the violation of Divine
and Humane Laws, to make their own
Cowardize reliſh in his mind, under ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
terms; and to perſwade him that they
have Reaſon, they never confeſs they are
affraid. They live thus near the Prince, and
maintain themſelves betwixt him and the
Rebels by the that common neceſſity which
there is of their Mediation to manage this
filthy Trade, and to preſerve two Parties in
a State, that ſo the one may not deſtroy the
other.</p>
               <p>They are alſo moſt commonly a friend to
ſtrangers: What need we diſſemble, they
far more apprehend to render their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
ungrateful to the King, then to diſſerve
the King their Maſter, ſo that during their
Miniſtery, no man muſt ſpeak of protecting
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55953:45"/>
the weak againſt the oppreſſion of the ſtrong,
of awaking pretenſions which are aſleep, of
undertaking any thing out of the Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what Juſtice, what Fitneſs, what Facility ſo
ever ſeems to perſwade ſuch an Enterprize.
They condemn the memory of <hi>Charls</hi> the
Eighth, and curſe the Voyages of Italy;
They even deride thoſe of the Holy Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
till even they offend the piety of former
Ages; not fearing to repeat after an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fellow engaged in the latter, <hi>That they
were the Feavors of thoſe times, and Popular
diſeaſes;</hi> That they were from the youthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Princes, and from the heat of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in our Counſellors. One of them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
That <hi>Alexander</hi> had never been;
That his Hiſtory was but a Romance, that
that of <hi>Amadis</hi> was not more fabulous, nor
more unlikely.</p>
               <p>If their ſoft counſels do not always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
over their Maſters Vigor and good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
if ſome ſenſible injury which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be diſſembled oblige the State to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
reſentment; then when they cannot
blame the thing in its principle, they decry
it with all their power in its conſequences
and effects; And as if the Victory were not
worth the charge of the War, upon the
taking of a Town from the Enemy, they ſay,
<hi>That it's to loſe to gain, after that manner; ſo
many honeſt men ſacrificed to the vanity of one
(this one perhaps, is a Prince of the Blood, or
a Son of</hi> France) <hi>ſo many millions tranſported
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55953:46"/>
out of the Kingdom for the gaining of a paltry
place; the expence of the Artillery alone would
perfect our ruine, did we make but ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Conqueſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such kind of Miniſters would not have
pleaſed themſelves at <hi>Carthage</hi> with the
Victories of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> They cried
out in Council upon the arrival of good
news, when they poured forth buſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s full
of thoſe Roman Knights Rings who had
been killed in the War; <hi>Let him keep his
iron Rings, and his paper Trophies, and ſend us
back our Men and our money; the Affairs of
the Republick were never either more flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or more ruinous; It never had more reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
abroad, nor more miſery within its own
bowels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Miniſters have cauſed the end of two
Empires, and have loſt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
by the fatal faintneſs of their Counſels;
They have opened the door to all the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,
They have ſhamefully purchaſed
peace either from the <hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Vandals,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Northern people, whence all the ill in
the world comes: They made no account
of the diſhonour of the Empire, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
of the Roman Name: So as by the
ſweetneſs of the word, they might correct
the bitterneſs of the thing; and ſo when
they paid Tribute to their Enemies, they
might be ſuffered to ſay that they gave a
Penſion to their Allyes; They minded not
the fortune of the future, nor what would
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55953:46"/>
become of Poſterity, ſo as they might but live
as long as the State which they governed
could laſt.</p>
               <p>Yet let us once more pardon them, and
not accuſe them of Treaſon. I believe they
would not ſell and deliver up their Maſter;
but they are not angry that the world ſhould
know that they can do it; upon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
they make no difficulty of ſetting a
price on him; they ſuffer him to be traffick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for: They even afford Merchants ſome
Patterns, although they will not part with
the whole Piece. It's one of their Maxims,
THAT ONE MAY SOMETIMES
DECEIVE THE PRINCE FOR
HIS OWN GOOD. And when they
hold intelligence with the Miniſters of other
Princes, they call that <hi>To labor for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
good of Chriſtendom, and to maintain
Peace betwixt the Crowns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our Fathers days it was believed, that
<hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> and <hi>Andreas Doria</hi> did not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand
one another; yet cannot any
man therefore ſay, but that the one was a
good ſervant to <hi>Soliman,</hi> and the other to
<hi>Charls;</hi> But they had need of one the other
to make their ſervices valued by their
Maſters, and to keep the place they held:
The Turk commended the Chriſtian, and
ſpoke of him as of the onel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and as advantagious. And a ſlave of <hi>Algier</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55953:47"/>
this ſubject ſpake very pleaſantly to a

And that if</hi> Doria <hi>were ruined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

more then one ſtep lower in the Emperors Court
by the ruine of</hi> Barbaroſſa.</p>
               <p>They helped and favored one another
therefore reciprocally, for the continuation
of the War which was their Trade and
their Buſineſs: And ſince ambitious men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who conſequently love honor, were capable
of ſuch a kind of traffick, I leave you to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
if men loving onely their own intereſt,
and knowing nothing elſe that's honeſt and
profitable would not be glad to preſerve
their Authority by ſuch a Commerce;
would they not, do you think, render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
neceſſary, that they might continue?
would they not for Peace, which would be
a golden Harveſt to them, and a Harveſt
which never fails, do what others did for
War, whoſe Vintage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THeſe are the proceedings of our Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Adminiſtration of the State,
and in the high Region of the Miniſtry; but
when they go lower, and that their duty is
more eaſie, they therein acquit themſelves no
better of what they ought. The affairs of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
who depend on them, take the ſame
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55953:47"/>
courſe with the publick. In ſure and eaſie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
wherein they might at an eaſie rate
ſhew their ſtrength, they cannot chuſe but
make their natural weakneſs appear; they
would not loſe the friendſhip of thoſe
whoſe goods they have raviſhed; and at one
and the ſame time, they fear and offend the
ſame perſons; they entertain all the world
with general anſwers, and ſuch as preciſely
do not oblige. A man never goes unſatisfied
away from them, they never brave nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
any man; they afford a man nothing
but fair words and fair hopes.</p>
               <p>To him who demands Juſtice, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
Civilities and Complements; they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
him who hath need of bread with Roſes
and Violents; after having held a man a
whole year in length, promiſing you all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
from day to day, at laſt when you
preſs them to a concluſion, they deſire you
to tell them, and thereby make it appear,
that as often as you ſpoke unto them, they
never intended to hearken unto you.</p>
               <p>A Pretender in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> having
treated them after this manner, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home, as he went, met with a Gallows at
his going out of <hi>Bologne</hi> (where the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> then was) and having a while ſtaid
before the Gallows to look on a man who
had been newly hanged, there, they ſay he
cried out all at once with a loud voyce,
HOW HAPPY DO I ESTEEM THEE
MY FRIEND TO HAVE NOTHING TO
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55953:48"/>
DO IN THE PLACE WHENCE I COME?
You ſee whom, for their ſakes men of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
envy, and whereto they oblige men to
go ſeek felicity; and indeed Death for
Death, and one Hangman for another; a
ſudden Death, and a ready Hangman, were
yet better then all this.</p>
               <p>Thus do they tire the patience of Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors,
thus they revenge the importunity
of Supplicants, nor do they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
angry to make them deſpair: Wherein
to ſpeak the truth, their proceeding hath I
know not what that's rare and worthy of
conſideration; Nothing can be imagined
more ſweet and more calme then their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;
their poiſon is compoſed of as much
Sugar as Arſenick, and the equality of their
humor is like to the calme of that River,
where the lighter bodies go to the bottom
without ſo much as the appearance of one
cloud in the air, nor one breath of wind
which moves them.</p>
               <p>A man of this make is a learned Artiſan
of calumnies; he never wants playſter nor
colours; he can admirably well prepare and
poliſh an ill turn; he blames with Elogies and
not with Invectives; in appearance he bears
teſtimony of ſome great Deſert, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
he breeds ſuſpitions of any mans great
Reputation. You would ſay that he grieves
for thoſe he accuſeth, and pities thoſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to ruine; Rhetorick teacheth us groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſpeak ill, he hath found out a way far
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55953:48"/>
more quaint to do the ſame thing; this is
called, to ſtrike without liſting up ones
arme; it's to hurt without drawing blood,
or the appearance of a blow. He diſguiſeth
himſelf in a friend to hate one with the
more ſecurity; and that he might be thought
charitable at the ſame inſtant that he aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
he kills no body, till he hath firſt
made his funeral Oration.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He tells the Prince, the eyes of all men
are turned towards him; the Souldiers
call him their Father, and the People
think he is their interceſſor towards your
Majeſty; it's in his power alone to prevail
with this univerſal favor, and the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſo many hearts, to form a party
which may carry his name; yet I believe
he would not fail in his duty, and that all
his are good intentions. The Aſtrologers
and the Poets promiſe him a Kingdom;
but beſides that, they are people who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
keep promiſe, its perhaps a Kingdom
beyond Sea; perhaps he muſt travel to the
conqueſt of it to the fartheſt extremities of
the Earth; yet it's likely that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf with the place which your
Majeſty hath given him about you; His
ambition will be more wiſe and more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
then that of other ambitious perſons.
Perhaps Sir, his deſigns will reſpect his
Majeſties Crown, and the Laws of his
Country.</q>

theſe magnifick excuſes, and with this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
ſweetneſs, mixt with this bitter rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
Miſtruſt with eſteem enters his ſoul.
But there is yet ſomething to be done; The
work is happily begun, but he muſt not ſtay
there; the diſſembling Courtier goes on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He adds, <q>That whatever may be ſaid, and
what Crime ſoever is alleadged he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reſolve to condemn a man who hath
ſerved him ſo well; that <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
muſt in ſuch a caſe conſult with himſelf,
and with the immortal gods; he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
whether there be more danger for
him to diſpatch a deſerving ſervant, then
there is danger in declining it; You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
loſe him without a notable intereſt of
State; You cannot preſerve him without
the evident danger of your perſon: Look
Sir, which of the two is neareſt, your
State or your Perſon: Conſider whether
it's better always to miſtruſt that man, or
aſſure your ſelf of him by thoſe means
which are in your power. A Sovereign,
can he be in ſafety, whilſt there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſon who can corrupt the Senate,
desbauch the Legions, and make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
revolt?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus without making high exclamations,
or employing violent figures, he perſwades
a timerous Soul, and drives fear into cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Thus cruelty ſeems ſweet, and appears
officious and doing good. By poi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he ſhuns the odious name of his Accuſer;
When he hath perfected his deſtruction,
giving him his laſt blow, he ſtill diſſembles
his hatred, he ſtill feigns himſelf good and
compaſſionate.</p>
               <p>But withal, he is ſo much affraid leaſt he

Science. As far off as ever he ſaw a man
whom he newly came from doing an ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unto, he cried aloud to him I HAVE
SERVED YOU SIR: And with
theſe Maxims of Deceit he a long time go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
the World. He grew extremely
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55953:50"/>
old in refuſing and in granting nothing, in
ſaying neither I nor no; in receiving both
parties with the ſame ſerene countenance;
Let him die then when he pleaſeth; this <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ſo little worthy of old <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo far from
the candor and ſincerity of the antient <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
with truth it might be inſcribed over
his Tomb, THAT HE DID LYE
THREESCORE YEARS AND
TEN, and that the Comedy he acted laſted
all his life.</p>
               <p>It's true, that we learn from ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that formerly men lived happily enough
under thoſe ſoft and languiſhing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and that they have not always been
fatal to their Countries: But we muſt take
heed in Hiſtory whether the adminiſtration
we commend, is not the conſequence of a
better Reign, whether it be not the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heat of a fire which is no more, and the
motion of a ſhake which is quiet: We
muſt obſerve whether they are not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Vertues which uphold the Childrens
Infirmities; and their Patrimony which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
desbauches. For in effect, after a
long continued order, Buſineſs moves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of it ſelf, and Policy cannot ſo ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a turn, being ſtill ſenſible of that good
impreſſion which ſome great Prince hath left
behind him. Beſides, it's the nature of the
things of this World to require time, and
with trouble to paſs from one condition to
another. So that if it hath hapned that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55953:51"/>
the Commonwealth remain ſtable under ſuch
weak, feeble and ill aſſured Powers, it was
perhaps obliged for its repoſe to thoſe good
and ſolid foundations which had long ſince
been eſtabliſhed, although that above it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appeared but ſtraw and earth. It
was not ſo much the fruit of the preſent
Government, as the remains of the former
happy conduct of Affairs.</p>

               <p>TO this ſcrupulous and miſtruſtful
Wiſdom we may oppoſe a certain
brutal Vertue, if it be lawful to
call it ſo; but the better to make it
known, and to define it by deſcribing it,
might we not call it a paſſionate, untutor'd
impetuous Probity, which rather follows the
Fury of Nature, then the Diſcipline of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and hath more Courage then Addreſs?</p>
               <p>At firſt it ſeems to be Vigor, and it proves
Rudeneſs; it might be taken for Force, and
yet 'tis but Violence; wherein the Mind fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it ſelf, intending to ſtiffen it ſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
immoveable, by meaning to be too
ſtable: Now it imports a man very much
to know how to turn and bend his Mind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the exigence of occaſions, and
the variety of thoſe ſubjects which preſent
themſelves. If we render it ſupple and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageable,
if it be not capable of ſeveral
forms; in a world, ſo changeable as this, its
uſe which ought to be univerſal, and not

have any defined object, finds its bounds at
the very beginning of his carreer; It ſtops
at ſome encounters, which ought to be in
its choyce, and extends it ſelf but to a very
ſmall number of things. And thoſe things
happening but very rarely, thoſe Miniſters
on the other ſide, who are every day to be
in action, they cannot with one onely Drug
make all kind of operations, and with the
ſame fire cool again, what they before
heated.</p>
               <p>I confeſs they have a good heart, and
their intentions may be good; but they
want both art and method for the conduct
of theſe advantages of birth. They are made
all of a piece; and if there be ſome overture
of difficulty to be made, inſtead that they
ſhould ſtoop their heads, they muſt have
the wall raiſed; They muſt conſtrain Time.
Men, and Buſineſs to obey them, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them: Thus never entring into another
ſence, being ever unable to ſhift place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
no other Reaſon but their
own, they are not very fit to govern States,
where it's neceſſary to take new advice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the novelty of thoſe accidents which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and where ſometimes the Pylot may
learn ſomewhat from the Paſſengers.</p>
               <p>What an unhappy regularity it is to go
out-right, and not to turn from a Gulf
which is in the midſt of the way; to go over
ſhelves, to have the honor not to go aſide;
to reject a good reſolution becauſe another
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55953:52"/>
propoſed it? Yet your generous Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
fall every hour into theſe Gulfs, and
continually ruſh themſelves on thoſe ſhelves;
being unable to arrive at the firſt glory of
Vertue which is not to fail, they neglect the
ſecond, which is to know how to amend ones
faults; becauſe they cannot be Perfect, they
will not be Penitent.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever the cauſe be, good or ill,
which they at firſt embrace, they hold on
with a blind obſtinacy, wherewith they
maintain it, and diſpute as violently for the
leaſt of their Sentiments, as for the Religion
of their Fathers; They would willingly be
Martyrs for their own Opinions; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
continue a commenced evil, to ſhew
that they undertake with Judgment what
they do with Perſeverance.</p>
               <p>If a Propoſition which they have advanced
by way of diſcourſe, and which they do
not believe to be true, comes to be conteſted,
they from that very time, intereſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in its defence; afterwards they half
perſwade themſelves to it; in purſuit of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
they hold it altogether aſſured, and
quit it not till from a problematick queſtion,
which it was at the beginning of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
they have in concluſion made it a
a point of Faith.</p>
               <p>If they are deſired to conſider that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
are powerful and numerous; They
anſwer, They are a great many Men, but
few Souldiers; That they are not true E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Enemies,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55953:53"/>
but a mutinous Raſcality: If it be
remonſtrated that a paſſage cannot be made
for the Army by that place which they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
they labor and torment themſelves ſo
much about it, that it ſeems as if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make it paſs there by the onely
force of their words.</p>
               <p>I do not here fancy things which are not;
I do not create Artificial Men: I know ſome,
My Lord, and I could name them to you,
who act in Council after this manner, who
will yield neither to evident Reaſon, nor to
an eſtabliſhed Cuſtom, nor to a received
Practice.</p>
               <p>They oppoſe the ſingularity of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to the conſent of People, and to a
crowd of Examples. The Briefs and the
Bulls of Popes, the Edicts and Declarations
of Kings are for other men, they are not
concerned; They break all publick Acts
when they agree not with their particular
ſence.</p>
               <p>Have we not firſt ſeen in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
ſince in <hi>Italy,</hi> a Spaniſh Miniſter, who was
of this humor; he could never reſolve to
acknowledge for King of <hi>France</hi> the late K.
<hi>Henry</hi> the Great; he could never call him
otherwiſe then the <hi>Bearnois,</hi> or the Prince of
<hi>Bearne,</hi> when he meant him a favor. The
League was dead, and without hopes of ever
reviving. The Peace of <hi>Vervins</hi> was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all its Articles executed; The Kings
Reconciliation had been ſolemnly made with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55953:53"/>
the Holy See; The K. of <hi>Spain</hi> had ſent him
Ambaſſadors, and had receiv'd his. Yet all this
could not make the ſpirit of the Miniſter
ſtoop; He would be more averſe to <hi>France</hi>
then <hi>Spain,</hi> and more Catholick then the
Church. His opiniaſtrecy excommunicated
him whom the Pope had abſolved. And he
ſtill remained on theſe terms till the year
1610. the very evening before when this
<hi>Bearnois</hi> was ready to make himſelf Maſter
of a conſiderable part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and who
knows whether he would not have begun
with the Dutchy of <hi>Millan,</hi> which this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
was then Governor of, purpoſely to
have made him change his note?</p>
               <p>THoſe Wiſemen we yeſterday made the
examen of, aſſure nothing at all, durſt
not ſwear it were day at high noon, are
not certain whether thoſe things which
they ſee are objects or illuſions; when a
man inquires their Sentiment, they always
ſay I THINK, never I KNOW, and
in buſineſſes which are moſt clear, a man
can draw nothing from them but PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAPS,
IT MAY BE SO, and WE
MUST CONSIDER, which proceeds
according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> from an opinion they
have conceived of the world, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ill, and from appearances; So that they
may be ſometimes deceived, but they are
indeed ſeldom deceived. If they loſe it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they play but too well; It's themſelves
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55953:54"/>
and their misfortune which they ought to
complain of, and not of the advantages and
wiles of their Enemies. They alſo firſt ſeek
Safety and afterwards Profit; They govern
themſelves by a reaſonable Diſcourſe,
which concludes with profit and certainty;
Nor do they live according to moral Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which propoſeth what's honeſt and
hazzardous.</p>
               <p>You may fancy quite the contrary of the
others we now ſpeak of, who expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in affirmative terms, who decide the
moſt doubtful and the moſt imbroyled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
with a THIS IS SO, it CAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOT
BE OTHER WISE, THERE
IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY
THAT IT MUST HAPPEN
SO; theſe commonly quit the greateſt of
their intereſts for the leaſt of their Paſſions,
they prefer praiſe to Preſents, and thanks
before Rewards; they promiſe themſelves
wonders from the future and from fortune;
they make their doubts their ſuſpitions, their
hopes valid even to infinity.</p>
               <p>Yet let us confeſs the truth to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the men of this day, they are far
more worth then thoſe of yeſterday in
<hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Judgment, Timerous perſons are
defective, for as much as they aſpire not to
thoſe things the Magnanimous are worthy
of, and for as much as they aſpire not even
to thoſe of which themſelves are worthy;
But the Audacious are exceſſive onely in that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55953:54"/>
they aſpire to thoſe things which the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
are, and not they worthy of. I
ſpeak of Magnanimity as you may perceive
with the rigor of Philoſophers, and not with
a Poetical licence, who might well call this
days Men Magnanimous, ſince they ſo call
their Gyants, their Phaeton, and their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paneus.</p>
               <p>It's certain, that this Boldneſs and this
Fierceneſs do not always diſpleaſe the
world; In ſome encounters they have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
approbation and praiſe; They have been
eſteemed and have ſucceeded in the perſon
of that Roman, who ſeems ſo honeſt a Man to
my Lord the Duke <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> and to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
the Marſhal <hi>Deſdiguieres;</hi> your Highneſs
is pleaſed that I ſhould remember you of
the ſtile wherewith he wrote to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
               <p>The fidelity of that Roman was without
reproach, and yet he was accuſed in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and found an Informer againſt him
at Court; He commanded an Army in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
and had great credit and authority
in his Province, and among the Souldiery:
Being advertiſed of what had paſt at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and of the ill offices which were rendred
him in the Pallace, he wrote a bold and
proud Letter to the Emperor, the laſt words
whereof were much like to theſe, <q>My Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
hath been pure and intire hitherto,
nor will I change it unleſs I am forced
thereunto; but whoſoever comes to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55953:55"/>
me in my command, I am reſolved to
receive him, as if he had enterprized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my life, LET US IF YOU
PLEASE CAESAR AGREE,
LET THE WHOLE EMPIRE
BE YOURS, AND MINE MY
GOVERNMENT.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such men hardly hold intelligence with
the Enemy, but they eaſily bandy againſt
their Maſter; they are never Rebels out of a
formed deſign, and out of a malitious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but they may be made ſo by diſdain
and reſentment; they want not Fidelity ſo
long as they are truſted; Theſe do no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice,
but will ſerve after their own mode;
They will be Arbiters both of their duty and
of their obedience.</p>
               <p>One of theſe perſons (whom you know
my Lord) would prove unto me, it's not
long ſince, that he ſerved his Maſter in
diſobeying him; it was at an entertainment
which laſted four hours betwixt us, when I
gave him a viſit at his Government from
your Highneſs. By a nice diſtinction which
he made of the King and of the State, he told
me, that very lately and upon an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which was not yet paſt, <hi>He had gone
out-right to the good of the State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having hearkened to ſeveral different
voyces, which would have ſtopped him by the
way, alleadging to him the Kings rame.</hi>
Whereto he added, grounding himſelf or
a principle which he took ſomewhat high:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55953:55"/>
                  <hi>That the King his firſt Maſter, Father to the
King that now is, had commanded him before
his death, that if ſuch a time happened, and
ſuch an accident occur'd, he ſhould not fail to
do ſuch a thing, what contrary order ſoever
were brought him from Court to hinder him;
That he thought he was obliged in Conſcience to
follow the intentions of the greatest and wiſeſt
Prince in the world, nor did he apprehend he
could err by conforming himſelf to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of him who never committed faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I pray go on to verifie that ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
which is yet come to the knowledge
of no man, nor even to the Queen Dowager
of the late King. To know of a truth of
this, the charms of Magick muſt be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the ſoul of the greateſt and wiſeſt Prince
of the the Earth muſt be raiſed; of him who
committed no faults; and it muſt be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
whether that Miniſter who alleadgeth
this, alleadge it not falſely. It's a raillery to
think ſtill to belong to <hi>Philip</hi> under the
reign of <hi>Alexander;</hi> to endeavor to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
ones Maſter that a man hath reaſon to
diſobey; That opiniaſtrecy hath merit;
That it's ſufficient to ſerve well, howſoever
though againſt the will of him we ſerve.</p>
               <p>Let ſuch perſons who thus will ſerve their
own way, be always if it be poſſible two
hundred leagues from Court. Let them be
employed, if it may be ſo, in obſcure places,
where ill examples being not ſo much look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon, are not ſo dangerous: But it would
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55953:56"/>
not be well to call them near the perſons of
a Prince, where reſpect is no leſs neceſſary
then ſervice, and where they would be his
Tutors rather then his Counſellors.</p>
               <p>Theſe are excellent men I do not deny it,
but this excellency under the power of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not in its right place. They love the
State and their Country, but they hate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
and Subjection; their end is right,
but the means are oblique, and ſeem contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to their end; For making the good of
the Monarchy their object, they uſe all the
licence which may be uſed in a popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Further yet, In ſerving they
will ſerve like Soveraigns; themſelves have
told me, in their entertainments of near
four hours, <hi>That they were too old to ſubmit
themſelves to the firſt elements of their duty.</hi>
When ſmiling at what they told me, I went
farther and told them, <hi>They were too great to
learn that leſſon which a Doctor of the Court
gave his Son in the Grecian hiſtory,</hi> MY
CHILDE, MAKE THY SELF
LITTLE. Good Governors of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and good Guardians of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
good Porters of the Realm, ſo long as
you pleaſe; But I grant not, that you are
good Miniſters of State, and good Courtiers
after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>There are Affairs in which a man may
take ſeveral parties, and ſome diverſly by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed
which offer themſelves, of which we
are to chuſe that which is moſt proper to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55953:56"/>
manage it well. In ſuch buſineſſes they
bring the ſame paſſion, and are born away
with the ſame miſcarriages which we have
already obſerved on the ſubject of News. A
man can never ſee them out of one extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or other. They would rather fall then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend;
they deſire all or nothing; they ſeek
Death or Victory: Yet methinks it's much
to carry away three quarters, when one
cannot obtain the whole; That betwixt
Death and Victory there ſhould be Peace,
which is a good of an ineſtimable value,
which ought to be ſought for by the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
and deſired by the Victorious.</p>
               <p>But what is ſeemly with us, nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
them, nor have they an ear for our
remonſtrances; there is no way to divert
their imagination from its object, and to
make them change their aim, they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to all accommodation, and ſo bound
to thoſe rules which they preſcribe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and to that rigor of exact Juſtice
which exaſperates them, that it's impoſſible
to render them capable of Equity. It's not
poſſible to make them take a reward for a
thing when it's loſt. They would have the
ſame, and not the like; They combate the
ſence of the Law with terms of Law, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
themſelves by doing themſelves right;
They make me remember thoſe Brothers ſo
much celebrated in Hiſtory, who being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to divide a Succeſſion, broke a glaſs to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it, &amp; cut a Suit in two, that each of them
might have his half.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55953:57"/>
If theſe go not ſo far, and if this be to ſpeak
too much; Let's at leaſt ſay, that in buſineſs
they know not of how great uſe theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments
are, and how profitably be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for the perfection of Affairs, by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things at a diſtance, and by facilitating
thoſe which are difficult. They underſtand
not theſe Relaxations, theſe Adjuſtments, as
they ſpeak now in <hi>Italy.</hi> This neceſſary
mean which ſeems often to come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and which is needful to conclude bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
with particular perſons, and with far
more reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Treaties of Peace betwixt
Princes, Leagues Offenſive and Defenſive,
Negotiations, wherein the ſafety of People
are concerned, and the fortune of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>Our ſullen vertuous perſons will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of theſe Tempers, nor of this Mean: In
a State which dies of old age, they would do
the ſame as if they governed in a newly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Commonwealth in the purity of its
inſtitution, and in the vigor of its firſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
They ſpeak of nothing but of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Power, but of the Autority of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
but of the force of the Laws, although
they are things which grow old as well as
other things, and which growing old grow
weak.</p>
               <p>Hearken unto <hi>Cato's</hi> opinion in <hi>Caeſars</hi>
cauſe, <q>He ſays we muſt load him with
chains (he doth not ſay, we muſt firſt ſeiſe
upon him) we muſt ſend him in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55953:57"/>
to our Alleys whom he hath offended,
that they may do themſelves right, and
that he may be puniſhed for his unjuſt
Victories. Theſe MUSTS are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to be put in execution, if Favor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
Reaſon; we muſt, continues he, have
him come and plead his own cauſe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and give us an account of his nine
years Command; All muſt be done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Law, that's to ſay, according to
my intrpretation, we muſt hazard all the
Laws to obſerve Formalities.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I perſwade my ſelf Your Highneſs thinks
this auſtere Commonwealths man to blame,
although never man was more praiſed then
he; <hi>Cicero</hi> was not only his particular friend,
he was his publick Admirer; after his death,
he did ſomewhat more then make his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Oration; and what he did, made way for
<hi>Caeſars</hi> two <hi>Anti Cato's:</hi> Yet <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaking
confidently to <hi>Pomponius Atticus</hi> confeſſeth,
that the vertue of that man whom he ſo
much admired was unprofitable for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
He confeſſeth that that Divine man, for
ſo he called him, was out of uſe, and knew
not how to accommodate himſelf to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of thoſe times; That when he gave
his opinion in Council, <hi>He thought he had
been in</hi> Plato's <hi>Republick, and not among the
Lees of</hi> Romulus <hi>his People</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word of <hi>Cicero</hi> explains a Verſe of
<hi>Virgil,</hi> which your Scholaſticks take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, yet it deſerves the reflections of a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55953:58"/>
Courtier. In the deſcription of his Hero's
Buckler, wherein divers figures were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
when he would have repreſented that
part of Hell which is inhabited by ſacred
Souls, he makes <hi>Cato</hi> to precide with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Authority, and gives him a Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over Juſt and Happy People.</p>
               <q>Secretoſque Pios, his dantem jura Catonem.</q>
               <p>And as a Poet who is a friend of ours hath
tranſlated it,</p>
               <q>Aux Juſtes aſſemblez Caton donne des Loix.</q>
               <p>And thus in Engliſh.</p>
               <q>The blest withdrawn, where Cato gives the
Laws.</q>

               <p>I have elſewhere read with ſome manner

the Seventh his Datary, it's addreſt to his
Maſters Nuncio with the King of <hi>Hungary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
And by this Letter he witneſſeth, <q>That
the Pope extremely deſires the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi> with the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55953:60"/>
holy See, but that he this Datary, foreſaw
a very great impediment which might
combate this extreme deſire of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
it was that it did not become the
Grandeure &amp; Dignity of the Church to ſue
to Kings or Kingdoms: And that in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of ſo great reputation order was not
to be overthrown, nor the fitneſs of things
to be violated. That for that purpoſe it
were fit to finde out ſome means to oblige
the <hi>Bohemians</hi> firſt of all to begin this
practice, and make the advance of it; that
preſenting themſelves to Cardinal <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegno</hi>
(who was Legate in Germany)
they ſhould be received with open arms;
but not preſenting themſelves, the Legate
could not move towards them, nor the
Judge ſollicite the parties. That what they
demand ought to be granted, but that they
were not to be offered what they did not
demand.</q> Is it not true, that this man was
a great Husband of the point of Honor? This
ridiculous nicety diſpleaſeth me in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
of <hi>John Matthew Giberti,</hi> who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
was an excellent man.</p>
               <p>I am not onely angry but vexed, that our
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſhould be of the number of theſe
men; I could wiſh it had been ſome other
body who had ſaid in the Council of <hi>Athens,</hi>
on the ſubject of a little Iſle neighboring
with <hi>Samothracia,</hi> which was in conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Athenians</hi> and King <hi>Philip,</hi> 
                  <q>If
the King will reſtore you the Iſle, and that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55953:60"/>
the Treaty import the word Surrender, I
would adviſe you to take it; but not if he
pretends to give it you, and if he ſhould
call the reſtitution of what he hath uſurped
over you a Benefit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You may by this believe how ſuch Great
Perſons have amuzed themſelves on trifles,
and that this man priſed the vanity of a
word, more then the ſolidity of the thing.
If the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> would have made a
preſent of the Dutchy of <hi>Millan</hi> to our laſt
Kings, and had <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> been of their
Councel, he would have counſelled them to
have refuſed the Preſent for fear of doing
wrong to the Rights they had to the Dutchy.
He would rather have kept his juſt pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and have conſolated himſelf with the
hopes of the future, then to have enjoyed
the advantage of the preſent, and to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the poſſeſſion of a ſecond Crown, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch terms as he did believe were not
worthy of the firſt.</p>
               <p>In the wicked world wherein we live,
when they execute Juſtice on us, do we fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
it an act of Grace? Let's not be avariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of terms and of appearances, ſo as the
eſſential part remain. Let them carry away
ſome Pictures and Weathercocks, ſo as they
leave us the Walls and the Roof. Let them
call it a Preſent, a Favor, an Alms if they
pleaſe, when the piece is ours we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give it a fairer name, and that which may
pleaſe us better. Let us with honor have
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55953:61"/>
thoſe Iſlands which belong to us; but let us
have them at any rate; Let us rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
our ſelves for a little wrong we have
ſuffered then complain to poſterity of a great
injuſtice inflicted on us.</p>
               <p>It were better not have a good and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
ſight in the diſcuſſion of ones Rights,
leſt we ſhould therein diſcover but too much
Juſtice; it were better not to be ſo able in
a mans own buſineſs, leſt a man ſhould be
thereby over-perſwaded. This ſo ſubtil and
delicate a ſence of the injuries which we
have received, is no very convenient thing,
when the reparation we require is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
So high an opinion of the merit of the
cauſe with difficulty ſubmits it ſelf to the
Judgement and Deciſion of another. All this
ſerves onely to render that impoſſible which
we haue a deſign to do, to amuſe a man in
a place out of which he ought to go as ſoon
as poſſible; theſe are not means to act, theſe
are hindrances of action; theſe are not means
to level the difficulties of a courſe, they are
ſtones which lye before the end of it. They
are in effect elevated qualities which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
accompany Nobleneſs of heart and
Generoſity. But they commonly do more
hurt then good; At leaſt, they are not for
every days uſe, and thoſe who are weak can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
uſe them profitably againſt thoſe who are
more ſtrong.</p>
               <p>I know not how they underſtand it; But
methinks a Treaty cannot be more unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily

which muſt be caſt into the fire, it's obliged
<hi>To appeal to another Age,</hi> and muſt bring

It were far better to quit ſome of this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and of this Honor. Why not conſent to
an accommodation which were reaſonable,
in conſideration of what's profitable, and
which will be no ways diſhoneſt in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of times, whereto Generoſity it ſelf
and Nobleneſs of heart ought to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
themſelves?</p>
               <p>LEt us not be blinded therefore with the
Reputation of the Wiſdom of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
let neither the one nor the other of the

that Favour could work nothing on them,
take up a ſtrangers intereſt againſt one of his

They have been raviſhed at the loſs of a cauſe
which was recommended to them by their

office which could be done a good buſineſs,
was, ſuch a recommendation. When divers

And to eſtabliſh this ſtrict commerce,

intelligence which they endeavor to keep
with his Paſſions: But having once poſſeſt

They are like <hi>Seneca's</hi> ballance,

The Epicure deſtroys as much in three days

its ſufficient if he is not wicked; that he

to hinder himſelf from being hated. That
ſolid and perpetual Probity is too heavy
and too difficult; But that its image which
changeth not, hath the ſame ſplendor as the

That from time to time a vertuous action
which is no great matter of coſt, being fitly
performed, may ſerve to entertain his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.

If there be an Inceſt in his thoughts,
and that this Inceſt is combated with ſome

his diſturbed ſpirit. They eaſe his pains by

that he cauſed his own Son to die upon
the firſt ſuſpition which he had of him,
It's true, he regretted his death, and
acknowledged his innocency. But this
acknowledgement came too late, and his
regret laſted but Four and twenty hours;
he thought himſelf quit by cauſing a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

<hi>Charlemayn,</hi> who is oue of the Saints

all the ſcruples your conſcience can make;
although they tell you of his capitular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
he knew neither a better nor

of his ſword ſerved him for his Seal
and Signet. Do not think that I would
make you believe this; this is Hiſtory,
and is to be taken according to the letter.
To this day there are ſtill Priviledges found

the good and orthodox Emperor, <hi>Rowland</hi>

who have inſtructed Princes theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Leſſons, and I have it from the Doctors

of theſe fair Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>Being at laſt tired out with defending
crimes which were without a Judge, and
to excuſe an all-powerful cruelty, they
have freely told the Prince, That when
there was no example to be found, he
might make one; that what had formerly
been unheard of, would being done ceaſe, to
be ſo; That it would be ſhameful for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign

of the <hi>Sejanuſſes</hi> and the <hi>Plautuſſes</hi>)
innocent in all the parts of his life, and
who in his ſoul hates not his Superiors; and
conſequently, the Prince cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the guilty, nor ſtrike any but his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
Conſequently, he gratifies him whom
he bereaves of his goods, in that he takes
not away his honor, and leaves him his life.
According to their principles, Loyalty is the
vertue of a Merchant and not of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.
They alleadge I know not what Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
<hi>That in Heaven they in the ſame ſcales put
the oathes of Princes with thoſe of Lovers:
That the gods equally laugh at one as well as at

               </p>
               <p>Thus in a way of fooling and telling of
fables, they quite perſwade the Prince, that
he is not obliged by his word; after having
perſwaded him that he is no longer ſubject
to the fancies and viſions of the Legiſlators;
they maintain that it belongs to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh

To declare to the world what for the future

which is more pernicious then an ill Prince:
There are no where puniſhments great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

               <p>For which cauſe, ſince the perſons of

ill Princes, which provoke innocents to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Murtherers to burn Temples For
in effect, their pernitious advice endears ever
thoſe reſolutions which have been taken.
Their Maxims of Fire and Blood aſſure and
fortifie Malice when it is as yet timerous and
doubtful; they ſharpen what cuts, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
what is falling, they encourage the
violent when they run after the prey, they
inflame the deſires of the Avaritious for
our Goods, and thoſe of Impudent perſons
for our Wives.</p>
               <p>NOw if they meet with natures which are
not ſuſceptible of thoſe ſtrong Paſſions,
and which are in anequal degree diſtant from
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55953:70"/>
and from Vertue. If they light on theſe ſoft
Princes, who are without ſting or offence,
and have no inclination to ill, their nature
inclining them ſo to idleneſs as not to ſuffer
them to ſtir out of their places. It's ſtill the
worſe for thoſe people who are to live under
them, for abuſing the ſimplicity of their pliant
Maſter, and taking the advantage which
their ſpirit hath over his, they reign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
openly. And obſerving it but as the
right and title of their unjuſt Dominion, to
the weight of Tyranny they add the ſhame
there accrues for ſuffering it from a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
perſon.</p>
               <p>You cannot imagine the wiles and artifice
they uſe to attain hereunto, and totally to
ſubject to themſelves the Prince. Firſt, the
method is to ſpur him up with glory in the
eſtabliſhment of their fortune. They give him
to underſtand through ſeveral Trunks, that
his Predeceſſors who were nothing more
powerful then he, made ſome far greater Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of theirs. That it's far better to raiſe
up new People, who have no dependance,
and who ſhall onely hold from his Majeſty,
then to uſe perſons of a good birth, and of
a known Probity, whoſe affections and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are already made; That it concerns his
honor not to leave his works imperfect, to
labor for their imbelliſhment after having
eſtabliſhed their ſolidity. That he ought
to put them in a condition that they may
not be ruined but by themſelves: That if

he yields to the deſires of his Grandies, who
will endure no Companions; and if he
contents the complaints of his People, who
are Enemies to all growing Greatneſs, he
will not for the future have the power to
do any good; he will be forced to call an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of the States General to diſpoſe of the

he cannot abandon a perſon who hath been
ſo dear unto him, without condemning the
conduct of many years, and rendring a
publick teſtimony either of his paſt blindneſs
or of his preſent fickleneſs.</p>
               <p>It's certain, that having begun to love a
thing, for the love of it ſelf, time preſently
adds our own intereſt to the merit of the
thing; the deſire we have that all the world
ſhould believe that all our elections are good,
makes that action out of neceſſity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was voluntary; ſo that what hath been

               <p>Now if theſe conſiderations can ſhake

               <p>Thus is the poor Prince at mercy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of his Favorite, caſts not forth a
ſigh but a Spy renders him an account, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not one word but what is told him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
So that in the midſt of the Court he
is ſenſible of the irkſomneſs of a ſolitude;
he ſees nothing about his perſon of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and hath not one onely faithful
ear to whom he may ſay, <hi>I ſuffer.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that he is ſo far engaged that there is
no way for him to releaſe himſelf; the other
hath made all the world either his Enemy,
or ſuſpected, that he may have none but him
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55953:72"/>
to truſt. By having long had the poſſeſſion
of Affairs, which he communicates with
no man, he alone underſtanding all, and
knowing the State, he at laſt becomes a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
evil, which neither can the Prince
be cured of but by a dangerous remedy.</p>
               <p>After this manner, in an abſolute Peace
being well with all his neighbors, no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regn
Army appearing on the frontier, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſtroke ſtriking, or having ventured fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then from the Palace to the ſtreet, he
ſees himſelf miſerably fallen into another
mans power, which is after the loſs of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
the worſt thing which could happen
him. The unhappy moment which firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
him to commence his affection, and
to believe more then he ought, hath reduced
him to this deplorable extremity. And to
ſpeak home, the Battel of <hi>Pavia</hi> was not ſo
funeral to <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, nor the taking
of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh: For if
their diſgrace was great, at leaſt, neither was
it voluntary: If they loſt their Liberty, they
in their affliction preſerved the greatneſs of
their Courage; and if they were taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
twas by a great Emperor, who was their
enemy, and not by one of their petty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
There is no captivity ſo miſerable, ſo
baſe, nor ſo infamous as that of a Prince who
ſuffers himſelf to be taken in his Cabinet,
and by one of his own; He could not have
exerciſed a more cowardly patience, nor be
more ſhamefully unhappy.</p>

I ſhall go further yet, when a King eats
his People to the very bones, and lives in
his own State as in an Enemies Country, he
doth not ſo far eſtrange himſelf from the

There is a great difference betwixt
Tyranny and Royalty; yet it reſembles it
a great deal more then Servitude. It's at

way of commanding men, although it be not

Fellows, and not reſerve ſo much as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

a caſe I know not what name to give him,
and there cannot be a more miſerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum
then his life, during which he
doth nothing, and yet doth all thoſe evils
which happen to the People.</p>
               <p>In this condition, he is civilly dead, and
hath as it were depoſed himſelf. It's onely
his Effigies which is uſed in publick, which
out of cuſtom, and for a ſhew hath ſome
duties paid unto it, and to whom many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Congees are made. Men are no longer
bound to the legitimate and natural power.
They follow another which is ſtranger and
uſurped; which is in a violent way born
from the firſt, and in adultery. Royalty is
forſaken to run after favor, of which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55953:75"/>
this, and conclude, That the diſtance is great
enough betwixt the Sovereign and private
Perſons, to raiſe them up very high, and yet
leave them room enough below him. IT'S
GOOD THAT HE WHO IS NEAREST
THE PRINCE SHOULD BE EXTREME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
DISTANT FROM HIM; IT'S FIT
THERE SHOULD BE MANY THINGS
WHICH THE BEST BELOVED MAY
NOT REACH.</p>
               <p>Juſtice admirs of favor, we have long ſince

oppoſeth not it ſelf againſt honeſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it condemns not Familiarity and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Philoſophy and Chriſtianity agree
in all theſe with Nature; and the Son of
God when he made himſelf Man hath by
his example authorized all this: Let there
therefore be a Favorite at Court, Heaven
and Earth allow of it; Let there be a man,
we would have it ſo, who is the Princes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident;
But let there not be a man who day
and night beſiegeth the King; who by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
uſurpation appropriates him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
he who will have to himſelf alone a
good which ought to belong to all the
world, exerciſeth the ſame Injuſtice as if he
hid the Sun from the world, as if he ſhut up
Churches to all the People in it.</p>
               <p>Let the Prince ſend forth as long as he pleaſe
a reflection of his Greatneſs on thoſe Subjects
who have found favor in his ſight; Let him
communicate unto them the rayes of his

power; But let him not transfer it entirely
into their perſons; let him never caſt off
from himſelf his Globe of light; Let his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
enrich particular perſons, ſo as it
do not impoveriſh the Kingdom; Let his
Benefits abundantly flow in ſome places, ſo
as he remain Maſter of the Spring. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle

as to make it change place, that it
ſhould never be where it ought to be. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Power is of the nature of thoſe
things, which are ſo much ours, that we
cannot give them to another, nor ſeparate
them from our ſelves. Its legitimate ſo
long as it remains in the hands of thoſe
who have received it from the Laws
of the State. But the ſame Law will have
it ſo, that it cannot paſs from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Our wiſe Predeceſſors were herein wiſe,

They would not the King ſhould have the

and to whom he pleaſed; That he
could deligate the whole or any part. But
on the contrary, by a Law which is of the

But in purſuit, having tried the perſon he
choſe, and having received thoſe ſervices he
hoped for, if he will do what's juſt, he will
make his Miniſter his Favorite, and will not
ſuffer him to deſire any thing beyond the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of an obliged Prince; it's
juſt he ſhould not impart common honors
to an extraordinary vertue, that he ſhould
not avaritiouſly diſpenſe his favours on a place
whereon Heaven hath poured forth all
hers.</p>
            <p>But do you remember Sir, that I ſpoke of
<hi>Agrippa</hi> and of <hi>Moecenas</hi> who are long ſince
dead, and have left behind them none of
their race, although the earth be large, and
the number of the people which inhabit it
not ſmall. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> could never have found
through all its extent, two better or more
efficacious inſtruments for thoſe glorious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes
he deſigned: He had need of thoſe
two men to eſtabliſh that eternal Peace he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Univerſe; theſe men were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for him to perſwade obedience to people
that were free, to make his arms revered
by the vanquiſhed, to render that Power
which was terrible to all the world, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to every particular perſon.</p>
            <p>Beſides which, they were friends worthy
of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> enlightned with the cleareſt
lights of wiſdom, when they were to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate;
they burnt with zeal and affection,
when they were to execute things delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Sometimes they followed the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55953:80"/>
of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> otherwhiles they preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. They did not onely obey his
words and his commands, but even the ſigns
he made and his deſires. None but they
could have born the ſplendor of ſo lively
and active a vertue as his, far enough from
being able to have upheld it, to fortifie it as
they did, and to cooperate with it.</p>
            <p>Is it not true, that a Prince who hath ſuch
Miniſters may take ſome hours of reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice to the Publick repoſe, may
take up the debates in his mind without
diſturbance to his affairs? I am confident
you are of my mind, but you muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that ſuch Props as theſe are not in
Sholes under one Raign or in one Kingdom,
not even in Hiſtory, which embraceth ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Raigns and Realms. Such helps as
theſe are rare preſents from heaven. A man
had need know how to chuſe; theſe kind
of elections are not every day to be made;
all Ages are not ſo happy as that of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus;
And that man whom the world may
ſometimes ſtand in need of, perhaps may not
be then born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THere are ſome Souls capable of Fear,
which was the ſecond point of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
which otherwiſe are fair ſouls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and want not light; But they are without
fire, or ſo ill kindled, ſo weak, and ſo languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they appear to be without action;
theſe Souls are only fit to exerciſe eaſie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55953:80"/>
they know not how to act, but when
they move without reſiſtance; ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to be ſure will never truſt to Chance;
they would have a God for their ſecurity,
and more then an Oracle for their aſſurance
in the leaſt of their undertakings; their Maſter
may have courage, but the timerouſneſs of
their Councels blunts the edge of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
they always reſtrain, and never ſpur
him forwards.</p>
            <p>Take heed, I beſeech, you of thoſe able
Cowards <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> entertain'd us withal;
obſerve how a new experiment puts their
wiſdom in diſorder, how a ſimple report
without an Author or foundation, caſts them
out of their ordinary ſituation; how grave
and diſſembling ſoever they are at the firſt
allarm, their Mask falls, <hi>all their buſineſs is
to be read in their faces, in the afternoon you
may know the Diſpatches they received in the
morning</hi> (ſo that good wiſe Gentleman Mr.
<hi>Conrart</hi> once told us) although they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to palliate themſelves with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
ſilence, the eſmotion of their mind
ſtill appears in their troubled looks.</p>
            <p>When our <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> learnt from
the mouth of the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> the League
which was concluded againſt King <hi>Charls</hi>
his Maſter betwixt that Seignory, the Pope,
the King of the <hi>Romans, &amp;c.</hi> this news
which he nothing ſuſpected, and during the
time of his Embaſſie did ſo ſurprize him,
that if you will beleeve Cardinal <hi>Bembo,</hi> it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55953:81"/>
almoſt made him quite loſe his wits. And
when he went out of the Senate with a
Secretary of the Seignory, who had order
to accompany him, <hi>My friend,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>pray
repeat what the Prince told me, for I have quite
forgotten it; I no longer know what is become
of my Memory, or of my Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This example is ſingular, whether it
were by reaſon that ſuch a ſecret was kept
amongſt ſo many Senators, and ſo many
Ambaſſadors, who treated about this League
or by reaſon of our Ambaſſadors ſurpriſe,
who ſeeing them every day never was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

good reputation which he had otherwiſe ſo

            <p>A funeral news may happen which may

fortune claſheth with them. But whatſoever
the Barbarians of the Court ſay, or if you
had rather call them the enemies of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the ſtudy of Wiſdom is no unprofitable
help to Magnanimity and Judgment.</p>
            <p>True and good Philoſphy, for there is one
which is falſe and evil, renders death fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
unto us by a frequent meditation; it
bereaves us of fear, and diminiſheth ill; it
teacheth us that the onely faults which we
commit, are the onely miſhaps which befall
us; and the conſolation which a man receives
who is at no loſs by his imprudence, but by
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55953:82"/>
the infidelity of others is to be preferred to
the good ſucceſſes of him who gains by his
crimes and not by his vertues.</p>
            <p>That Miniſter of whom you fancy I have
made this Picture, but which I reſerve in
my ſecret Repoſitory, being called to the
Government in ſuch troubleſome times,
ought to uphold himſelf on theſe principles;
he ought to paſs from the Philoſophy of
words to that of actions; an unforeſeen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
will never overthrow his Rules nor
his Maxims, becauſe there can be no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
which he foreſees not, and ſmels not
a far off. He will neither apprehend the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his perſon, nor the ruine of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
he will apprehend nothing but blame
and an ill reputation; And although Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
be a Vertue principally employed for
the preſervation of him who poſſeſſeth it;
yet neither will Prudence hinder him from
prizing ſeveral other goods more then his
own life.</p>
            <p>But when things grow better, and times
become leſs evil, he for that will not ſleep
out a calm, nor unbend himſelf from his
former vigor. Our wiſeman will go before
all diſorders, not onely with quick and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
eyes, but alſo with a firm and an
undaunted heart. If he ſees ſome ſigne of
change appear, and the leaſt preſage of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War, he will endeavor to ſtiffle the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
before its birth. It would be vain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
unto him thoſe inconveniencies
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55953:83"/>
which threaten him in particular, if he will
oppoſe himſelf to a ſpringing faction, he will
paſs by all thoſe conſiderations which ſtop
the greateſt part of our other wiſemen, and
he will onely mind the performance of his
duty, without caring for the greatneſs of the
danger he is engaged in.</p>
            <p>Were there a Son, or the Brother of a

he would never ſharpen that Son or
that Brother, far leſs would he flatter them:
He will give counſel to the Father and the
elder Brother which ſhould neither be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
nor cruel. And if any man ſeek to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange
from him the affection of theſe young
Princes, he will rather ſerve them without
their good will, then pleaſe them by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
them: He will not ſo much reſpect
what they would then ſeem to will, as what
hereafter they would indeed; nor ſo much
the intereſt of others, wherein others engage
them, as he will their true and natural inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
which can never be ſeparate from thoſe
of the King and Crown.</p>
            <p>After this manner he will undertake the

wherein others would ruine all by violence

firſt, he muſt be reſolved come what will
to the worſt can happen; to ſave the State
he muſt be prodigal of himſelf, he is the
Kings own man. He muſt not onely engage
himſelf in a dangerous action, the event
whereof is doubtful, but devote himſelf to
an aſſured death, if his Maſters ſervice exact
it from him.</p>
            <p>It's this quality which is ſo neceſſary for
a Miniſter <hi>To love the Princes perſon as much
as the State;</hi> the one and the other paſſion
ought equally to poſſeſs his Soul, one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

was alledged in <hi>de Aubignys</hi> Hiſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Dukes of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> and <hi>Eſpernon.</hi>
I thus return to our ſubject.</p>
            <p>IT hath been formerly ſpoken of two <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,
That the one loved Alexander, and
that the other loved the King;</hi> it's not well
done to part what ought to remain entire;
why ſhould we ſeparate the King from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
and divide that poor Prince in pieces?
it were a violent diviſion, and a violence
even to Nature; it's to cut one body into
two; the Kings intereſts are inſeparably
united with thoſe of the State, and I muſt
confeſs that I cannot approve the meaneſs of
Cardinal <hi>Birage,</hi> who uſually ſaid, <hi>I am

               </hi> Magiſtrates and other Officers
with far more reaſon ow themſelves unto it.
They will never therefore at the ſame time
give and take away the ſame thing; their

avarice; will they repent themſelves of their
liberality? will they ſecretly take back a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
which they ſolemnly made before all the
world? for ſo I call the adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
of good Judges, and of good Laws.</p>
            <p>Unleſs than <hi>Melanois</hi> reckoned <hi>France</hi> as
nothing, he could no way better then there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
have made it appear, that he was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

indifferent But let it not be diſpleaſing to the
Cardinal of <hi>Birague;</hi> the Miniſter ought to
love the King and State both at once toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And if beſides that, he love ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, his ſecond affections muſt always
ranck themſelves under the ſubjection and
orders of the firſt.</p>
            <p>If he marry, he ought not to contract him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with any who is ſuſpected by the State,
or gives any cauſe of jealouſie to his Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but for this its too too much, he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his own Country, he ought to break
all the bonds of Nature, he ought to ſacrifice
all for the good of the State, if the good of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55953:84"/>
State require it. He ought to make it appear,
that in a Monarchy there may be a young
<hi>Brutus,</hi> who prefers his duty before his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and can even loſe them when its neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            </p>
            <p>But if the Miniſter be unmarried, and if he
keeps himſelf chaſte, it will be ſo much the
greater advantage to his Maſters affairs, and
they will be leſs ſubject to inconveniencies; it
wil be no ſmal matter That to him who ought
perpetually to labor either with courage or
with his mind, defended pleaſures are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
which have turned ſo many wiſe men

but the ground of it indeed were, that
even he would be without legitimate paſſions
which at leaſt amuſe and divert, if they do
not debauch and corrupt. Domeſtick cares
which uſurp ſo much time from buſineſs will
not rob an hour from ſuch a Miniſter; he will

he will not have one thought but for the

            </p>
            <p>ANd then neither will he be troubled to
