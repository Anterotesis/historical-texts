            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thoſe that are ſpiritually hot, find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation; thoſe that are ſtarke cold, have a leſſer reckoning; the meane between both, is ſo much worſe, as it comes neerer to good, and attaines it not. How long will you halt in this indifferencie? Reſolve one way, and know at laſt what you doe hold; what you ſhould. Caſt of either your wings

or your teeth; and loathing this Bat-like nature, be either a bird or a beaſt. To die wavering and vncertaine, your ſelfe will grant fearfull. If <hi>I</hi> muſt ſettle, when begin you? If you muſt beginne why not now? It is dangerous deferring that, whoſe want is deadly, whoſe oportunity is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

But if yor love not inconſtancy, tell us why you ſtagger. Be plaine or elſe you will neuer be firme: What hinders you.

Will you love Chriſt the leſſe, becauſe his coat is divided? yea let me boldly ſay; the hemme is torne a lettle, the garment is whole; or rather it is fretted a little, not torne; or rather the fringe, not the hemme. Behold, here is one Chriſt, one Creed, one Baptiſme, one heaven, one way to it, in ſumme, one religion, one foundation, and (take away the tumultuous ſpirits of ſome rigorous Latherans) one heart: Our differences are thoſe of Paul and Barnabas not thoſe of Peter and Magus if they be ſome, it is well they are no more; if many, they are not capitall. Shew mee that Church, that hath not complained of diſtraction: yea that familie, yea thàt fraternity, yea that man that alwayes agrees with himſelfe.

ſong, doe not call him, a young Hart in the mountaines of diviſion. Tell mee then, whither will you goe for truth, if you will allow no truth, but where there is no diuiſion? To Rome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, famous for unity, famous for peace. See now how happily you have choſen, how well you have ſped: Lo, Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, a witneſſe above exception, under his own hand acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the world and reckons up <hi>237.</hi> contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doctrine among the Romiſh Divins. What need we more evidence? O the perfect accordance of <hi>Peters</hi> See! worthy to be accorded for a badge of truth. Let now all our Adverſaries ſcrape to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo many contradictions of opinions among us, as they confeſſe amongſt themſelves, and be you theirs. No, they are not more peaceable, but more ſubtill; they have not leſſe diſſenſion, but more ſmothered. They fight cloſely within doors, without noiſe; all our frays are in the field; would God wee had as much of their cunning, as they want of our peace, and no more of their policie,
<pb facs="tcp:112669:4"/>
than they want of our truth. Our ſtrife is in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, theirs ſubſtance; ours in one or two points, theirs in all. Take it boldly from him that dares avouch it, there is not one point in all Divinitie (except thoſe wherein wee accord with them) wherein they all ſpeake the ſame. If our Church diſpleaſe you for differences, theirs much more; unleſſe you will be either wilfully incredulous, or wilfully partiall: unleſſe you diſlike a miſchiefe the leſſe for the ſecrecy. What will you do then? Will you be a Church alone? Alas, how full are you of contradictions to your ſelf! how ful of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary purpoſes! how oft do you chide with your ſelfe! how oft do you fight with your ſelf! <hi>I</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to that boſome which is privy to thoſe ſecret combates: beleeve me not, if ever you find perfect unity any where but above: either go thither and ſeek it amongſt thoſe that triumph, or be content with what eſtate you find in this warfairing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Truth is in differences, as Gold is in droſſe, Wheat in chaffe; will you caſt away the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,

the beſt grain, becauſe it is mingled with this Offall? Will you rather be poor and hungry, then beſtow labour on the Fan or Furnance? Is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth your reſpect but Peace? I have heard that the interlacing of Diſcords graces the beſt Muſick; and I know not whether the very evil ſpirits agree n<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t with themſelves. If the body be ſound, what though the coat be torn? or if the garment be whole, what if the lace be unript? Take you Peace; let me have Truth, I cannot have both. To conclude: Embrace thoſe Truths that we all hold, and it greatly matters not what you hold in thoſe wherein we differ: and if you love your ſafetie, ſeek rather grounds whereon to reſt, then excuſes for your unreſt. If ever you look to gain by the Truth, you muſt chuſe it, and cleave to it. Meere reſolution is not enough; except you will rather loſe your ſelf then it.</p>
