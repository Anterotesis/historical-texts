         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

theſe inconueniences, and to reform theſe deformities

Surely God hath ſet theſe examples before your eies

there is any common plague, or in time of other viſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
miniſter it to the ſicke man, and if he require it,

thys is not to tie neciſsitie of ſaluation to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

commendation. I certefye you, that you haue don wel,
and according vnto due order. &amp;c. But now we ſpeake
in good earneſt, when they anſwer this: Let them tell
vs, howe thys geare agreeth wyth the ſcriptures, and
whether it be not repugnant or agaynſt the worde of
God? But ſome will ſay that the baptiſme of women
is not commaunded by law. If it be not, why doe you

common experience teacheth that it is vſed
almoſt in all places, and fewe ſpeake agaynſt it. And
thys I am ſure of, that when it was put in the booke
that was the meaning of the moſt part that were then
preſent, and ſo it was to be vnderſtande as common
practiſe without controlment doth plainly declare.</p>
               <p>8 The publique baptiſme, that alſo is full of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhe
&amp; ſuperſtitious toyes. Firſt in theyr prayer they
ſay y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> God by the baptiſme of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt,
did ſanctify the floud Iordan, and all other waters, to
the myſticall waſhing away of ſynne, attributing that
to the ſigne whych is<note n="i" place="margin">1. Iohn. 1. 7 Act. 20. 28. Rom. 3. 24</note> propre to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> worke of God
in the bloud of Chriſte, as though vertue were in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to waſhe away ſinnes. Secondly, they require a
promiſſe of the godfathers and godmothers (as they
term them (whych is not<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 7. 15. 18. 21. Rom. 9. 16.</note> in theyr powers to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
Thirdly, they prophane holy baptiſme, in toying
fooliſhly, for that they aske queſtions of an infante,
whych can not anſwere, and ſpeake vnto them, as was
<pb facs="tcp:2165:13"/>
wont to be ſpoken vnto men, and vnto ſuche as being
conuerted, anſwered for themſelues, &amp; were baptized.
Which is but a mockery<note n="l" place="margin">Gala. 6. 7</note> of God, and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
the holy ſcriptures. Fourthly, they do ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
and wickedly inſtitute a new ſacrament, which
is proper to Chriſt only, marking the childe in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
with a croſſe, in token that heereafter he ſhall not
be aſhamed to confeſſe the fayth of Chriſte. We haue
made mention before of that wycked deuorſe of the
worde and ſacramentes. We ſay nothing of thoſe that
are admitted to be witneſſes, what ill choyſe there is
made of them, how conuenyent it were, ſeing the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the faythfull onely are to be baptized, that the
father ſhould and might, if conueniently, offer &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
his child to be baptized, making an open confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
of that faith, wherin he wold haue his childe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
as is vſed in well reformed churches.</p>
               <p>9 As for Matrimonie, that alſo hathe corruptions
too many. It was wonte to be compted a ſacrament,
and therfore they vſe yet a ſacramental ſigne, to which
they attribute the vertue of wedlocke. I meane the
wedding ring, which they fowly abuſe and dally with
all, in taking it vp, and laying it downe: In putting it
on, they abuſe the name of the Trinitie, they make the
newe marryed man, according to the Popiſh forme, to
make an idol of his wife, ſaying: with this ring I thee
wedde, with my body I thee worſhippe. &amp;c. And bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in Poperie, no holy action mighte be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

if he appeare not when he is ſent for, if he doe not as
hys ordinarie would, from whome he had his popiſhe
induction &amp; inſtitution, and to whom he hath ſworne,
Canonicam obedientiam, Canonicall obedience, if he
learne not hys Catechiſme like a good boye wythoute
booke, when it were more meete he ſhoulde be able to
teach others. To conclude: if he be not obedyent to all
theſe Lord biſhops officers, by and by he muſt be cut
of by excommunication. And as it is lightly graunted
and giuen forthe, ſo if the money be paide, and the
court diſcharged, it is as quickly called in again. Thys

better occupied. We ſtriue for true religion &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

throw out Antichriſt both head and taile, and that we
will not ſo much as communicate with the taile of the

by the head, go about to pull him in again by the taile,
cunningly colouring it, leaſt any man ſhould eſpie his
foote ſteppes, as Cacus did when he ſtole the Oxen,
For if it might pleaſe her maieſty, by the aduiſe of you

to heare vs by wryting or otherwiſe, to defende
our ſelues, then (ſuche is the equitie of our cauſe) that

THere be ſome men perhappes will
maruell, why we haue annexed the
priuate letters of theſe learned and
reuerende men to theſe Treatiſes,
ſeeing that it may ſeeme ſome iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vnto them, for that their conſent
is not there vnto. And beſides, not
written ſo aduiſedlye, as the publy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
in Print woulde require, whereout things may
be drawne agaynſte bothe parties, being written for
ſtay of ſtrife betwene bothe. But we truſt that bothe
the one &amp; the other will beare with vs in this behalfe.
Firſte, bicauſe the godly Brethren haue beene often
preſſed with priuate letters, as not to be of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the beſt learned, and that therfore we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
contentions, and ſo vnſtayed, that we ſeeke we
can not tel what. Againe, we haue for our example the
reuerende Byſhops, who to gette the better credite to
theyr cauſe, haue ſhewed vs a preſident of imprinting
ſome priuate letters, though we muſt needes ſay ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ſo good a cauſe, nor with halfe ſo muche equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And what thanke they had for ſo doing, as well
D. Bullingers letter written to a Noble man in thys
realme is witneſſe, as alſo this of Maiſter Gualters
which followeth. That whiche they did, was in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of corruptions, and no ſmall diſcredite to the
Authors, that which we do is in defence of the truth,
and to Gods glory, and no doubte to a ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendacion
of the wryters. Albeit we muſt nedes ſay

               </gap> the truthe of thys cauſe craueth no credit, neither
of theyr letters nor authoritie. For the ſcriptures are
manifeſt, and the woorkes of theſe godly and learned
men, I meane bothe of D. Bullingers, and M. Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
teſtifie howe farre of, they are from maintaining
any of the forenamed filthy corruptions. We beſeeche
thee therefore gentle Reader to iudge the beſt of our
doings: howſoeuer it fall out, this ſhall be our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort
the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, wherin we mind
to reſt, and to ſuffer willingly what ſo euer ſhalbe laid
<pb facs="tcp:2165:21"/>
vpon vs. Theſe godly men I hope will not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with vs, ſeeing we doe it for the truthes ſake, and
to purge them from ſuch a iudgement to defende cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
as the Biſhops by ſetting out theyr letters,
would ſeme to charge them. As for the former admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
if in the print they fynde many faults, let them
remember it was done ſpeedely, and as the extremitie
would ſuffer. For the matter, if any thing be iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,
it ſhall be amended, for the Treatiſe, if it be
thought too ſhort, it ſhall by Gods grace be enlarged.
We thoughte at the fyrſte onely to giue but a taſte of
theſe corruptions, to prouoke the patrons thereof to a
more full defence, which when it ſhall be ſet oute, we
minde more fully to ſhewe our meanings. In meane
time we beſeeche God to appeaſe theſe troubles, to
worke his peoples deliuerance from all Antichriſtian

            <p>HEalth in Chriſt. When we heard at

that matter did greatly aſtoniſh vs,

continuing and increaſing longer, ſhoulde bring ſome

as lay in vs to pacifye ſome certaine men, leaſt aboute
a thing not of anye ſuche great waighte, they ſhoulde
trouble or diſquiet them ſelues. And ſurely this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
of oure minde no whitte at all deceyued vs, if
thoſe things be true that we heare, to wit: that many
other things, beſides theſe garments are thruſt vpon
the Churches, and thoſe Miniſters caſt out from the
<pb facs="tcp:2165:21"/>
Churches, which will not ſubſcribe vnto the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of certaine men, whiche either abuſe the name of
the Queene, or elſe by theyr yeelding, make hir more
bolde in ſuche lyke matters, ſo that according to her
pleaſure, ſhee may ordaine what ſhee will. It increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
alſo our greefe, for that we ſee our letter to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed,
wherin we indeuorred to mitigate ſome one
or other man, and that the Godly brethren are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the aucthoritie of our name, &amp; ſo we to come
into ſuſpition with many, as thoughe we allowed po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhe
fylthineſſes or corruptions. In deede we coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled
certain Miniſters, that they ſhould not forſake
theyr Churches for a cappe or a ſurpleſſe, but that ſo
farre forthe as they might. (Keping godlineſſe ſound
and vntouched) they ſhoulde feede the Lords flocke.
In meane tyme we neuer haue allowed eyther theyr
ſuperſtition or fooliſhe toyes, whiche thruſte vppon
godly Miniſters ſuche things, and out of the Popes
ſchoole, or rather kitchen, ſcrape ſuche fylthineſſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
throughe whiche they make much trouble and
buſyneſſe to good paſtoures, and gyue offence to the

the Biſhops ſhoulde ſhewe them ſelues to be the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

not yeelde, ſhould be caſt out. I woulde to God they

fellowe ſeruauntes. For I ſee not howe farre they
differ from hys manners, who doe ſo eaſily allowe
the phantaſies of ſuperſtitious courtiers, and handle
godly Miniſters ſo vncurteouſly. Neither woulde
I euer haue thonghte that any could be found among
the Byſhoppes, which would haue ſhewed him ſelfe
an officer of this raſhneſſe, or at the leaſt haue confyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the ſame throughe cowardly diſſymulation. For
me thoughte that all this matter had ſprong from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

woulde haue defended the cauſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and haue ſoughte meanes, whereby this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe

            <p>There are I graunt among the brethren, certaine

the day will come, that we ſhall iuſtifie oure caſe in
bothe the poynts of this accuſation, before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeat of the ſonne of God. For as touching oure
doctrine, we are out of doubte: it agreeth with Gods
word: and I think it wil not be hard for vs to ſhew, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimplicitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ceremonies of this church, (wherof
we repent vs not at all) and the whole order of oure
Diſcipline, are drawne out of the ſame fountaine, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that we willingly acknowledge our ſelues to be
farre off from that, which ought to haue bene eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb facs="tcp:2165:23"/>
ere this. Moreouer, what heauing and craftie
dealing there hathe beene a late at Auguſta, agaynſte
all the Churches of theſe partes, and conſequently
alſo againſte youre Churches, and the Churches of
Fraunce, all which we thincke to agree with vs in all
poyntes of doctrine: I ſuppoſe it hathe bene reported
vnto you already. Which exceeding great miſcheefe
was ſuch, as though it ſhould not touch you at all, yet
ought it of right to moue you alſo, for the defacing of
ſo many and ſo great Churches. This therefore was
the cauſe, that the laſt winter, al the Churches of theſe
our quarters, (only Baſill excepted, bicauſe that they
a little afore, had by themſelues ſet forthe a lyke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion
in all poyntes, in effecte of matter,) did giue
our conſent to the common confeſsion written by our
brethren of Zurike, which great conſent we hope wil
yeeld moſt plentifull frute of concord. Afterwarde all
the French Churches folowed this preſident, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth a record of their agreing with vs: now if it
may pleaſe the Lord to graunt thus muche more, that
your &amp; the Scottiſh churches might alſo teſtifie your
agreeing with this common confeſsion of oures, by
ſome publike wryting: no doubt but it would greatly
auaile to the hindering, or rather to the vtter ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
of theyr deuices, which inforce our condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
vppon truſt of multitude rather than of reaſons:
and alſo woulde ſtirre vp manye men to trie oute the
true religion, who are nowe borne in hande, that oure
Churches are at debate among themſelues with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
diſcordes: that I may ſay nothing of manye
weake ones, whom (it is not to be doubted of) ſhould
be very muche ſtrengthened by the conſent of manye
nations. Conſidering therefore reuerende Father,
that this thing is very profytable for the Churche of
GOD, and righte agreeable to the charge of youre
ſelfe, and your reuerende fellowe offycers: I thincke
it a worthy matter for you, not only to take care of, but
alſo to preferre by all meanes to the Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie:
which charge I hartely deſyre you, yea, and for
<pb facs="tcp:2165:23"/>
Chriſtes owne ſake beſeeche you, that you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to goe throughe wyth, for the Churche of God.
But for as muche as I am once entred into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I beſeeche you of your gentleneſſe Reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that you will gently and patiently ſuffer me to
proceede a little further in a matter not altogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
this, ſyth no ambition (as God helpe me) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good will towardes the Engliſhe churches, dothe
moue me thereunto. There is a report brought vnto
vs, and the ſame is confyrmed by certaine mennes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
both out of Fraunce and out of Germany, that in
your countrie, many Miniſters of gods worde, (who
otherwiſe wer faultleſſe as well in life as in doctrine)
were put out of offyce by the Queenes maieſtie, euen
with the conſent of you Biſhops, bicauſe they re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſed
to ſubſcribe to ſome certaine Ceremonies. The ſumme
of which Iniunctions is reported to haue bene thys.
That they ſhould admit againe, not only the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
which were the Prieſtes badges in poperie: but alſo
certaine ceremonies which haue bene growne oute of
kinde long agoe into moſte fylthie ſuperſtitions, as
croſsing and kneeling at the Communicating of the
Lordes ſupper, and other things of the ſame ſtampe.
It is reported moreouer (which is muche greuouſer,
that Women are permitted to miniſter Baptiſme,
that there is authorit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

power of ordering Eccleſiaſticall matters, is giuen to
the Biſhoppes only, wythoute giuing the Miniſters
of ſeuerall Churches, ſo muche as any leaue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne.
I wrote agayne to thoſe freendes of mine,
That the church of God did perſwade it ſelfe farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wiſe, bothe of the Queenes maieſtie, and alſo of
ſo many learned and religious biſhops: and moreouer
that at the leaſt many of theſe things were (to my ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming)
eyther vtterly deuiſed by ſome malicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or at leaſt wiſe miſwreſted. Neuertheleſſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeche
you of your courteſye, that we maye haue ſome
conference of theſe matters betwixte oure ſelues. I
<pb facs="tcp:2165:24"/>
knowe there be two opinions concerning the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Churches. For there be ſome of opinion,
that nothing at all ſhould be added to the ſimplicitie
of the Apoſtolike church, and therfore that (wythout
exception) all things are to be done by vs which the
Apoſtles did, and whatſoeuer the Church that ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
next after the Apoſtles, hathe added to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former
things, they thincke they muſt be abolyſhed at once.
Contrariwiſe, there be other ſome, which thinke that
certaine of the olde ceremonies ouermore, are partly
to be held ſtil as profytable and neceſſary: and partly
to be borne withall for concordes ſake, although they
be not neceſſary. As for my part, I am out of doubt,
that the Doctrine of the Apoſtles was moſt perfect
in all poyntes, and that it is not lawfull for any man
to take any thing from it, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to putte any thing to it.
But as for theyr Ceremonies, I iudge a little other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of them. For fyrſt of all, it is certaine that at the
fyrſt ſpringing vp of churches: not eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles
themſelues were able to ſtabliſhe whatſoeuer they
thought expedient, and therfore that they proceeded
ſteppe by ſteppe, according as theyr ordaining of
Deacons ſheweth: in ſo muche as they did ſuffer for
a time euen many Iewiſhe things, like as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in theyr Stories. Againe, who doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth but
that the Apoſtles hadde a ſingular regarde of theyr
owne times, and alſo of the places and perſones, in
outwarde ceremonies? in ſo much as it is no likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode,
that the ſame ceremonies were in all poyntes
obſerued in all places, according as it appeareth wel
inough bi the notable Epiſtle of Irene vnto Victor.
Beſydes thys, euen very neceſsitie hathe abolyſhed
ſome traditions of theirs, as thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon refections.
Wherfore I am of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that all that hath ben don
by the Apoſtles in caſe of ceremonies, is not by and
by, nor without exception to be followed for a rule.
Neyther do I maruell that thoſe olde Fathers, vpon
conſyderation had to theyr owne tymes, haue abated
ſome of thoſe fyrſt things, or put ſomewhat to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2165:24"/>
And to conclude chaunged ſome. But euen they
them ſelues that I may ſpeake with theyr leaue plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what I thinke, had not as me ſeemeth ſo good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of Chriſtian ſymplicitie, and pureneſſe as
was meete. For fyrſte they oughte to haue conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the aboliſhing of the Ceremonies of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
by little and little, was not to ſette them vppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in time by another pretence: and alſo that the
Heatheniſh ceremonies were to be plucked vp by the
rotes, ſo as there might not any print of heathniſhnes
remain to be ſene, were it neuer ſo ſmal, according as
Moſes aduiſedly charged the Iſraelites at theyr en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the land of Chanaan. And therfore I think
them to haue ſinned ſore, how be it not vppon malice
which haue folowed both the law of Moſes and alſo
the manner of the heathen, for a rule in ordaining the
ceremonies of the churche: which thing howe buſily
they haue done, I ſuppoſe there is no man ignorant.
Againe, they ought to haue conſidered this alſo, that
the aboliſhing of the ceremonies of the law, was not
to bring in another bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage of ſeruice vpon it (for that
had not ben a taking away of the yoke of the law, but
an exchange of it) but rather to the ende that all men
ſhould behold Chryſt exhibited, from henceforth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed,
and walking in the cleere lyght, and nomore
darkened with any figures or ſhadowes. For (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as Auſtin complaining very greeuouſly of the
ſame matter, hathe rightly deemed) this ſame is the
cauſe why oure Lord ordained both fewer (that is to
witte but two, in ſtede of all the other former whiche
were innumerable) and alſo ſimpler and euidenter
ſacraments of the new teſtament. And therfore I ſay
againe, that they ſinned righte greeuouſly, as ofte as
they brought any Sacramentalles, (that is to ſay any
ceremonies to import ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſpiritual things)
into the church of God. Therfore, at one word for all
I am of opinion, that whatſoeuer hath ben conuerted
into the rites and cuſtomes of the chryſtians, eyther
from the Iewes or from the Painims, without Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:2165:25"/>
ordinance, and the aſſured example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:
and likewiſe, that all Sacramentall ceremonies
ought to be thruſt out of the church at once, whervnto
they could neuer be brought by any right: and that the
church cannot be reſtored to hir natiue beautie, ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
as they continue in it. Now remaine only ſuche cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
as pertaine only vnto comelineſſe: In whiche
caſe I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in many, euen of the auncienteſt biſhops. For fyrſt
of all, as concerning the miniſtration of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
wheras all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and it is no more lawfull for men to ordaine ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,

and wheras Chriſt the author both of the worde and
of the ſacraments, wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of them ſhould be very ſimple &amp; very few, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that he preſcribed a rule certaine of theſe holy
doings, vnto his true ſhepherdes in theſe woordes:
Doe ye this: I cannot wonder inoughe what reaſon
ſhould moue diuers men to be of opinion, that all the
whole furniture, wherwith euen y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ancienteſt fathers
of all thought themſelues to garniſh Baptim and the
Lordes ſupper, ſhould be helde ſtill with toothe and
naile: and ſome alſo ſhould thinke, that it ought to be
ſet vp againe in places where it is taken away as it
ought to be. If antiquitie be required: Chriſt is he
that gaue vs the Prophets and Apoſtles: and again,
by the Apoſtles, ſhepherds and teachers. If authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
required: Chryſte is the foundation, the Apoſtles
are the maiſter builders, and the ſhepherdes and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
are bound to build golde and ſiluer vppon that
foundation. Therefore lette the golde and ſiluer abide
ſtill: and as for the hay and chaffe, ſeing that the day
of the Lorde hathe diſcouered them, why I pray you
do we build them vp againe? Nay verily, why ſtriue
we ſo much for chaffe and ſtubble, or rather euen for
more trifling things than chaffe and ſtubble be: and
if not vtterly, yet at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> leaſt wiſe for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moſte part, why
neglecte we y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſubſtantiall and pretious building in
<pb facs="tcp:2165:25"/>
deede? But this complaint perchaunce agreed better
to the times wherein the fyrſt ſucceſſors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
liued, than to this doting olde age of the preſent
world. For I eſteeme the ſinnes of thoſe fathers as
vertues in compariſon of theyr vnlearned, heedeleſſe,
and ambitious ſucceſſors. For by what other termes
ſhould I call them, who beſides that they haue made
as great adoe aboute ceremonies only, as aboute the
whole ſumme of Religion, wheruppon hathe inſued
that horrible diſfyguring of all the parts of doctrine)
ſeme to haue had the ouer ruling of Goddes houſe to
none other intent, but to ouerthrowe it quite, being
already decayed. They that could not away wyth the
plaine faſhions of the Apoſtles, haue added a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ceremonies to the baptim of the new inſtructed.
It lyked ſome to haue them anoynted, as though they
ſhould haue gone to wreſtling: ſome to haue them
plucked out of Sathans power by certain coniurings
and breathings, as folk paſsing out of the diuels do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion

giuen them to taſte aforehand, as folke comming by
a newe kinde of life. All which things if I liſted to
go through with, what ende ſhould there be of theyr
maſking toyes, rather then chriſten ceremonies? But
(ſay they) ſo it behoued the heathen to be allured vnto
Chriſt. As who would ſay, that Chriſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
after Chriſte, coulde not haue prouided theſe
things. For ſurely, as for thoſe that make the apoſtles
authors of theſe toyes, they are not once worthe the
diſprouing, howe aunciente ſo euer they bee. I
pray you what a thing is this, that whereas it is the
propertie of chriſtian religion to do nothing in hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermudder
(for it is a trick of Sathans to ſhunne the
light): yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, many of thoſe auncienteſt
thought it good to hide the holy miſteries of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb facs="tcp:2165:26"/>
as if they had bene the miſteries of Ceres, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
muche as they admitted not the newly inſtructed
to the ſyght of them: yea, &amp; as for that whole action,
wherin looke whatſoeuer thing was fygured vnder a
fewe plaine tokens, the Lorde himſelfe bothe willed
and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the ſame to be openly preached and
publiſhed by his word, alowed and expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in ſuch
a tongue as all men vnderſtode, according as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was wont to do: they tranſformed it into certaine
ſecrete conceites, and into certain ceremonies ſcarcely
vnderſtode of many of the prieſtes themſelues. But
farre greater was the negligence of the biſhops that
ſucceeded: who conueyed that thing to the Chryſten
mennes infants, which was ordained for theyr ſakes
that paſſed out of Painimrie into Chriſtianitie, after
traynement in the fyrſt principles of Religion, being
already men growne. If any man do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te whether this
be ſo or no: I pray you let him conſyder the maner of
baptim according as the papiſts kepe it, and yet ſtill
by tradition from furtheſt antiquity, ſauing that they
haue added a few things of theyr owne, and held ſtil
the ſtraunge language, whiche at that time was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the Weſt and the South. For there they that
are to be baptized, are bidden not onely to render a
reaſon of theyr faythe: but alſo come to be baptized.
Which thing althoughe manie; (among whome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin
himſelfe is one) haue gone aboute to excuſe by
ſome qualifycation: ſaying that the Godfathers and
Godmothers are demaunded, and doe make anſwer
in the childrens names: yet notwithſtanding, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, that this is but a weake deuice, to cloke the
thing by ſome coloure, which was crept in by abuſe?
for I beſeeche you, if baptim may not be miniſtred,
without preſent vnder taking for the faith of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that is to be baptized: for except that be graunted;
wherfore I pray you is the childe that comes to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening,
demaunded of his faythe:) to what purpoſe
is baptim haſtened? and why rather do we not delay
baptim, vntill ſuch time as thoſe that are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb facs="tcp:2165:26"/>
maye be able to profeſſe theyr owne faythe, as the
Catabaptiſtes do, which God forbid. And I am oute
of doubte, that thys negligence of the Biſhops, whome
it behooued of neceſſytie to haue putte a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the chriſtenyng of babes, and the chryſtening
of men growne, as in reſpecte of ſome outwarde cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies)
hathe cauſed many to delaye the chriſtening of
theyr children the longer, howe be it that they dyd not
well in ſo doing: Notwithſtanding, that the ſayde er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was not eſpied in olde time, (no not euen of inanye
Byſhops) euen thys one thing declareth, That Nazy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzene
being a Biſhoppes ſonne, was aboue twentie
yeres old ere he was chriſtened. Muche leſſe had thys
opinion taken roote, of the neceſsitie of Chryſtening
vnto ſaluation, whiche opinion the Byſhoppes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke
broughte in afterwarde in reſyſting Pelagius.
And the cauſe whye I make mention of theſe matters,
is for that (among other things) it is ſayde that in
youre Countrye the little Babe that is to be Chriſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is demaunded of his faythe by the Miniſter.
And I woulde gladlye learne of you reuerende Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vppon what probable reaſon, or vppon what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that pertaineth to the edifying of Goddes Church,
the ſame cuſtome is grounded. As for the ſigning<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of
folke with the croſſe, althoughe it be very auncient: yet
ſurely I ſee not what profyte it can bryng: and all be it
the ſame is wonderfully, and altogither ouer reaching<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commended (ſpeciallye by Chryſoſtome,) as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſumme of the chriſten Religion: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in as muche as it is not grounded vppon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of Gods woorde, or vppon any example of the
Apoſtles, (for I make no reckening of vnauthoriſed
ſtuffe) that is to ſay, foraſmuche as it is vtterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Gods woorde, and pertaineth not in anye wiſe
vnto comlyneſſe, but (to be ſhorte) hathe bene the fyrſte
opener of the gappe vnto that mooſte abhominable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
and worſhipping of the croſſe, the horribleſt
of all Idolatries: I can leſſe fynde in my hearte that it
ſhoulde be nombred among thoſe things indifferent,
<pb facs="tcp:2165:27"/>
than the braſen ſerpent of Ezechias, whoſe example it
would become all chriſtian Princes to folow, chefely
in this caſe, that is to ſay in ouerthrowing the Idols
of croſſes and crucifixes. But whereas childrenne
that are to be chriſtened, are offered in the open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the church, rather in honeſt than in coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparell: where as there is vſed a certaine conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
forme of prayer, and expoſition of baptim: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the godfathers and godmothers are preſent to take
charge of the holy bringing vp of the child: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wheras the children be ſprinkled with cleare water
taken reuerently in cleane handes according to the
forme appointed by Chriſte: conſidering that theſe
rites be ſimple, honeſt, and in no wiſe magicall, and
finally ſuche as can not giue any occaſion of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
who is he that dares condemne them, except he
wil be reproued by the expreſſe words of Paule, who
giueth commaundement, that in the Lords houſe all
things ſhould be done fitly and orderly? Furthermore
as touching the Lords ſupper, who can refraine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
to declare howe miſerably it is transformed into
that olde ſtagelike frisking &amp; horrible Idol gadding?
That the vndiſcrete zele of ſuche as were not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the ſimpleneſſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
opened the fyrſte gap to this corruption, I thincke it
needeth not many wordes to proue it, for as much as
bothe the olde and the newe ſeruices, as well of the
Eaſt as of the Weſt, which are ſo muche the vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as they be done with more ſolemnitie, doe moſte
manifeſtly proue the matter to be ſo. And heere I
dout not, but you haue well marked how wily ſathan
hath ſhewed himſelfe. For who would not thinke,
that the vſing of an altar, or of ſome table were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
thing? Therfore by little and little, Altares
were brought in in ſtead of tables: verely bicauſe the
common tables, (which neuertheleſſe the auncient
fathers vſed euen for theyr bankets) ſeemed not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
well with ſo ſtately ſeruice. Heerevppon ſathan
tooke fyrſte occaſion to transforme this holy action,
<pb facs="tcp:2165:27"/>
(which was ordained, not to giue, but to receiue
Chriſte) into a propitiatorie ſacrifice, that is to ſay,
moſte ſhamefully to treade vnder foote the deathe of
Chriſt, which is there declared. They were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with common and plaine ſongs, and therfore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of beutifying this holy action, that buſie
and curious prickeſong &amp; deſcanting was brought in,
more mete for ſtage playes, for the moſt part, then for
an holy action, and more fyt to delite the eare, then to
ſtirre vp the minde. A thing ſurely for this reſpect not
only vnprofitable, but alſo very hurtfull, that in that
noiſe, no man coulde well marke what was ſayde: ſo
that the matter it ſelfe dothe plainly conuince, that the
true worſhip of God was by this meanes eſpecially
transformed into vaine, and at the length mere ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſongs. A ſimple and common furniture pleaſed
them not, nor was agreeable, therfore they ſought out
marble, they guilded walles, they prouided veſſelles
of golde and ſiluer, and theyr miniſters beganne to be
attired in pretious and Biſhoppelike, yea, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perourelike
garments, and all forſothe to honoure the
ſacramente with all. And ſo forthwith theſe were the
meanes and inſtrumentes to foſter and cheriſhe rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
to neglecte true charitie, and to be ſhorte, to
bring in foliſh and ſtagelike furniture. They were not
content with a ſimple breaking of the breade, whiche
notwithſtanding is not the leaſt parte of this action,
therfore little round cakes began to be giuen to each,
and the order apointed of the Lord, was abrogated.
It pleaſed them not to giue the breade into theyr
hands while they were ſytting or ſtanding, as in olde
times it was, but it ſeemed them good to haue it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vp, as it were, to worſhip it, and afterwarde was
kneeling vſed, and choſe rather to haue a morſell put
in to theyr mouthe, for more reuerence ſake forſothe.
And that this was the fyrſt beginning of that moſte
horrible bread worſhip, whiche can not yet be aboly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ed,
who ſeeth not? Nowe then ſeeing theſe things
<pb facs="tcp:2165:28"/>
are ſo, and the moſte dolefull and ſorowfull euente of
theſe honors vnſeaſonably and prepoſterouſlye giuen
to oure holy things dothe more then ſuffyciently teache
vs, how far better it were for vs to content oure ſelues
with the ſymple inſtitution of Chriſte, then with an
vntowardly zeale to faſhion or deuiſe anye of theſe
things: he doth beſt of all in my minde, which aboly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
theſe things, (althoughe not wicked of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
yet as not neceſſary, and very little profytable,
although they be well vſed, but very much hurtfull, as
the moſt heauie ſtate of churches ſheweth and ſetteth
forth,) with no leſſe earneſtneſſe, then moſte euidente
Idolatrie. For I pray you, if there were a ſtone ſet for
ſome purpoſe in the parting of two wayes, whereat
ntowithſtanding, all men, vnleſſe they were very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpecte,
mighte fall with daunger of their liues,
whether were it better to take that ſtone at once out of
the way, or to let it alone, and daily to warne the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
on which hande they were beſt to goe, if they
would not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mble? For if theyr directours ſhould be
either ſlouthfull, or not circumſpect inoughe, in vayne
might they admoniſh a great number. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
we thinke that rites which are neceſſary for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and comelyneſſe, are to be retained, as, that vppon
certaine dayes, and at certaine houres, the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
ſygnes, being taken oute of cleane veſſels, be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
giuen and receyued, and what ſo euer is of like
ſorte, pertaining rather to an honeſt, than an ambici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manner. Nowe if a man aſke me, whether I
thinke that nothing at all of theſe things, which are of
themſelues indifferent, may be retained, at leaſt for
the weakes ſake, and whether the miniſtery oughte to
be forſaken, rather then any ſuche thing ſhoulde be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
eſpecially if this caution be namely added, that
theſe things are eyther broughte in, or as yet tolerate
not properly to binde mennes conſciences, but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good conſyderations. I anſwere, that I thinke
not, that congregations may be forſaken for garments
and cappes, or ſome ſuche like mere indifferent and
<pb facs="tcp:2165:28"/>
mene thing. But fyrſt of all, I think that there are man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
things, which of themſelues being indifferent, yet
for an opinion of worſhippe annexed vnto them, can
ſkarſly or not at all be eſchued, ought to be counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſuperſtitions, or ſurely amongſte very needy
occaſyons of ſuperſtition. Moreouer this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
that many things may be tolerated for the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake,
which notwithſtanding oughte not to be renued,
after they are once taken away. For that this were not
to take away an infyrmitie: but rather, in ſome reſpect,
to reſtore it when it is taken awaye, and not to call it
backe, after it is departed, ſo that I maruell not, that
many men in this caſe ſhewe them ſelues harder in the
reſtoring of certaine things, then perhaps they would
haue bene at the beginning, when they were in hand,
to take them away. Moreouer and beſides. I ad this
that to my thinking, weakenes is falſly pretended in
that kingdome, wherin ſo many yeres already, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
hath bene preached and receiued, yea and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
wyth the bloud of ſo many excellent martyres. If
ſo be that the Apoſtle did rightly chide the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
for that when they had begon in the ſpirite, they
went backe againe to the fleſhe, how muche more may
it be lawfull to ſay the ſame of you Engliſhe men, if
peraduenture after that ye haue began in the ſpirite,
you fall backe againe (as God forbid) not as they did
to the fleſhe, that is to ſay, to Moiſes his ceremonies,
whereof God was the author, but to the trifles and
traſhe of mennes traditions. Laſt of all, I will not be
afraide to ſay this, truſting to your equitie, if they doe
amiſſe which had rather depart from theyr congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then to ſuffer thoſe things to be thruſte vppon
them againſte theyr conſcience, that they are in greate
fault before God and his Angels, which had rather a
bide to haue flockes depriued of paſtors, and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
laide of moſte horrible confuſion by the paſtors
forſaking of theyr congregations, then to ſee miniſters
otherwiſe without fault, to vſe rather thys then that
apparell: and that in ſome places there ſhoulde rather
<pb facs="tcp:2165:29"/>
be no ſupper giuen to the hungrie ſheepe, then that
kneling ſhould be omitted. Which things, if they ſhuld
be there done amongſte you, (as God forbidde that I
ſhould thinke that they are done) ſurely they would be
beginnings, not of former, but of far greter calamities.
Againe I beſeeche you, reuerende father, that if I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
heerein, you would paciently bear with me ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
not of ambition or malice, but (as the Lorde
knoweth,) of rudenes and vnſkilfulnes. If it be true
that is commonly reported, and I am not yet perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that baptiſme is priuately permitted to women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you, I can not tel what is to go backe from the
gole to the barriers, if this be not. For firſt of all from
whence ſprang this moſt filthy error, but from a groſe
ignorance of the matter of the ſacrament. Who ſo euer
is not waſhed in water, is condemned ſay they which
are the patrones of this prophanation of baptiſme. If
it be ſo, the ſaluation of infants ſhall come, not from
the couenaunt of god, (which notwithſtanding is the
endoubted ground of our ſaluation) but from the ſeale
annexed vnto the conenaunte (and that not to make it
more certaine in it ſelfe, but rather to certify vs of it.
And that more wicked is, the ſaluation of infants ſhal
wholely conſiſt in the diligence or negligence of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
But ſeeing, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> excellent ſeruaunt of God D. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Martyr, as you right well knowe, reuerend father,
a good while a goe diſputed of this matter at large in
his commentaries wrytten to that godly king Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
and that, as I thinke, with the conſent of the
whole Engliſhe churche in thoſe dayes, I woulde not
now at large diſcourſe vppon this matter. This only
I ſay, if that reporte ſhoulde be true, it were greatly to
be lamented to ſee them now to tourne back as it were
to the barryers, which ſhoulde haue rather bene come
euen to the gole, eſpecially hauing had ſuche guides
and maſters. But if thoſe things ſhall be true, whiche
ſeeme not to me probable, that Metropolitanes pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
and put in vre thoſe moſt filthy abuſes which are
more intollerable then ought elſe in the church of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:2165:29"/>
as pluralities of benefices, licences of not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydences,
to contracte Matrimonie, and for eating of
fleſhe, and ſuche like, as it were ſurely not a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of chriſtianitie, which I ſpeake with horror, but a
manifeſt falling away from Chriſt, and therfore they
were not to be condemned, but rather to be praiſed:
which would oppoſe them ſelues againſt ſuche ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors.
Moreouer by what right, whether ye reſpect the
word of God, or all the olde Canons, may either the
ciuil Magiſtrate by himſelf, where congregations are
already erected and eſtabliſhed, bring in vppon them
any new rites, or abrogate the olde: or the Biſhoppes
wythoute the iudgement and conſent of theyr Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
of duetie ordaine any thing, I haue not yet lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But bicauſe I ſee that theſe two plagues, that is
to ſay, the diſhoneſt and ambitious flattery of former
Biſhops, partly abuſing the vertuous Princes, and
partly ſeruing theyr euil affections and vices haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
vndone the Church, vntil the matter came to this
paſſe, that the mightyeſt of the Metropolitanes of the
Weſt, by the iuſte iudgemente of God, ſo puniſhing
Magiſtrates and Biſhops, had ſcratched and raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
vnto himſelfe all matters bothe diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.
I muſt needes confeſſe that I am aſtoniſhed &amp;
amaſed, ſo often as I think of theſe things, and I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,
that eyther the ſame, or more greeuous puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
do agayne hang ouer the moſt part of people, which at
the firſt, with great affection, embraced the goſpel, and
now by little and little fall from it. And I dout not but
the good in what place ſo euer, doe in like ſort lament,
whome the Lord heare, and for his ſonne Ieſus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes
ſake giue vnto Kings &amp; Princes a true, godly, and
religious mind, and graunt them good and ſtout coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
&amp; to the gouernors of his church, eſpecially his
holy ſpirite, &amp; moſt aboundant knowledge and zeale, &amp;
moreouer increaſe and preſerue the people which haue
already profeſſed the true fayth in ſinceritie of doctrine
and rites, and godly manners.</p>
            <p>You ſee (reuerende father) howe farre this heate,
<pb facs="tcp:2165:30"/>
as it were hathe enforced me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I beſeeche you, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

too muche. It remayneth that I commend in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtant
