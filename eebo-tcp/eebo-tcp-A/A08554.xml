            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The first Chapter. How the Princesse Rosselia of Rome, being deliuered from the Inchantment, desired her father to bee reuenged on Don Heleno, Prince of Dacia; and of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereof.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O many were the harmes receiued of the princes of the Gréekes, (most Noble Lord) that in all the Pagans countreys there was no spéech of any thing, but of reuenge, and that, the most cruell that might be: for those which were grieued, were so great Monarches, that each of them determined to inuade <hi>Greece</hi> apart; particularly, <hi>Bembo,</hi> who drue his pedegree from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe most toucht, séeing the Gréeke louer to beare away the spoyles, which were due to his worth and valour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:3"/>Well had the Pagan some body else, who likewise was grieued for him. For <hi>Proserpina</hi> below in her darke king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, through the malice which she bare against the Gréeks, entreated her beloued <hi>Pluto,</hi> for aid in the behalf of <hi>Bembo,</hi> against the Grecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The infernall prince was so subiect to his wiues request, that he commanded Discord to be called, whom, with the greatest company that possibly might bée, he commanded presently to depart, &amp; to leaue neither armes nor lance on end, which should not bee bent against the Gréekes: for the Grecians bold attempts were not to bée endured. Discord felt it selfe some thing grieued, euer since the time of the venturous <hi>Octauius Augustus</hi>; for her arme being vnable to resist the valor of that yong man, he peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably possessed the whole world; wherefore it was an easie matter to make her leaue that infernall habitation: shée was well accompaned; for with her went Ambition, and Ielousy, friend to the blind god, and there went Auarice and the rest of the infernall Furies. Discord sallied, armed at all pieces, in russet armour, with a sword in each hand, &amp; vpon her shoulders a bright shining Mirrour; a signe, that as she pardoned none, so would she go in safetie from her enemies, accounting all for such Couetousnes marched with her spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, which made all she saw séeme greater, with a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous aspect. The first place attempted, was in <hi>Morea,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the braue <hi>Epirabio,</hi> to the ende y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in seruice of his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciana</hi> he should repaire into Grecia, there nowe to recouer that, which before, by his late comming he had lost. They knew how to take so good order, that although the Prince went with his confederates, al the kingdom was in an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore, to attend the seruice of their soueraigne Lord. The king of <hi>Lituania</hi> was already summoned, to the ende that, with the greatest forces that he was able to make, he should draw nere vnto <hi>Niquea.</hi> Couetousnesse encountred this man, and in such sort ouercame him, that at the instant hée beganne to order his people, wich were many and well armed.</p>

There is no Uiper, which sheweth it selfe so cruel, as a faire Ladie doth against him, whem shee hath once loued as her soule. Iealousie crossed in the middest, vntill she was wholy ouercome, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her to aske cruell vengeance of her father, for that which the <hi>Dacian</hi> had committed. They made herto adde thereunto, which was, that the Emperour asking her, whether there past any promise of Mariage? Shée (beeing blinded with passion) answered her Father, Yea.</p>
               <p>Wrath approched in so good a time, that a Basiliska returneth not more wrathfull, then the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Constantius</hi> shewed himselfe to bee against the Gréekes: he presently commanded a Councell to be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in this case: there entred thereinto <hi>Arsiano,</hi> the braue Prince of Almany, whom Dishonour had already ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, bringing to his minde, the disgrace whereinto <hi>Don Heleno</hi> the Prince of Dacia had brought him: and as his voyce was the first, and he well disposed thereto, hee gaue his opinion, that by fire and sword, vengeance should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. No man gainesaid this passionate yong man. The alarme was spéedily giuen in Rome, and in all the Townes subiect thereto.</p>
               <p>Thither came the Kings of Zerssa, of Carthage and of Argier, all which were friends to the Romanes.</p>
               <p>The king of Rodes failed not in this warre. As for the furious Almaine, he thought with his owne people alone to giue battell to the whole world: for he left not in all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, neyther high nor low, one man that was able for the warres.</p>
               <p>The King of Scotland came with a mightie Hosse, in
<pb facs="tcp:13979:4"/>
fauour of the Romane Empire, for the friendship he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Daughters. Discord was yet of greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for it passed into Gibia, leading Reuenge by the hand, where she published the death of their Princes, by the hands of the Dacian Lord in Rome: their death was there alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vnderstood, and mourned for.</p>
               <p>But those infernall furies knew how to take so good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that all that whole populous Kingdome was at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in an vprore: who had a yonger brother, and the most valiant man in all those kingdomes, called <hi>Brundusio</hi> the strong, who although that hee were not a Gyant of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, yet there was no man (how strong soeuer) that was able to resist his force, which yet was not knowne to be borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He spéedily began to leuie people, gathering together the Borderers, which were braue Knights, with many proud Gyants, which excéeded two thousand: of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the strong <hi>Brundusio</hi> raysed an hundred thousand figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men, and with them hee went to ioyne himselfe with the Romanes, carrying sufficient prouision for many daies, perceyuing that the warre would be of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. The Emperour of his ariuall receyued him with great ioy, séeming vnto him, that with that people, and the rest which he would leuie, it were a small matter to subdue the whole world: they would not inuade the Gréekes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aduertising them of their departure, déeming that it would bee attributed to their small valour, although it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a most cruell nauall warre, as that which passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them and the Soldan of Egypt, which would giue them notice, that they were daily to expect them. Herewith was there made a most proud defyance, signed by xii kings, which were ioyned in that confederacie with the mightie Romane, who of himselfe and of his adherents, had leuied aboue foure hundred thousand most ready and expert Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: for amongst them went the fierce <hi>Almaines,</hi> a people through all the world held for valiant.

The King knowing of their comming, with the most principal that were with him, went forth to receyue them, taking the King of the Garamants by the hand, to do him the greater honour: they al let them down to heare the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassade of so mightie a Monarch as the Soldan of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quea. As they all expected the Ambassade of the Soldan, the valiant King of the Garamants, making a little reuerence, drew out a sealed Letter of credence, and giuing it to the great Emperour of Rome, <hi>Constantius</hi> looke it, and with a loude voyce a king of Armes read it, which said thus:

The valorous <hi>Coriandro,</hi> who went in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the foure Gyants &amp; the Damsell, answered him, that therein went certaine Knights of Rome, into Grecia, to defie the Gréekes.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll those which haue weighed the great trauell of Imagination, with such sound considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so aduisedly, as is requisite, (most noble Prince) haue iudged it very great; and not without much reason: for he who will please many, must seeke out matter different: for that which to one is loathsome, another holdeth for pleasant and swéet; and to hit right to please many, is impossible: for euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene thrée that are inuited, there is great difference in tasts: as he said, who had wel experimented the same, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race.</hi> I say so, because it is not possible in so large an histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as this, which I now haue in hand, but to bee tedious, with the diuersitie of Chapters: although that if men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate should be Iudges therein, this is the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meane to entertaine that can be.</p>
               <p>But of force, séeing I take this way, I must haue recourse
<pb facs="tcp:13979:5"/>
to pardon, and to treat somewhat (leauing so many defian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) of the noble <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> who with some amorous griefe tooke his leaue of <hi>Rosabel,</hi> both woondring at what they saw the one in the other: but it made it the lighter, to sée the valorous kinsemen which he had, and what it behooued him to doe, to be called brother to so great Princes, and Unkle to such a Knight; for yet to <hi>Claridiano</hi> he was vnknowne. With this conceit he retyred to embarke him, where his Damsel attended his comming, feareful that his long stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might be the occasion, that he should not come in time with his succours; for the most accomplished Lady in all Samogacia, had grounded her hopes vpon him. At his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, she told him, what paine she endured, and the cause thereof. Great griefe would it be to me, faire Damsel, (said the resolute yong man) if my staying should giue occasion of any defect, and I should be very glad if you would shew me your necessitie; for since our comming out of Gréece, we haue had no place for it: and séeing that now the Seas and fortune haue giuen it, I should bee very glad thereof. All shall be perfourmed, valorous Prince of Tinacria, séeing the life of her which sent me to séeke, resteth in your hands: and because you shall be the more willing to procure her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, harken, and you shall heare the greatest and most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, that euer was vsed to Lady; for if you be sworne to the lawes of loue, you shall vnderstand how vniustly my Lady is condemned to an infamous death: and vnderstand, that in the great and populous kingdome of Samogacia, there is a King, who for his valour and person is worthie to be King of the vniuersall world; it pleased the Heauens to giue him sonnes and daughters, which is the greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the world, and fortune willing to try his valour, with taking them all away from him, leauing him one onely daughter, of whom it is said, that the summe and ful perfection of beautie, and accomplishment of qualities, is included in her shape and goodly proportion: for in her, beautie is no hinderance to her discretion, with both which
<pb facs="tcp:13979:6"/>
graces she is adorned in the highest degrée that may be, and so haue they giuen her a name conformable to her constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (calling her <hi>Celibella</hi>:) for her beautie séemeth rather heauenly, then of the earth; where, if ought be excellent, yet it bringeth with it some ill-fauoured abatement. With this Lady, the Princes of <hi>Podolia</hi> fell in loue, Knights to whom nature had shewed her selfe very bountifull, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with what is most desired: she made them equals, to the end that as brothers, and so like in proportion, but that by their names, no man could haue knowne them: the elder was called <hi>Daristeo</hi> of Podolia, and the yonger <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>: Both at their comming affected the Kinges fair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Daughter, wooing her with many Tiltings and Turneyes, which they caused for her sake, wherein they were both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in equall degrée. As to subiect the mind in these lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers cases, is reserued to loue onely, it ordained for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euill, that <hi>Celibella</hi> most affected the younger, not for that he had more then the other, but that fortune thought it an honourable trophe to triumph of these two louers: with her eies did this faire Dame giue her beloued gallant to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, to what estate fortune had brought her: but they had so small hope of béeing beloued, that notwithstanding that she shewed it with a thousand good countenances, yet he could neuer be perswaded, that she loued him: for as that Lady is the <hi>Phoenix</hi> of beautie, hee held a fauour from her hand, to be such a thing, as loue it selfe could not deserue, and so they procéeded in their loues a-vie, without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the one the other with the secret of their mindes. It was no small griefe to the Ladie, that <hi>Rosaner</hi> could not perceiue how well she loued him; and for the Lady to make shew thereof by any signes or other meanes, she would not for any thing in the world, well knowing, how much she should therein preiudice her honour: with the often fauours and publike prayse, which she gaue to whatsoeuer this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant did, he was partly perswaded that she loued him: but yet he could hardly beléeue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fortune would be so fauorable.
<pb facs="tcp:13979:6"/>
At this instant, wherein <hi>Celibella</hi> shewed her selfe most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected vnto him, accepting of the endeuours and exployts which <hi>Rosaner</hi> performed in her seruice, there was brought to the Court a kinsewoman of this Ladies, who was the beginning and ending of all these mishaps: She truly was fayre; for somewhat being of kinne to the Kings daughter, claue to her. As my Lady was young, and a nouice in loue, she was of opinion, that it was much ease to disclose it: some others are of the same opinion: but for my part, I vtterly condemne it: for there is no greater griefe, then to reueyle the secrets of the heart, whereby the renowne may be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and from whence nothing is drawne, but the Lady to subiect her selfe to the party to whome shee reueyleth her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, who also (peradu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ture) will hold her for more light in discouering it, then for being in loue. This hapned some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. The vnwary Lady trode these reasons vnder foot, &amp; told all to <hi>Felina,</hi> for so was her kinswoman called. The discouery of this secret serued not to yeeld any ease to the Lady, but to incite her kinsewoman to fall in loue with the Prince <hi>Daristeo,</hi> and that in so good earnest, that shée spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily made it appeare. But as hee was so engoulfed in the loue of <hi>Celibella,</hi> he tooke no notice with what affection <hi>Felina</hi> shewed her selfe to be his. The Lady Princesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued it well, and receyued no small pleasure therein, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that therewith <hi>Daristeo</hi> would leaue to bee so ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of her, for the beauty of her kinsewoman was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell worthy to be beloued. There were often meetings in the hall betwéene these foure louers: but I know not who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to agrée them, for with my tongue I am not able; for neyther partie left to loue, though it were not accepted. It appeared in their eyes: for the two brothers fixed theirs vpon the Princesse, and she with new spoyles beholdeth her <hi>Rosaner,</hi> making her eyes fat with beholding him. But her cousin being touched to the quick, with apparant signes giueth testimony of her loue, in beholding her <hi>Daristeo,</hi> in whom she onely delighteh, and from whom she draweth
<pb facs="tcp:13979:7"/>
her life; and although she were but a nouice in that occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the carelesnes wherewith the prince answered her, put her in such care, as I thinke no body hath béene more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for from that time forward, her griefe was such, as her cousin was very sory for. This amorous passion did so much pinch her, that shée knew no meanes how to remedie it, neither saw any possibilitie; for the prince neuer tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regard of the fauours which shee shewed him: which was worse then death to this afflicted Lady, who grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desperate, would haue taken any course for remedy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though somewhat dishonourable.</p>
               <p>As the king loued these Princes, holding them in place of sonnes, although he had not yet determined vpon whom be would bestow his daughter <hi>Celibella</hi>: so had they oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to discourse with the lady, who seeing that her father was well pleased therewith, forbare it not, making shewe that to be the cause, concealing the trueth. <hi>Rosaner</hi> being the man who wore the palme, his brother could neuer ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it, thinking with himselfe, that if the Ladyes affection were guided by reason, he was rather to be beloued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his brother: but loue led it another way, without respect of the large kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whereof he was prince; for to him which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly loueth, it neuer representeth the qualities of the thing beloued: but only what is in self, which otherwise were but a fayned loue: and so the Lady loued the fortunate yong man, not with a litle enuy of loue, séeing what was enioyed.</p>
               <p>The passionate cousin was shée, who sped worst in this businesse; for although that the Princesse loued not <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steo,</hi> yet he was neuer perswaded that shee loathed him: for the discreet Lady bestowed some fauours vpon him, which were a meane to entertaine the Prince, and hée held himselfe happy, to obtaine so much at her handes. But poore <hi>Felina</hi> neither perceiued any shew that she was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, neither was there any end in vnderstanding her ill hap in being not regarded by him, whom shee loued better then her selfe. In this meane while, the braue <hi>Furiandro,</hi> bastard
<pb facs="tcp:13979:7"/>
sonne to the king of <hi>Podolia</hi> (which hée gat in his yong yéeres, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a most strong woman in the mountaines <hi>Rifei</hi>) came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court to séeke these 2. brothers: he proued so fierce and valiant, (that they say) that in valour he doeth exceede the great god <hi>Mars</hi>; for there is no knight, no, although they be ten, nay twenty, that are able to kéep y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field against him, neither any Gyant, how fierce so euer he be: he is beloued of the common people; for hee is not of that condition, which such men commonly are of, which excéede all other in force and strength of body: but he is rather courteous and a great friend &amp; fauourer of Ladies, although that in this occasion (I maruaile not) he haue shewed himselfe cruell to <hi>Celibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> Much did the princesse reioyce at his comming, &amp; all the whole court; for the feastes were renewed, wherein it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible &amp; not to be beléeued, what that furious knight did: for he was séene at one blow, to strike downe both horse and man; all men gaue him the prize for valiant. The king re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected him according as was reason, for his valour &amp; good gouernment; for that was it, which most aduanced him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others. All this was nothing, neither the assurance which shée saw of her paine, to cause <hi>Felina</hi> to giue ouer her determination, but rather increase it, attempting one of the boldest &amp; most presumptuous enterprises of the world, from whence could ensue no other thing, but that which followed: for vnable to endure to sée her self so little respected, she adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to say vnto the prince <hi>Daristeo,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the princesse would expect him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> night in the garden, to confer with him of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. There could nothing happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more pleasing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infortunate prince, then such a message; for as it was a thing vnlooked for, now holding him selfe assured thereof, he held himself y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most happy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world: he held y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day for as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as a mans life: he thought the night fled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute he held for a yere, such was his desire to meet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy princesse. The subtil <hi>Felina,</hi> séeing her plot to take effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> took a sute of <hi>Celibellas,</hi> which did best set out her beauty, &amp; clad her self therwith: &amp; as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> heauens would not frustrate

what she had exployted, so could not the gallant sée, whether it were the Princesse, or shée. But hee comming into the garden, lesse armed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was néedfull, went to the window, so passionate, that he knew her not. The cruell damsell cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

As he should haue made an answere, in an alley among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The cause hereof is the little confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which I repose in my owne deserts and worthinesse, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to so great a good, as to bee beloued by your beauty, neyther can I leaue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the high estate you hold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vnderstanding who he was, or imagining any thing of his brother: for now Fortune would néeds shewe her mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability against these two Louers: with the greatest sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennesse of the world, the beloued <hi>Rosaner</hi> ranne vpon his deare brother, not knowing who hee was.

betwéene them a most cruell battaile, but the elder had the worser, not through want of force, but of armes &amp; fortune. Although the other had receiued some hurts, yet they were but small. The furious louer would néeds close with <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steo</hi>; but therein he sought his owne death: for the desperate yong man being deadly wounde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The elder brother had not yet so much lost his memorie, but that he followed the blow, vntil the point of the sword pierced through his brothers braines.</p>
               <p>These faithfull louers came to fall iust together, losing with one onely blow, their liues, ielousies, and loue, and the greatest good of the world, which was the fayre Lady. The vnhappy <hi>Felina</hi> stood beholding this battaile, vntill that she sawe them fall: then sorrowing their death, with her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes shée disqueted all the Palace, and falling downe in the euill which shee had done, without dissembling it, neither had she strength to auoid the punishment, she her selfe being her owne executioner; for euen in the same attyre as shee stood, she cast her selfe headlong out at the window, falling vpon her head betwéene the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some others did suspect it, to sée the brotherly death betweene two louers.</p>
               <p>It caused extréeme sorrow in all the court: for the king shewed himselfe very sorrowfull (as was reason) to sée so pitifull a chance.

There was nothing but did put her in minde of her knight; and to remember him, it was death to her: and hauing no more comfort but what shee reaped from her teares, which were so many which shee shed, for that lamentable mischance, that it bereaued her of a great part of her beauty. All the Court was in an vproare; the king in making search for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murderers, could take no rest, so as in the citie there was nothing but suspition and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The most valiant <hi>Furiander</hi> disturbed all, forgetting what he had promised when he took the order of knighthood, that hee should neuer take part against any Lady; for as ech of his brothers had discouered vnto him part of his loue, and séeing how much they were tormented, and how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse she was thereof, which was not for want of affection, but rather of discretion, he fully perswaded himselfe, that to be rid of their importunities, she had procured their deaths; he conceiued it with such apprehension, that nothing could disswade him, neither to see the sorrowfull signes which the princesse gaue for the death of the two brothers: for this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious yong man had determined what he would do, &amp; would draw his comfort for the lesse of the two princes brothers, from the death of a lady, whom to be hold, I know not who but would haue ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tured his life for her.

               <p>Then came your fame (valorous prince) flying through Samogacia, with the highest pitch that euer knight enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The poore distressed Lady was of opinion (as in deed it is true) that she could not repaire with more reason and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance vnto any then to you, and so shee sent mee to seeke you. I came from the citie with that care, which a matier of such importance as this is, doeth require, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the great feasts which were in <hi>Grecia,</hi> I was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to finde you there among your brothers; for by the way I vnderstood, that you are sonne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great Emperour <hi>Trebatius,</hi> with whose fame y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world is replenished, &amp; seing it was my hap to méet you in so good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, I am y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gladdest woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, assuring my self, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bringing you, I bring life to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princesse, &amp; although y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue bin hindred in our sayling, with tempests, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wind being fauourable,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:10"/>
wee shall (I doubt not) come in time to Samogatia, (for there yet remaine twentie daies, before the challenge bée expired:) and this is (Sir Knight) the cause that hath moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to take the paines to seeke you, and I beléeue it shal not bee in vaine; for seeing the wrong that is done to the Princes, you will not suffer it to proceede; for the fame of your valour importeth no lesse, but that you imploy it in fauour of those which are distressed, as is this Ladie.</p>
               <p>The lady hauing ended her story with some teares which fell from her eyes, remembring how much it would grieue the Princesse seeing her long stay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> valorous <hi>Tinacria</hi> was verie pittifull, especially in the behalfe of women, holding it for no honour which was gotten against them; and so he answered, I would that the heauens had giuen me farre greater force (faire damsell) to the end that your businesse might be the better assured, although hauing so much equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie on her behalfe, I hope that it shall suffice to yéeld that contentment, as such an excellent Ladie as shée is, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, against any that without reason shall procure her griefe, and I refuse not the houre, to méete that Knight of so little discretion.</p>
               <p>Great comfort did those couragious spéeches yéeld to the Damsell which the Prince vsed: the weather was fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto them; for foure daies before the time was expired, they landed néere the Citie of <hi>Adibia,</hi> (for so is it called) with great pleasure to them both, to sée themselues so neere; shée to her soueraigne Ladie bringing so good a returne; and he, which much desired to shew all his valour in defence of the Princesse: and but that it was onely his, it had neuer béene accomplished with that good hap; for the Pagan was one of the most strong men in the world. One day and a halfe did they spend in comming to the Citie, which was full of strangers, although neuer a one so valorous, as to answere the challenge, notwithstanding that <hi>Furiander</hi> came daily to the lists. They passed the night in a groue of poplar trées, where, what happened vnto them, you shal heare in the next Chapter.</p>

That cannot bee, said the Pagan, who owing his life, and would not venture it for her, in any daunger how doubtfull so euer the successe thereof were, cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; therefore you cannot denie me the wrong that I haue done my Ladie. Notwithstanding all this, I will not yéeld that any such crueltie bee committed in my presence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it weldone, but ill (you see the end of this aduenture) to torment your selfe in such sort, as may put you in such despaire as this, which dooth so much disgrace the valour which appeareth in your person. And because I came from farre about this businesse, and to fight for this Ladie, I pray you be satisfied, and hold me companie to the Citie, where I will trie my lot with <hi>Furiander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who can presume, Sir Knight, (said the Moore) to come into that Citie where hee hath committed so great a fault, such as the like hath not beene séene? I haue not the power, neither can any thing make me thereto able. It hath not beene so great (said the <hi>Tinacrian</hi>) but it may be amended, if fortune fauour vs. The Prince told him so many things, that in the end hee offred to hold him companie to the end that he might see the forces wherewith hee should fight for <hi>Celibella.</hi> By this time it was day, and so they tooke their horses, and with the damsell and the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> his squire, they tooke the way towards the Citie, and by the way hee knew that this Knight was the Lord and King of <hi>Prussia,</hi> where he fel in loue with the Princesse <hi>Celibella,</hi> although he neuer knew the necessitie wherein shee was, vntill hee came with his armes onely disguised to the Court, to see
<pb facs="tcp:13979:12"/>
her, which for her beautie was extolled through his whole Dominion: and comming thither, he vnderstood of <hi>Furian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> his challenge: But the fame of his valour was such, that hee durst not vndertake the battell for the Princesse, notwithstanding that hee loued her, much more then his owne soule: and falling into consideration of what hee had done, going forth of the Citie, he meant to haue slayne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> recomforted him the best that hee could, and he did not a little preuaile, being the most feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full yong man in the world. They ariued, when the King was newly risen from the table, and had that day inuited the famous <hi>Furiander,</hi> purposing with some good reasons to haue disswaded him from that attempt, being very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, for that he perseuered in his determination, he saw néere at hand the certaine death of his déerely beloued daughter: for hee continued so obstinate in his vniust chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, that nothing could withdraw him from his damned resolution. The two Princes came in, whose presence gaue no small ioy to all that were in the hall, principally the <hi>Tinacrian</hi>: for no man had a greater grace in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. In ouer-looking the hall with iudiciall eyes, the sonne of great <hi>Trebatius</hi> doing some reuerence, said, God saue the great King of Samogacia, and graunt thée that peace which thy personage deserueth; this Knight and I come from farre countries, onely to defend the wrong, as we haue vnderstood, which is done by a certaine Knight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Daughter; and casting lots, whether of vs should first enter into battell for her, it fell to me, which gaue mee no small content, to doe thy daughter this seruice, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that, whereto by the law of Knighthood I am boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and therefore you may commaund her to be called, and wee shall sée, whether shee will commit the equitie of her cause into my hands. The Gods requite thée the band, (Sir Knight) wherein you haue bound me, with offring your person to such danger as this present, which is one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test that you haue séene, which might be ended by some other

To be of the Princesses part, (mightie King) hath compelled me to come, answered the <hi>Tinacrian.</hi> The fierce Pagan being somewhat moued, rose vp, saying, I would not, Sir Knight, that you should haue so great confidence in the Ladies innocencie, but that you should come so well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with forces, as are needfull for the battel, and so you may take this Knight to helpe you; for my challenge doth extend to foure. It shall not néed, said the sonne of <hi>Treba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> to haue any more companie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the equity of my cause doth giue me: for if I be in the right, my person will suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The furious Pagan beeing there with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffended, answered, saying, I thought not, Knight, that my curtesie had animated thee to be so proud: but because thou maist know, that I will not passe the time in words, being more fit to vse deeds, we wil no longer deferre the battell. As he had ended his answere, came the most faire <hi>Celibella,</hi> all clad in mourning attire, which did greatly encrease her beautie. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> had neuer séene greater beautie; for there were few in the world that did excell her. Her father told her at her comming, how that Knight vndertooke the battell for her. The faire Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse knew him straight, by his deuice of a bough which he bare in his shield, &amp; that hee was the man for whom she had sent. She presently gaue him authoritie, with greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, then can be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when she reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred the infortunate Princes, her most pleasing thoughts were watred with teares.

                  </hi> taking his leaue of the King, went into the lists, taking with him the Prince of <hi>Prussia,</hi> who stood to looke on. On the other side of the lists, presently came in the valorous <hi>Furiander,</hi> much people accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him although there was no bodie that would he should winne the palme, or weare those armes, wherein hee had accused the Princesse, who was set vpon a scaffold with a sufficient gard; where she prayed to her false Gods, that her Knight might obtaine the victorie, séeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in so iust a cause he vndertooke the battell. Face to face stood these two war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, whose lookes and gestures were such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he which stood farthest off, did scarcely account himselfe in safetie, at the giuing of the fearefull signe; they drew with more swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then an arrow flieth: In the middest of the place, was appointed the course of their Carriere, making a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sound in their meeting, then if two hils had runne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: they bowed not in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These two rare men in valour, turned their horses with their swords in their hands, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching the one iust to the other, they gaue so fearefull blowes, as would haue beaten a rocke in pieces; eche of them could testifie his aduersaries force, they redoubled the second with greater courage then dexteritie: either of them féeling his owne blood in his mouth, they began to make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the nymblenesse, wherewith they were endued, closing, and beating by the blowes, in such exquisite maner, that <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe could not haue done the like. The vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Moore spurring his horse, thinking by swiftnesse to get aduantage, charged, carrying his sword firme, with the point forwardes: The great <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware thereof; there was neuer seene any Eagle more swift then hee in giuing blowes, and making his horse to giue a bound, hée passed before the Moore, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him so sodainly, that hee wondred at the Sonne of <hi>Trebacio</hi>: they came to ioyne, and the Moore would giue
<pb facs="tcp:13979:14"/>
the first blow; hee did it, which was more swift then the wind, and strake him vpon the rich Helmet, whose finenesse warranted his life, for otherwise hee had clouen him to the saddle; it sounded like a bell, and therein the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> saw a thousand starres in the skies, he fell vpon his horse necke, and the Moore doubled his blow; but if hee had giuen the third, the battell had béen ended: for it came with such force, that he was quite senselesse: he had closed with him, if he had not séene, that more furious then a Basiliske hee returned with his sword aloft. There was no man in that place, that yeelded not the victorie for the Pagan; the Ladies fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting confirmed the same: for losing her Rosiall colour, it became like snow, séeing the blowes which her Knight had receyued, who was nothing discouraged therewith, but ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting his shielde at his backe, grinding his téeth against the other, he assayled the Moore, giuing him so mightie a blow vpon his helme, that he left him al that part vnarmed, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him so vehemently, that there mist but little to haue laid him in the dust: hee tooke hold of his horse necke. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> ioyned with him, accounting the victorie for his owne, and with both his handes gaue him another blow, which imprinted his sword in his flesh, wounding him in the shoulder: as the Moore setled him selfe, (losing no occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) he gaue him two thrusts, one after another, which set him on the arson of his Saddle, griping him so, that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he had striken him quite out of breath. The Pagan aduanced himselfe, &amp; closing with the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> he thought to preuaile by grasping with him; but he found the sonne of <hi>Garofilia</hi> as fast in his saddle, as if he had béene a rock: they tugged so hard together, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they both were out of breath; their horses stood more fixt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>No pleasure can be compared to that which <hi>Celibella</hi> receiued, séeing how well her knight had acquitted himself; for on foot none of her brothers could do better: and yet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fighting with them, hee made them to doubt of the battaile.

The Pagan féeling the wound, &amp; thinking it had bene to the death, gaue a signe thereof: for with the very paine of the wound he went crosse-leg'd, and was readie to fall: the furious yong man holpe him, doubling another blow vpon his helme, with so great might, that hee made him set his knées to the ground.

               <p>It yéeldeth me not that ioy and solace (said the <hi>Tinacrian</hi>) Soueragine prince, to sée how gentle fortune hath shewed her selfe vnto me, to gette such a friend (as I hope in the gods you will bée,) as to sée with what affection, and in how good earnest you haue estéemed my offer, so as if I shall be able to equall my déedes with my desire, none shall shew himselfe a more faithfull friend then I.</p>

               <p>By this time was come the Kings daughter, so fayre, that I know not any man of reasonable vnderstanding, but would haue giuen, rather then to haue lost the sight of her, two thousand soules, if he had them. She drew néere, giuing the prince great thanks for that which hée had done for her, saying, I was well assured (valorous knight of the Bough) that committing my affayres into your victorious hands, it should haue such issue as is this. While as the fayre <hi>Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crian</hi> made answere vnto <hi>Celibella,</hi> loue began to sturre in the brest of the Pagan, who regarded the beautie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Infanta</hi> was adorned, whom in his conceit he had much offended: but loue playing his part, had obtained his pardon; for sometimes she cast her eye aside, to behold the wounds which this new-come prince had receiued: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed the Pagan did not so much feele it, as the Lady did, for it did ease his paine, to behold her beautie: But to her, who had already yéelded her selfe tributarie to loue, euery drop of his blood, was worse then a cruell death: so farre doeth his power extend, who is called the blind god of loue.</p>
               <p>Within the Palace, were these Princes cured of their wounds; and fifteene dayes the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in which time he behaued himselfe so well, that hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the king all that he desired; setting before his eyes the valour of <hi>Furiander,</hi> and the state which hee held: loue had so well disposed of the fayre princesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was no hard matter to winne her.

not how to value this good; for all the Court feasted him, holding it well content to receiue such a knight, for prince and Lord thereof.

This frée yong Batchelour was washing his fayre face, when they approched, beeing somewhat out of countenance, for that they had left their company behind them, and also to finde him so alone; hand in hand they came thither, at the instant when the sonne of <hi>Garrofilea</hi> lifted vp his head to behold them.

               <p>What sudden mishap is happened to this Lady (said the sonne of <hi>Trebacius</hi>?) If it be anything, wherein I, with the hazard of my life, may procure her remedy, I will performe it so farre foorth, as it to me shall be possible.</p>

The Gods requite you, gentle Knight, answered the Lady, for your noble offer, which is correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the great valour, which your personage doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: My annoy is so rooted in my soule, that any remedie whatsoeuer to be applied, will but double my sorrow: onely sometime, as now, it yéeldeth me some ease, to make shew of the euil which I endure, and it hath not béen to any smal purpose, séeing I find, that it hath moued those to pitie mée, which neuer knew me. The dutie, (faire Ladie) which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege to owe to al those which please to vse my seruice, is so generall that it forced me (séeing the great extremitie, whereunto this euill as you say, had brought you) to offer my life in quest of some meanes, to bréed your rest. It may be well perceiued, valorous Knight (said the Ladie) that if we should entreat you to shew your valour to purchase our contentment, you would doe it, as he which best might.</p>

This yong gallant betooke him to his weapons, because that to be found without them, it should not put in doubt that which his valour did assure: he had hardly laced his Helmet, and embraced his strong shield, when through the thickest of the

By this, they were all thrée ariued, and the Knight putting vp his beuer, somewhat more discouering his face, said, Many dayes, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Princesse <hi>Silepsia,</hi> with costly experience to my heart, I haue made shewe of my sacrificed faith to your beautie, procuring (to my cost) by all possible meanes your content, and yet could neuer obtaine any the least hope; not that I would be beloued; for that were to renue my life: but you would not so much as once regard my paine, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause thereof: The heuens haue now permitted me to come so in the nick, to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how little you shal lose, to answere to my payne: &amp; knowing this, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell not, though I procure that by force, which I deserue should be fréely bestowed on me; and so you are to haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, for you shall be mine in despite of all the world.</p>
               <p>Well haue I vnderstood, Prince of Libonia, (answered the Lady) the affection which you haue euer showed me, and to be such as deserued worthy correspondence: but neuer faithfull louer, which delighted in the renowme of a worthy Knight, tooke pleasure to winne affection, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready setled; for therein he should rather resemble a rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous louer, then a man of that faith, which you say you haue borne vnto me; and so séeing the impossibility in my behalfe, I haue procured by all possible meanes to let you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, how small meanes I had to yéeld you remedie.

The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was not a yong man, which would let slippe oportunitie, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a matter of such importance, which concerned no lesse then the Ladies libertie: and so the Moore beeing in this trance, hee with the greatest care of the worlde, with his sword in both his hands, with all his power strake him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crowne of the head; the helmet could yéeld no defence, for he claue it so, as it fell at his horse féete, and dispatched him suddenly. He turned about as swift as thought, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trace of the bold aduenturous Prince, and fortune was fauourable vnto him; for without any let, within one mile where the battell began, hee saw the Prince with his pray, flying swifter then the winde; the Falcon neuer slew so swift after the fearefull Hearon, as this valorous <hi>Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crian,</hi> who giuing the spurres to his horse, made him to run swifter then the stéeds of golden <hi>Apollo.</hi> And thus riding, he called to the Prince to stay, whose voyce caused this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant louer, whose haste to himselfe séemed slow, still to spur his horse; for it sufficed him not, to sée and hold his Ladie in his armes, but with her to escape the armes of that yong man, who as a furious Lyon (his sword died in bloud) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and in his flight strooke him vpon the rich Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met; and if it had hit right, it had ended the warre with that blow: But it was not to any small purpose, séeing it made him (for his owne defence) to set her to the ground, being wholly sencelesse.</p>

The Moore was most nymble and skilfull; and if hee had gone away with this blow, he might haue prolonged his life, but to his greater harme, he would néeds close with the valorous <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrian,</hi> where al happened acrosse vnto him; and the Moore well perceiuing his strength, gathered new forces from his most mortal wounds, considering with himselfe, how much he lost in losing that battell, and so he suffered him to enter, and with his sword in both his handes, hee smote him vpon the rich helmet, and had reuenged the death of his two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and recouered the Ladie, had not the well tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fine mettall béene betweene; the which, although it gaue the yong man his life, yet it could not defend him, but that it brought his head as low as the pommell of the saddle, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting out blood, both at his nose and mouth: he reached him yet another, which made him almost forget himselfe. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was Eagle more furious in defending her nest, then the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> shewed himselfe, turning towards the furious Pagan, and hitting him vpon the helme; it sounded like a bell, and made him tremble like an Aspen leafe, being sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the fresh winde in Autumne: he smote off his crest, leauing him mortally wounded, and séeing him stagger, he claspt him in his well brawned armes, whose betters the world contained not; and pulling him from his saddle, hée bare him in his armes, to the place where the Ladie was, being perfectly come to her selfe, who ioyed to sée how well he had reuenged her quarrell. Hee leapt with him from his horse, and with his ponyard ended his life and loue, in the sight of the Ladie, whom hee best loued in the world: the which ioyfull and secure, rose from the place where she sate, and with a countenance, which would haue made loue it selfe in loue, shee went to the frée young man, casting her armes about his necke, which I know not who would haue refused, and with a cloth wiping his armour sparkled

I would not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in the world, most worthy Lady, (answered the Prince) that I should giue you any cause of discontent, for I receyue so much herein, that I know not ought, that may frée me thereof, although that if it may be held for an excuse, that he haue not equalled your affection, his being elsewhere deuoted, yet a sufficient reason it yéeldeth, to cause you to shew your selfe lesse passionate. I neuer desired (most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Knight) that he should wholy requite my loue, séeing it
<pb facs="tcp:13979:21"/>
impossible for him to doe: I onely desired that he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that I loued him, and how swéet a life I held it, and how much I ioyed to bee his. But (Oh extreme dolor!) it appeareth that if I did liue, but to loue him, he in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest tooke pleasure to abhorre me. Here did I furnish him with horse and armes: and here did I shew him the most faithfull sincere affection, that euer was contained in any humane brest. In my Palace did I cure him of his wounds, hoping that that would haue moued him to haue cured those which he had giuen me: but to my greater griefe, I sent him hence whole and sound, and he left me here, so, as you sée me. Let it not (noble Prince) offend you to heare my passionate complaint; for I would not haue spoken it to any man in the world, but to such a one, as were so néere a kinseman, and deare friend as are you, to that cruell Knight; and know, that my constancie shall serue for an example to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: for first shall my soule forsake my body, before I leaue to be his. Behold and sée vnto what estate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection hath brought me: for in hope to sée him, it doth not grieue me to sée my father, in the behalfe of the Souldan of <hi>Niquea</hi> to goe against him. And I beseech you, valorous Prince, séeing you meane to serue in those famous wars, to remember, some day to tell him, that <hi>Eufronisa</hi> is in the Campe, not in shew of an enemy, but as a tributarie. Much did the crueltie of his kinseman grieue the Prince of <hi>Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cria</hi>; wherefore to comfort this noble Ladie, he said, Be not dismaide (noble Lady) for I promise you on my faith, and as I am a Knight, that I will so bring it to passe, that in <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> the prince <hi>Rosabel</hi> shall visit you, and acknowledge the fauor which in this countrie he hath receiued at your hands. I desire no greater ioy for my whole life time, answered the Ladie, but only to sée him, and that, that with some acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement he may vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how much I haue loued him; and herewith let vs go, for that Ladie staieth for vs, who is a witnesse of what I endure.</p>

so pleasant and merry, that, but for the remembrance of the losse of her sonnes, nothing could yéeld her so great ioy; of loue was all their discourse, although this Youth had small skill therein: But fortune determined to prepare him with those shewes of loue, meaning shortly to subiect him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; holding it for base, séeing he was not yet subdued. Some horsemen they met vpon the way, of her gard, which in a great troope came galloping, fearing that they had lost the Kings daughter. Here would the Prince haue taken his leaue, without comming to the Citie of Goltuerg, where the King made preparation for his departure; but at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant request of the Princesse and the discreet <hi>Silia,</hi> he could not refuse to goe with them, vpon condition, that by no meanes they should discouer who he was.</p>
               <p>Being ariued at the Citie, it nothing amazed him to sée it in armes, and the great number of Knights, which hourely ariued there, among which were many most fierce Gyants; neither the great abundance of warlike instruments, which were prepared in that Citie: for well hee knew in what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse his father would be. Eight dayes remained hee there, with the greatest entertainement in the world: for the king knowing in what maner he had rescued his daughter, knew not how to requite it him. At the end of which time, (with a determination to goe into Tinacria, and there to leuie the mighttest Armie, that possibly he should be able, in the behalfe of his father) hee tooke his leaue of that gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Ladie, with such a farewell, as made him sorrowfull. She likewise within foure dayes after, tooke her way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Grecia, with her fathers Armie, with so great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to bee there, that she imagined that the heauens could yéeld her no greater content. The words of the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did much hearten her, who in a well rigd Galley directed his course towards his Countrey, with his aforesaid deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But the third day after his being at sea, the sea began to worke in such sort, that he lost his voyage, casting him by diuine prouidence, into a streight of the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean
<pb facs="tcp:13979:22"/>
sea, where he wandred 3. daies, &amp; the fourth tooke land in the most swéet and pleasant countrey that euer he had séene in his life. Hée leapt ashore, desirous to know in what countrey he was ariued, commanding the Marriners there to attend him; and with his Squire onely, he began to enter a most pleasant shadow of Poplar trées, where hee tooke pleasure in the fresh ayre thereof, séeming vnto him, that there, industrious nature had taken great care to excéed all humane arte.</p>
               <p>When hee had trauailed about a mile therein, busying his eyes in beholding the stately Poplars and lofty Cedars, at the end of this wood, in the midst of a fayre field, he beheld the stateliest Palace that could be imagined; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> height there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of séemed to touch the clouds, with such varietie of stone, that it seemed a worke of the high heauens, or that it was the habitation of some rulers thereof.

               <p>The Gréeke betooke him to his weapons, to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> retchlesnesse should yéeld no ill successe; and so they stayed, vntill drawing néere, they heard them, bid them amayne, except they would all be dead.

               <p>The valiant Prince of Gréece was very suspicious, and any matter that might concerne women (to whome in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time hée had vowed his ayde) did much trouble him.

together incompany from the danger on the seas, by reason of these alterations and warres which sound ouer all the world. The fierce Giant answered, saying, Our Galley, sir knight, goeth so safe from any ill successe that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto her, with those that are within bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is superfluous fauor (sayd the Gréeke) fading feare, and to the ende we may go the more at pleasure, I pray you take aboord you a Squire, who is in great feare, for that hée heareth that certaine Gréekes scoure this coast. Let it bée as you will (sayd the Gyant) and if he will, he shall sée, how little I esteeme those proud knights of whom he is so much afraid; and so commanded to strike sayle, and to lay his Galley so néere to the princes, that he might easily (lying néere together) leape aboord where the Gyant was, and did it with such dexteritie, that when they betooke them to their defence, he was already aboord, with his sword in his hand, saying, It is requisite, you traytors, that you leaue your praye and your liues, for payment for your presumption. Hee stayed for no answere, neither strained any curtsie; for before they could fit themselues, he had slaine two of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It was wonderfull to behold, how hee cast himselfe amidst the thickest of the throng, and it is not a thing to bee writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in so true an History as this which I prosecute, what this valiant youth performed. <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> saith, that at thrée blowes he smote downe sixe knights at the Gyants feet, who blaspheming heauen and earth, lifting vp his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible axe, came towards the louer, making the Knights to giue place. They neuer better performed their Masters commandement then now: for no lesse then their liues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended thereon. The fierce Gyant gaue so vehement a blow, which made such noyse, that it séemed to thunder in the ayre. It séemed not to the louer of <hi>Arquisilora</hi> any wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to stay the lighting of so rude a blow: and so winding
<pb facs="tcp:13979:24"/>
himselfe on one side, séeing the blow come from aloft, he let it slip, which came as it were thundring in the ayre: he smote it an hand déepe in the hatches of the ship, which was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great good hap for the Gréeke: for by that meanes, being vnable to pull it out, so soone as hee would, he ioyned with him, and with both his hands gaue him a blow on the thicke helme. It little profited him that it was thrée fingers thick; for he smote the greater part thereof from his head, and left him sore wounded, and withall made him to reele, hee payde him the second time better then at the first: for hitting him right vpon the huge great armes, hee made him let goe his battaile-axe, which put him to such paine, that he had much to doe, to put his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to his side, to draw a broad crooked fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion, wherewith flourishing, he assayled the prince. There was no roome in the Galley to shun y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> swift comming therof, neither was it possible to ward the terrible blow with his most strong shield, which (for the finenesse thereof) although that he could not cleaue, yet hee beat it to his helmet with so great force, that he made him set both his knées to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground.</p>
               <p>Neuer did Knight better beare himselfe in a particular fight, then this prince did: for oftentimes, with his agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and discretion hee knew how to make his benefite of his ill happes, against his enemy, as nowe, without loosing his warde, by reason of this great blow: for hée gaue him a great slash ouer the legs. This was it which assured him of the battaile, for hitting him a little beneath the gartering place, hée cut it almost halfe off, hée would not so giue ouer without giuing him one more, which was a very feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full stroke, which wholly bereaued him of his right foote: he made him goe backewards with lesse stedfastnesse then in battailes is required.</p>
               <p>The valorous Batchelour rose againe on his féete, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the fierce Pagan, who came vpon him, casting a thicke smoake out at his beuer, but wanting the assistance of his legge, hée was to strike him with his eyes; hee was constrained to set him on his knée, and in that maner to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb facs="tcp:13979:25"/>
the doutful victorie, it cannot be imagined how great contentment the Prince of <hi>Apulia</hi> receiued, in séeing the marueiles in armes, which that Knight performed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéeming himselfe happy to haue such a companion.</p>
               <p>By reason of the great noyse which was made in this battaile, out of a cabin of the Galley came one of the most fayre Ladyes that euer was séene, all clad in gréene Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin cut vpon most fine cloth of Gold, and her yellowish haires hanging loose about her shoulders, pouring streames of teares downe her fayre cheekes, which resembled the most rich Orientall Pearles, who seeing howe victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously this Knight had borne himselfe, to giue him the greater courage, sayd, Let these cruell and accursed caitiffes dye, and assure your selfe, I will not leaue your trauaile vnrewarded.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke néeded no new fauours, for hée had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ranged the Gyant so well to his will, that hee would not giue him so much space as to drawe his breath, and desiring to make an end of the war, making amends with a mighty blow vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moore, he closing, came to handy gripes and cast him on his backe on the floore, bereauing him at the very instant of his life, in the despite of all those knights which would haue hindered it; with which hee returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into a deadly battaile, but it lasted not long; for hée lost all patience.</p>
               <p>The cruell Lyon is not more furious in the middest of the sheepe-flocke, nor a shée Beare that is robbed of her whelpes, then was hée among those which remayned; he ouerthrew three with mortall wounds, which gaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the rest (who before with much hate did resist him) to throw away their swordes, and to fall downe and humbly entreat him to pardon them their liues.</p>
               <p>The noble minded Knight easily graunted it; for cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler did neuer so much blinde him, as to make him tread that compassion vnder féete, which ought to bee held with those which yeeld.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:25"/>By this time the faire Prince of Apulia was come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord the Galley, who embracing the Grecian, saide, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will not now (most puissant Knight) shew herselfe so cruell vnto me, séeing it hath together giuen me satisfaction for so many troubles, bringing me in due time to ioy at the view of your worthie actes.</p>
               <p>It is sufficient glorie for mee (noble Prince) answered the Gréeke, to haue deserued so generous a commendation, as what I heare from your mouth, which hath giuen me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to estéeme better of my selfe, then my valour hath deserued.</p>
               <p>The gallant Ladie ended their discourse, who like a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lionesse, taking notice of whom she had held for a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, who was also Lord of her soule, wherewith shee loued him, without giuing the Gréeke any thankes for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which hee had giuen her, clasping her armes about his necke, shée saide, I neuer thought, neither <hi>Iaroe,</hi> with such satisfaction, as this, to enioy thy presence, or that Fortune should haue ended my disgrace in this maner: but the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue so decréed, that she who is borne to be thine, shall be no mans else.</p>
               <p>Now I will not complaine of <hi>Iaroe,</hi> for I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, hee would not haue so forgotten me, as the Prince of Apulia. With this, the gentle young man presently knew her to bee the faire <hi>Troyla,</hi> daughter to the King of Argel, where he had béene a captiue.</p>
               <p>The gallant Ladie had made this Prince so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to her, for the many signes of good will which shée shewed him, being in prison, that at the instant bowing his knées to the ground, desiring to kisse her hands, he said, My troubles, noble Princesse of Argel, haue béen such, since the destinies ordayned my departure from thy presence, that I know not how they haue giuen mee leaue to liue, neither to thinke vpon <hi>Iaroe,</hi> but the Prince of Apulia, as he who at the last yéelded himselfe more beholding, acknowledgeth the much and many fauours, which he hath receyued at your
<pb facs="tcp:13979:26"/>
hands, offering you now anew, his life to be at your seruice, and speake I pray you, to this venturous Knight: for both ours to him is due, according to the much which hée hath performed. The Lady acknowledged the error where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into shée was fallen; but séeing it was for loue, it was to be excused.</p>
               <p>Then began shée to discourse of this valorous Gréeke, and to enquire who he might bée, and what aduentures hée had past? And hearing what the prince of <hi>Apulia</hi> said of him, shée said, Pardon (most worthy Knight) my retchlesnesse, in that I haue not all this while giuen you thankes, for that which you haue done for my libertie, which onely may be estéemed a thing whereof there resteth for mée no hope to make any requitall, which the heauens reward you in your greatest necessitie. The great displeasure which I conceyued against this Knight, for departing out of my prison without my leaue, was the occasion of my ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight.</p>
               <p>For many errors, (worthy Lady) this onely were a sufficient excuse, if there had beene any such: how much more then, where there was none committed? Much time they spent in entertaining with these swéete discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. To entertaine in such maner (worthy Ladyes,) is no error, which I leaue to your discréete considerations, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting therewith the tediousnesse wherewith I should procéed.</p>
               <p>The long absence of the Prince of <hi>Apulia,</hi> had giuen no occasion to lose any part of the affection which shée bare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him when hee was present; her stedfast beholding him did manifest as much. All this did but encrease the Gréeke louers paine, to see himselfe so infortunate, and absent from his Lady, and with such disgrace banished, and not to returne into <hi>Grecia</hi> without licence, bearing the name of <hi>Claridiano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It did somewhat grieue the Prince of <hi>Apulia,</hi> to sée the discontentment of the knight of Crueltie: he was generally
<pb facs="tcp:13979:26"/>
so called of al men; for that was his deuice in his shield. The gentle conuersation of the Princesse, did much comfort him, whom these princes entreated to declare the cause of her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment. I can tel you none, valorous Knights, but that being one day in a garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vpon the Stronds side, to recreate my selfe, in company of these foure Damsels, this accursed Gyant, by chance, with the furie of the winde, came to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue at the gardens bancke side, he with those Knights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and comming through the thickest, they ariued at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fountaines, where we were solacing our selues. To small purpose serued the callings and outcries which wee made, calling for helpe, that they should not carrie vs away to their Galley. It was yesterday twelue dayes, he told me by the way, that he was of the squadron of <hi>Ocho,</hi> vassal to the Prince of Almayne, in whose seruice hee went to the warres against the Gréekes, in company of the Emperour of the Romanes, and to the same effect my Father is vpon parting with the king of Carthage, which are to ioyne with the Souldan of Niquea, whom (as they say) this warre doth principally concerne, for the theft, which a Prince of the Gréekes committed, in stealing one of his Daughters; they purpose to ruinate the whole Empire, according to the great numbers of men which they leuie. This is all that I can say, concerning my imprisonment. And séeing I shal not finde the King my Father at Argel, (for by this time hee is gone) I should be very glad, if you would take me with you: for being in company with such Knights, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, nothing in the world could yeeld mee the like content. You shall doe vs (answered <hi>Florisiano</hi>) great fauour, to take vs with you, for Knights of your gard. Whereto the Gréek agréed, dissembling the griefe hee conceiued, to heare how great troopes of men were leuied to warre against his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; hee determined with himselfe to take his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Grecia, disguised with new armes secretly, without acquainting any man therewith, except the Knight of the Lions, who was the gentle <hi>Claramant.</hi> The Princes often

Some things haue happened vnto me to my liking, answered the Prince; but the most ordinary and that which maketh me to absent my selfe from my Countrey and friends, is that which cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me after the currant of my hard happes. (Loue most noble Prince, is not so swéet to bee endured, nor so easie to be concealed, but that howsoeuer a man will goe about to dissemble the matter, hiding the griefe of his soule, yet hée will giue signes and certaine notice thereof.) The Prince of Gréece was of opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plainely to discouer it, for in his soule hee was grieued; for it was a matter to touch a man: for her beautie did deserue, that the Prince of Apulia should loue her: but he dissembled, offering himselfe to any danger that might yéeld content to <hi>Florisiano.</hi> They attributed it to the great generositie of his minde, desiring much, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion might be offered to requite the same.

great a grace, as <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe: the Ladie taking great pleasure therein, accounting it a pleasure, to trauell all the world ouer in company of such Knights, their valour assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her from al danger. By the same way that they went, they saw eight Knights comming towards them, very rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armed, to whom at their méeting, the Gréeke in their owne language said (for he could speake any in the world) We shall take it for fauour, Sir Knights, to know of you, what Countrey this is, and how farre it is to any Towne. Well pleased with his good spéeches and behauiour, The Countrey, Sir Knights, wherein you are, (answered one, who séemed to be Captaine of all the rest,) is the populous Lucania, very néere vnto the famous Citie of Troba; it would yéelde you great delight, to sée the maruellous state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buildings thereof: but now all the Countrey is so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with these warres, which are a beginning, that there is no pleasure or contentment, especially now, by reason of the importunacie of <hi>Asternio</hi> Prince of Calabria, who hath declared himselfe for a great louer &amp; suiter vnto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Polinarda,</hi> although it is imagined, that she admitteth none of his seruices: But the King hath so effectually dealt in the matter, that she is promised vnto him for his wife, in stead of his brother, whom they put to death through her occasion. Greatly was the Prince of Apulia moued with the words of these knights, although he past it ouer, holding the matter as concerning himselfe, and holding such compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the Gréeke Prince, who desirous to returne into Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, to the aid of his parents, taking leaue of these Knights, thanking them for the newes which they had told them, he said, Ualorous Princes, the best &amp; most certaine meane y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I know to deale in this busines, is, to remit it to the fortune of my valor, &amp; so to bereaue this Prince (which procureth your spoiles) of the meane therto, here fréeing vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any successe that may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to send a messenger to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King of Lucania, that I wil maintaine the beauty of this Lady, against any Knight that shal say the contrary, at al assaies, to be the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest that is in this kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which shall giue occasion to this

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Polisandro</hi> and the Damsell (as saith <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor</hi>) were departed from the Princes, with the Gréeke Princes message, and were come within two miles of the great Citie of Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, at what time as the King was newly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dinner, accompanied with many principal knights, among which was the most strong <hi>Astrenio,</hi> which was now respected of euery body as the Kings sonne: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired leaue to enter, which was granted, in the presence of many Ladies, &amp; the faire <hi>Polinarda,</hi> with <hi>Solesia</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of Campania, and her valorous louer <hi>Lisander.</hi> The Damsell doing such reuerence, as in such cases is accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the King willing her to deliuer her ambassade, shee
<pb facs="tcp:13979:28"/>
began in this maner: Thou shalt vnderstand (mighty King of Lucania) that in the confines of the red Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that part which boundeth vpon Media, there lyeth a most populous and rich Iland, called the Ile of plate, for the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, which the earth there bringeth forth: of which I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is Quéene, one of the most accomplished Ladies of the world, called <hi>Troyla,</hi> with whom the mightie Prince of Cumagena, (trauelling through the world to seeke his aduentures, seeing her rare beautie) fell in loue, and that with such feruencie, that according to the shew which hee hath made thereof, nothing but death onely may suffice to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert him from his amorous conceit: hee hath perfourmed (most Soueraigne King) so many and so great matters in the seruice of this Ladie, that of very dutie, (and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with her selfe, that it was no disgrace to her to accept him for her Knight) thee resolued to admit his seruice, and him for her seruant. With the fauours which she bestowed on him, he beganne againe anew to make triumphs for ioy, in such maner, that she consented and promised to be wholy his: She (valorous King) standeth so assured on her selfe and her beautie, that she requested him, in requitall of the faith which she vowed vnto him, to carie her to the Courts of the most famous Kings, for the space of two yéeres, to maintaine her beautie. A small request seemed vnto her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that which she required, and to all others that knew him, seeing by experience the great valour which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens had infused into him. And now they goe, accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two yeeres quest, performing such aduentures ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with so much honour to them both, that hee is held for one of the most valorous Knights of the world, and hearing the fame of this Court &amp; of the gallantrie of the Ladies of the same, he would not passe by into Grecia, before he had here made proofe of what power his aduenture might bee, he yéeldeth to the battell at all perils: for some hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded to the Iusts onely, haue remained throughly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, bringing the battell to no perfection; wherefore he hate
<pb facs="tcp:13979:29"/>
sent to entreat thée, (if it shall so please thée) to send him safe conduct, to the ende he may maintaine the cause for which he commeth. Here ended the Damsell her Oration, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not one in all the hall, which did not wonder at her bold demaund. Some rumour beganne among the young Knights, making a scoffe thereof, auouching that the Ladies whom they serued, had attained to the highest of all beautie. Wel did the King vnderstand it, and dissembling the same, answered the Damsell, (which comming in the name of an Ambassadour, was to be honourably entertained) I doe thankefully accept (faire Damsell) of the pleasure, which this Knight with his presence will doe vnto this court, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (as I am perswaded) he shall here purchase more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies then friends: for here being Princes, which delight in Ladies seruice, they will neuer yeeld to so generall an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as is this. The most strong <hi>Astermo</hi> could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble his discontentment, déeming, that therein was great disgrace done to his <hi>Polinarda,</hi> who said thus, I doe rather wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h (faire Damsell) that this Knight had first séene the Ladies of this Palace, that he might haue perceiued the errour which he maintaineth, before he had with such ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldnesse, defyed their gallants. I am of opinion, Sir Knight, (answered the dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reet Damsell) that you haue not yet made proofe of the power of loue, seeing that you know not, that hee which admireth the beautie of his beloued, speaketh according to his affection: I am of opinion, that both of the one and the other, the Prince will put you out of doubt, if it shall please the King to giue him leaue thereto. I graunt it, quoth the King, if he will; to the end wee may see the effect of your hopes. The Lady would haue kist the Kings hand for the sauour which he granted, &amp; returning, she said, As these Princes (mightie King) haue trauelled a long iourney, so come they vnfurnished of prouision ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; wherefore they pray thee to commaund a Tent to be lent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seeing that the challenger is to make his abode therein. Whatsoeuer shall please him (answered the King) I will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand to be carefully prouided. In this maner (said
<pb facs="tcp:13979:29"/>
the Ladie with a high voice) begin you that are enamoured, to set vp your armes; for betwéene this and to morrow, wil come to the Lists, the Prince of Comagena, with costly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to make shew of his great valour. And so taking her leaue of all, <hi>Polisander</hi> and shée mounted on horsebacke, and with a swift pace they returned to the wood, where they had left the Princes, to whome (for by little and little they drew néere to the Citie) shée deliuered the message which she brought.</p>
               <p>Much did <hi>Claridiano</hi> reioyce, to vnderstand how well the Damsell had dispatched her businesse. It might bee about two of the clocke in the afternoone, when these valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Princes came into the great Market place of the Citie of <hi>Troba,</hi> leading betweene them the venturous <hi>Troi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a,</hi> so well pleased to see the good which shée hoped for, that shée was as it were, ouerioyed. There were none but did verie attentiuely behold the Princes, the Ladie séeming to them no lesse faire, then the Knights to be of a good constitution, particularly he in the yellew, whome by his deuice in his Shield they held to be the challenger, and whome they dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee the most gentle Knight that was in that place. They ware their visors perced, and bare their Launces in their hands. All the place by this time was full of people, by reason of the report of their comming; and so they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to the beholders, where the King and all his daughters were, the one doing that reuerence to the others, as their estates did require.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke a little lifting vp his Beuer, said, Ualo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous King of Lucania, notwithstanding that my comming to thy Court hath béene to doe thée pleasure, yet my chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge I addresse to those, which professe themselues not to be their owne. Your comming (Sir Knight) is much estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (aunswered the King,) and so at your pleasure you may begin to maintaine the beautie of this Ladie. When they all intreated to come vp to the beholders, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Polinarda,</hi> the two Princes desired no other thing,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:30"/>
accordingly as they had agréed: and so alighting into the armes of him in the yellow, they led her vp to the place, wher <hi>Polinarda</hi> was, who was very doubtfull that <hi>Aster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> should not lose that, which the other held for certaine.</p>
               <p>All the courtly Ladyes iudged the fayre <hi>Troyla,</hi> to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beautifull, <hi>Polinarda</hi> saying vnto her, I now say, gallant Lady, that I maruaile not, though your Knight beare the prize in all hard aduentures, iustice beeing apparant on his side; wherefore all good successe is due vnto him. This (noble Lady) answered <hi>Troila,</hi> will be through the reflection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your beautie, mine being very little. O prince of Apulia, who could helpe thee in the perplexitie wherein thou wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t? It was so much (most noble Prince) as who so had noted him, might well haue perceiued it.</p>
               <p>They spent not long time in discourses: for the Gréeke yet saw not the end of his businesse, pricked forward with the necessitie wherein his parents were, and so doing a short reuerence to the Ladyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giuing his hand to the carefull lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, they came downe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, and mounting on their horses, they rode to a most fayre tent, which was in the middest of the place I would not, valorous prince, (said the prince of Apulia) that any euill successe should happen vnto <hi>Lisander</hi> my friend, and brother to my Soueraigne La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. There shall not (sayd the Greeke) for I will so handle the matter in the battaile, that he shall lose nothing, but that he shall not ouercome.</p>
               <p>By this time many were come into the place, who with their Armes would yeld testimony of what they felt in their soules. The first that tried their fortunes, were two of the Kings nephewes, yong knights, and both much enamored, but losing their saddles, there rested no more action for battaile; for at two encounters hee put them &amp; all the whole company out of doubt, that he wanne the flower of cheual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Right before him past the prince of Campania, who was but newly come to the Court, so enamored, that hée made account (trusting therein, to beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palme from the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke, with his sword &amp; shield making amends, first ioyned with him, and with both his hands smote vpon the top o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his shield; there was no defence, but hee cast the one halfe thereof to the ground, the sword fighting on his helmet with such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rce, that it set him sencelesse on the arson of the saddle. The Gréeke was very desirous to end the battaile, and so spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his furious horse, he ran against him with his brest, which cast them both to ground: and the prince was so cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the fall, that he could not get from his horse.</p>
               <p>The Ladyes were much grieued that the prince of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania should be ouercome; and most of all his sister the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Solersia,</hi> whose brauerie had encouraged the prince <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander</hi> to come into the Lists, so well armed &amp; disposed, that the common people through affection, openly gaue him the victorie. He came armed in a reddish armour, wrought all ouer with knots of gold, and in the midst of his shield, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, described after the maner as they depaint the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia Foelix, set vpon a Globe ruling the world,</hi> encompassed with this Mott,

                     <l>Where hope is well assured,</l>
                     <l>And ioyn'd with stedfast constancie,</l>
                     <l>Fortunes mutabilitie</l>
                     <l>Is nothing to be feared.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:31"/>Great pleasure did his mistresse receiue in his deuice, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it done for her sake, The prince of Apulia had giuen notice, that that was his deare friend: wherefore the Gréek with a soft pace went to him and said:</p>
               <p>Ualorous prince of <hi>Lucania,</hi> there resteth so little time to end so many battels as yet remaine, that I thought good to demand battaile of you vpon condition, that whether of vs that within two houres shall loose his Saddle, through a stroke of his aduersarie, shall remaine for ouercome.</p>
               <p>Be it, Sir Knight, (answered the prince) as you shall thinke good, presuming to haue the better of the battaile. They managed their horses with so good a grace, that <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe from his high throne tooke pleasure to behold it. At what time as they should encounter, in sight of the whole troupe, the valorous Gréeke bare vp his lance. There were few in that land, that could so well behaue themselues, and so gallantly, as he which was before him, who smote him with such force, that it made him bend his body farther backwards then he would: he past forwardes, much estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of that Knight for his valour, and hurled his lance with greater force, then if a man had discharged a culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, striking the one halfe thereof into the hard ground, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the rest shaking in the fresh winde, which did so much amaze all those that were present, as the ouercomming of the prince of Campania: with a soft pace hée came to the Knight.</p>
               <p>There was no body there, but did note the honour which the Gréeke did vnto him; he was very neere vnto the prince, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he put his hand vnto his sword, more to defend himself the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to offend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, as he made it to be plainely séene: for the Prince of <hi>Lucania</hi> assailing him with his whole force, smote him so great a blow vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> top of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helmet, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it made him be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d downe his head so low as his brest; he came againe with another, which the Gréeke tooke so ill, that had not <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risiano</hi> bene present, he had forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his generous determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. With all this, not with the valour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could, but to
<pb facs="tcp:13979:31"/>
put him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he smote him euery where where he could.</p>
               <p>This is (gallant noble Ladyes,) no ill will, said the sayre <hi>Troyla,</hi> that my Knight hath shewed to his enemy, seeing how carelesly he procéedeth in a matter that so much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him; but I beléeue that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iustice of his cause detaineth him which he seeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> behalfe of his aduersary. They could not answere her, for the great noise which was in the place: which was for that that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Greeke imagining that the time was now expired, had closed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, clasping his body within his brawny armes, he did not plucke him so soone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his horse, as he would; for that that the valiancy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> louer, séeing what he had lost, did animaie him so, as he did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what detaine him; but it was but for a small time: for with a strong pluck he dismounted him, desiring him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would not be ouercome, but that he might hold him for his friend. I desire no more, answered the prince, then mine eyes haue séene, that by so many wayes you haue won the palme of the battaile: but séeing the heauens wil haue it so, all is yours, &amp; so wil I be as long as I liue. Many thanks did the Gréeke giue him for his offer, &amp; so he mounted on horsebacke, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the knight of Crueltie being admired. There was none in that place, (notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was against their prince) but did extell with high praises y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yellow. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the most valiant <hi>Asternio,</hi> stayed their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedings, whom shew more mightie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <q>
                  <l>Well may this Sacrifice</l>
                  <l>Giue hope assurance</l>
                  <l>Of great confidence.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:32"/>Much did the fayre Laydes extoll the deuice of this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant louer: But to the fayre <hi>Polinarda,</hi> who remembred her <hi>Florisiano,</hi> all this was a death; for shée had yéelded her self to loue, &amp; who loueth faithfully is not forgetull; but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence rather reuiueth the memorie of those which loue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, preseruing the touch of their faith.</p>
               <p>The gentle disposition of this Moore did well please the Greeke: but séeing that without his death hee could not accomplish his promise made to the prince of Apulia, without further pausing on the matter, he turned about, and went to the place where the lances were, where, with his owne hands he made choise of one of the greatest and most stiffe and tough among them.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion (sayd the fayre <hi>Troila,</hi> séeing what hee did) that the affection is not alike, which my Knight shewed to the prince of <hi>Lucania,</hi> to that which hee beareth to him which is now before him. The occasion should not be smal (sayd the fayre <hi>Solersia</hi>) who in her soule was grieued that <hi>Asternio</hi> should by so many meanes procure <hi>Polinarda</hi> to be his wife. Let vs see (quoth shée) what will become of this enmitie; I am perswaded this battaile will bee worth the seeing.</p>
               <p>Now were these 2. famous warrious, confronting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one the other, when the Gréeke with a soft pace came towards him, saying, You already know (Sir Knight,) the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my demaund, which are, that you tel me your name, and the name of the Lady whom you serue; for to be assured that her beautie doth excell hers which is Lady of my life, without any battayle I will yéeld the prize.</p>
               <p>I would not that wee should haue made so long delay (sayd the furious yong man) to make so long a discourse: for I am perswaded to resolue you sooner with the battaile, then to shew you in fight the Lady whom I serue: Yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that I am called <hi>Asternio,</hi> prince of Calabria, and the Lady whom the heauens haue ordeined for my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, is the kings daughter of this land. To haue a good
<pb facs="tcp:13979:32"/>
foundation (said the valorous Gréeke) for you, to haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to lift your affection to so high degrée, it were without question no great matter to giue you the palme of this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and so I will haue it, not in regard of the beauty which the heauens haue adorned the Lady withall, but to let you know how presumptuous you haue beene, to make shew to loue her.</p>
               <p>These discourteous spéeches (said the warlike Moore) deserue the fury of the braue <hi>Asternio,</hi> being as red in the face as a burning coale, without regard of what to a knight did appertaine, séeing him so neere vnto him, stung with that which he had sayd, with more force then discretion, hee hurled his well pointed lance; onely the excellence of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano</hi> his shield saued his life: for beeing vnable to pierce it, the lance flew backe againe whole, but not in such sort, but that it was likely to haue made the Gréeke to haue lost his Saddle; for it made him strike his head vpon his horse buttocks, which stood him in no lesse stead, then the earth did <hi>Anteus</hi>; for redoubling his courage, hee setled himselfe with such wrath, that nothing could be more cruell; there was neuer séene so angry countenance in any Knights, it made aboue foure of the most valiant to lose all the colour in their faces, to sée their furious encounters, a good palme, he raised himselfe vpon his stirrops, &amp; whorling his lance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head, with greater agilitie then <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe, hée hurled it at the Pagan, who was about to draw his sword.</p>
               <p>The thunder maketh not so great noyse in renting the clouds, as the Gréeke made, hitting in the middest of the Pagans shield. It preuailed not, that it had more folds of well tempered stéele in it, then <hi>Aiax</hi> his shield had, to resist the force of this louer; for it passed thorow, and smote on his brest-plate, but found no defence therein, (for as the shield was broken, and his fortune prolonging his life to a worse ende) the head of the lance turned aside vnder his arme, so as it came forth at his shoulders, an armes length and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:33"/>The Moore fell not, for he had his legges fastened to his horse, but he made him so much forget himselfe, that all the company held him for dead.</p>
               <p>O mighty <hi>Iupiter</hi> (quoth the King) of what strength is this Knight! without all doubt it is not matchable in the world; for hée hath at one blowe ouerthrowen one, whome we held for one of the most valiant in the world. Few of the Ladyes were sorry for the Moores disgrace; for <hi>Mars</hi> his fury did more raigne in him, then any amorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: hée at the first dash pretended to purchase <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda,</hi> which with great ioy sayd:</p>
               <p>Now, I say, fayre Lady, that your businesse is in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter assurance then was imagined, not through want of the beauty wherewith the high heauens haue enriched you, but for the great accompt which was held of this Knight.</p>
               <p>I rather attribute it to the loue (answered the Ladie) which my Knight beareth vnto mée, then for that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (wholly to binde mée) you would attribute to my beautie; and truely I am sorry for this Knight, onely, for that hee resembled one whom in my Countrey I knew; (an example for those which are louers to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire:) for mée thought, as it appeared by him, that if loue it selfe should bée enamoured, it should not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly atteyne to that degrée which his faith held, which was the most rare that euer was séene: for I neuer sawe heart so tryed with the crosses of Fortune, which so persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted as his did, onely for that hee would not lose a iote of his louely affection.</p>
               <p>I would fayne know (sayd the fayre <hi>Solersia</hi>) what hée might bée, if it may bée spoken, to the ende that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing those partes which you report, wée may estéeme of him accordingly, and as is reason: for here hath béene to the cost of many, another affection without comparison, and tryed with the rarest experience that can be imagined.</p>
               <p>He whom I saw in my Countrey (answered the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete <hi>Troyla</hi>) was called <hi>Florisiano,</hi> who for his faith,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:33"/>
in my conceite, deserued any good hope: (shée had scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mande an ende of naming him, when the two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes imagined, that it was hée whom they loued, and whose absence they so much sorowed, especially the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Polinarda,</hi> who béeing much troubled, gaue occasion to <hi>Troyla</hi> to say:</p>
               <p>It séemeth to mée (worthy Ladyes,) that this is not the Knight whome I know, yet neuerthelesse, I perceiue that his name is not a little estéemed in this Countrey, séeing that the remembrance thereof is so acceptable. It is true, answered the fayre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Solersia,</hi> that in time past there was a Knight in this Citie, as rich in constancie, as poore in fortune, whose absence hath béene no small griefe to the chiefest in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The discreete Moore Ladie, séeing the way so plainely open for that which shée pretended, drue out of them all that she would.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more easie (most noble prince) then to discouer the passion of the soule, when it is grieued; for by a sigh, or by asking one name, two or thrée times, it maketh shew of a life in loue. The kings daughter of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania plainely confessed all.</p>
               <p>And as the two Ladyes discoursed of the Prince of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia, at an instant the discréete <hi>Troyla</hi> set before her fayre eyes the plot of all the businesse, declaring vnto her with such perswasion, that hee which had beene her captiue, was Prince of Apulia, vntill at last, séeing all was in safetie, shee playnely told her, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, who fought these battailes, was the same <hi>Florisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> and that if shee so much loued him, she should dispose of herselfe to depart with him.</p>
               <p>The fayre <hi>Solersia</hi> did so well discharge the part of the Prince of Apulia, that <hi>Polinarda</hi> vsed these speeches:</p>
               <p>It séemeth to mée, worthy Dames, that the fates haue disposed of this businesse, according to the desire of the Lady Princesse of Campania; and séeing it is so, al that which the

Foure houres were past since they beganne: and as at the first, they whéeled about, drawing forces out of great blowes, the Gréeke gaue the Pagan such a blow on the shield, that he cut the one halfe cleane away, so tormenting his arme, that hee could not lift vp the little which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and so he flung it to the ground, pursuing the Gréeks more fiercely, then the hungrie Lyon doth the fearefull shéepe-flocke, he reacht him vpon the toppe of the rich hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, a blow with such furie, that although that he cut it not, by reason of the good temper thereof, yet for all that, it made him to sée the twinckling starres of the skies, within the helmet, making him for a space to forget himselfe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king benefite of the time, he gaue him such a stabbe in his louing brest, that it much grieued him; they were come so close and so néere together, that béeing vnable to strike, and seeing him so néere, he claspt him in his strong armes: The Pagan refused not to wrestle, neither would he, if hee had béen <hi>Anteus.</hi> There was neuer battell so fought; for they were so lockt together, that they stood more firmely fixed in the ground, then the roots of a great and wel growne Oke.
<pb facs="tcp:13979:35"/>
All men wondred at this rigorous combat, thinking with themselues, that there neuer was the like séene in the world: and so was the King saying to the Prince his sonne, that hee was much beholding to the Knight of Cruelty, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how he had dealt with him, and the like to the Prince of Campania, who maruelling much thereat, said, I doe certainely beléeue, that this battell will be perpetually me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable, and much it would grieue me, that eyther of them should die, séeing how great losse their death would bring to the world. The sorrow would bee generall, (saide the gentle <hi>Lisander</hi> of Lucania) who was of opinion, that hee in the yellow would obtaine the victorie. They turned to behold the battell, which at that instant was maintained with much obstinacie, but in the end they were of flesh, and fell to the ground, they gaue ouer their hold, betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to their armes, where with they afresh renewed the battell, which was worth the séeing, although with some aduantage to the Gréeke; for as he was more nymble, hee charged and retyred with agilitie both of body and minde. The Pagan would haue relied himselfe, who, as hee was heauily armed, and corpulent of body, and the battell had lasted so long, he was out of breath, &amp; said thus, If it please you, Sir Knight, let vs rest vs a little; for there remaineth time inough to ende the battell.

It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed betwéene them, that on that side of the Ladies garden which <hi>Florisiano</hi> knew, they should come, where she would warrant his life, and receiue him for her husband. The young man went downe so troubled, to sée himselfe in her presence, and not to lead her by the hand, which loued him as her selfe, as it were impossible, but that his alteration would be noted. To auoid tediousnes, I do not set downe how he felt himselfe, when he knew what the Ladie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.

               <p>Those few houres which they past, seemed a thousand, to goe to the place appointed, where, hauing taken order for all that was to be caried, the Ladie leauing a letter for her father, contayning a thousand amorous excuses, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him all the whole course of their loue past, she stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in company of the faire <hi>Solersia,</hi> who would not part without speaking to the valiant <hi>Florisiano.</hi>

But the pleasant <hi>Solersia,</hi> imbracing the Prince of Apulia, said, I would not valiant Prince, that that Ladie had told vs the discouerie of <hi>Iaroe,</hi> for it had beene to put vs in new griefe, to loue you, not as the Carthagonian, but as the Lord of Apulia. I was assured, worthie Princesse, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Prince) that shée who then did me fauour, would now worthily accomplish it with that generositie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are endued. Your sight and new acquaintance (quoth shée) is for so small a time, that I cannot suffer this Ladie to enioy the same, to whome your absence hath béene so grieuous, that shée could hardly bee comforted: But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the heauens will that you come together, there is nothing to bee done but to giue thankes therefore; and wee are all glad thereof.</p>
               <p>Those true louers imbraced each other with so much ioy as cannot bee imagined; it sufficeth to beléeue, that it was the greatest in the world, being purchased with so much troubles, which doe season the good when it commeth to bee enioyed. About an houre they stoode talking, giuing many thankes to the Greeke for that which hee had done for them, admiring his beautie and few yeeres. Much it grieued the Ladies to depart; but séeing that it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, giuing in charge to <hi>Solersia,</hi> to procure her Fathers good will, and excuse the Prince of Apulia, with his beloued <hi>Lisander,</hi> giuing strickt imbraceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts they tooke their leaue, the Ladie returned to her lodging without being perceiued. The Princes in their armes receiued the Kings daughter, which went away very feareful of her Fathers displeasure; it was good hap that shée lost not her sences for sorrow; but <hi>Lisander</hi> and his beloued <hi>Solersia</hi> tooke so good order, that

And so in a short space, he armed twentie thousand Knights, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating the Prince <hi>Claridiano,</hi> to goe into Gréece with him: who yéelded thereto, but vpon condition, that he should neuer speake to any man of him; for no lesse then his life depended thereon.</p>
               <p>And so they tooke their course towards the great port of Grecia, where they arriued in happie time, not without many great suddaine passions of the Gréeke louer, to know himselfe so néere to her whome he carried in his soule; they tooke land, the Emperour receiuing them with such graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as appertained. But the Gréeke louer would neuer disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his name, neither would hee see her which was Ladie of his life; and therefore tooke his leaue of the Ladies, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Emperour, that he would not depart out of Grecia before the warres were ended, which was then euen at their doores, the enemies comming being most certaine; with his Squire <hi>Palisander</hi> alone, accompanied with a thousand pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of loue, hee tooke his way into a wood, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, The wood of Willowes, purposing to change his armes, and so vnknowne to giue aide to his Grand-father. Hee greatly reioyced, to sée the great good preparation in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, being of opinion, that with so great armies and so well armed, the land might be defended against all the rest of the world.

All those which had knowen her, desired no lesse, her rare beautie leauing them affected vnto her, and the faith and loyalty which she euer bare to her prince.</p>
               <p>They were quickly in better and more certeine hopes; for to sée the couragious Knight without Armes, had sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed it, as with a cloud: but not to sée him so, with great fury hee strake the sayle, with greater courage then before he had shewen, when his person was furnished, putting himselfe in point, not onely to defend himself, but also to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend &amp; recouer his lost Armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Contrary to his desire stood those of the towre, saying, There requireth more care to be taken in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comming in, sir Knight, then you haue yet shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; which is a matter, which onely to haue it, will put it in your hands.</p>
               <p>There hath not bene so great want thereof (sayd the furious yong man) as of your part there doeth wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse abound, wherewith you haue procéeded; and to the ende that you may sée that I am not without Armes, stay, and you shall see, how costly your cousinage will proue vnto you. And here with like a royall Eagle, with a iumpe hée set himselfe in the midst of the Hall, where, O <hi>Apollo,</hi> that thou hadst the describing of this battaile, to set it out in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the acts of this yong Gréeke, according as they did deserue, which were worthy of no lesse then thy wisedome, and not of his that is bare and vnfurnished of grace, and method, who yet hath not had knowledge and experience of the deceites in loue, what it is to be beloued, &amp; what to liue secure from the paine which the soule féeleth!

Yet notwithstanding tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb facs="tcp:13979:39"/>
in your fauour, I will begin to describe the doings of this Gréek, to set at libertie the Lady, whom hee best loued euer in his life.</p>
               <p>In the midst of the Hall, he stood expecting these 2. which more swift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Sacre flying after her praie, came, the one with a battaile-axe aloft, &amp; the other with the well sharpened sword of <hi>Theseus.</hi> The first was more spéedy in deliuering his blow, (which stood y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince in no little stead) for making him to lose it, with a ship he closed with him: and as for his dagger, there was neither Armor nor enchantment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> could resist it: and finding himselfe néere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight of the towre, he strake him on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> top of his left shoulder, &amp; drew it out againe dyed in his blood. By this time the other was come, with more discretion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first: for hauing noted the quicknes &amp; agilitie of the enemy, he came well in breath, with his sword in his hand, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> point forwards. The yong man had good hap, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ran him not thorow; for he tooke it vnder his arme. He of the towre thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had sped him; &amp; so drawing backe his sword, which making way to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh, came foorth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dangerous hurt, hee marked his fortune, &amp; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it was no fearefull hurt; he would not lose occasion in a matter where it was so necessary, to sée himself destitute of Armes, &amp; so with the strength that he recouered aboue all others of his time, he gaue him a perillous stab in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midst of his brest, &amp; had slaine him, if he had not giuen back, drawing out his bloody dagger, at what time as he with the battaile axe came, wel strengthned on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> left shoulder, he would haue run him in with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> point: the Gréeke could do no more, but with his force and his dagger, shun y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fearefull halbard; but not so, but that he first wounded him shrewdly, going foorth in the arme: he feared ill successe, because the battell was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnequall, with so apparant disaduantage: yet for all this, although he saw himself hurt in some places, &amp; the hal sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with his blood, hee made no shew of want of courage, but rather with greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had held in former battailes, he charged and retyred vpon his enemies, and ranged them, couered all ouer with their owne bloud.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:40"/>Those which sawe the battaile, did wonder, assuring themselues that they had neuer seene the like in their liues; and it was so indeed, for fewe had there past like this, for those of the towre liue onely to fight, and our <hi>Claramant,</hi> to be feared, so as the heauens had the more enabled them both, to the end to yéeld the battaile the more cruell.</p>

O fortunate Knight (said the gentle <hi>Clarintea</hi> of Celandia) séeing that before it is knowen who he is, the Ladyes dispose of themselues who shall best loue him.</p>
               <p>This followeth valour well employed, said the gallant <hi>Venus,</hi> who drew néere, although I haue knowen another Knight no lesse worthie to be beloued, then he of the Lyons; and heerein the Lady <hi>Laysa</hi> will take my part. For this which is so well knowen, who would but drawe néere, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with hazard of life, answered the Lady? for there would want no Knights to helpe me.</p>
               <p>I would not bee the last (sayd the venturous <hi>Dacian</hi>) for me thinketh, that with those of the towre al runneth at euen hand. It is no small matter to come to so doubtfull bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, with this apparant disaduantage (said <hi>Claridiana</hi>) and in requital of what these Ladyes haue shewed, the Prince of Dacia shall tell vs who this Knight is.</p>
               <p>He hath héere so much kindred (sayd <hi>Don Heleno</hi>) that whereas he might fight for iustice, here he might doe it for affection. He presently shewed them in what maner he met with the Prince of Grecia, and <hi>Trapisonda,</hi> in Sclauonia, and what had happened vnto him concerning the fayre

               <p>They could procéed no further, for the great noyse which the people made, which were in the Court: and beholding the cause thereof, they saw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Knight of the Lyons, after two houres space, in a most bloody battaile, defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from him with the halberd ioyned with him, and clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the same néere where he held it, with a sudden touch hee pluckt it out of his hands, thrusting him a good way off from him: he gat it not so scot-frée, but that hee receiued a greater wound then he had of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day giuen him, in one of his thighes, so as without great paine he could not stir it; he felt-it not for ioy that he had gotten this wished for halberd, wherewith hee was a <hi>Phoenix</hi> in Armes: With this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous weapon he made roome in the Hall.</p>
               <p>There can no sorrow be compared to theirs which were in the towre, especially his which had lost it. For al this they would grant him no entrance: but with two poinyards with a soft pace he made towards the Gréeke, and in comming néere him, making shew with the greatest force &amp; quicknes in the world to come within him, he hurled one at him; the Lord defended him, for the great good which for his sake he should accomplish. In throwing this cruell poinyard, hee mist his brest, but strake him thorow the arme, from side to side; the payne pierced him to the very soule, but before they parted, he gaue him his deserued payment, welding his hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd so wel as he could, hee reatch him such a knocke on the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know not, (worthie Ladies) how I am entred into this déepe sea, which here presenteth it selfe to me: for if I should describe all those Ladies which came to salute the faire <hi>Lindabrides,</hi> there would be no end thereof.

               <p>This is a passage, (worthy Ladies) which without your fauour, I know not how I shall get out of it.</p>
               <p>Worthy Empresse, (said the frée Princesse) I would the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:44"/>
heauens would haue graunted vnto me in time past, to doe that with as little care as now I doe, séeing how little this Knight hath had of me. Mine was neuer so much (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Emperour <hi>Alphebus</hi>) supreme Princesse of the Scithes, as the care which your comelinesse put mee to, so as to defend my selfe from the force thereof, I was enforced to shield me with the beautie of my Ladie the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse. The rest of the Ladies left not to come forwards, which came to entertaine her, some to know her, and others to behold her brauerie. They wholly (valorous Prince) ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away both my wit and penne after them, and it is no great maruaile: for where Ladies are, there Knights are not to be spoken of, for that were to doe them wrong, and were it not for <hi>Claramante,</hi> I would not returne; to whom his mother holding him in her armes, vttered a thousand pittifull spéeches. But leauing at last, most glad to sée him before her, dissembling the ioy of her heart, there came his seuere Father, who embracing him, said, No man vpon earth hath more reason to be glad then I, séeing that when I thought least thereof, it hath pleased the high heauens to cherish our old age with your faire presence. The Princes and Knights which were there, tooke him out of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours armes, saying, Let vs in part enioy this Knight, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee hath béene as much desired and wished for by vs as you which are his parents. These were those which tolde him, what all those Knights were which came to speake with him: he receiued al with so great grace and discretion, that they al loued him. I should spend more time then were reasonable, if I should particularly set down the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, onely this I say, that with such contentment as is requisite in such a case, they went into the Emperours hall, where each Ladie called to her, her gallant, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them the rest of the time which remained, with great desire to know <hi>Don Heleno</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundi,</hi> and no lesse to know <hi>Rosabel</hi> and his beloued <hi>Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana.</hi> In the middest were the gallant <hi>Claramante, Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides,</hi>

               <p>AS all Gréece daily expected the comming of so mighty a Prince as the Soldan of Niquea, so was there no man troubled with this defiance, except the Prince of Dacia, whose colour waxing as red as a liue coale, said, Well did I imagine, Knight, that with your prowd ambassade there should come some Knight which should not weigh whether iustice were on his side or not; for although that now there be no time to make excuses, admitting the defiance, I say,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:45"/>
that all that wherewith thou doest charge mee is false, for although that I tried the adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture of <hi>Bruto</hi> in the name of that Princesse; yet there was neuer any speach of her part that I should be hers; and in prouoking such Princes against me, they haue done it disloyally, séeing in perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might haue come and requested mée this: that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other occasion they will trouble the world led by their blind passion: as for the rest, I hope that the life which they wish me, to sée their reuenge, but I beléeue I shall sée it first on them; and to the end it shall not happen, I with my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and friends will séeke them at home in their owne countryes. He said no more, for he well remembred y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had bene more cholericke then is vsuall with Embassadours.</p>
               <p>But the faire <hi>Rosamundi</hi> could not dissemble her griefe, séeing her louer defied, of whom she had vnderstood all that which had passed at Rome, and taking occasion of what <hi>Coriander</hi> had said, she said, Me thinketh (Knight) you haue offended many, with your presumptuous maner of procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in scoffing in disdaine at the Gréeke Ladies, for to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Dacian Prince to be of lesse worth, for being in our company. Hereby the iustnesse of the cause, for which you come, is the more plainely to be perceiued: and because you shall vnderstand, that the comming from Kings, doth not warrant you, when you haue receyued your answere, I wil make you know, that there are Ladies in Gréece, whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie yéeldeth honour to Knights which frequent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. There will not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t those which will maintaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> challenge (quoth the faire <hi>Archisilora</hi> burning with anger) for such a disgrace as this shall not passe vnpunished. For a mediator (answered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi>) here is mine arme which in fauour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies, shall shew their equitie. In so iust a cause (sayd the faire <hi>Sarmatia</hi>) there is none that will refuse the combate against any of the fiue. I would I had <hi>Mars</hi> his strength (quoth the faire <hi>Liriana</hi>) to let these Knights know, that it had bene better for them to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken some other course. Let not that offend you, (sayd the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:46"/>
faire <hi>Rosamundi</hi>) for I, (as most iniuried) doe in challenge defie this Knight, and one of his companions, to the ende they may sée how little they are estéemed. All which was done with such a sudden, that the Emperour, although hee would, yet he could not haue enter medled therein. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what milder than before, (the furious <hi>Coriandro</hi> answered) Faire Ladies, where the victorie is so apparantly due to your beauties, the Knights of Gibea do not vse to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to battels, but against sterne Knights, where the valour of the persons may appeare, &amp; I am very sorie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whereas so many Knights are, they haue yéelded to the Ladies to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the honour of Grecia. This did somewhat nettle the Greeke Princes, that together arose thrée, which well shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they were. They were no lesse then <hi>Rosabel,</hi> the warlike <hi>Claramante,</hi> and the furious <hi>Dacian,</hi> who being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, without all doubt, would haue had them by the eares. But to auoid the hurly burly, the old King of Macedonia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, willing the Ambassadours to goe with him, while the Greekes gaue answere: a thousand times was <hi>Bembo</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All was left to the field battell, where wanted no occasion, and euery man had his handes full, as you shall heare. The defiance being accepted, they dispatched the Messengers, which did not a little wonder at the Ladies, and much more at the great Nauie, which they saw at sea, and the innumerable armie, which they saw on land: and (because that in the Citie there was not roome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) the Captaine generall had commanded many tents to be erected, compassed about with deepe trenches, which seemed another Citie. Some dayes they stayed, because that thither came the wise Lord of Achaia who, before he would goe forth of Gréece, desired to be informed of the state of his enemies; but finding many contrarieties, he much doubted of the good successe, according to most mens opinion, seeing the great and mightie armies leuied against the Gréekes.</p>

Shée did so dissemble, and that with such courtesie, that it tooke away all occasion from them to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them, although that without it, the fiue did assure them selues, nothing imagining that there had béene any women in Grecia which bare armes, and that that which they heard at the Court was but a iest: and so the braue <hi>Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> gently answered, holding himselfe sufficient to haue ouercome all the foure: Because, Sir Knights, you shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the commaund of the Ladies, we accept thereof

(vpon condition, that whosoeuer shal lose y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saddle at the encounter, shall not desire to come to fight with the sword: you (requiring this condition) shall not thinke it much, that we desire another in our behalfe, which is, that whosoeuer shall fall, shall lose his shield; for there is nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Ladies are better pleased, then to see their beauties so well defended, bringing for testimonie thereof the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries armes. All (quoth one of the Giants) shall bee as you will haue it, for remaining without the shields, it shall bee no great matter, to make you beholding to vs for our good déeds. Without making any answere, the gallant <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samundi</hi> turned the furious <hi>Tirian,</hi> who came more swift then the Sunne beames betwéene the clouds.</p>
               <p>I would to God, worthy Ladies, séeing this matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth you, that you would assist my slow hand with some new fauours, which would furnish meanes to make the matter the more easie, to recount the best iusts that euer were in the world: for comming to encounter with a full carreere, (with greater noyse, then the swelling Seas make beating the miserable Ships against the high Rockes) they brake their Launces as if they had beene little Réedes; but before it was done, the Pagan, who assured himselfe of the victorie, smote the Ladie in the middest of the white brest, with so great force, that hee strake her sencelesse out of the Saddle: but fortune was much her friend, and durst doe no other, for shée set her hand on the pummell of the Saddle; where shée held fast till shée recouered breath, and therewith the Saddle, wondering at the strong encounter. Hers was no lesse to be noted, for shée smiting the braue Pagan with such force, that before that her Launce brake, shee laide him on the greene field, falling with such disgrace vpon his head, that he remained sencelesse with the blow. Well may you imagine (gallant Dames) whether the thrée faire Ladies were well pleased, with the good beginning which the Princesse had made: shée stoode with a better grace behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the fierce Pagan, then can bee spoken, making her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
<pb facs="tcp:13979:48"/>
to make more accompt of her, then of <hi>Mars</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: for being mounted vpon so good a horse, and so gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly armed, neuer had any a better presence then she; shee commanded the Squire (for they all foure had but one) to take away the Moores shield. Presently commeth forth the gallant <hi>Archisilora,</hi> giuing no lesse hope of her valour, then <hi>Rosamundi</hi> had done: one of the foure Gyants confronted her; it did nothing moue her to sée him so great, as a well growne Pine trée, but rather praying the Heauens to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour her in this encounter, she ran with her Courser more swift then a starre falling betwéene the cloudes; there were those which bare record of this encounter, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods of the woods leauing their habitation, with their Nimphes and Tritons, came into the gréene field at the very instant, that that famous Quéene made the brauest encounter that euer was séene in Gréece: for hitting the Pagan in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the strong shield, it auailed him not that it was of stéele, neither the doubles which it had, for through it and the brest-plate (being a handfull thicke) it past cléere, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an armes length of the launce thorough his beastly shoulders, the swiftnesse wherewith her Courser came made him to misse the shocke: shée past forwards with so good a grace, as would haue intangled <hi>Mars,</hi> the countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Archisilora</hi> onely was sufficient to haue made him to yéeld his soule captiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shée returned, and with a soft pace came to the Ladies, which were very glad of the good encounter which shée had made; onely she wished that her Gréeke louer had bene there. The valorous Empresse of <hi>Trapisonda</hi> would stay no longer, but mounting vpon <hi>Cornerino</hi> her horse, came sorth as swift as an arrowe which is shot by a nimble Sorian at a certaine marke: she did nothing enuie the last encounters, for although that in that which she receyued, she lost one of her stirrops; yet that which she gaue was so rigorous, that shée therewith sent the Giant to the ground, wounded in his brest; and
<pb facs="tcp:13979:49"/>
but that her launce brake not, striking somewhat acrosse, it had cost him his life. The two famous warriours, <hi>Bembo</hi> and the great <hi>Brauorante,</hi> séeing the valour which the thrée had shewen, and the signes that the fourth had giuen, to be no lesse then the rest, it was euen so as they imagined: for the faire <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> with her furious horse, charged the third Gyant with such force and doxteritie, that shee laid him, (though it much grieued him) in the gréene field: forth shee rode, and recouered both her stirrops, which in the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she had lost: forwards went the gallant <hi>Rosamundi,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken vp the dead Gyants launce, and said vnto those which remained on horsebacke, I would very gladly, Sir Knights, that wee were in number equall vnto you, to the end, that with equalitie, the Iusts might haue béene ended. But now me thinketh, that you séeking reuenge, for that which is done to your companions, we beeing but foure, of force you must beginne againe with me. The last Gyant, which was the most valiant of al, made no longer delay, but whorling a ships mast (which he bare in stead of a launce) about his head, tooke his carriere against the Ladie: she gaue spurres to her horse, as &amp; swift as thought, encountred the Pagan, and did better this time then the last; for his strong plancks of stéele could nothing profite him, but that shee smote him cleane thorow from side to side: the horses came to the shocke, and made greater noise, then if two rocks had met: but as the Ladies horse had not his like in that land, so he ouerthrew the Gyant, horse and man, spreading them vpon the gréene field: and her horse set him on his buttocks, being vnable to goe any further. The valorous Dame, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring some ill successe, (as light as an Eagle) leapt to the ground, &amp; séeing her good horse recouer, with another iumpe shee leapt into her saddle. The most strong Pagan <hi>Brauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> blaspheming against heauen, would haue taken his course, when the Ladie said vnto him, Hold, Sir Knight, for there is time enough for our encounter; for I would speake with this Knight in the gréene skarfe, pointing to <hi>Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi> which was the man whom she had ouerthrowne, who
<pb facs="tcp:13979:49"/>
hauing recouered breath, was mounted on horsebacke, but without speare or shield. The like had the other two Giants done, to whom the Ladie said, I am very sory, Sir Knight, for your ill hap; but I was more sory to sée the few maners which you shewed in Grecia, for you should haue had more respect to the great princes which were in the hall, wherein you grieued many Ladies, being in your prowd behauiour farre more arrogant then valiant: if that might not haue moued you, it had bene sufficient for you to haue noted the courtesie and good carriage of these Knights in the blacke, who made shew to be hartily sory for your prowd demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which deserued that reuenge which you now haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented: and because you may sée the hands which haue wrought it, and may say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in Grecia as Knights vse Iusts and Tournaments; so like wise Ladies also séeke reuenge, which peraduenture may serue for a warning for you Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, that they come with lesse pride then their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours haue done: and so, although your pride deserue it not, yet we will do you this fauour, to tell you who we are, to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being well assured, you may be glad to haue left your armes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kéeping of such ladies, together with your honor: &amp; at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> instant they tooke off their caskes, appearing by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heate of their encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, sar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13979:50"/>
although being sent, they might be somewhat excused (if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse may be admitted for errour committed against such beautie.) But it séemeth, as it doth appeare, that who can so well take offence, can as well take reuenge, without néed of any offer to be made by any your gallants: against whom rather then against your daintinesse, the challenge was made. But it is past in such sort, that you rest reuenged, making vs, beeing bounden vnto you for your courtesie, to giue ouer the right, which we had to the Iusts, for your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge was to all. That which you do, valorous Knight, is not of so small account, but may deserue requitall at our hands, which shall be, to leaue vs in greater doubt then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The famous Prince would haue answered, when as not farre from them, there came along by a woods side, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Knight with the Dames, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuice which he bare vpon his shield, approching néere vnto him, said, (Sir Knight) you are without all doubt, hee which is called the Knight of the Lions, to whom I bring a message from farre hence, from a Knight which is called the Knight of Crueltie, who knowing that I came for Gréece, requested mee to visit you in his behalfe, &amp; to tell you, that he would be here with all spéed possible, and told me farther, that I should bee a gayner hereby, for I should sée the gallantest Knight of the world: hee told me so many things in praise of you, that hée
<pb facs="tcp:13979:50"/>
made mee much to affect you, with a desire to trie my small, with your much valour, and although that I bee sure to be ouercome, I shall take it with the more patience, but our fight shall be without swords or Helmes, with our daggers onely; and if you so please, we will deferre no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time, if you will not, I haue performed what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to that Knight, and as I desired.</p>
               <p>For the newes (Sir Knight) which you bring me, of that warlike young man, in requitall thereof, I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imploy mee to doe you any seruice, then by battell to offend you. But séeing you haue challenged me, there is no reason but to yéeld to your demaund, accepting the battell, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presently, séeing you so please. I assured my self before my comming, that I should receiue so generous an answere, said the other, so as weighing and considering the fame and valour, which is bruted euerie where of you, I know not who would not refuse it, and if I had not demaunded it, I would leaue it, for these reasons haue put me in more feare, then if I had séene the daunger and my certaine ouerthrow before mine eyes: but yet let it be, notwithstanding, that without it I will remaine your prisoner so long as I liue. The Prince of Trapisonda had vnlaced his Helmet, and séeing the valorous young man busied in taking off of his, vpon a suddaine hee was transformed into the likenesse of god <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time had <hi>Claramante</hi> fully taken off his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and being about to assaile his nephew, séeing him without a helmet, he said vnto him, Stay, valorous knight, for with my death you will offend your louing friend <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano.</hi> He put off his inchaunted Iewel, remaining in his perfect shape, saying, Why, how now, valorous Knight, so highly hath the Prince of Gréece offended you, that you should prepare your self to grieue him? I reposemore trust in your arme. This new louer was so surprised with ioy, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him before him whom he most dearely loued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could make him no answere; but casting his arms about his neck,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:51"/>
he said: O gentle gods, how fauorable haue you shewn your selues in my behalfe, hauing reserued so great a good for me as is this, which is the greatest that could happen vnto me! O desired Prince! and is it possible that fortune should bee pleased, to bring mee to so happie estate? I beséech the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, that they season this but with some meane ill hap. I will not stand now to repeate what passed betwéene these two, but of that onely which hee told, had happened vnto him in Gréece, and how hee knew that he was his vnkle. There shall néede no great perswasion to make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, how great ioy he conceiued of so pleasing newes: hee told him all that had happened, and of the remedie which his Master the wizard had giuen him, to the end that he should come into Gréece, to the reliefe of his Grand-father, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being knowne to any body, which it behoued him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale, vntill such time as he should further aduise him.</p>
               <p>The noyse which was in the Iusts with the Ladies, did interrupt their discourse, and so putting on their Helmets, and the Prince his rich Iewel, as hard as their horses could driue, they tooke their way directly towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where the noyse was, arriuing iust at the instant when the Ladie <hi>Rosamundi</hi> had made an end of giuing thankes to <hi>Bembo,</hi> for leauing the battell: but as these two approached, who did most faithfully loue in the world, O, who had a refined wit to describe what the one &amp; the other felt in themselues, onely in beholding the one the other? <hi>Claramante</hi> reioyced for that hee was the first which came to the rescue of these dames, if there had béene any néede thereof; he maruailed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I cannot tell how it
<pb facs="tcp:13979:51"/>
came to my minde, to describe the suspition which that Quéene conceyued in her heart, that that should be her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued <hi>Claridiano</hi>: for as hee had the best grace of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man, if she saw any man to excell, she presently imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it was he. O mightie power of loue! but the houre is not yet come, to know who he was. <hi>Bembo</hi> and the great <hi>Brauorante</hi> knowing the gentle <hi>Claramante</hi> by his armes, prepared themselues to fight, being netled with that which past at Sea. All this is nothing (gallant Dames) to that which the disguised yong man felt, séeing himselfe disguised in the presence of her, (who ruled the helme of his life,) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o faire, &amp; so surpassing excellent, that he held the griefe which he endured, well employed, séeing it was for hersake. But comming néere her, hee became more timorous, then if hee should haue attempted the most doubtfull aduenture of the world. There was not in all that land a Gallant, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more déerely loued, and therewith that liued more iealous of his honour. Hee knew not whereupon to resolue, whether hée should speake to her, or make himselfe knowne, desiring her to pardon what was past. A thousand doubts came into his minde: in the end he determined, to the end not to offend her, to passe his discontented life as well as he could, in this shape of god <hi>Mars,</hi> and to sée if hee could perceiue by her lookes, whether his absence were grieuous vnto her or no, and whether she had so cruelly vanished him from her sight. The valorous <hi>Claramante</hi> drew néere, and séeing the Gréek Dames, hee suddenly put off his caske, and discouered his faire face, saying, I know not, how I could haue come, without great errour (valorous Dames) but to sée the work of your hands vpon these Gyants: but séeing this battell is fought in the behalfe of the gallants, I in their name doe come to giue thanks, and yéeld acknowledgement for the much which they owe, for such a matter as this, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth no other requitall, but what procéedeth from your valour.</p>
               <p>We would not, Sir Prince, said <hi>Archisilora,</hi> (who loued
<pb facs="tcp:13979:52"/>
him extremely, for hauing so long accompanied her louer) that you should discharge your selfe of the debt, wherein these Ladies haue set you. That should be too much want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement (quoth he.) Who would not be thankefull, and to liue onely thereof? for, what greater good can come to the Gallants of Gréece, then to acknowledge, what they owe to such Soueraigne Princesses? In this maner wee may then in safetie returne, with the spoiles gotten on the Romane Knights, who reposing such confidence in their pride, little regarded our valour, and (as I thinke) as little our beautie. The furious <hi>Bembo</hi> could forbeare no longer, but like a Uiper, (although with mild spéeches) aduanced himselfe forwards, before these Dames should returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gréece, saying, Wee would not, Knight of the Lyons, that you should haue come so assured, and with such confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your owne valour, that before whom you haue so much displeased, as this Knight and me, you should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed: and were it not, that the order of Knighthood doth detaine vs, we would with small cost take reuenge of our wrongs.</p>
               <p>The confidence, Sir Knight, is not so much of my selfe, answered the Gréeke, as of these valorous Dames, who with their presence, are able to encourage and giue new va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to the arrantest coward that liueth: and moreouer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauing your selues as to Knights appertaineth, you should first tell me the cause of your displeasure, because I doe not remember that I haue offended any man. That is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of those which doe wrongs; for they write it in the sands: but those that receiue them, imprint them in their hearts, quoth the bold <hi>Bembo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, let it not grieue you, quoth <hi>Claramante,</hi> for there is time, and now the best that can be wished, hauing such witnesses, for your satisfaction, which as you say, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute with such vehemencie.</p>
               <p>Why then, quoth the Pagan, there is nothing that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs any cause, why wee should deferre the battell any
<pb facs="tcp:13979:52"/>
longer, so as there may rest time for our companions.</p>
               <p>In stead of this Knight, quoth the proud <hi>Claridiano,</hi> sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with what pride they had defied his Uncle, hee may fight with me, for my death will bee no lesse lamented then his, and it will ill befit vs to stand by, dallying, and sée our friends maintaine fight with manifest perill.</p>
               <p>Let it be as you wil, said the furious Pagan <hi>Brauorante,</hi> furning about his swift running horse; the like did all the thrée, and that so suddenly, that notwithstanding that the Ladies would haue hindred it, séeing the matter so farre past, they durst not, for offending the Gréeke, assuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of his valour, and that hee would end that fight with victorie. And <hi>Archisilora,</hi> rather to kéepe them company, said, turning towards <hi>Coriandro,</hi> I am of opinion, that you are desirous to haue occasion to helpe your friends; and because you shall not say when you come to Rome, that you could not come to all kinde of battels, wee giue you leaue thereto, and to that ende returne you your shield againe. The Pagan was so proud, that without giuing thanks for what was offred, hee said, Why then, by and by you shall sée, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The two Gyants made no longer delay, but drawing out their huge Cemitars, they made towards the Ladies, which had already put on their Helmets: they left, although against their will, the gentle <hi>Sarmacia</hi> for Iudge, and so with their swords in their hands, &amp; their shields on their armes, they attended their comming.

<pb facs="tcp:13979:53"/>
his head to the Saddle pummel: it was not possible it should doe lesse: he seconded it with another of no lesse force, so that the skies containe not so many stars, as he saw within his rich Helmet. This serued but to vrge him to take reuenge; for setling himselfe in his Saddle, (considering what had passed) as fierce as a Basiliske, hee charged <hi>Bembo,</hi> who warded it with his shield, whereon hee receiued so great a blow, which was such, that it beat it to his Helmet, and made him almost sencelesse: hee holpe him with a thrust in the brest, which set him on the arson of his Saddle, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching at him with another, nothing doubting to ouerthrow him, but his sword winding in his hand, so as he smote him on one side of the Helmet, which holpe to bring the Pagan againe to his remembrance.</p>
               <p>There was neuer Lion which so fiercely assailed a heard, as this young man did his aduersarie: they were close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at one time they smote each the other vpon the top of their Helmets, and bowed downe their heads downe to their brests. The Moore was most nimble, and knowing that therein he had some aduantage, spurring his horse, hee ioyned with the Gréeke, who stoode not at his defence, when the Moore gaue him two such thrusts, the one after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if they had not lighted on <hi>Theseus</hi> his armes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had parted the soule from the bodie, and made him (sore against his will) to fall backe on the arson of his Saddle. The <hi>Achaian</hi> knight was not a man which would lose the benefit of any occasion: for before that he could come vpon him againe, with all his whole power hee smote him on the middest of the visor, and made him starke blind, and yet <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> saith, that he made him readie to fall. All these blowes gaue occasion to put the young man in choler: there was no defence in the Moores armes, against the strong arme and good temper of his sword, but that hee hurled the one halfe of his Helmet to the ground: hee had scarcely done this, when with another blow no lesse furious then the last, with his sword hee smote a great péece of his shield to the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:54"/>
ground, and the sword lighting on his shoulder, smote away the one halfe of his Poldron. All this was nothing to that which passed betwéene his nephew and the valorous <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorante,</hi> which encountring with a greater noyse then the thunder maketh betwéene the cloudes, they smote their Launces into little splinters, which flying in the ayre, gaue signe of the fortitude of these warriours. The Pagan lost one of his Stirrops, but he recouered it so soone againe, that no body perceiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault. That serued but to enflame him like a Uiper against the Christian; they both together encountred with their swordes aloft: there were no better Armes in the world then those which they two did weare, but they were not of force sufficient to kéepe their Masters, being tormented with blowes, from bowing downe their heads to their angrie brests, they seconded them with such force as set them on their Saddles pummels; the Greeke was better in breath, and therefore he first recouered, &amp; with such quicknesse as is requisite in such a case, hee gaue him on the side of the Helmet, such a terrible blow, that made him make a foule bending backwards in his Saddle: hee was so gréedie to giue him another, that hee came more néere vnto him then was requisite, and for that cause being vnable to strike, they were constrained to make shew of friendship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to this streight, as to claspe one the other with their armes; there was neuer séene a more dreadfull strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: for although that they could not help themselues with their féete, yet they did so tug with their hands, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were quite out of breath, &amp; their horses knéeling on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, gaue two furious cries.

all ouer with their owne bloud, especially <hi>Coriandro,</hi> who fought with <hi>Rosamundi,</hi> who séeing the Knight in the yellow in the ground, much affected to the valour which he had shewne, and assuring her selfe of the strength of her <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> shée assailed <hi>Coriandro,</hi> doing him greater fauour then he deserued; for shée clasped her faire armes about his necks with such force, that shée haled him out of his Saddle; he fell on his féete, where againe began the battell, but with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant aduantage, for shée gaue him neuer a blow, but that did cut his armour and his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After her came a Giant, who was the cause that <hi>Claramante,</hi> shifting <hi>Bembo</hi> from him with a thrust, at two skips he was with the Pagan, making him lose his Saddle, and then he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Bembo,</hi> who with a great pace went towards <hi>Claridia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who being sore brused with her fal, was now risen. The valorous Ladie had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing by dealing with <hi>Bembo,</hi> but the new louer approached, doing wonders incredible to any mans iudgement. The fierce Giant which had a fall on the ground, seeing his sword broken with the fall, ranne to <hi>Claramante</hi> his horse to get the Battel-axe. But hee could not do it: for the Quéen of Lira, as fierce as a Serpent, met him with her horse brest, so as she tumbled him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. By that time was the braue <hi>Claridiano</hi> come, and thinking that he should doe good with his Axe on foote, he tooke it from the Saddle bow; hee was not so nimble with this terrible weapon as his vnkle was: for euery blow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee gaue, was mortall; he put it in practise against the Giant, which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on horseback, who with his monstrous sword had giuen the Quéen such a blow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her rich helmet, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being vnable to
<pb facs="tcp:13979:55"/>
breake it, (the buckles thereof being loose) hee smote it from her head, leauing her amazed at the strangenesse of the blow. The Pagan would haue seconded it, and without all doubt had slaine her, but that <hi>Claridiano</hi> came couered al ouer with a cold sweate, to sée the mistresse of his soule in so notable a daunger, he aduanced his Battel-axe with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter furie, then discretion, fortune was his good friend, for hitting him vpon the top of the shoulder, the edge of the Axe turning inwards, it smote off his head so easily, that <hi>Mars</hi> was amazed thereat: hee came to the Quéene, who yet had not put on her Helmet, who presenting himselfe vnto her, said, Kéepe you aloofe, valorous Ladie, for although that you bee cruell to him which dooth most adore you, yet it is not lawfull for me so long as I liue, to permit any crueltie to be done against your worthinesse. These words were so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the middest of the Quéenes heart, that shée was of opinion that without any doubt, that was hée whom shée best loued: shée had taken him by the arme and asked him a thousand questions, but that they were otherwise so much busied: that notwithstanding, yet shée said vnto him with a tendernesse of heart, Follow, worthie warriour, the fortune which the heauens haue ordained for thy greater fame, such a seruice as this is not requited with thankes, but you haue made mee bounden vnto you in any thing that shall please you. Ah, <hi>Claridiano,</hi> said the gallant young man to himselfe, if the Ladie knowing thée had said this, what paine could there be which should not bee pleasing? what displeasure could the heauens doe me which here with might not bee made tolerable? And herewith, faining that shée said so, brandishing his cruell weapon, hee assaulted his enemie. It was in good time: for he found (in an ill taking) her who had borne him in the middest of her intrailes: for the furious <hi>Brauorante</hi> at the verie instant of his arriuall, with a blow had made her set her hands to the ground, and was about to haue giuen her another, when the braue Gréeke stopt his passage, reaching him a far off such a knocke with <hi>Theseus</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:55"/>
battel-axe, that made him runne faster backwards then he came forwards. Let your Soueraigne greatnesse hold your selfe aloofe off, valorous Empresse of <hi>Trabisonda,</hi> said her dearely beloued sonne, for it is not reasonable that to hands so generous should happen any disgrace. The Ladie wondered to sée that shée was knowne by that Knight, and imagining that it was some of her kindred, shée assailed the Giant which had falne to the ground, with whome shée returned to a most cruell battell, but it lasted not long, quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the same with the death of the Giant. Alone remained <hi>Claridiano, Claramante,</hi> and the gallant <hi>Rosamundi,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Bembo, Brauorante,</hi> and the furious <hi>Coriandro,</hi> whose fight, O Muses of Pernassus, that a man might dip his pen in the fountain of your sacred liquor! for much more doe these fixe most rare in valour deserue: they fell out of order, for against <hi>Rosamundi,</hi> the Achaian addressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and <hi>Brauorante</hi> against the braue sonne of <hi>Trebatius</hi>: with <hi>Claridiano</hi> happened the wounded <hi>Coriandro,</hi> which yet with mortall wounds prolonged his fortune.</p>
               <p>There was no fight to be séene like to <hi>Rosamundies</hi>; for although that she were not equall in force to the fierce Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; yet her rich and faire Armes in all supplied that want; for against the edge of her rich sword, no armour nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment could auaile; for shee neuer gaue <hi>Bembo</hi> any blow, which did not pare away his harnesse, together with his brawny flesh.</p>
               <p>The Moore was wonderfully amazed to sée his armour so torne, knowing that shée which fought with him, was but a gallant Ladie: a thousand times would he haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne himselfe from her, accompting it a base thing to wage battell against her, but shée did so anger him with the often blowes which shée gaue him, that treading all vnder foote, he began to defend himselfe and to offend the Ladie, giuing her such sound knockes, that, but that shée tooke them vpon <hi>Semiramis</hi> armour, without doubt he had dealt but hardly with her: but if she took any blowes, it was to the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:56"/>
greater dammage of the Pagan which gaue them: for shée charging and retiring, as nymble and quicke as an Eagle, made the victorie very doubtfull, and oftentimes brought it to that passe, that it plainely appeared to be hers, shee was so furious. The battell betwéene <hi>Brauorante</hi> and <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante</hi> deserueth a Romane Theater; for eche of them knowing his enemies force, they began to make benefite of their agilitie, which was such, and employed in so good sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that neither of them could fasten a full blow: but hee which tooke any vpon his armour, it made his flesh blacke and blew, and brought him to the ground vpon his knées. Unequall was the battell betwéene <hi>Claridiano</hi> and <hi>Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>: for as he wanted both breath and blood, his ouerthrow did plainely appeare, or his certaine death, at the instant that <hi>Archisiloraes</hi> Louer ended the battell, hitting him so hard vpon his shield, that it nothing auailed him to be of fine and well tempered stéele, but that he smote it in two pieces, sorely wounding him in the head, comming to the ground vpon all foure, and yet he was ashamed, being in choler and before his Ladie, holding it but for a small blow, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a thousand amorous suspicions in her head, she stood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in his valour, vnable to perswade her selfe that it should be any other, then he whom she loued with her soule: but comming to shew him any fauour, her grauitie was such, that she resolued rather to die, then to shew any such lightnesse; this cost her so deare, that it made her to shedde bloody teares. The thrée pillars of humane fortitude arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when the Gréeke drew néere vnto the place where <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samundi</hi> with <hi>Bembo</hi> were together by the eares, if néede required to ayd her. They were no lesse then <hi>Don Heleno</hi> of Dacia, the faire <hi>Rosabel,</hi> and his friend, the Captaine Generall <hi>Aristoldo</hi>; who hearing the noyse of the battell, came as hard as their horses could runne. The <hi>Dacian</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently alighted, and with his sword drawne, went directly to <hi>Bembo,</hi> thinking that his Lady was ouermatched, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare not, séeing the Gréeke Prince to do the like, but rather
<pb facs="tcp:13979:56"/>
ouercome with furie, thinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had meant to haue strike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, as he made great haste, he cried vnto him, saying, Hold thée, vncourteous Knight, for this villany shall cost thée thy life. The Gréeke would scarsely haue taken these words at his owne fathers hands: he gaue no answere, but florishing his axe about his head, with such courage, that he made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al to wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, he was so quick in deliuering his blow that <hi>Archisilora</hi> knowing that it was the <hi>Dacian,</hi> could not put her selfe betwéene them, before that the furious young man had striken him with the axe, on the toppe of the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met. <hi>Brutus</hi> his Armes stood him in good stead, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, from the head to the foot, his axe had split him: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he made him to goe thrée or foure steps backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being ready to fall, he followed him with a thrust; there was neuer a better giuen in all these battels: for hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him on the one side of the brest, he brake all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> buckles, and within a little disarmed him, making him set one knée to the ground, to stay him vp. Hee againe lifted vp his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible axe, but not with such dexteritie, as his Uncle would haue done, for being long in bringing the blow about his head, he gaue place to the <hi>Dacian</hi> to close with him, with such force, that he lifted him from ground, and with a little more had ouerthrowne him. The Gréeke was constrained to let goe his axe, the better to vse his hands. O you Princes, which delight in armes, I would haue béene glad to haue séene you at this wrestling; for neither wearinesse did any way cause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke, to shew himself to be any other then he was wont to be: and the <hi>Dacian</hi> was so blinded with choler, that he dealt not herein with such discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as was requisite.</p>
               <p>The maner how they gyrded one another, the gronings they made, their sometimes clasping their bodies, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times parting asunder, then crossing their legges, was such as no tongue is able to declare; for if the Dacian be strong, the Gréeke is no lesse. Giue eare, Ladies, for there is no reason that this wrestling should passe in obliuion without witnesses; and these which came, were no lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most
<pb facs="tcp:13979:57"/>
mighty <hi>Alphebus,</hi> the two pillers of fortitude brought him betwéene them, <hi>Bramidoro</hi> and <hi>Brandafidel</hi> with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Tirifeo</hi>: of the other part came <hi>Torismundo,</hi> the braue Lord of Spaine, with his sonne and his valiant brother in law: they mist not the venturous <hi>Zoilo,</hi> with the beloued <hi>Lisart,</hi> and the Prince of Argentaria, so as a man may well say, there was at that méeting the best and most tryed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that was in the vniuersall world. All this comming could not cause them to giue ouer the battell: for the <hi>Dacian</hi> séeing his Ladie in danger, it made him draw new forces euen out of his wearines, and to giue the aduersarie worke inough to doe, who condemned himselfe of cowardise, to suffer one Knight to vse him so, in the presence of his father and other friends. They were both out of breath, and they could not continue and maintaine their obstinate fight: but the one thrust the other a great way off from him; the Gréeke fell downe hard by, where <hi>Rosamundi</hi> stood: and where hee had left his battell axe, he tooke it vp, and with a wonderfull readinesse hee made towardes the <hi>Dacian,</hi> but before that he was come néere him, <hi>Archisilora</hi> stept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them, saying, Hold you out, Knight in the yellow, for the Prince of Dacia is not a Knight, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel may be suffred to be ended. The Greeke stayed vpon his Ladies words, and then knew the valorous <hi>Dacian</hi>; for he had no desire to do ought, but what might please his Queen. But the noise of a most fierce blow which <hi>Bembo</hi> gaue the Lady, suffred him neither to giue any answere, neither to procéed forwards. The fierce <hi>Claridiano</hi> turned about, as malicious as a serpent, to see his faire Ladie on the ground, vpon her knées, and had somewhat lost her senses, and that the Pagan, forgetting from whom hee came, would haue closed with her.

The battaile-axe seemed somewhat trouble some to the Gréeke in a priuate battell; &amp; chiefly, because he had neuer bene vsed thereto: wherefore pitching the blunt end thereof into the ground, he left it for a testimony of the owners valour: and so drawing out his good sword with his shield in his hand, he assayled the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Bembo.</hi> O <hi>Apollo,</hi> I would thou wouldest recite this battaile, which made all men to wonder! for the dexteritie of them both was without comparison; they were both wel breathed, by reason of their long exercise in armes, and for that cause hastening their mighty blowes so thicke, that it séemed to them which saw them not, that <hi>Vulcans</hi> Forge was thereabouts; for according to the noyse, it was to bee thought, there had bene a great many of Knights: to the

               <p>There was neuer particular battaile in the world better fought; for eche of them both was the flower of his Nation, and exercised in the Arte as well of Loue, as in this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no man excelled them, no not loue it selfe, nor <hi>Mars.</hi> The Moore had the worse, by reason of the Christians good Armes, but supplied that with his strength, giuing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king blowes which would haue beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a rock to péeces. The Gréeke would play the fencer, thinking with a thrust, to haue striken his aduersarie in the face, but hee had not well fastned his blow, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moore soundly gaue him a knocke on the top of the Helmet; he tooke him at vnawares, and so the blow lighted so much the heauier, &amp; made him set one of his knées to the ground, and in that warde he stood to sée if he would second his blow, which had lifted vp his sword, but the young man would not attend the weight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it came, but with a iumpe standing on his féete, he let slip the blow on one side, leauing the Moore deceiued, who gaue so fierce a blow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it turned him round about, &amp; smote the one halfe of his sword into the hard floore. Upon the armes, the nephew of the great <hi>Trebatius</hi> gaue him a great blow, he was much distressed, being assured that hee should lose his sword; breaking the little chaine, with a skippe hee turned about, for in agilitie no man excelled him, and if the Gréeke had not the better looked vnto it, the like had happened vnto himselfe. But seeing the Pagan giue way, he let slippe one hand to weaken the blow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee stayed but little herein, but it was enough for the nimble Pagan, who like an Eagle, séeing his sword was lost, he suddenly tooke vp the Axe wherewith he was a second <hi>Mars.</hi> In many dayes before he had not receiued the like contentment, as

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ector</hi> was not so much grieued with the cruell wound giuen him by the Greeke Prince, for that it was by his hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as <hi>Claridiano</hi> was to sée himselfe vnfurnished of one of his weapons; &amp; not onely for losing it, but that it happened in the presence of his parents, when it had béene requisite to haue shewed all his valour, rather then in any other part. The sight of the faire Quéene was to him as sauce for his choler, tempering the same in such sorte, that it made him to fall into conceite with himselfe, how he might recouer the lost Battel-axe, and so like a cruel Pard, he would haue closed with the Moore, but hee met with the point of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> axe: his shield was no sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t defence to ward the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:59"/>
blow, but that it passed cleane thorow. This did more grieue the Gréeke, then if hee had in a maner felt the fine temper thereof in his flesh: he remembred, that there was no enchantment, that could resist the edge thereof: the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan doubled his blow, but before that he could fasten it, hee was gotten so néere vnto him, that he seized his armes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and finding no resisting, within a little he had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne him, and lifted him aloft from ground. The Lord of Achaia was in some doubt, and thought with him, that it were better againe to lose the gotten battell-axe, then the victorie; and so letting it goe, hee did vse such force vpon the yong mans shoulders, that he made him in despite of him, to stay with his burthen, and gaue him place to take footing on the ground: he resembled the Sunne of the earth, in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering againe his strength, againe getting that, which hee before had lost, the Gréeke being vnable to hinder the same, notwithstanding that he sweat droppes of blood. This bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell made them that were present, so much to wonder, that they tooke no héede to that which passed betwéene <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante</hi> and the Scythian Moore, who were so fierce, that they séemed to beginne the battell anew. <hi>Claramante</hi> was sory, that he had not begun with the axe, imagining that by this time he had made an end thereof: yet notwithstanding, when he hit him a fall blow, he made him to shake like an Aspin leafe vpon the trée, when the Southwest wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. They were both very desirous to end the battell, for it was aboue sixe houres, since it beganne, and both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaue so mightie blowes, that they both set their hands to the ground; there was little difference in their skill. But as occasion serued, the Gréeke was more nimble in assayling, then the other: and so raysing him with a thought, before that the Pagan could recouer his ward, he gaue him so cruell a blowe vpon his great crest, that hee made him to goe crosselegd and ready to fall: hee set his right foote forward, and with a strong thrust hee hit him on the brest, striking him almost out of breath. Through the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:59"/>
noyse which they made which beheld this battaile, hee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about his head, and séeing that those which had wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, were come to that ground where they were, he suddenly drew neere, and would not strike the Pagan, which all men thought much of.</p>
               <p>By this time was the valiant <hi>Brauorante</hi> come, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming against the heauens, seeing that he neuer proued Knight in Gréece that did not put him in doubt of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: in approching, he suddenly gaue him a knocke crosse the helme, which made him goe on one side; not with the good grace which the place required, where were so many beholders: hee turned against the Pagan; and being so néere that they could not strike, they closed, <hi>Claridiano</hi> was so néere to the battell-are, that strugling with <hi>Bembo,</hi> hee might haue layd hands thereon; and taking footing, hee rose, finding himselfe hard by his Uncle, for these warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours were sometime aloft, sometime vnder. The Achaian gaue him not so much leasure; who hauing recouered his sword, came towards the Gréeke: he went to encounter him, beginning the battell anew. Those which stood by, had no time to talke, fearing that in shutting their eyes, they might lose the sight of some notable action, worthy eternall memory. By this time would the carefull Louer impart his light vnto the Antipodes, hiding it from our world, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to vs that which his sister gaue, when the foure war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours (being the flowre of Armes and brauery) were most earnest: sometime the Gréeke seemed to haue the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but it was so little and la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13979:60"/>
where the Earthquake had brought him, for any thing that hee was able to doe. Some visions appeared to them which fought the battell: and as those clouds were past, the skies remained cleare, the Sun yet shewing some fayre streames, as a certaine token of his departure. All alone remained they which had fought the battell, onely excepting <hi>Bembo</hi> and <hi>Brauorante,</hi> with the wounded <hi>Coriandro,</hi> which <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertius</hi> had carried away, because that the Romane shippes being arriued at Niquea, had great néede of their presence. <hi>Gualtenor</hi> saith, that being fearefull of some ill successe, he made that enchantment to carie away his <hi>Bembo,</hi> and sought by all meanes to haue done the like by the Battel-axe, had not <hi>Claridiano</hi> seized vppon it, out of whose hande he could not get it, by reason of the vertue of the rich Iewell, which was of the greatest antiquitie of any that he knew.</p>
               <p>No griefe can bee compared to that which <hi>Bembo</hi> and <hi>Brauorance</hi> conceiued, seeing themselues set in Niquea (for it seemed to them that they had farre the better of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,) which was the cause of their sorrow: they made a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand complaints of the wizard, who by all meanes sought to appease them, telling them the truth of the cause, for which hee brought them away, which did somewhat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease them, and promising them that he would set them in Gréece, in a place where no body should part the battell. This is verie little, in respect of that which <hi>Brundusio</hi> felt, when hee vnderstoode what had happened in the Iuste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ladies; for he would not of all that day speake to his Cousin, but the next day hee came to him, saying, I know not, Knight, who would presume to returne againe into my presence, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ouercome by a woman, I know no reason why you should call your selfe my nephew, seeing thou hast so much shamed the royall bloud of <hi>Gibia.</hi> Oh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly knight, is it possible that I should haue the pacience to forbeare to put thee to death? But I leaue it to her to doe, which hath bereaued thée so much of thy fame, and were it
<pb facs="tcp:13979:60"/>
not for that, I would teare thée in a thousand péeces with my owne hands, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spot wherewith thou hast stained our worthie linage. At the loud spéeches which he vsed, in came the Emperour of Rome, and the Prince of Almaine, who sought to appease the furious Pagan, whose eyes séemed burning coles: they had much adoe to get him from thence, leauing the proud <hi>Coriandro</hi> so ashamed, that a thousand times he would haue killed himselfe, and but that hee was in hope to be reuenged at his pleasure, no man could haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his life: But that vaine hope did serue but to prolong his life, comming againe to lose, in the same place where he had béene before ouercome.

They chose for Captaine generall, the braue King of Fenicia, and for his companion the expert King of Zarssa, with the King of Armenia, who vndertooke a heauie burthen. They began to dispose of the Nauie, which was so great, that they had néede of <hi>Bemboes</hi> helpe, who diuided it into three squadrons: neither of the wizards doth set downe the certaine number, but <hi>Lupertio</hi> saith, that it was nothing to couer the Greeke sea.

All came, warlike Knight, said the faire <hi>Archisilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> (which without offence to <hi>Claridiano,</hi> was much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for his valour to this vnknowne gallant, séeing what he had done) through the hope that we were in, to haue you for Iudges of our battell, a thing which might haue assured the greatest difficultie in the victorie which wee attempted: And I &amp; these Ladies do much desire to know your name, and of what countrey you are, if it bee no offence to you. Greater would it be to me, to fall into your disgrace, by not discouering it, said <hi>Claridiano,</hi> then that, which I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, by vttering it. In this maner, it will be to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, (quoth the Quéene) in stead of not offending vs, and at the point to demaund it of you by battell, to make vs beholding vnto you for your courtesie. It is so long since, answered the Gréeke, (glad to sée himselfe so sought vnto by such Princesses, which were so and the same in beautie) that I haue béene without any will, for that I sacrificed it to Ladies, that it is not meritorious to yéeld new obedience, seeing that so long since I haue giuen my selfe in sacrifice. My Countrey is in the confines of Scithia Liuia, for it were not conuenient that a Knight of any other countrey should be entertained with such crueltie; sometimes I haue béene called the Knight of Crueltie, but now (wherein they haue hit right) the Ladies Knight, for the pictures which I beare in the middest of my shield, enduring onely the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which so much tormenteth my soule, which hath béene of such power, that the Ladies haue had a desire onely to helpe me, and my heart herewith endureth new torments.

Now I say, that he is worthy to be pardoned, and we are sorry for him (quoth <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samundi</hi>) seeing that if he desire to liue, it is onely to doe vs seruice. If it were not for that, gallant dames, said y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke, I would rid my selfe thereof, but I haue therein setled this hope, that I should here find some bodie, which would bee sorie for my ill happe. About this matter those faire Ladies rode discoursing, well pleased with the Knight of Liuia his gentle conuersation, and no lesse were all those high Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the valour which they had séene and experimented in him: the night they passed with swéete discourses, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the thrée Ladies, and their being in companie with their husbands, did restraine them from discoursing of loue matters, yet they delighted to refresh their memorie, with talking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most plesing time of their whole life. For neuer man loued wel which liued not in loue: for by louing, knights are purified, they become franke, liberall, valiant, and hee which was the most carelesse, becommeth most careful. In no part discretion holdeth so due proportion, as betwéene louers, and neuer was there any honourable end of warres, if loue were not the ground thereof. For loue, gallants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt doubtfull enterprises, making them easie with this saying, My Ladie will take pleasure therein: and to procure her contentment, in exchange of his owne soule, is to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase a new life, new Iewels of loue, sufficient to giue life to him that so loueth: and to conclude, <hi>Plato</hi> saith, that there is no good where is no loue.</p>

In the middest whereof which was of blew, he bare god <hi>Mars,</hi> and close by him his <hi>Venus,</hi> with seuerall crownes in her hands, as though shée gaue them to a Knight which knéeled at her féete, with this Mot:
<q>
                     <l>For thy worth and beautie,</l>
                     <l>Receiue this fauour,</l>
                     <l>Worthie thy valour.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>They tooke great pleasure to behold his goodly personage, and much more, that with his Launce in his hand hee came towards them, they all imagined that he would iust. If it be no otherwise, said <hi>Rosamundi,</hi> it falleth to our lot to begin, seeing we haue giuen the occasion to séek vs. No body gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said it, séeing it was no great aduenture: and so by that time that this gallant was come, they had taken their weapons, who shewing courtesie lifting vp his Beuer, discouered the best fauoured face in all the Pagans countrie, and said, My lot, valorous Knights hath béene so good to méet you in this place, that I cannot complaine of fortune, séeing shée hath set before mine eyes what I most desired to see. I doe not tel you my Countrie, valorous companie, being so remote, neither my name, because there will be small notice of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for there are not two dayes, since I receiued the order
<pb facs="tcp:13979:63"/>
of Knighthood, from the hands of a most mightie warriour, who told me, that if I made haste, I should find here all the best of Greece. I desired him to tell me his name, in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of which fauour, I would bee readie to doe him seruice all the dayes of my life, for his valour deserueth it. He told me that hee is called <hi>Bembo,</hi> and that I should tell the Knights, with whome hee here had fought the battell, that they should pardon him for not ending it, and that there should not want time nor place thereto. Hee told mee so much of your force, and made me so desirous, that I purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, if it shall not be offensiue, to desire to iust with some of those which here come: I know it a great boldnesse, being the first time, yet is it a satisfaction, although I lose, to haue iusted with warriours of so great fame.</p>
               <p>The discrete behauiour of him in the blew, gaue great delight to all, and so the gallant <hi>Rosamundi</hi> answered him, thinking with her selfe, that shée had neuer in all her life séene a gallanter Knight, except the Gréeke Princes, for they were borne to bee the wonder of the world. I would that of your part some harder matter to be done, had béen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to the end that you might haue séene of what power in Gréece, the controuersie is which you haue vsed, and séeing it is but to iust, and to prooue the strength of your arme, let be as it shall please you, estéeming (according to reason) her courte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The young gallant turned with so good a gesture, that hee made the great <hi>Alphebus</hi> say, Neuer beléeue me, if these iusts be not worth the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for me thinketh that this stranger is locked fast in his Saddle. Of the same opinion were all the rest, expecting what would follow.</p>
               <p>It is not to bee recounted, most excellent and worthie Dames, without hauing recourse for aide to your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for such a thing is not to bee solemnized, but by him, who hath twise borne the Lawrell: for the Eagle flyeth no swifter after her pray, then these two rare persons in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour departed.

But the gallant Ladie losing both her stirrops and the reines, was driuen to take hold of her swift horses neck: they all doubted more then before, of the successe, séeing the faire Ladie in such case at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. In her place entred the faire Quéene of Lira, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a new Launce to the young Gallant. The sage <hi>Lir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandeo</hi> passeth ouer all these encounters, saying, that in none of them hee had the worse: hee aduaunced himselfe farther, and ouerthrewe the Princes of Tharsis, both the father and the sonne, and the braue Captaine <hi>Aristoldo,</hi> he was likely to haue brought to the same predicament.</p>
               <p>Finally, notwithstanding that the braue <hi>Torismundo,</hi> &amp; his warlike so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne vndertooke the charge; yet he lost no grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, nor any part of his honour. Alone remained the Emperour <hi>Alphebus</hi>; who would not iust, because there should want no lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces for <hi>Don Heleno, Rosabel, Claramante,</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiano</hi>; foure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best Knights vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. The Prince of Hungarie had scarcely ended his course, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent swiftnesse the <hi>Dacian</hi> began y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carriere: he could not haue wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne much honor, although he had ouercome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge Galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had already run sixtéene courses against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most mighty knights, who without any shew of wearines, came against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Dacian.</hi> The raging sea maketh no greater noise, persecuting the shippes readie to wracke, then these two most famous warriours made at their encounter in the middest of their carriere: there was neuer seene any better encounter in Greece: for the greedie <hi>Dacian</hi> smote him some what lowe, and so the blowe was nothing sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and withall, hee made him make the foulest bending backwards, that hee had made in all the rest of his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> was faine to let go the reynes out of his hands,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:64"/>
and to kéepe the Saddle, hee seized on the horse necke, hee encountred <hi>Don Heleno</hi> in the midst of the shield, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnable to pierce it, by reason of the most fine temper thereof, he shorked with the Helme with such force, as made him forget himselfe, hee was so angrie for this encounter, that had not the straunger had equitie on his side, the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell had past a outraunce. You would not beléeue how those which stood by did wonder, séeing the great strength of the Knight with the Starres without staying, that <hi>Claraman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> or <hi>Rosabel</hi> should doe it, the vnknowne Gréeke tooke the matter in hand, purifying his valour in his Ladies face.</p>
               <p>The sparkles flie not so thicke from <hi>Vulcans</hi> Anuile, as from these two famous warriours Helmets, either know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the others courage. He in the blew encountred the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Claridiano,</hi> in the middest of the strong brest, but as in that place loue onely did predeminate, so it could not receiue any further wounds from any other hand, he smote him so furiously, shiuering his Launce into small splinters, as made him lose one of his Stirrops, and make such a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bending, as was strange to that young gallant: <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisiloraes</hi> louer got not much by his fierce encounter, which might haue set him on the greene field: and had hee met him in the beginning of the Iusts, hee had not escaped so good cheape, but being wearie, it was no great matter to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare him, with the Saddle betweene his legges. In faire greater estimation from thencefoorth was the Knight held with the Ladies, then before, seeing that he had ended that, which all they could not doe, which were in all things so highly extolled: at an instant he againe fitted his lost Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and with a verie good countenance asking pardon of them all, (although somewhat ashamed) hee tooke his leaue of the Princes. <hi>Gualtenor</hi> doth not declare the name of this Knight, neither whose sonne he was, leauing it to the fourth part of this famous Historie. Onely hee saith, that hee was the famous competitor to the house of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria, vntill that a kinseman which hee knewe therein,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:64"/>
should conclude the welcome peace, but first hee should couer the field with dead bodies, all caused through the loue to a Gréeke Ladie: Hee did not a little in the behalfe of the Pagans in the field battell, whose actes the sage doth not a little commend. All those Lords were much affected vnto him, although the most of them did desire to come to single combate with him.</p>
               <p>If the Youth had béen aduertised thereof, he would not haue refused it, although against <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe: for in the world was not knowne a prouder young man, and this made him to attempt great matters, wherein hee alwayes bare the fame of warlike. In discoursing of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancie, those Princes arriued at the Citie, where they were by all men expected, with some doubt of some danger that might haue happened vnto them, but knowing what had passed, all was turned into mirth.</p>
               <p>The noble <hi>Trebatius</hi> entertaining the valorous Ladies, said, I would not faire Ladies, that you should so estéeme the honour of Gréece, that you should therefore put your selues in such apparant danger.</p>
               <p>There was none (noble Emperour) answered <hi>Archisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lora,</hi> sith it was for your seruice, especially this Knight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, pointing to the Knight with the Ladies, who for his valour may be compared with <hi>Mars</hi>: the rest affirming the same, it gaue occasion to the Emperour to embrace him with as great affection, as if he had knowne him to haue béen his déere nephew. All the faire Ladies bestowed on him new fauours, hauing heard of the valour of his person: By generall proclamation it was commaunded, that all should obey him as a Gréeke Prince: he lay with his beloued Uncle: the world neuer knew two which loued so déerely: they were deuising together, when into the hall there came two Knights from the braue <hi>Astrusio,</hi> aduertising the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the enemies armie, and how that (without doubt) the next day they wold be in sight of Constantinople. They all put themselues in Armes, euerie one repairing to his
<pb facs="tcp:13979:65"/>
thrée hundred thousand men; a shew worth the sight: with all the Flowre of Fraunce, of Denmarke, and Apulia, went the braue <hi>Don Heleno</hi> commaunding that squadron: his friend <hi>Torismundo</hi> held him company, with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Tharsis and Argentaria: on the one side went the faire <hi>Rosamundi; Polidolfo</hi> held the third place, with all the Soldiers of his countrey, which were very many, and well armed. All the Portugals kept him company, &amp; great part of the Persians.</p>
               <p>The fourth degrée fell to the valiant <hi>Persiano</hi>; wherein he commaunded all the Babilonians and Persians, which were without number. With the rest of the Campe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Emperour <hi>Alphebus,</hi> with all those of Trapisonda and Lira, much practised in the warres. There were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer séene troups better ordred, nor Captaine that better prouided for all poynts: hee was gallantly apparelled all in colours, with rich furniture of the same: for they say, the fight of the Generall contenteth the people: hee made them spread all along the coast, opening their rancks: in the middle (for their greater honour) went the Flowre of all humane might, <hi>Claramante, Archisilora,</hi> &amp; the vnknowne Gréeke, twelue Spanyards, and as many Antiochians. Being drawne neere to the sea side, and in sight of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fléete, which comming neere the Port, drew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues together vpon the top of a little hillock, with his Beuer vp, he vttered this oration:

Onely this I would call to memorie: The royall blood from
<pb facs="tcp:13979:65"/>
whence we are descended, and that we haue a cause in hand which may be for our aduantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The lot is already cast, and the destinies haue permitted it, that at ease wee may see our selues (not compassed with enemies) for, that your noble hearts could not endure: But at the point to let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that wee defend our Countrie with the edge of our swords, I speake to my Knights: for to returne to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie it is impossible, except we ouercome, or lose our liues. And so seeing the Greekes themselues haue chosen and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs to their aide, consider that it is honour to die to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance theirs: our enemies exceed vs in number, and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell them in valour and courage; equitie is on our side, and we shall haue as firme ground to fight vpon as they: There resteth nothing but to fight with discretion, for that, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse to be commaunded, maketh the most doubtfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, easie: neuer any nation made but one Generall, vnder whose commaund an Armie (be it neuer so great) is to be gouerned, attributing to him the glory of the conquest, or the dishonour of being ouercome. This I haue said in regard of mine honour, and of the Office which you haue bestowed vpon mee: for fighting in order, and vpon firme land, and the enemies in the water, if they should get any thing vpon vs, we should lose the hope of any good successe: as for me, it shall be glorie to liue or die in your seruice: and there is no more to bee said, but to march forwards whither victorie shall call vs.</p>

All the

Ladies were put into <hi>Venus</hi> Castell, which stood towards the Sea, from whence, some with sighes beheld their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, praying to God to saue their liues: they which could doe it, did publikely giue them skarfes and fauours, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to encourage them to aduenture their liues for them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready was the mightie <hi>Astrusio</hi> on the Shores side, who leaping into a Friggot, went to the Emperour, reciting to him all that passed, and how neere they were to the enemies Fléet: Wherefore if your Maiestie please, commaund what people you like of, to enter into this Ship Royall, with you for your Gard: for wee are in readinesse, for the most memorable battell, that hath béene fought vpon the Sea, where, if fortune be our friend, they shall dearely buy their comming, although I assure you, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> Fleete was but small, in comparison to that which now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: But I haue so great confidence in the valour of your souldiers, and in mine owne desire to fight with them, that I doubt not, but that we shall ende it with honour.</p>
               <p>Do, valorous Captaine, in all, as to you shall seeme good, answered the noble Emperour; for neither now, nor at any other time, none shall resist your order.</p>
               <p>Presently he embarked with the company aforesaid: all the Princes which remained, repaired to their Gallies, where it was a thing worth the séeing, to behold so many Gallies together, so many standardes, so many flagges, streamers, and penons, such thundring of Ordinance; the brightnesse of the armours did so glister, that it beat backe <hi>Apolloes</hi> glistering beames: the valiant Warriours made so faire a shew on the toppes of the poopes, as gaue good hope of victorie: and so being put in forme of a Crescent or halfe Moone, they beganne to make towards the enemies Fleete, the which they discouered in order, veering in the wide Sea, holding their direct course towards Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, with resolution (although there were among them many opinions) to winne the mayne Port, with pure force of armes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:66"/>The desire which the Ladies had to be on land, did moue them thereto: and so the two Nauies came to encounter, where they discharged sundry Cannon shotte, in token that they should charge. The mightie <hi>Astrusio</hi> had in the vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Fléet, fiftie great Brigandines, which had no other commission, but on the one and other side, to discharge great Cannon shot, which put the valorous Captaine in good hope. The valorous Thebane, with an hundred Gallies, gaue many sudden assaults, and was euer in readinesse, to giue aid where néed was: the battell being ioyned, the Sea waxed calme. Oh, who had euer séene so vnhappy a day, when almost all was betwéene the water, and the flaming fire! the noyse of the shotte bereaued many of their hearing, with such furie, that all the world séemed to shake; for the smoke, the fire, the noise of prows and broken mastes, the callings, cryings, and sundrie noises, made a confusion: <hi>Priamus</hi> his Citie did not make so great a fire, neither were there so many braue swords drawne, neyther with such spéed and noise, as these two Nauies made, the one shewing to the other the valour of their souldiers. A thousand masts were broken in pieces, their high carued workes swamme vpon the water: it séemed, that the water, the fire, and the winde, had concluded a peace, whose effect was so fearefull, that the sea was on fire, as if heauen and earth would come together: the sundry deaths which were giuen that day, my slender wit is not able to expresse, neither would the great confusion which was therein, giue place to a man, although he had <hi>Argus</hi> eyes, to see the particular encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters: for after the furie of the Ordinance was past, they came so néere as to strike with their swords, they were so néere on boord, where, with much shedding of blood, and many deadly wounds, were made many braue assaults.</p>
               <p>In this most cruell battell, death (which daunteth the stoutest) was not of power to discourage them, or put them in feare, for no man refused any labour or perill, although he saw the Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>non bent against his brest: they entred by the

began to burne in a light flame. Death was not there fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but yet séeing before their eyes so manifest danger, they began to fly from her, and to abandon the ship.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Astrutio</hi> his people followed so hard in chace, who were most expert at sea, that some of those Princes were almost in danger. But there is no danger, where Commaunders are diligent: onely the Giants payd for it, who were so waighty that they could not make such haste, and so death ouertooke them, before they could come to the sight of Grecia.</p>
               <p>One of the best ships in the whole nauy was lost. There was no lesse to doe where the three lights of Knighthood, <hi>Claramante, Archisilora,</hi> and the disguised young Knight, with the Captaine generall by land were fighting. The braue Souldan of Egypt fell to their lot, but to his losse: for against the furie of those foure Princes, there was no force or temper of any Armour, was able to resist: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could put himselfe in readinesse, they had ouercome him, and had wholly ended it, if that foure Gallies had not with full sayles come to the rescue of their Prince: and with all this, presuming vpon the aide of the Gyants, hee placed himselfe neere the boord, where he assaied to shew his force to his enemies.</p>
               <p>His youthfull resolution lasted but a while, for his gard of Gyants little auailed him, neither his fierce Cousin which stoode by his side, whome <hi>Claramante,</hi> suddenly with a knocke with his Battel-axe, bereaued of his life: for taking him on the toppe of his Helmet, the sharpe edge of of his Battel-axe descended downe to his brest.</p>
               <p>This terrible blow strooke a cold sweat, into all the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which came to his aide.</p>
               <p>The warlike <hi>Causelio</hi> (as angrie as a waspe) taking the Souldans part, would needes be reuenged, who in the Empire was the next that succéeded the dead Souldan.</p>
               <p>Fortune was heere fauourable vnto him, reseruing him for greater daungers: for although hee fell into the handes

               <p>To the losse of many liues they gat the Standard, iust at the instant when <hi>Don Heleno</hi> assailed the Admirall of the Romanes, for he had long béene about it. The furious Lady aduanced her selfe forwards, being verie angrie, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance which they had sent her husband. The first that was met, was the strong <hi>Brundusio,</hi> who séeing the armes of Dacia wauing in the maine top, hee presently imagined what it was, and to be that which he desired: hee made all haste with his Galley to come aboord the mightie Dacian. The Moores Galley came manned with so good Knights, and so warlike and mightie Giants, that here the battell was most obstinately maintained. The warlike Pagan fell into the Ladies hands, with whome shée began such a stur, and with such valour, as made them all to wonder; shée had the aduantage aboue all that followed the warres: for there was not a blow that shée gaue, but did cut their armours cleane thorowe, and most commonly the flesh withall. By reason heereof, the Pagan, notwithstanding that he were knowne to bee one of the most strong and valiant in the army, yet was hee so hardly be set by his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, that hee was bathed all ouer in his owne bloud: but
<pb facs="tcp:13979:68"/>
that was not sufficient to make him giue backe, neither was there in him any point of cowardize, but deferring his cruell destinie, be fought like a valiant Captaine. The <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> his Galley was in great danger, for there were foure, which at once with full sayles, charged him on all sides. I beléeue it was to the ende, that he should the more shew his valor: for redoubling his deadly blowes, there was nothing worth the looking after, but he and his faire Ladie.

There were neuer séene more cruell blowes, then were giuen here: for the mightie Emperour, holding his valour for nothing worth, to sée himself so compassed about, gaue neuer a blow, which
<pb facs="tcp:13979:68"/>
bereaued not some one of his life; so as the Sea was full of dead carkasses, the enemies were so many, that they neuer mist ten or an hundred; for presently there came so many fresh men in their places, and of ours neuer a one: they had now no hope to depart from thence, for it séemed impossible, séeing their great valor, to do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they intended, which was, to take their Standerd. Afresh came the furious Knight of Epire, who was accounted for one of the most famous, he was much in loue with the faire <hi>Lisiana,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his doings were to be noted: he came in a very high car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ship, he thought to haue caried all, at the first charge; but he found such company within boord, as was the flower of Cheualrie; who came to ioyne with the louing Moore: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he could take footing, as a valiant man, for indéed he was one, the Emperour <hi>Alphebus</hi> gaue him so sound a knocke, vpon the top of the Helme, that he made him set his hands and knées both to the ground: he was scarcely risen vpon his féet, when with a thrust, hee set him faster then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, out of the Galley; he would haue followed him, had it not béene for feare to abandon his Galley, being in such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: there came a Gyant (to his owne hurt) to séeke reuenge, but before that he could discharge one blow, <hi>Claridiana</hi> had left him armelesse, being desirous to hasten his death, shée came to the ships side, where, with a thrust shee pierced him cleane thorow: she escaped not so scotfrée, but that another smote her on the top of the crest, whose good temper gaue her life, &amp; yet not so, but that she set both her hands to the floore: the Pagan would haue giuen a second, when the warlike Spaniard, <hi>Don Clarus</hi> drew néere, cutting both passage and life from the renounced Infidell.

The night came so fast on, that for all that they could doe, they could not end it: the Greekes being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned (except they would lose themselues) to returne to their Galley, where they might sée their enemies Nauie burning in a light fire: for there comming a fresh gale of wind from the shore, it was a fearefull thing to behold the slaughter that there was made: if <hi>Nero</hi> had séene it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue he had séene that which he so much desired.</p>
               <p>The Greeke Nauie was not free from that danger; for as there were many Galleyes grappled together, the flame tooke hold on them, and had done much mischiefe, had not the Captaine wisely preuented it, casting on much water, and with all possible spéed (as the case required) cutting the grapples and tackling, falling off from the fire. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vsed the like policie, and were forced to take landing much lower then they would haue done, hauing lost great part of their Nauies: but séeing so great a multitude of people, they were recomforted purposing to make amends by land. That night and the next day, they landed all their people in the Hauen of Hircambela, ten miles from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, which they would haue razed, but for staying. They presently ordred their battels according to <hi>Bemboes</hi> direction, who that night came forth of the Campe, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best men in the armie, with a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men of warre, to leuell the passages betwéene that and the Citie, and to pitch their Tents.</p>

               <p>This famous Captaine was the first man, shewing in all things not onely his valour, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellencie of his wit also: for the golden <hi>Apollo</hi> had scarcely lookt out at his fayre baye window, spreading abroad his golden lockes, bathed in the Spanish Seas, when comming foorth of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople with all his royall Cauallarie, hee called the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Antiochians, to whome for their much experience hee had shewne much affection: with him went the flowre of Cheualrie, <hi>Clarama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, Claridiano,</hi> and the faire <hi>Archisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lora,</hi> with him also went the warlike Giants, <hi>Brandafidel, Bramidoro,</hi> and the strong <hi>Tifereo.</hi> Few of the principall but did accompanie the Generall, who in few words told them whereabout he went, and how much it did import af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and séeing in what case the Moore had left him, before that he had space to draw his broad sword, the Ladie was come, and with hers, shée suddenly tooke him crosse the Helmet, cutting away a great part of the visor, and withall, made him réele in his Saddle; shée holpe him forwards with a thrust, so as his thicke armour auailed not, for shée hurt him sore in the middest of the brest, his bloud gaue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his dangerous hurt. Like one of the wild beastes of Hircania, the Paynim set vpon the gallant Ladie, who sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the furie where with he came, gathering her selfe vnder her shield, for shée had no more roome, shée receiued the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blow: it made the bloud come forth at her eares, and to her brest did shée bend downe her head, astonished with the blow; and but that her dexterity stood her in stead, he had striken her againe, which had béene no great matter to doe, shée was so ill of the last, for the Moore was verie strong; but reyning her horse, shée put her selfe somewhat from him: the force of the blow made the strong Pagan to turn about, and fall vpon the pummell of his Saddle, and his horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prickt with the Spurres, brought him hard by <hi>Claridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> who was glad in his soule: for a thousand times he was about to leaue the battell, to come (although there were no néede) to aide the Quéene of his life.</p>
               <p>Seeing the good occasion, putting the <hi>Achaian</hi> from him with a verie strong thrust, with all his whole power hee smote him vpon the Helme; it was a verie fortunate blow: for lighting vpon the cannon of the Feathers, it pluckt it from his head, leauing it disarmed, throwing it at his horse héeles, and but for feare of the ioyning of the two battels, he had followed him; for séeing into what case he had broght his Lady, it made him deadly angry.

séene thee girt with thy rich sword, and with thy axe in both hands, rushing in among thy enemies! He onely may bee said to be the death of them all: for as they went close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so sometimes at one blow he smote downe two ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, giuing neuer a blow in vaine. With all this they cryed, Uictorie, by reason of the many Captaines come to their ayd. <hi>Archisilora,</hi> which was by her louers side, came to ioyne with the faire <hi>Floralisa,</hi> knowing her by her Armes: and hauing a great desire to try her strength with her, said to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beloued yonker, Kéepe you this side, for yonder Knight in the cornation hath much wronged mee. The Bull neuer better defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his eares against the mastife, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Gréeke obeying his Ladies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whorling his shield at his back: it was pittifull to sée what he did: for he gaue no blow, that was not deadly, giuing place to his Lady, to execute her cruell determination. The two valorous Ladies came to blows, there was neuer séene a more cruell battell: <hi>Flora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisa</hi> gaue the first blow, such a one as brought the Quéene of Lira to deathes dore; for she gaue her such a blow vpon the highest of her Helmet, that it made her lay her nose in her bosome, casting bloud out at her visor: she doubled her blow on one side of her shield, and beat it so close to her brest, that made her almost breathlesse. It was not long ere the Quéene came to her selfe, who as fierce as an Ounce char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Lady: there was no defence in her shield, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that she cut it not, for that it was <hi>Camillaes</hi>; yet she smote her so on the helmet, that she set her on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pummell of her saddle. Shée paused, and then like a Lyonesse, giuing her a mightie thrust, she clasped her armes about her neck, and drew her out of her saddle. They both fell downe to the ground, where without all doubt shee had lost her life, had not <hi>Don Celindo</hi> leapt after her, and with him his three most famous companions, who when they saw their sister <hi>Floralisa</hi> in so great and manifest danger, and at the poynt to be ouercome, being enraged with great sury, and without any regard of what to Knights did appertayne,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:73"/>
they all thrée at once began to lay on load vpon the Quéen. O <hi>Claridiano,</hi> there was neuer Lion comparable with thée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for séeing his Ladie in such peril, although shée strangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her selfe, he skipt from his horse like an Eagle: there fell into his hands a mightie Giant, which came to the noyse, and was going to close with the Lady. But the disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed louer being therewith displeased, brandishing his sword about his head, he smote him iust in the waste, his plancks of fine Stéele were like waxe before his sword, for in sight of the whole armie, in two péeces hee smote him downe at the Ladies féete, which then were in fight: a cold sweate ranne through all their veines, séeing so terrible a blow. This youngsters furie was not herewith asswaged, for hee more forcibly then a thunder bolt, rushed in where his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was enclosed, and in great danger. Hee trode <hi>Don Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gante</hi> vnder his féete, and shouldred <hi>Thorisiano</hi> a great way from him, and with a leape, assailed the valorous Assirian, which in defence of his Ladie, performed verie heroicall exploits. His faire lookes could not auaile him, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke with both his hands smote him on the Helmet, and made him set both his hand and his knées to the ground: he set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> who was hammering vpon <hi>Archisilora,</hi> and with a terrible thrust made him runne backwards, and fall vpon his backe among the footemen: and although that he were roundly assailed, yet, making way with his sword, hee came where the Ladies were, and gaue <hi>Floralisa</hi> a stumbling blow. <hi>Camillaes</hi> armour saued her life, but they could not saue her from falling on her face before his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, who holpe her forwards with another which was no lesse. By this time were come to their aide, the two valiant Giants <hi>Brandafidel</hi> and his friend <hi>Bramidoro,</hi> who plaied the Diuels; they cleared the passage on one side, for he which had the Gard of <hi>Floralinda,</hi> neuer gaue blow with his Club which did not ouerthrow thrée or foure. With this good assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the braue Gréeke tooke his Ladie in his armes, (the greatest pleasure that euer fortune did him) and set her
<pb facs="tcp:13979:74"/>
in her Saddle, saying, I would not, valorous Quéene, that your worthie acts should bring you into such danger. To ioy in yours, warlike Knight, it shall bee but well done to séeke it, séeing that therewith is purchased the sight of the valour of your arme. There was no time to vse many speeches, for they were in haste, for séeing the enemies on foote, no man remained on horsebacke. The Greeke with a light leape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered his horse, leauing them all amazed at his doings; it was his good hap to be on horsebacke: for there came the flowre of Giant-land, with great Pine trées in their hands, these the Greeke desired to meete, and but for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Ladie, he had gone to seeke them: their huge bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were clad with planckes of Stéele: to meete them went out two, with the Princes: <hi>Brandafidel</hi> aduaunced him and gaue a faire blow, for hitting one of those fierce Giants on the toppe of his Murrion, hee put him out of his remembrance, throwing him to ground with a greater noyse, then if a great horse had falne: his death was not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for there came so many, that there was no place voide, although they fell more and more. With all this, they felt the braue Greeke keepe a stirre, and working wonders among them: that which <hi>Bramidoro</hi> did, was no lesse worth the sight, who had alreadie slaine foure: the great troupes of men which came to rescue one another, parted the battel, but not the companie of the foure which first began.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Claramante</hi> hauing vpon a suddaine slaine a King of the Giants, raising himselfe on his Stirraps, saw much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple towards Grecia: in a whirling, he repaired thither, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the thrée Princes with him, one wondring at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doing. They made great haste, for it was néedfull, and the matter was, that the young man whome wee will call the Knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Starres, vntill the fourth part of this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, where hee shall lose his name and become a louer, it was hee which in the Forrestes, as is alreadie said, put the Princes in such danger, who was come in fauour of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, as hee had promised to <hi>Bembo,</hi> whome hee went to
<pb facs="tcp:13979:74"/>
seeke. Before that euer he brake his Launce, he had throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en many of the most famous to the ground; for to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Fraunce, nothing did their valour auaile them: for he ouerthrow them. <hi>Liriamandro, Brandisel,</hi> and <hi>Barian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> with the braue Troiane kept them companie: it was his fortune with his sword in his hand to meete with that Knight, to whome by nature he was bounden, which was <hi>Zoilo</hi> the Tartarian. They both strake together, but the match was vnequall, for such as the young man are few in the world; hee had put him in danger of death or of being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, if the warlike <hi>Lisait</hi> had not come to his aide, with his beloued sonne, and the Prince of Persia <hi>Bransinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> the which with their power, hauing left the stand where <hi>Sacridoro</hi> was, séeing all in safetie, came afresh to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and they came in good time for the Tartarian. The yong man more faire then <hi>Absolon,</hi> doubled nothing, but cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his shield at his shoulders, as he neuer mist blow, he put them all out of breath, without losing any ioat, who being neere the Prince of Hungarie, with a side blow he cast him to the ground sore wounded: after him hee set the Prince of Bohemia on all foure. Then came the Spanish Prince, who within a little held them companie, for hee set him sencelesse vpon his Saddles pummell: hee had a hundred swords about his cares, and those the most famous, but his lot was to make shew of himselfe, to bee the Phenix of the world. To his rescue came the foure Pillars of their Camp, <hi>Bembo, Brufaldoro, Brauorante,</hi> and the terrible <hi>Brundu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio,</hi> with whose aide he made more head against the Greeks. On the other side came the braue Emperor of Trapisonda, all couered with bloud, with <hi>Rosacler</hi> &amp; his sonne, they held their swords to behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> young gallant. God blesse vs, quoth <hi>Alphebus,</hi> what valor is in this knight, he would not assaile him? he so much affected him, but be held <hi>Rosabel,</hi> who like a Lion leapt into the middest of the throng. All those which were of his side knowing him, gaue him good way, and the enemies for feare, left the field frée: for the foure famous
<pb facs="tcp:13979:75"/>
warriours, <hi>Claramante</hi> and his companie, had taken them to taske, and so hauing fit oportunitie, they put their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in execution. I would I were not so much affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the young Knight with the starres, whose fame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto them, because I would describe this battell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out passion, worthie to bee related by <hi>Virgill</hi> or <hi>Mantuan.</hi> For these two rare persons in valour comming to ioyne, it is not possible to expresse what blowes they gaue: onely <hi>Gualtenor</hi> saith, that they bowed downe their heads to their Saddles pummels, casting aboundance of bloud out at the visors of their Helmets: none of those which beheld the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, durst to giue them any aide, for it was néedlesse: for they presently came againe to themselues, and each of them knowing the valour of his enemie, they began to vse dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. The bold <hi>Breton</hi> was most accustomed to armes, and therefore was more nimble in giuing the on-set, but the late lost blow of the yong man supplied that defect: for as fierce as a Serpent, he sought to attaine to the victorie. He came flying in with two blowes vpon the highest of his shield: the young man with the Starres was not one who would lose occasion, and insuch a case as that: and so beating by a thrust, hee smote him on the rich Helmet, it much auailed him that it had béene <hi>Hectors</hi>: otherwise hee had cleft him to the necke: it sounded like a Bell: he made the firie spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles flie, and him beléeue that the skies were therein when they are most starrie, for hee did so astonish him, that for a good space hee lost his remembrance: it was a spurre to put life in him, for the young man to come with another as strong as the first, it cut off his plumes, and as <hi>Lupertius</hi> saith, the Cannon also wherein they were: but let it bee as it will, the Gréeke neuer saw himselfe in the like danger as then, in his life: but being chaffed therewith, and that his Father did behold him, he set vpon his enemie.</p>
               <p>In all these battels, there was neuer giuen a better blow: for against <hi>Hectors</hi> sword, no force nor magicall temper can resist. Smiting him vpon the top of the shield, hee claue
<pb facs="tcp:13979:75"/>
it in two péeces, and passing through to his shoulders, it carried with it his Poloron, leauing him shrewdly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, hee ranne at him with a thrust, which cast him backe vpon his Saddle, and if he could haue fastned another vpon him, without doubt he had ouerthrowne him. There is no Uiper could bee compared to that warlike young man; for seeing himselfe handled in that maner, hee flung his shield to ground, and with his sword in both his hands, hee let flie a blow at <hi>Rosabel,</hi> which lighted on his shield; it pierced it not, but draue it to his Helmet with such rigor as made him sencelesse: ioyning with him, hee cast his armes about his necke, and within a little pluckt him out of his Saddle, but recouering his sences, setling his feete in his Stirrups, wheeling most strongly about, they fell both to the ground, where betaking themselues to their weapons, it was a world to sée their agilitie, the proud onsets, and couragious retreates.</p>
               <p>Strong was he with the Starres, but he had before him one which was borne with a brest-plate. Some aduantage there was to bee séene in him, but it was so little as could scarcely bee perceiued. The night drue on, for the Sun hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his course, hid his beames because he would not sée so cruell a battell. Wherefore those warriours were constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to repaire to their horses, desirous to méete, where they might haue time and place to end the battell, which at that instant was so vehement, as was wonderfull: but the Moores had the worst, because they had no succours: this was the sorrowfullest day for them, that they had during the warres. For of one hundred and fiftie thousand men which entred into the Willow valley, there neuer returned the third part, with the losse of thrée Kings, which died among the first. The Gréekes did not wholly without losse enioy this victorie, although it were the greatest that euer they had in all the warres, for it grieued them to sée the Moores encamped: within sight of the Citie in a most conuenient place, the past all the night well content on both sides; the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:76"/>
one for hauing shewne, that by land they were those which with their persons defended their Empire, hauing shewne vnto the Moores, with the price of many of their liues, the valour of their persons. The others, notwithstanding that they had lost many people, yet were verie glad, that they were entrenched in so good a seate. The warlike <hi>Bembo,</hi> seeing the valour of the yong Knight with the Starres, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely loued him, hee was no lesse accompted of by the Gréeke Princes, esteeming him more then all the rest of the Campe.</p>
               <p>But the commendations which were giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the knight of the Ladies, were such, and so many, that I am not able to recite them: there is no reason but to beléeue them: the first that beganne to publish his famous acts, was the faire <hi>Archisilora.</hi> Among the Pagans likewise his arme was much extolled, the which in fortifying their Campe, and burying their three Kings, spent eight daies, in the which there wanted no sightly skirmishes, nor dangerous encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein sometimes they were losers, and sometimes were victorious, a common matter to haue such aduentures in the war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XVI. How the Prince Poliphebus of Tinacria, entred the Castle of the golden Bough, where hee deliuered the most faire Luzela, daughter to the Emperour of Egypt, from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am so afraid, faire dames, to be lothsome to your delight, with such warres as are past and are expected, that I am enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to entermixe some matters of loue, with those of furious <hi>Mars,</hi> because that if the one bee tedious, the other may yéeld delight, and so I will shake off the feare wherein I was in this behalfe; for not to proceede with that sweete and pleasant stile as I would, it is enough to be loathed; without liuing in feare also, you shall take my desire, and not the fruite of my short witte in good part: for thereof, and of your daintinesse I am assured, seeming to me to bee of gold the libertie of the Tinacrian <hi>Ageno,</hi> and to haue it, I acknowledge that it is a death to me, and life to be estranged.</p>
               <p>Hee enioyed little by being at libertie, for that angrie passage being ended wherein we left him, hee went direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those Portes, whose faire rich lustre made him to wonder, comming to the Portes which seemed to bee of no worse then gold. The sight of the faire Pictures and Paintings therein engrauen, yeelded delight to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: hee came to the Pillar which stoode before the gate, and without feare winding the rich horne (for he much desired to know what was within) hee had scarcely winded it, when with a greater noyse, then if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole architecture
<pb facs="tcp:13979:77"/>
of the house had fallen to the ground, they opened. The coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious young man put hand to his rich sword, and imbracing his strong shield, and séeing that no bodie came foorth, hee went directly to the gates: through them hee passed, when suddainely hee was held backe, for on either side stoode two deformed Giants, hauing their huge waightie Clubs lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp. The young man was aduenturous, thinking with himselfe, that what he had done, was cowardice, if he should now retire, and so hee went forwards. There was not a liuelier Knight in all the land, and this aduaunced his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, for on foote few could match him. Hee entred with his shield before him, making a faire shew, and with a leape he cast himselfe in, but not without receiuing such a knocke, as made him set his knées to the ground: it was then no time to bee idle, for at an instant the most strong Giants were with him, who attended their comming, with deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, with discretion to maintaine the battell. As hee was skilfull in fencing, so he tooke his ground in the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was vnder the Port, vpon the which were the two rich Pinacles: the Giants were in hand with him by fits; it was not ill for him to goe flourishing, and to charge when he saw time, but if he were light and quicke, they were Pards, yet notwithstanding, his nimblenesse did auaile him, for they both together being about to strike him, with a skip (couering himselfe well with his shield) hee put himselfe iust betwéene them, making them to lose their blowes, but he, not his: for with a blow backwards in entring, hee smote him which was on his right hand, iust a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the knee; there was no defence against his arme, for his sword entred into the bone. The Giant féeling himselfe sore burt, would haue closed with him, but his thigh failing him, he fell vpon his face to the ground: he did not let slippe the occasion which fortune gaue him, for before that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Giant could assaile him, with a great blow he tooke him on the top of his huge Helmet, it was thrée inches thicke, but yet hee pierced him to the skull. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was so
<pb facs="tcp:13979:77"/>
gréedy of ending the battel, that it was like to haue cost him deare, for hee gaue oportunitie to the Giant to strike him: those blowes were not such, as that a man should stand to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward them, for it made him to set both his hands and his knées to the ground, casting out aboundance of bloud at his mouth: another blow the Pagan meant to haue giuen him, but his furie was such, that it made him to misse, for if he had hit him right, it had gone ill with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Garrofileaes</hi> sonne arose, and seeing the Giant vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for his blow was past, without any feare hee ranne at him with a thrust, and smote him in the middest of the broad brest, his armour was three double, yet the sword en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the hollow of his brest: he felt the wound which he had giuen, and séeing the Giant comming drawing his lame legge after him, with a leape he ioyned with him, who vnable to strike as hee pretended, compassing his Mace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head, he threw it at him, and smote him in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the shield; it was a wonder that he had not beaten it to péeces. The young man was not strong enough to kéepe himselfe from falling to the ground, the bloud gushing out both at his mouth and nosthrils. The young man could not defend himselfe, but that he tooke a blow on the shoulders, which made him thinke that all his bones on that side were broken. Being now as furious as a Lion, casting his shield at his shoulders, and smoake out at his visor, couered with bloud and sweate, brandishing his reuengefull sword, hee smote the Pagan a full blow on the brest; there were fewe such blowes as this euer heard of: for neither his thicke brest plate, nor his doublet of fine Maile could defend him, but that he almost cleft him into two péeces. The young man was glad that he had giuen so good a blow; but he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not scotfrée: for turning about to set vpon the wounded Giant, two crowned Lions ramped vpon him, which in strength excelled that which the braue <hi>Hercules</hi> slue, they seyzed vpon him, and hee was not able to defend himselfe. His armour saued his life, but they so crushed him, that they
<pb facs="tcp:13979:78"/>
put him cleane out of breath. The most cruell Pagan had not lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his ioynt; who drawing out a broad crooked knife, was comming towards <hi>Poliphebus.</hi> He well saw him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and not (as was reason) without most great feare, séeing he had so much to doe to defend himselfe: but there he shewed the bloud, from which he was descended: for in despite of the Lions (haling them after him) he eschued the enemie; and so with all his force he got one arme at liberty, which he put to his dagger, and therewith ended the Lions warre.</p>
               <p>He was so gréedie thereof, that the fierce Pagan came; who being desperate, smote him vpon the rich Helmet, and beat a thousand sparkles of fire out of it, and made him set his knées to the ground. He came vpon him with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before he could recouer himselfe: it was great hap that he had not stretched him all along, for he made him to fall on his face vpon the ground; and had it not bene for his lame leg, without doubt he had killed him.</p>
               <p>But the future louer, which now for that he was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hastned his lot, séeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he came againe, shifted himself to one side, and with all the strength that he was able, he smote him vpon the shield: it was of hardned stéele, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of a Target, which hung at his necke: he parted it in two, iust in the middest, and made the Moore to réele, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fall.</p>
               <p>The couragious young man, séeing him stand some what amazed, hee shewed not him selfe so, but suddenly leaped close to him, so as that before he could turne, he had giuen him a knock on the pate: he smote off halfe of his Helmet, and good part of the crowne of his head: he was driuen to trip to kéepe himselfe vpright. With another blow came y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of the great <hi>Trebatius,</hi> wherewith he ended the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, bereauing the accursed Moore of life, being so tyred, that he was constrained to leane to his sword, and put vp his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor to recouer his breath: hee might haue inioyed his rich hood, which was inestimable: he spent some time herein,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:78"/>
and thinking it more then reasonable, and taking a view of his weapons, he tooke vp one of the Giants Macee, and went to the other gate with so great courage, as would haue made <hi>Mars</hi> afeard, which stood wide open: a little within appeared a very comely Knight on a roane horse: his Armes were all lion coloured with some gréene spots: he séemed so comely a man, that the great <hi>Tinacrian</hi> affected him.</p>
               <p>He entred the gate without any shew of distrust, with his club on his shoulders. In passing a little vault, hee of the Castle came to him, saying, For the fayre disposition, Sir Knight, which you shew, I would not willingly fight with you; but being commaunded, of force I must obey, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Ladies, to whom is promised the head of euery one that commeth here, since the comming hither of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Damsell.</p>
               <p>Without fighting with you, gentle Knight, answered the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> I would goe forwards; but seeing it impossible, I am to be excused: wherefore bethinke you of the maner of our battell. On horsebacke, answered he: for, for you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth one which the Ladies send you. He turned his head to one side, thinking that that had bene true which he of the Castle told him; but he had scarcely turned, when the other clapping spurres to his swift running horse, ouerturnd him with his horses brest, and gaue him a great fall in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the yard. He thought that his body had bene broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the fall was so terrible. This horse was taught for this purpose onely: and so he was not full risen, when with a new carriere he returned to tread vpon him, and ouerthrew him vpon one side: this was worse then the first; for fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon one side vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his shield, it had almost put his arms out of ioynt. There is no Hircane Uiper like to this netled yong man, who lightly raising himselfe on his féet, without losing his terrible club which he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giants, he attended the returne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horse, which was so quickly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could hardly slep aside: he did him no harme to speake of.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:79"/>But it was much for him to sée that hee had escaped the trained horse his brest, which with new force returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the young man: here hee gaue a signe of his warlike arme, and the great valiancie of his person; for leaping a little to one side, the horse mist to runne vpon him, hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a gallant blow: for raising his Club aloft, hee smote the Knight vpon the shoulders, making the bloud to gufh out at his mouth, hee stretcht him along vpon his horses necke: but the blow which the Master receiued, was no let to the horse, to returne againe at the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> beating the pauement in péeces with his héeles. Now had the sonne of <hi>Trebatius</hi> taken fortune by the foretop: for slipping to one side, he tooke the knight by the arme: it auailed him not, that he was againe come to himselfe, neither that he bare a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant mind: for hee pulled him to the ground, where strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, at length they came to let goe their hold, beginning a now battell, and although bloudie, yet worth the sight: for he of the Castle was valiant, and he fought for no lesse then his life and honour, but he gat little by this young man, who was euerie way his better, and much accustomed to feates of armes: And hauing gotten him a foote in that manner, had he béene <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe, hee would haue made small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of him. With all this hee of the Castle defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and sometimes offended the mightie <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> who thinking that he lost much time, reatcht him a sound knock, yea he gaue him another, which made him fall on his hands to the ground, which, before that he could rise againe, he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, that within a little he had laid him all along.</p>
               <p>This warriour of the Castle, as fierce as a Lion (séeing his death before his eyes) considering the enemies force, falling into desperation, throwing his shield to ground, with his sword in both his hands, went towards him, striking him vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shield: the fierce blow came with such strength, that it beat it to his Helmet, making him lose his sences. There was neuer séene greater haste then he made to seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that blow, and smote him on the top of his most fine Helme,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:79"/>
bereauing him in a maner of his sight: he would haue closed with him with a stabbe: but the young man as fierce as a Basilisk, preuented him, beating it aside, they came to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gripes: and as hee was stronger then he of the Castle; so lifting him vp from ground, hee hurled him against the pauement, and gaue him a sore fall: hee of the Castle still kept his hold of him, being afeard of death: and recouering strength in his weakenesse, he began to defend himselfe, &amp; to procure his libertie. But it was now too late: for knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe vpon him, with his dagger in his right hand, he made a good end of his dayes worke; but so wearie, that he was not able to stand on his feete.</p>
               <p>With all this, thinking that he had yet something to do, desirous to know what that might be, which was so much defended, with the same club on his necke, he entred in at another gate, he came into a large walke, at the end whereof he saw about the number of twenty Ladies, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding faire, that they did euen make his eyes to dazle, thinking with himselfe (as indéede it was true) that there was nothing else to be séene.</p>
               <p>After that he drew neere to behold them, they were La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Gréece, which there were represented, although with new spirits, all taking that forme. Seeing him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they set themselues to behold him, very well liking his proportion.</p>
               <p>One of them, which to him séemed to haue an Imperiall Crown on her head, said vnto him, We would not, Knight, that you should passe from hence without our fauour, which shalbe so néedfull for you, considering how much there yet remaineth, that without it, it will be impossible to haue good end of this aduenture.</p>
               <p>No man can deny it (sayd the young man, putting vp his Beuer) being a thing so well knowne, and wanting deserts: if it shall please you to bestowe any vpon mee, as on him which hath most neede thereof, you may binde me wholy to doe you seruice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:80"/>Wee are all well pleased therewith (sayd the fayned La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) but you are to receyue it heere in our lodging, because that euery one will impart some vnto you apart: and so you may come vp here, and I will lend you my hand.</p>
               <p>Being so heauily armed, faire Ladies (answered the Prince) it will bee very hard for mee to get so high. You haue your remedie in your hand, answered the Ladie, for disarming you; you may easily come vp to our lodging, and it shall be a new fauour for you, to be new armed at our hands.</p>
               <p>It will be so, sayd the Greeke; but in a Castle where I haue met with so many enemies, it shall not be safe to goe disarmed; wherefore if there be no other staires, I am not of opinion to fulfill your commaundement.</p>
               <p>Then I say, sayd the Ladie, that you shall not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish what you pretend, séeing that Ladies requests (so much in your fauour) you haue so lightly regarded.</p>
               <p>They were all gone vpon a sudden, leauing him at their departure in extreme darknesse. The Prince in some sort was sorrie that he had not obeyed them: but imagining that it was some inchauntment, he was glad that he had on his Armour.</p>
               <p>By chaunce he entred in at a gate which led him into a fayre Court: the Maiestie and richnesse thereof bereaued him of his iudgement; for there was nothing else to be seene but portraytures of gold, set with many rich pretious stones: they all seemed to the young man, to bee aliue, the colours were so excellent and so wel layd on.</p>
               <p>In the middest of the Court, hee saw a most fayre tree, the one halfe of most fine gold, and the other of siluer, set in so good and comely order, with such exquisite arte, that it was a most strange, wonderfull, and pleasing thing to behold.</p>
               <p>Aboue in the Galleries there seemed to bee people, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee could speake to no bodie, nor know how hee should proceede in this most strange aduenture: for hee
<pb facs="tcp:13979:80"/>
was very desirous to sée the end thereof.</p>
               <p>As he stood thus beholding the Castle, and the ingrauen workes of the walles, there came forth at one side of the Court, a most comely and well countenanced Knight, in his hose and dublet of greene cloth of gold, so faire and so young, that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> wondred at his most excellent constitution. Hee came with his sword in his hand, and a scarlet mantle wound about his arme, with such a gesture as was strange to see, and with very good behauiour drawing neere towards him, he said,</p>
               <p>I would not, Sir <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you had falne into so great disgrace with the Ladies, without which, you might haue gone forwards with your good fortune, which did assure you a certayne end of this aduenture; but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fight, you are to performe it with mee, and not with any other weapons then such as you see I come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: wherfore except you see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e (as it is requisite) a mantle at some Ladies hands, hauing most highly offended those of this Castle, I know not what order we shal take to be able to fight, which is a thing that I haue much desired, for the great fame which in this Castle I haue heard of your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>I thanke you much, faire Knight, for that which you haue said, answered the <hi>Tinacrian.</hi> Although there bee no such matter in mee as you say; yet neuerthelesse, there shall want no good will to obey yours.</p>
               <p>This battell being ended, which seeing that it cannot be eschued (to end this aduenture) let it be as you will haue it, although I want a mantle, for I am perswaded, that I haue so offended those yonder Ladies in denying what they required, that they will lend mee none, and yet I knowe no reason for it, seeing that heretofore I haue bene so subiect to their obedience.</p>
               <p>All the Ladies which before he had seene, had seated themselues all aboue in the Galleryes to see the battell. Yet the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was of opinion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what was past would
<pb facs="tcp:13979:81"/>
giue no occasion, that in such a case they should refuse to fauour him: and so he beganne with a very great good grace to put off his Armour, remayning all in blew, so gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant a personage, as there was none like him.</p>
               <p>In that maner he went towards the Ladyes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto them a verie comely reuerence, hee sayd vnto them, I remember, Soueraigne Ladies, the small reason I haue (considering what is past) to come to intreat you: but in that that I did not performe your commaund, it is to be attributed to the naturall feare wherein I was, not conceyuing that your presence was sufficient to accomplish with honour, any action whatsoeuer though neuer so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, yet notwithstanding, being challenged to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell by this gentle Knight, with mantles, and I hauing none, and to be giuen by Ladies, reposing my case in your generositie, and not in my want of courtesie, which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, I beseech you that it may come from some hand, which may giue me the palme of this, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warres which I shall vndertake to doe you seruice.</p>
               <p>I know not, Knight, with what countenance you can come to request any thing at Ladies hands, whom you haue so much offended, and in a matter which so much concerned you (answered she which first had spoken vnto him) particularly, there is nothing wherein Gallants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto greater honour, then by obeying Ladies: So as, that now if wee should at your bare request giue you our mantle, it would seeme that wee did it of great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie.</p>
               <p>Therein consisteth your noblesse, (most excellent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) answered the fearefull young man, and I will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you to returne it againe to you, whole and sound, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cost mee my life, which I will esteeme nothing so deare, nor no aduenture so hard that I will not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: and there is no greater generositie, then to pardon an enemie, principally, acknowledging his error, and that he hath deserued punishment. As they stood denying
<pb facs="tcp:13979:81"/>
this Mantle, there came into that same roome, a most faire Ladie. O loue, how great is thy power! for shee was not fully come, and had set her selfe at the side of the Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, when to her was subiected the most frée young man, who hauing forgotten what he requested, and himselfe also, for he stood gazing, fixing his eyes so vpon her, that hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himselfe, and knew not where hee was. And in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for beholding her, he gaue her the keyes of his heart, and was yet sorrowful, holding it yet too little, in exchange onely to behold her. Shée came all clad in cloth of Gold with sundrie colours, with her haires curled after her Countrie fashion, with a Dutch robe of the colour of the rest of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell: the young man neuer saw any thing so well worth the séeing in his life.</p>
               <p>All the rest of the Dames séeing him in this maner, with a fained laughter, asked of him: How now, Sir Knight, what, haue you felt, that you haue so soone forgotten, not onely the Mantle which you desired, but euen your selfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so? If it bee a wound of loue, it is ill falling in loue in this place, for here is nothing to bee hoped for, but cruell death. In her crueltie, answered the now firme louer, consisteth all my life, séeing I haue séene the most swéete death that can be imagined: he spake it with such passion, that I know not who would not but haue yéelded, considering his goodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage. The faire Ladie was no lesse busied in her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, perswading her selfe, that there was not so comely a Knight in the world, giuing loue so frée passage into her brest, which lasted till her death, being no way able to leaue to loue. In her did loue shew an example of power, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and being vnable to doe any otherwise, (hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode the request of this young man, and what the Ladies denied) she said, Because, gentle Knight, you shal not think, that in this Castle is included all the crueltie of the world, I will giue you this Mantle, wherewith you may end the battell, but vpon condition, that you shall not depart from hence, before you shall first haue come to aske pardon of
<pb facs="tcp:13979:82"/>
the Ladies whom you haue so offended. That should bee a great want of discretion (Soueraigne Ladie) for a man to fall into the reckoning, what it is to offend you, séeing how much it concerneth mee, not to depart hence without it, it shall not need to aduertise mee, that therein I should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase your disfauour. Why then, valorous Knight, quoth shée, there resteth nothing but to giue you the Mantle, and therewith to wish you the victorie, as one which deserueth the same. In vttering these wordes with such a grace as would haue made loue himselfe in loue, shée tooke off her rich robe, &amp; cast it downe to the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> who being much enamoured, with his necke in her yoake, winding it about his arme, he turned toward the knight, who at his approach said vnto him, You haue, Sir Knight, made so long stay, that but for that, that I did so much desire the battell, I would haue returned to my lodging, without giuing you any place to go any further forwards. In that I haue made no longer tariance, I doe maruaile (said the valorous Gréeke) for I know not how I could possibly depart from my life, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it in the hands of those faire Ladies. Is it possible (said he of the Castle) that comming in frée, you are become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie so subiect? Therein appeareth the force of loue (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the gentle <hi>Tinacrian</hi>) for he giueth, and bereaueth of libertie at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>In this maner (said he of the Castle) you are desirous to giue end to this battel. It rather grieueth me much (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the valiant youth) that we stay so long, I expect no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the contrarie, neither did the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> giue him aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, but rather the one making to the other a due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with angrie paces they came to ioyne. O <hi>Thalia,</hi> that a man might put this battell into thy hands, to the end that thou mightest giue it that Soueraigne grace which it deserueth, for with my dull wit, and want of fauours, it is not much, though I erre therein. All the faire Ladies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the warriours. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did purpose rather to suffer himselfe to be hurt, then that the Mantle should bee
<pb facs="tcp:13979:82"/>
toucht: it did encourage him, and that verie much, that his Ladie had giuen it him; hee entred with his right foote bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the point of his sword firme forward. He of the Castle was nimble, and so with his left arme he ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He cast ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his shoulder: this gaue him the victory, for through his elbow, hee thrust the third part of his sword, hee drew it out dropping bloud, and not content therewith, hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was neuer Uiper that so returned against her enemie, as did he of the Castle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although somewhat out of breath, which was the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wound: being wholly desperate, couered with his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he entred, and with a strong thrust, hee stabd the great <hi>Tinacrian</hi> in the arme: it made him to grone, to féele himself so sore hurt. At the instant, the bloud sprang out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Mantle.

                  </gap>ut that was but a poore defence, for he cut all the pleites therof, and part of his arme: hee saw him somewhat out of order, and lost not the benefit of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasion: for he closed with him, thinking to haue ouerborne him, but he gat but little by his comming: for fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe preuented by his aduersarie, who with his dagger in his hand, if hee had béene a little more come to himselfe, without doubt he had kild him: for comming to handie gripes, he gaue him therewith a mightie stab: it was below his hip, wherein he left the dagger s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icking. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous <hi>Tinacrian</hi> tooke this wound verie in patientlie,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:83"/>
and put his hand to his dagger to haue ended the warre. Hee of the Castle set hand to the scabberd, being afraid of death, but he could not be master thereof. But going strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling euen to the gate where the Ladies were, hee had the better in the wrestling, by reason of his hurt in the thigh: But comming where hee might behold his Ladie, (his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour changing and all his body trembling) hee set vpon his aduersarie, whome being almost out of breath, he forced to fall on his knées vpon the floore, and with his dagger in his hand, hee meant to haue stabd him into the forehead, &amp; had done it, had he not heard the Ladies which séeing it, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, holding him fast. The young man lifted vp his head to see who it was that called. They said vnto him, Sir Knight, in requitall of the displeasure which you haue done vs, wee entreate you to leaue that Knight with his life, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how little it importeth you to be an Homicide, whereas you may otherwise haue the victorie. It is a thing which I should bee sorie for (answered the valiant youth.) I would valorous Ladies, that of your part I might be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and as not a thing that I desire: and if it bee your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I giue ouer the battell, on condition that he suffer mee to giue an end to this aduenture: and so he parted from him, thinking to haue fought no more, (for his déede deserued no lesse:) but the Knight forgetting his kindnesse, with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased stomacke, farre more then at the beginning, assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the young man, saying,</p>
               <p>Doe not thinke, sonne of <hi>Garrofilea,</hi> that thy comming into this Castle shal so litle cost thée. The Prince was asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to sée himselfe so mocked. Hee turned to sée the Ladies, which holding his death for certaine, séeing him so ill hurt, and his enemie so sound and wel, had left the standing. The like did his faire Ladie, hauing made streames of teares for the great sorrow which shée felt, to see the Gallant whome shée so dearely loued, to bee so sore wounded: much more did the young man grieue at that, then to sée himselfe so wounded. But comming againe to himselfe, as furious
<pb facs="tcp:13979:83"/>
as an Aspicque, hee charged vpon his enemie, although drawing one leg somewhat after him. There is no cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie comparable to this, for death is not feared, so as reuenge may be had. He crossed his sword somewhat low, making shew to bee ouercome. His most strong aduersarie thought to make benefit thereof, but it hapned cleane contrarie; he put by the blow, but with a full blow he smote him ouer the legge, and almost cutting it off, hee made him to stumble with the paine of his hurt, and hee reached him yet another sound one before hee could stay. Hee smote him also on the shoulders, where was his first hurt, but therewith the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrian</hi> ended the battell, for with the fourth, hee felled him dead to the ground. He scarcely touched the ground, when he vanished out of sight: all the Court was filled with a thicke darke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; nothing was heard but the lamentations of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed Ladies. That being past, the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> felt himselfe whole and sound of al his wounds and blowes receiued, and againe armed with his rich armour, which was that which made him most to wonder, hee saw nothing in the Court but the Siluer trée. He drew néere vnto it, wondring at the beautie and the rich enamelling of the body of the trée. He read an Epitaph, differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which the faire Quéene of <hi>Lira</hi> met withall, when shée entred into this Castle, as was declared in the second part of this Historie, written with Gréeke letters in bloud; the Louer read them, which said thus,</p>
               <p>When the bastard Lion shall come into this habitation, and with winning it, shall lose his libertie, breaking off the Golden bough, he shall make frée from perpetuall enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that personage which tooke him, leauing another frée entrie for the fierce Basiliske, who shall set at libertie the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Damsell, and many other Knights which here shall bee enchanted with the flowre of beautie: leauing this Palace, this old and fresh repose shall be giuen them in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympus,</hi> where they shall remaine many yeeres.</p>
               <p>The young man made no longer stay, but comming to
<pb facs="tcp:13979:84"/>
the Golden bough, taking good footing in the ground, hee set to his valiant hands, he bowed the bough so much, that hee made it like a bow, hee heard great exclamations, which came forth of the body of the trée, saying, O cruell Knight, the case which tormenteth me, I feele in the middest of my soule, leaue me, it sufficeth for my afflicted heart, that thou take compassion thereof, in knowing that I am that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Alpatraphio,</hi> Lord of all Egypt, and to my great hurt a great wizard, and this not sufficeth, for I was the murtherer of my owne daughter, in whome rested my life. These words, nor the pitifull complaints of the Emperour mooued him not, so as to make him giue ouer her determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: but rather with greater force then before, he so hard pulled the bough, that he brake it off, running downe great streames of bloud, all his armour and weapons were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into that Purple colour, and hauing the boug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The young man was much troubled to see the things, which were in that most faire hall: in one side thereof, hee saw comming foorth, an auncient Gentlewoman of good yeeres, leaning vpon two Nimphes, such as hee saw the Queene haue, apparelled all in white, cut vpon coloured Tinsell, which comming neere vnto him, said,</p>
               <p>I know not, presumptuous Knight, who hath giuen you leaue to come into my lodging, whither it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any man to come, without bringing the Golden bough, or at least, that of Siluer. Why then, honourable Ladie (aunswered the young warriour) I bringing the tokens of the tree which you speake of, you haue no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to shew your selfe displeased with me.

               <p>Shee put him in a rich square roome, which opened towards the Dungeon, where <hi>Luzela</hi> the Emperours daughter was, lamenting her misfortune, to see her selfe without libertie or any hope thereof. The Ladie verie pleasantly went in thither, saying, Come hither, Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princesse of Egypt, for now the high heauens haue practised a meane to free you of your paine, and haue sent you the Prince of <hi>Tinacria,</hi> to set you at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, for whome it was reserued, as for him which was most worthie.

Shée had alreadie prouided Palfreyes for the Ladies, and againe imbracing them, not without teares, shée returned to the Castle, at whose going in, there was so great a noyse, as made the louers much to wonder, and within their sight, they sawe the building to arise and to flie in the ayre, vntill it past their sight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention shall bee made in the end of this fourth booke, where it shall better fit, to tell you what those louers did.</p>

I would faine haue a fauour to be able to publish with my owne experience, of what power a fauour is, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with a pleasant countenance. All this was experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them: for if hee loued her, shee liued by adoring him: they were well matched, and to liue secure from the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings in loue, and with tendernesse of heart, the valiant young man askt her, saying,</p>
               <p>Soueraigne Ladie, séeing that the heauens haue reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to be yours, and that I am neuer to depart your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, neither from what you shall commaund, I should bee verie glad to knew your mind, and whither your will is that wee goe. My lot, valorous Prince, is so contrarie, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that I now haue my wish, seeing I am in your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer) that I am to doe nothing after my owne will, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow yours.</p>
               <p>The Gallant hartily thanked her, saying, I well see, valorous Princesse, that this your generosity is wholly to inrich me, and seeing that it is your pleasure, that I shall dispose of all, for this present let our iournie be for the Greeke Empire, for I haue a great desire to make my selfe knowne vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatius</hi> my beloued father, and also because that he may see what chaunce is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len vnto mee, in comming to doe you this little seruice; for there your greatnesse may stay with the Greeke Ladies, in greater honour then in that sorrowfull habitation.</p>
               <p>Ualorous Prince (sayd the tender Ladie) I haue euer had a great desire to see the Gréeke Court, and the Ladies therein: for that I haue heard say, that they are the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all brauery. In this maner there is a thing come into my mind, which if it shall please you to heare it, I will tell it you vpon the way betweene this and the sea.</p>
               <p>Nothing (valorous Prince) shall displease mee, if you therein shall take delight. In <hi>Poliphebus</hi> armes the Ladie tooke horse, and so did the Nimphes giuen to doe her seruice. Hee as nimble as a flie, leapt into his saddle, (a new bayt to make the Ladie the better to loue him) and leading her
<pb facs="tcp:13979:86"/>
horse by the bridle, they went downe the hill. In comming into the plaine, the right way towards the Hauen, <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebus</hi> began after this maner:</p>
               <p>I doe, Soueraigne Princesse, vnderstand of the great warres wherein my father now is, and of the many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which beseege his Citie: I neuer yet durst to make my selfe knowne vnto him, without doing something, whereby I might boldly vaunt my selfe to bee the sonne of the mightie <hi>Trebatius</hi>: and for this purpose I take occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to goe in your company; and hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> equitie of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie on my side, betwéene the two Campes I purpose to maintayne the same; not against the Greeke Dames, for the loue of my sisters, and the rest of my kindred, which liue enamoured, which seeing my challenge, of force must come to contradict it. Fame hath reported, that in the Moores Campe there are Ladies, which for beautie, are the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nixes of their Countries: and if I prosper well in this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, I may make my selfe knowne for the sonne of the great <hi>Trebatius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would not, valorous Prince (sayd the Ladie) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> through my occasion you should lose that, which your vertue doeth assure of: for there want not Ladies, whose brauery and beauty is to be preferred farre before mine. I am not able to goe into Greece (answered the gallant Louer) without making it appeare what power your vertue hath within my brest. So then (answered the Ladie) there is nothing to bee sayd against your resolution. With swéete conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation they came to the sea side, where they past all that night with such contentment of either partie, as can not bee expressed.

that they wished it had bene <hi>Vlisses</hi> voyage. After supper ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the hatches of the ship, casting their eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the vast seas, and the forme of the skies, this Gallant sayd vnto the Ladie, If it may be told without griefe vnto you, I would gladly know the cause of your enchauntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Some it will be to me (warlike Prince in renning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what I there endured; but to giue you satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, whatsoeuer you shall commaund shall be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>Then know, valorous Knight, that my father had an Aunt, the wisest woman in all Egypt, where it is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie matter to be giuen to the arte Magick. My father comming to receyue the Crowne, as Emperour of Egypt, was defirous to learne that science; and so brought that his Aunt to the Court, of whom he learned the greatest part of all her cunning. He married, and the destinies would, that there should be borne so infortunate a Damsell as am I, to haue so many desastres. Comming to the age that I now am of, without any pardon as a father to his owne daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he came to be so farre in loue with me, that hee tooke no pleasure of the world, seeing I would not yeeld to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. I imagining that I should wrong my selfe, to yéeld in such a case to my father. This my iust disobedience made such an impression in his heart, that from thenceforth his hatred was farre greater towards me, then euer his loue had bene. It did nothing grieue me to endure the troubles which he put me to, for denying him a thing so vniust.</p>
               <p>Wrath and blind affection so much preuayled ouer him, that being in my garden, little thinking of his paine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it did somewhat grieue me to see what hee endured, considering that he was my father, I saw him comming in a walke among Canes, with a more vnstaied pace, then his grauitie required.</p>
               <p>In seeing him I arose, &amp; with a fayned smile we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to méet him. But he which came drowned in a deuillish determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without regard of any thing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> led him

vnto, with a strange furie tooke mee by the arme, saying, My <hi>Luzela,</hi> if it may giue you no occasion to ease my paine, in that I am thy father, and to sée what I indure with the griefe and torment which thy beauty hath brought me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; yet let the death which thou séest before thine eies moue thee to doe it. And therewith he drew out his dagger which he set at my brest. You may imagine, gentle Knight, what my soule felt betweene these two extremes, and each of them so great. In the end I chose rather to die, then so to defile my body, and answered him, My Lord and dearely beloued Father, the heauens beare record with me, that if the losse of my life might doe you pleasure, I would prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue it, and should take pleasure to lose it, and therein should offend no body, but rather ennoble y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience which I owe you: but to be obedient in this, a thing so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason, I am of opinion, that therein I should doe iniurie, both to you and my selfe.</p>
               <p>Hee suffred mee not to proceede forwards; for with a strange fury, hee sheathed his cruell dagger in the tender brest of his louing daughter. Few blowes suffised to stretch mee all along.</p>
               <p>My father had not the power (repenting himselfe of that he had done) to take out his dagger. I thinke the heauens would not that he should kill me; to the end, that I in him should sée sudden change.</p>
               <p>O cruell destinies, began he to say, lifting his voyce to heauen, in how many sorts haue you shewne your selues coniured against me! O infortunate Emperour <hi>Alpatra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phio,</hi> to how small purpose serued the science wherewith I was indued!

<pb facs="tcp:13979:88"/>
what I did, I went to that lodging from whence you set me free, where I did nothing else, but be waile the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of my father, holding him for dead. She would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tell me any thing of him, although that sometimes she came to visit me, giuing me hope hereof: and she told it me so playne, that I now perceyue how much is therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes: and I am giuen to vnderstand, that the time shall come, that I againe shall sée my father.</p>
               <p>Yea, it will come (answered the gallant Louer) for the heauens giue not one contentment without another.</p>
               <p>In this and other pleasing things, they past the greatest part of the night; wherewith the young man began to ware somewhat bold: it was not wholly to offend her, but to shew with the mouth what the heart felt. He was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that this Ladie was sent to him from the heauens; wherefore, with the greater ioy they past the rest of the time.</p>
               <p>It suffiseth, that to take their rest, they went to their Cabin (with a determination on eyther side) that nothing should hinder their loue.</p>
               <p>Before that <hi>Aurora</hi> had done the Sunnes Ambassage to the world, shewing his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hee leapt out of his bed, not willing to shew any carelesnesse for the defence of his Ladie. With the masters helpe he put on his rich Armour, and being at all peeces armed, he went to put the Princesse of Egypt, and his soule also, out of feare: and with reuerence (being wholly ouercome with loue) he told her that there was an enemies Galley discouered: willing her, that shee should not therefore bee afeard, for the sight of her good grace did assure all.</p>
               <p>With greater valour, valorous Prince (sayd the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) I would very gladly accompany you, for the succour which hereof can come vnto you (except the good will) is so little, that it will rather be a hinderance. Ill should

I, gallant Ladie (quoth the <hi>Tinacrian</hi>) goe to fight, if not going wholly yours, and in fighting, it shall bee onelie for you.</p>
               <p>By this time the two Gallies were come neere together, wherin, in seeing the Princes Gally, was heard a great cry, bidding them amaine, if not they should all dye The young man did it, but to another intent: for hee commaunded, that all those which could beare Armes, should take them, and should stand at the ships side.</p>
               <p>As the Marriners with all diligence had ended the cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of grapples aboord the other, to the ende that shee should not fall off, and that they might with their swords fight aboord (it was no euill counsell, for it gaue them the victorie) vpon a sudden there came some twelue Knights, which bade them to yeeld.</p>
               <p>The valiant young Prince stayed vntill that they had fastened the Galley: and getting a club in his hand, hee set himselfe vpon the poope, where hee gaue so good account of himselfe, that two of them lost their liues with one blow which he gaue amongst them.</p>
               <p>They were many, and for feare of their Commaunders they set vpon the Prince, but it was to come with their liues, and there to meete their death; for hee neuer stricke blowe which killed not a Knight, and sometimes two of them together payd for their folly: before that they could returne, he had made an end of them.</p>
               <p>By that time, there came forth three most fierce Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, out of a withdrawing place in the ship, where the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> heard cryings, as of forced Ladies. Those thrée most cruell Pagans were much amazed, to sée how soone that Knight had made an ende of all their Knights. All of them forgetting the order of Knighthood, drawing out their monstrous faulchions, came to the shippes side: and one of them assuring himselfe of his agilitie, setting his one foote vpon his shippe side, leapt into the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> Galley, and had done it, if the young mans cruell club
<pb facs="tcp:13979:89"/>
had not by the way taken him a blow on the pate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reauing him of his life in the ayre, throw him in back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the ship dead at his friends feet, which were in a cold sweat. He which lost least occasion, was the <hi>Tinacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>; for with a light leap he set himselfe against the Giants. Whether that she which loued him better then herselfe, tooke pleasure therein, there is no doubt, thinking that no man could be loued with more reason then the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> seeing his great valour conioyned with so much beautie as hath bene aforesayd. He was one of the most gallant perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages in the world; so as many times he would not put off his Helmet, especially among Ladies, to whom he was as a Cockatrice. Uery ioyfull she set her to behold what he did in the Galley. He somewhat reposing himselfe, with a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled voyce, sayd, How now, you traytours, and so easily did you thinke to beare away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prize. First you shall leaue your liues in pawne for your foolish presumption. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Louer stayd for no answere, but whorling his club a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head, he smote one of them vpon the shield, which hee brake in péeces, and there withall his arme which it hung vpon. He escaped not without his paiment, for in the warres, for loue neuer giueth the palme without it: for they both smote him vpon the inchaunted Helmet, and made him set his knees to the ground: they there strake the Prince and his Ladie in the shield, which her soule hath that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully loueth: this, they which know what it is to loue, call the heart: hee saw that these fierce Giants againe smote downe right at him.</p>
               <p>Hee on one side crossed the blow with his club: and the other he shunned by skipping to one side. The club was no defence against the force of the blow, which brake it in the middest. It was good fortune that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> gaue back with his body, letting goe his club, which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause that he escaped the blow; which if he had not done, he had falne on his face: the handle onely remained with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valiant louer, which he would imploy in his Ladies seruice, which

he saw did behold him: it did the more encourage him to doe it, for that, that by reason of the noyse, there came cut of a Cabbin in the Galley, a most braue dame, clad all in blew, cut vpon rich cloth of Gold, with her haire made vp, more bright then the Sunne beames, vpon her head, a net-worke of Siluer: the swéete prison of loue, which to him had béene life, if they would haue letten him alone, although somewhat painefull in that place.</p>
               <p>It was long since that the Prince had séene that Ladie, but he presently knew that shée was his beloued sister: the gallant <hi>Rosaluira,</hi> a cold sweate to sée her in that place, ran ouer all his bodie, he would defer no longer time: but threw the péece of the Club which hee had in his hands at one of the Giants; if it had béene shot out of a Culuerin, it could not haue fline with greater force; he smote him right on the Helmet, him, who had alreadie lost his arme: the gallant neuer in his life gaue bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His strong dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Moore came vpon him with another, which made him fall vpon his hands and knées vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground: hee would haue troden him vnder his feete, but the warlike Prince had not yet lost his good resolution, séeing him come running, slipt to one side, letting him passe with greater force then a thunder-bolt. The young louer
<pb facs="tcp:13979:90"/>
followed him, and as hee turned about with his sword in both hands, hee smote him athwart the Helmet, and strake away all that side, and left him shrewdly hurt: hee prouided for him another, because hee should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Giant, with the pangs of death griped him with such force, that his armour entred into his flesh. But the fierce youth with his dagger ended the warres, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all into the Sea, hee went straight to his sister, putting off his Helmet, and said,</p>
               <p>I know not, Madam, and my beloued sister, how I shall estéeme this good hap, which the Gods this day haue powred vpon mee, séeing they haue brought me where I might doe you seruice: for I beleeue, you were forced to come hither with such euil companie. By this the Ladie knew him, and imbracing him with a thousand teares like Pearles, for ioy, shée said, Who that hath gained, valorous brother, hath béene my selfe, séeing that in giuing me libertie, you haue giuen me means to reioyce at your Cheualrie. They againe imbraced, for there were no brothers that more déerely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued then these two: he acquainted her with his aduenture, and the course which he held.</p>
               <p>The Ladie beyond all measure, reioyced to sée the prince <hi>Poliphebus</hi> so well employed; shée would then goe to speake to the Princesse of Egypt, taking much pleasure to knowe her for her Ladie and sister. The Prince carried her in his armes aboord, entertaining her with such courtesie as was expedient; and knowing her to bee his sister, whome shee so deerely loued, shee shewed her great affection, which lasted so long as they liued. The Princesse was verie sorie, to thinke how much her mother grieued for her absence: wherefore they tooke order, that two of their people should goe in the Giants Galley, directly for <hi>Tinacria,</hi> where they should bee well paid for their labour, which they did, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>That vpon the top of the hill, they had discouered great aboundance of Cattell, on that side towards their Campe, and that there might bee about some thirtie thousand foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which had the gard of them.

                  <hi>Don Argante,</hi> and his friend <hi>Thorisiano,</hi> that with 500. light-horse, without charging the enemie, they should disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the hill, and to see whether there were any Ambuscado, and if there were none, they should with all spéede take the passage, aduertising what passed, for hee purposed to leaue none, if he once tooke the hils side: hee was not so ill aduised which kept the flocke, which was the good Knight <hi>Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> but that he gaue present aduertisement to Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople; for the two Princes could not get vp so high so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, but that they would be discouered.

               <p>The messenger came before the Emperour, who with all the haste in the world, in companie of his sonnes, with all the men of warre of Persia and Babylon, which were most refreshed, hee sayled a great pace out at the Sirena Port, thinking to get the hill, but all his labour was in vaine: for the furious <hi>Bembo,</hi> despited with what was past, had already taken it with fifty thousand fighting men, whereof the one halfe were his owne, and the other were Almaines, to whome hee was much affected. It was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie day for the Gréekes: for ioyning with <hi>Flamin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They made no great boast: for comming backe with the Cattell, verie ioyfull of the victorie, they could not passe so at their ease, but that they must extend themselues at large on the hils side, making head against the Gréekes, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding what had passed, fought not like men, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like enraged Lions.

and how sorrowfull shée would bee when shée should heare the newes, euen by pure force of armes, they went vp to the top of the hill, and so returning vpon them which draue the Cattel, they tooke them from them, putting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to cruell deathes. They draue downe the beasts, til they gat at the enemies backs, &amp; then with a great cry they set vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, assuring themselues of the victorie, and brought them to such a straight, that whether they would or no, they made them take the plaine, and, but for abandoning the heards, they had wholly ouerthrown them. But hauing againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the hill, of force they were to stand there still, which stoode them in greater stead in the battell. <hi>Bembo</hi> was so carefull, that he had alreadie giuen notice to the Campe, to the end that <hi>Brauorante,</hi> &amp; <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> with all those of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quea, should with all spéede come thither, towards the hils side which falleth by the Sea side, for there hee most feared the Gréekes. The valorous Knight with the Stars, whom <hi>Bembo</hi> had made his Lieutenant generall, came with the rest of the armie openly to the battel. That yong man came verie desirous to fight that day, and so encouraging his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, putting vp his Beauer, chearing them with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his face, he said,</p>
               <p>This is the day, valiant men of warre, wherein friendly fortune hath put the enemy into our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, which now were carelesse for ioy of the late victorie. I will not encourage you, for I assure my selfe, that each of you in particular hath wished for this day, to let them know the strength of your armes, and séeing we are before them; there is now no time to make many spéeches, but remitting all to the valor, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the heauens haue enriched you, assuring my selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I am of opinion, that we shall make them pay their old score. He cast his Trunchion in the middest of them, which was a signe that no man should take any prisoner, but that they should put all to the sword: for there is neuer worse seruice, then that which is done perforce.</p>
               <p>They all showted for ioy, promising the Captaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they

would all die, or ouercome. There went in the middle <hi>Flora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisa,</hi> and <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> néere vnto <hi>Don Clarisell.</hi> There went in the Uaunt-gard, aboue thrée thousand Giants, so high, that they séemed to be so many Pine trées: the valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Astorildo</hi> led the arrere Gard, desirous to méete with his Cousin of Dacia, with whome hee was much offended, because that hee had perswaded his sister <hi>Rosamundi,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the worshipping of their false gods. Thither came the mightie Emperour of the Romanes, accompanied with the best men in the armie: by his side came the Prince of Almaine, with the strong <hi>Brundusio,</hi> which could neuer be perswaded of the fiercenesse of the Greekes: there came for his Gard all the flower of Giant-land, which were aboue two thousand.</p>
               <p>The braue <hi>Califa</hi> led his people, so gréedily desiring to fight, that euen with passion not foreséeing the euent, hee commaunded his Standerd to march forwards, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themselues in length, in good order they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselues before the Gréekes, for this should put the victorie in their hands. The mightie Gréeke came not so ill prouided, but that hee brought all the Thebane horsemen by his side, commaunding the Duke to bring foorth all the Carts, Wagons set with hookes of Iron, &amp; the Elephants, and if occasion were offred, to present a field battell, for hee with his sonne would take the gréene way. Then came the mightie Captaine Generall, with the best companie that was in all the whole world: for hee had twentie foure Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the most valiant that were in all the Armie, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had the charge of his person: for so had the Quéene <hi>Orisel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua</hi> commanded, feareful for her déere sonne: therewith went the flower of Cheualrie, <hi>Claridiano, Claramante,</hi> and the faire <hi>Archisilora</hi>: there was also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valorous <hi>Zoilo,</hi> with the men of Tiglia, who went a great pace to recouer a hils side, which was of great importance for the battell. Good were these preparations, but fortune being against them, they serued to small purpose: for the enemie led her by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke:
<pb facs="tcp:13979:93"/>
for the couragious <hi>Bembo,</hi> which led the vauntgard, seeing the Armes of <hi>Trapisonda,</hi> which were fiue Eaglets in a field of siluer, said to the Gallants which were with him, Sée, yonder is the Emperour <hi>Alphebus,</hi> of whom fame hath made so great report; heere is the place where you are to shew your valour.</p>
               <p>The mightie Gréeke came mounted vpon <hi>Cornerino</hi> his good horse, with his strong and rich Armour which hee had wonne; for in this battell hee meant to shew himselfe a Gallant. With him hee brought three companions, which did assure any hard aduenture: which were the valiant <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> the fayre <hi>Rosamundi,</hi> with his Empresse <hi>Claridiana,</hi> of whome the sonnes of the great <hi>Tituan</hi> tooke charge: which were eight Giants, and they the most famous in all the armie.</p>
               <p>The braue Lord of <hi>Achaia</hi> went a little apart from his people, in signe that first they desired so many against so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to breake their launces, to shew the valour of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. They went forth foure, and hee made the fifth: which were <hi>Brauorante,</hi> and <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> with the fayre <hi>Floralisa,</hi> and her brother <hi>Don Celindo.</hi> Face to face stood they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Flower of Christendome: for the great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which had a great desire to proue himselfe against <hi>Bembo,</hi> addressed himselfe against him: and against the Scithian, the valorous <hi>Don Heleno:</hi> against <hi>Brufaldoro, Rosamundi: Floralisa,</hi> and <hi>Claridiana</hi> charged together: and against her beloued brother, the prince of the Persians, the valorous <hi>Bransiniano.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bembo</hi> his encounter was somewhat lowe, for feare of missing, as hee desired: it was not such as hee had giuen. But he that receyued it, his force not auailing him, lost both his stirrops. The like happened to the valiant <hi>Brauorant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> with the warlike <hi>Don Heleno,</hi> who turning his <hi>Tirian,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned against a contrarie partie, and <hi>Alphebus</hi> did the like. There was neuer séene a more cruell particular battell in a field, nor better fought: for as for foure of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
<pb facs="tcp:13979:94"/>
could each of them apart doe as much in the warres, as the angry god <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe. The three past their carriere, amazing all the armie. <hi>Brufaldoro</hi> is more valiant; but the Ladies Armes supply her defect, and more too: for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning vpon him, she gaue him a knock, the best that euer was stricken in the warres: for by chaunce her sword ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betweene his shield and his brest: she strake it from his arme, and loosened a great part of his vaunt-brace: shee came vpon him with a thrust, and well shee felt that it fet the bloud.</p>
               <p>Neuer was Lion so furious, as was this Mauritanian against this Ladie: and although her Helme were most strong, yet it was not sufficient to keepe her from falling sencelesse vpon her saddle pummell, casting bloud out at her mouth.</p>
               <p>All the rest of the Combats were reasonably deuided, but they were presently parted: for the furious <hi>Dacian</hi> with the noyse of so huge a blow (by chaunce) looked back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and séeing his <hi>Rosamundi,</hi> to whom the Pagan was about to giue another blow, with two leapes off his <hi>Tirian</hi> hee was with him, and tooke him somewhat at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares. What shall I say of his blowes? they made him lay his head on the saddle pummell. Then he ranne against him with his horse brest, which made him stagger, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (horse and man) to fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>By this time was <hi>Rosamundi</hi> come againe to her selfe, and was glad to sée her <hi>Dacian</hi> so neere her. The Combate could not continue, by reason that the two Armies ioyned with so great a noyse, that it seemed that the last day was come.</p>
               <p>Who is able to describe the sundry kindes of death, the mightie blowes, and the gallant attempts giuen and taken of either party that day? Some vnable to kéepe themselues vpright, tumbled to the ground, and before they could rise againe, death met with them: others which kept their sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles much better, with seeking meanes to hold them, lost
<pb facs="tcp:13979:94"/>
their liues, and were glad that they were dead before they fell to ground: others were thrust thorow, from side to side, and were nothing sorry for their wounds, but because they had no time to bee reuenged: others were so impatient, that being close by their enemies, they had not so much trust in their swords, as in their fists, and with them mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the warres, vntill that death cut off all hope to sée the triumph for the warre.</p>

That a Riuer breaking his bounds, and ouerflowing a corne field, doth not so beare downe the corne, as they did tread men vnder their feet.</p>
               <p>The Christians were so desirous of reuenge, that they would not suffer any place to bee voyd: for although they sawe that they met with their death; yet there was no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die seene to refuse it, still being in hand with the gallant Pagans, whose swords and Armours were died in Gréeke bloud.</p>

the Ladies beheld the cruel warre. All the Gréeke Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces knew what it meant. The Emperour <hi>Trebatius</hi> was very sorry, fearing some ill hap; for he saw all the troupes of Niquea, in aboue sixty rankes, marching towards the fountaynes, to charge at their backes. He lifted vp his eyes to heauen, saying, Into thy hands, O mightie God, I commit my cause, and the equitie of this persecuted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He turned to <hi>Rosacler,</hi> saying, I doe beléeue that this day will neuer be forgotten: I beséech the Lord to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people.</p>
               <p>Hee offered to come to fight with the Moores, but that was not their meaning; for they deferred it for a better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, but onely to crosse the fields to recouer a hill, which was hard by the walles, where they meant to fortifie. It was wonderfull to sée; for the Captaine <hi>Aristoldo</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken it. A better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunder the world neuer knew; and truly to haue gotten the hill, had bene continually rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to enter the Citie.</p>
               <p>The discréet Captayne returned within the valley with all the Spanyards, and made such haste, that they tooke it beforehand. The Pagan brought much valiant people, and hee was so of his person; but he met with those which he thought not of, which were the flower of Knighthood; no lesse then Uncle and Nephew, <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante,</hi> with the faire <hi>Archisilora.</hi> These were sufficient to fight with their whole armie. The Captaine of the Moores came to an ill market, for he met with <hi>Lindabrides</hi> her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, who smote him sencelesse vpon his saddle bowe: he was so quick with him, that before that he could recouer himself, he laid him on the hard ground, with a knock with his axe. Hee would not trouble himselfe any longer with him, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him for dead: but withdrew himselfe some what from his companions for not to be troubled with his battel-axe, for therewith hee made more roome. There was nothing better worth the séeing in all those warres. There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any hired labourer in the countrey, which shaking the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:95"/>
Chestnut trée, threw down more Chestnuts, then the sonne of <hi>Trebatius</hi> threw downe Knights with his terrible bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell-axe. Sometimes with thrée blowes hee felled fixe Knights: and sometime with a strong thrust hee pluckt Knights out of their saddles, filed vpon his axe, as papers vpon a thred. He neuer gaue blow, which made not the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company to looke about, and wonder at the strength of his armes.</p>
               <p>The vnknowne Louer gaue good account of himselfe, for hee sought not out particular Knights, but the grimme Giants; among which hee rushed without any signe of feare. Their comming to the rescue, was to so great effect, that they made the Moores to retire out of the field to <hi>Bem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> his squadron, who by this time was within sight, for he had intelligence, that there was a supply of men landed in the port of Antona. He made hast, in hope to ouercome; for he saw that by their hastie going, his people gat the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the field. Wel did the strong <hi>Breton</hi> sée, that for that he was on the left wing, where he plaid the deuil: &amp; as that ground was somwhat higher, those which tooke land might well possesse it; which ranging themselues into a strong Battalion, he saw tooke their way towards the field. Hee called the Prince of Argentaria, and sayd vnto him, Now is the time come, valorous Knight, to shew what hath bene hoped for at your hands: and therefore if you will be my conuoy, it behoueth me to passe by all these Tents, to goe to know what people that is which is newly arryued; for if they bee not enemy, we shall get the field.

               <p>The valiant <hi>Rosabel</hi> (for he had no time to stay casting his shield at his backe, and in his hand his sword) gaue his horse the reynes, who, as swift as a thunderbolt, parted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his squadron towards the sea side. The Prince of Thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis had inough to doe to followe him, hee went with such

                  <hi>Archisilora,</hi> because they saw that <hi>Aristoldo</hi> made all haste, getting ground vpon his enemie: for <hi>Epirabio</hi> being missing (whom sore hurt they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the battell) in a maner turning their backes, they made towards their campe, notwithstanding that the Moores in that place had the worst of the fight: in most places else, they cryed, Uictorie: for <hi>Bembo</hi> reinforcing his squadron, had brought to his ayd a hundred thousand Assyrians; with which hee gaue so fierce a charge on the squadron of the Thessalonians, that hee made them retire aboue a bow shot.</p>
               <p>The Gréekes were in better case on that side where <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risiano,</hi> with the gentle <hi>Polidolpho,</hi> with the people of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Apulia, and Croatia had entred: they were somewhat of kinne, and for that cause they alwaies kept company. They were of opinion, that the Sargeant Maior generall had reserued them and their people fresh, onely for that dayes seruice. They were very confident in their valour, &amp; through that occasion they vndertooke great enterprises, and fell on that side from whence <hi>Rosabel</hi> went; who with the strong <hi>Flori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They came in good time; for the people of that countrey beeing but a fewe left, had retired to backe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with a little hill, whither came the two famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines with al the horsemen, which gaue so sudden a charge vpon their enemies, as did greatly annoy them; but the best was to recouer the ground which they had lost. They both did greatly encourage the people, shewing them what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they wanne that day, seing it might well be sayd, that they had restored Grecia, being almost lost.</p>
               <p>These couragious speaches wrought such effect, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one fought for two: no man was afeard of danger, so great was the hope of victory. All was but neede; for the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:96"/>
Emperour of Rome did so busie the Duke of Thebes: and the Souldan of Egypt charged on the right wing, so as the Greekes had their hands full on euery side; for with the Souldan came mightie Giants.</p>
               <p>Against this squadron the braue Emperour <hi>Trebatius</hi> addressed himselfe, compassed about with the best men of all his armie: they two met, but the Greekes force was such, that excepting his sonnes, it was matchlesse: hee ouerbare both man and horse to the ground. Many aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after him, some to defend him, others to kill him, or take him prisoner.</p>
               <p>Twelue Giants which were of his gard alighted from their Elephants to rescue him, which did much hurt. With all this as in a chase, there alighted the noble Emperour and <hi>Rosacler,</hi> with the Princes of Fraunce, and <hi>Zoilo</hi> the braue Tartarian, with <hi>Brandafidel</hi> and <hi>Bramidoro,</hi> and the gentle <hi>Tifereo.</hi> There was renued one of the most perrilous fights that had bene seene of all that day: for the Emperour making no reckoning of the Giants, rushed in amongst them, and at his entrie with a stabbe hee thrust their Captaine quite thorow the body, from side to side, who for his heyght was like to a well growne Pine trée.</p>
               <p>The fierce Giant fell not, seeking before bee dyed to be reuenged: for hee swinged his heauie club about his head, and therewith gaue the Emperour <hi>Trebatius</hi> such a blow athwart his shield, as made him goe staggering to one side, readie to fall, and hee had falne, the blow was so terrible, had not his valorous Nephew <hi>Clarindo</hi> bene by him, who held him vp with his hand.</p>
               <p>The yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made no stay there; for séeing what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to his grandfather, casting his shield at his backe, he made at the Giant. Others were come to the aide, so as he was well reuenged: for <hi>Bramidoro</hi> with his heauie club, &amp; the Prince with his sword smote him both at once: one of them made his eies leap out of his scull, and the other with
<pb facs="tcp:13979:97"/>
his sword cleft his head. <hi>Rosacler</hi> turned to another which had smitten his Uncle, whom he made to lose his féeling.</p>
               <p>This day did the young man winne his credit and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall praise; for with a mighty blowe he cut him almost in two péeces. Much did the father reioyce to sée the force of his sonne, who mayntained a cruell fight against another Giant. This was no time to straine courtesie, for <hi>Branda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel</hi> came, who with his hideous club knockt him on the pate: his Helmet could not protect him, for he stretcht him all along at the Princes feete. The Gréekes and Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians seeing their Emperor, tooke herein so good order, that they wanne part of the Giants campe. There remained two to beare newes of the Greekes valour: and had there not come so much people, that the trampling of their horses was daungerous, they had without doubt taken the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan: but they mounted him againe vpon a swift courser, whereon he rode encouraging his people.

At their first comming they did some harme because they were flesh men, but it lasted but a while; for the Greekes, which by this time were already fleshed, made a cruell slaughter of them, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that heere, which was lost in the rest of the battels: for the Fenician Prince, <hi>Don Argante,</hi> although vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, came afresh with all the Medians, and for that cause where he entred he made a deadly but cherie.</p>
               <p>This was no day for the Greekes, for euen the Sunne was against them: for falling downe in the West, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued them of their sight; so as the enemies might easilie charge and retire at libertie. The Prince of Britany could not sally on that side where he was, but that he chaunced to see the furious young man with the stars, who, desirous to end the war with him, seeing that his people had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better in the fight: he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t along y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> side of a hill, which he could not do, but <hi>Be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bo</hi> would sée it, who with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other 2. famous Knights

               <p>Being confident in my new wound (although it bee in my old soule) I presume to begin to make relation of the most famous warre that euer was séene, of so many against so many: for <hi>Rosabel</hi> had scarcely parted from among his friends, and enemies, when descending downe the side of

               <p>This was the valiant <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> who hauing landed, and hearing the noyse of the battel, in great haste drue néere vnto it, but durst not disclose his meaning, because he would not grieue the Ladies.

The Prince was verie glad of the newes, which the Nimphes had told him: &amp; so willing him to goe before, for they would come to behold, he imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, &amp; tooke his leaue of the Ladies, not without griefe: for the one he loued, as his sister, and the other as his loue, &amp; the greatest in all <hi>Cupids</hi> band. He pluckt downe his Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp; with his Launce in his hand, hee marched away like <hi>Mars,</hi> and came downe into the valley, hee did not bow the grasse where his horse went, hee flew so swift with the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored gallant.

He would aske no questions, but rather charging his Launce, assailed the Giants, who held him for a mad-man: one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opposed himselfe against him, who with his life paid for the young mans displeasure: for in méeting him, before that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Launce brake, hee passed it a third part thorow his backe, and like a Lion, returned against the rest of the rascals. Foure times he hurled about his strong sword, wherewith hee dispatched the foure Knights, remaining alone in the field, with the two fierce Giants, where, O valorous Ladie, newly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trisse of his soule, who can depaint this combat, in such sort as you may take pleasure therin? He which carried the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Frenchman prisoner, was constrained to set him downe vpon the hard ground, and with his Club, to turne against the sonne of <hi>Trebatius,</hi> who making a hard rocke of his rich and sure shield, attended the blow, bearing his sword aloft; and séeing that the blow came, hee spurring his Rubicane, came so néere the Giant, that hee made him lose his blow. <hi>Luzelaes</hi> louer came with a good will, for with a thrust he hit him on the middest of the brest, &amp; came with such force, that it past halfe thorow at one side: his armour was so thick, that he scarce hurt him. His other companion came with a great Cemiter in his hand, hee slaied for his comming, but before that he could make any resistance, he smote him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rich Helmet, and made him sée al the least stars in the skies, and the bloud in great aboundance to gush out at his mouth: had it not béene <hi>Poliphebus</hi> which fought this battel, without al doubt they had ouercome him: for the two Giants were the best in all the Camp, &amp; therfore <hi>Bembo</hi> had reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kéeping of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good Frenchman, but they met with the sonne of <hi>Garrofilea,</hi> who more fierce then a Basiliske, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine rusht in betwéen them, &amp; from him who had so handled him, on a suddain he smote his shield to the ground, with the gretest part of his arme. The yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fury rested not here, seeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he came néere to the knight, who also saw him, not

knowing whether he were his friend, although that (indéed) hee was the greatest that hee had in the world, he would not méete him in this hurly burly with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Giants: for turning to the second, he smote him vpon the Helmet, and left his head all vnarmed, and therein a great wound. By that time came his lame enemie, who séeing himselfe without one arme, lifted vp his crooked Faulchion, but it was to smal purpose, for his wound tooke away the greatest part of his strength: with a leape he cleared himselfe from him, and iust as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabel</hi> came, with his sword in both his hands hee smote him vpon the top of the shoulder; there was no defence in the hard Stéele: for hee strake away all that quarter, throwing him downe dead at his horse féete. Hee had so fatned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therwith, that he gaue opportunitie to the other (being in despaire of his life) to giue him a blow, yea, he smote him a full one; and strake him downe vpon his horse necke, past all féeling, sencelesse: and so hee continued a great while, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing place to the Pagan to second it with another: and had not <hi>Rosabel</hi> come in time to hinder it, hee had striken him againe.</p>
               <p>The furious Breton returned, and smote the Moore on the side of the shield, the one halfe he flung away, with great part of his Uant-brace, leauing him sore hurt. By this time was <hi>Garrofileaes</hi> sonne come againe to himselfe, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gréeke so néere him, hee presently knew him, and was wonderfully glad to sée him in that place, but he would not that he should end the warre: for giuing his Spurres to his strong horse (for there were few such, and for such did the wizard giue it vnto him) and ioyning with the Pagan, (desirous to giue his Cousin to vnderstand, that he was no lesse then himselfe) with both his hands hee smote him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vnarmed head: and as he hit him on the skull, so hee cleft him downe to the brest: and then (as though hee had done nothing) wyping his victorious sword, he went to his Cousin <hi>Rosabel,</hi> saying, I would gladly know, Sir Knight, of whether of these two Camps you are: for if you bee of the

Gréekes, my mortall enemies, I shall bee enforced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ingratefull for that which for mee you haue done, by challenging you the combat, hauing farre better confidence in the equitie of my cause, then in my owne valour. In vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding this, worthie Knight (in denying my selfe to be a Gréeke) I might auoide the combat. But because that you shall vnderstand that you come ill enformed, let our fight begin presently, and in what maner you will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you shall vnderstand, that the equitie of our cause will giue vs the victorie. Your personage, valorous <hi>Rosabel,</hi> is worthie of all the triumphes in the world: and putting off his Helmet, he went to imbrace him, saying.</p>
               <p>Why, did you thinke, Sir Knight, that I would not haue come into your Countrie to sée you, you hauing offended a Ladie in Silepsia, such as is <hi>Eufronisa,</hi> by whome I am commaunded to challenge you the single combat? The yong man could giue him no answere for ioy. Sometime Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, a suddaine ioy bereaueth me of my sences, especially, when it commeth vnlooked for: but that qualme being past, imbracing him againe, he said, I did assure my selfe, valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince, and my Lord, that considering how much néed Gréece hath of your aide, you would remember it: let vs bee gone, to acquaint the noble Emperour your Father herewith. That may not bee yet (answered the valorous young man) but it behoueth rather to conceale my name, for the loue of certaine Ladies which come in my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, whome I haue promised, to maintaine their beautie in the middest betwéene these two Campes, against the Moores: for against the Gréekes who shall dare, although it were <hi>Mars</hi> him selfe, <hi>Rosabel</hi> being of their side? Séeing that you so please (answered the nephew) there is no man that will gainesay your will: but first I would that wee might to day before the Sunne goe downe, let them know what your arme can doe: and it commeth well to passe, for I come now out of the battell, to sée what people this is which here commeth.

vnto them (answered the <hi>Tinacrian</hi>) and me thinketh that they beare the armes of Gréece. But I would not that wee should stay a ioat longer: and so presently they tooke the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way towards the place, where they saw these troupes, which were those which came from <hi>Tinacria,</hi> vnder the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the great Earle of Modica. In drawing somewhat neere, the young man knew his owne armes, which were on the one of the Gréeke armes: hee bare in blew the seuen Starres in Gold: he was glad in his soule, that his mother had partly forgotten the displeasure, which shée conceiued against his father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rosabel,</hi> to bee briefe, séeing the alarum giuen towards S. Michaels Castle, gaue them to vnderstand thereof: the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> were excéeding glad for the méeting their prince, of whome they had heard, what a man hee was, and of his great valour: the Prince would not discouer himselfe to them, vntill that hee had performed his challenge. <hi>Rosabel</hi> presently drew them into the forme of an Hearse, and with the swiftest pace that they were able, they tooke their way towards the Campe: they came euen when the Sunne had ended his iournie, giuing a beginning to a new. Some of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke Battallions were in a confusion, readie to flie: they lookt where was most néed, which was where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Croacians fought, although that in the beginning they had done great hurt. But the greatest part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Sophi</hi> his people, with their Prince <hi>Thorisiano,</hi> charged into that quarter, making them (notwithstanding that they fought like Lions) to retyre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the field. But the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> which were verie earnest, did so reinforce them, that had it not bin so néere night, they had pacified the fight: But it was fauourable vnto them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that it lasted not aboue an houre: for therein did the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> make knowne what a Captaine he was, which led them, for hee &amp; his sonne <hi>Fartemio</hi> did beare themselues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13979:100"/>
in all that kingdome. All was nothing in comparison to that which the young man did: for séeing his fathers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to goe to wracke, there was neuer Mower that with his Sithe, did cut downe Corne so fast in harnest, as he with his sword in both his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds did fel down those infidels, which were not accustomed to ouercome. At his first comming, hée encountred with the gentle <hi>Thorisiano,</hi> who seeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that that knight made of his people, called for a Launce and went towards him. The yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suspected him not, he was so busie; and his aduersarie was not a man that would greatly straine courtesie: for if his armour had not béen good, he had riuen him thorow from side to side: he cast him so far backe vpon his Saddle, that hee knockt his head vpon his horse buttockes. There was neuer any Uiper troden vpon, that was so angrie as <hi>Luzelaes</hi> louer: for comming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; setling himselfe in his Saddle, with his verie lookes he made aboue foure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most proudest afraid: for being fixt in his Saddle, &amp; his féete in the stirrops, spurring his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bican, with a leape he was with him, &amp; with both his hands he smote him on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shield, &amp; (had not such hands tempered it) he had cleft it: for hee beat it close to his Helmet with such force, that hauing wholy lost his sences; he cast out the bloud out at his mouth, and set him on the arson of the Saddle: he had seconded it with another, &amp; that had béene his death, for the sonne of <hi>Garrofilea</hi> was now impatient, and being so, none of his brethren excelled him: being angrie he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, which was soone past, which did much aduance his fame. <hi>Thorisiano</hi> had many Giants for his gard, which although that his father knew him not, yet he loued him déerly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue regard of his person: &amp; so one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little lesse then a great Béech trée, mounted vpon a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous horse, such a one as was fit to carrie such a personage) met with the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> horse, who if he had not beene giuen him by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wise woman, they had both faln to the ground, for he had not his equal. With a faire shock they staid, &amp; his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption cost him his life; for in field battels courtesies are
<pb facs="tcp:13979:101"/>
not obserued: for <hi>Rosabel</hi> being néere his Unkle, with <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> sword ended that warre: for hitting him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hee cleft his armour and bodie to the hollow of his heart. His companion would reuenge his death, &amp; charged amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst them, as amongst ordinary Knights. But sée, hither came the famous Earle of Modica and his sonne, who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Gard of the Standard, came hither to their aide, as though they had knowne of the méeting: if <hi>Gualtenor</hi> may be beléeued, hee was one, that afterwards was verie famous in Grecia, who comming with great power, equall to his discretion, hee rushed into the middest of those Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. The good Knight <hi>Flamineo</hi> held them good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Being couetous of fame, these thrée entred, as though they had gone a hunting: by their blowes they purchased fame, for the <hi>Tinacrians,</hi> (now <hi>Sycilians</hi>) at the first charge, ouerthrew two of those Giants. The Frenchma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was so ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke, who séeking reuenge, was so slow, that hee was like to haue béene lost: for a Giant being néere him, cast his armes about his necke, with such force, that within a little he pluckt him out of his Saddle. The Frenchma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and so drawing out his dagger, he suffered the Giant to beare him, who féeling his weaknesse, drew him from the Saddle: but hee put in practise what he had determined, for hee suddainely had two or thrée times stabd his dagger vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his taces into his belly, fetching his soule out at the wound.</p>
               <p>They fell both to the ground, where <hi>Flamineo,</hi> obtaining the victorie, began to defend himselfe, but it had béene to small purpose, had not the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> béene there, who tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about his furious horse, made way to enter where the Frenchman was: hee tooke him by the arms, and as if hee had béene a child, he set him vpon the Giants horse; all men wondring at the valiancie of that Knight; which sufficed to giue meanes to <hi>Florisiano,</hi> and <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> to recouer what they had lost. They aduertised <hi>Don Celindo</hi> of what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, who with the Assirian, &amp; his sister, made thitherwards.
<pb facs="tcp:13979:101"/>
Here was the greatest presse of people that was in any place of all that day; for both squadrons comming to méet vpon a little playne, and seeing the great hurly burly, there were few of any account which came not thither. The first that came thither, was the valorous <hi>Don Celindo</hi> with his company: hee encountred <hi>Rosabel,</hi> and made a good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, although he lost both his stirrops. <hi>Rosabels</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser was so well trayned, that at two leapes he was with his aduersarie, and by that meanes he smote him before he was in a readinesse, and had wholly ouerturnd him, had not <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risel</hi> come running in, who well seated in his saddle, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Launce aboue hand, hee darted it at the valiant <hi>Breton</hi>: the Armour which he ware, was not such, but that it could well resist that blow, so that the Launce being vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pierce it, rebounded backe againe whole. The valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Damsell gathered it vp, and therewith went towards him whom she loued better then her owne soule: it was <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelaes</hi> louer, as hath already bene sayd. <hi>Floralisa,</hi> euer since that she saw his picture in the wood where she was bred vp, yéelded her soule to him, confirming the same, when hee went out of Grecia, admitting him for her Knight, which he thought not of.</p>
               <p>This Ladie was <hi>Mars</hi> in Armes, and <hi>Venus</hi> in beautie: shee brandished her Launce with such force and dexteritie, that I knowe not, but that if hee which receyued it had knowne her, hee would haue taken it for especiall fauour. Shee hit him right in the brest, the most enamored that the world knew, and brake it with the blowe, and made the Prince to bend on one side: who againe settling himselfe, knew her to bee the same which had done him so exceeding fauours. He would not take any reuenge on her. But the warlike Ladie not knowing who he was, turned her horse, and with <hi>Camillaes</hi> sword in her hand, she drew neere vnto him whom she most loued.</p>
               <p>Here appeared the valour of the mightie <hi>Tinacrian</hi>; who comming close vnto her, before she could deliuer her blow,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:102"/>
tooke her so fast by the arme, as if she had bene bound with a great cable, and in sight of all the armie, saying. Upon him who is lesse desirous to doe you seruice then I, warlike Ladie, you may execute your wrath, and not against him who is so much and so long time yours, and will be vntill I die. He spake it so suddenly, that she knew not who he was: and yet seeing him come with Armes differing from the Gréekes, and that he came with new supplie, shee present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspected that it was the gentle <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> &amp; was glad at her heart: for it is an easie matter to perswade any one that hopeth, and feruently loueth, to beleeue any thing that they would haue, and sayd, I thought, valorous warriour, that my wounds were receyued for fauours: but séeing that in you there wanteth this acknowledgement, I will leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for those which will take them for such. The youngster let her goe, which was to make her the more to yéeld: and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrarie partie begin to presse forwards, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that shee would not stay behind; otherwise she had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus proceeded the battell, when the braue Knight with the stars, vpon a high rocke beheld him in the blew scarfe working wonders: for <hi>Florisarte</hi> was now come, who knowing of the battell, was sent by <hi>Rosabel</hi> from the Citie. As an Eagle came this warlike yong man downe the hill: and in despite of the Christians, crossing athwart their campe, hee came where those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were. He trode vnder feete all he met in his way, and came in such fury, that he would haue made small account of <hi>Mars</hi>: yet the Princes of Babylon and Argentaria made head against him, but he cared for none of them, after he had seene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong man: at his comming he smote <hi>Lisarte</hi> his sonne in the middle of the shield, and encountred him with his head and brest in such sort, that hee made him lay his head on his horses croope, and with another hee had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne him, had not <hi>Bransiniano</hi> bene there, who with all his might gaue a happie blow for the Prince of Tharsis: for at what time as the young man lifted vp his
<pb facs="tcp:13979:102"/>
sword, the Persian spurring his horse, gat within him, and gaue him so great a blowe crosse the Helmet, as made him to lose his, and going from him, left him almost past reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. The Prince of Apulia which was hard by, gaue him a third. They gaue him so much to doe, that they made him more manifestly to shew the valour of his person: for seeing that three had set vpon him, he turned against them all, and put them so much to their shifts, that hee put them all out of breath. He charged &amp; retired as quicke as thought, and sometimes it was impossible any way to hit him, hee was so light. <hi>Don Celindo</hi> had vnderstood that <hi>Poliphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> had grieued his sister, and therefore with his sword (which was Queene <hi>Iuliaes</hi>) hee made towards the <hi>Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crian.</hi> At that very instant came the famous <hi>Rosacler,</hi> who being neere, of force could not chuse, but know his owne good sword: a man cannot declare the contentment which he conceaued in seeing it: for he could no longer forbeare, but sayd, Away, away: for this fight belongeth vnto mee. He came where the Prince was, who refuing him not, the battell began. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> at his comming knew him by his deuice, and therefore withdrew, addressing his blow against the magnanimious <hi>Lindauro,</hi> who to his owne hurt was returned to the battell: for the blow which <hi>Poliphebus</hi> gaue him, was like to haue cost him his life, who within a little had stretcht him all along at his horses héeles. All the soldiers (for not to be benighted) withdrew, to giue place to <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> who now more couragious then euer char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Gréeke: both together they gaue 2. mighty blowes, which brought their noses to their bosoms. The nights ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch would not suffer them to giue the second, which made both armies to sound y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> retreat, for feare to kill one another his friend vnknown. The Pagans were victorious, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they made good shew with their ordinarie instruments. On eyther side died so many, that they were innumerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet for all this, neyther in the Citie, nor in the campe was heard any complayning; for those which remayned,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:103"/>
were mightyly grieued, vntill they might sée the howre wherein they might either die, or be reuenged. For the hurt men the Duke of Thebes tooke especiall care, who was a most expert Captaine.</p>
               <p>This was that which hee with the starres desired; who leauing the battell, came to <hi>Rosacler,</hi> to whom with a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant grace he sayd, I would haue bene very glad, Knight, that you and I with some other whom you please, might haue gone and ended the battell that other day, for I much desire it.</p>
               <p>Let it be as it shall please you (answered the noble <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who desired the same no lesse then he) and leade you the way, and I will follow. The nerest at hand was <hi>Don Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risel</hi> which kept him company: with the Greeke was the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> who left word, if any body asked for him, they should say hee was gone about a little businesse, and would come againe straight.</p>
               <p>The Princes in withdrawing them, found some wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; the errand was left with <hi>Zoilo</hi> the Tartarian, who pacified his Lady and the rest: they were much better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, when they vnderstood that <hi>Claridiano, Claramante,</hi> and the fayre <hi>Archisilora</hi> were also missing, thinking that they were all together.</p>
               <p>The night was wholly shut in, when the braue <hi>Don Heleno</hi> and his beloued Lady, with the Captaine generall, and <hi>Brandafidel,</hi> and <hi>Tirefeo</hi> went forth of the Citie: and within a little while after, the most part of the Princes went forth also, and likewise out of the campe, to seeke for their Gallants which were missing.

               <p>He with the stars had no great experience in the warres, and much lesse knew the countrey, for both which his few yéeres might excuse him; for yet hee was not fully sixteene yeeres old, and yet he gaue all the flower of Greece matter to thinke on. At last they came to a fit place for the battell, although somewhat farre from the Citie and the campe. Without speaking one word, these two warriours turned their horses and parted, to returne the one against the other. Oh that my Mistresse would allow herselfe to be beloued, which would giue me meanes to depaint this warre, which was the most bloudy, being betweene so many against so many, that happened in all those warres! it were a sweet pensill for mee to vnderstand, that she tooke pleasure to be

adored; yet perswading my selfe that I am beloued, I will goe forwards, because they came together with greater fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then the sea, when being most swolne, it threatneth the heauens, putting the ships in great danger. Neither of them mist in the encounter, breaking their launces as if they had bene réeds. They past the one by the other with <hi>Mars</hi> his countenance. <hi>Lirgandco</hi> saith, that he with the starres lost one stirrop, but it was not perceiued. The Briton had a better horse then those which draw the Sun, a reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why he was with him before the yong man could turne about, he strake downe right. <hi>Achilles</hi> neuer strake better blow: for as it was <hi>Hectors</hi> sword, it did cut away halfe of his shield: for <hi>Lupertius</hi> his enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tment was not of that antiquity as the swords: he beat it to his helmet with greater force then can be imagined, &amp; made him bow downe his head as low as the horses crooper, and gaue him a terrible stab: within little he had indangered him, for it lighted néere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioynting of his vant-brace. He would néeds close with him, which was to his owne hurt: for the yong man like a fleshed Lion, with a leap was on one side of him, the Gréeke passing by with his courser, as quick as thought. He with the starres followed him in hope of reuenge: fortune put that into his hands which he desired: for <hi>Oliuiaes</hi> son returning, he smote him at ease vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highest of his helmet: the sword reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as if he had smitte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a rock. The yong man was nothing glad of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he gaue him another, which smote the Breton downe vpon his horse neck, casting out bloud at his mouth, nostrils, &amp; eares. The furious <hi>Tinacrian</hi> his bloud did fréese to sée such a blow: at length co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming againe to himselfe, &amp; in state to seeke reuenge, thinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he returned against his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Assyrian, saying, Sir Knight, there is no reason y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our friends should be in such da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, &amp; we stand and looke on.

The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> neuer perceyued that in his horse before, and was sorry for it in his soule; for hee would not ouercome him with any aduantage: and lightly leaping from him, he sayd, Pardon, Sir Knight, for it was not in my power; for I desire not to fight with any man with aduantage ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of horse or Armes. The Assyrian was so furious, that he made him no answere; but with his sword in both his hands hee set vpon him. On foote no man excelled the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrian,</hi> for he was an Eagle: he suffred him to approche: but before he could strike him, hee shifted him to one side, &amp; made him lose his blow: which being past, he gaue him such a knocke vpon the Helmet, that he made him set his hands to the ground, and would haue closed with him, but it was too late: for the angry young man was againe on foote, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nimbly made a famous assault; for he gaue <hi>Garrofiliaes</hi> sonne two stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g thrusts one after another, which made him goe backwards, somewhat out of breath, which gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the young man with a wheeling about to lay him at his féete, and within a little had hought him, one leg tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting him. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> felt the blow, but would not shew the effect which it wrought: for hee charged his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie vpon one leg, vntill the great payne was past: rare va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in a Knight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the want of his leg was not perceiued: for with a leap, although but vpon on leg, he came home to the Assyrian: there was no defence against his arme: for hitting him vpon one side of the shield, he smote him so hard, as made him set his knées to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground: he entred &amp; shouldred him, &amp; threw him downe vpon his backe: he knéeled downe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him with his dagger in his hand. <hi>Floralisaes</hi> louer was in dout of his life, &amp; this made him draw stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, setting both his hands vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The starred Knight came blind for ioy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he came in time, whereby <hi>Poliphebus</hi> had meanes to giue him a cruell blow; for as he had neuer a shield, so hee gaue him a great slash in the brest. Now was the Assyrian on foote, who séeing <hi>Rosabel</hi> come running, he gaue him a thrust, but hee neuer boasted of it; for <hi>Lirianaes</hi> louer, with a blow backwards, made him to fall on his face to the ground: the noyse of this battell was so great, that all the hils and vallies rung there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The moone shined bright, which gaue light to three Knights which sate on the hils side to sée all this battel; they were no worse men, then the Princes of Silepsia, <hi>Leobello,</hi> and <hi>Claribel,</hi> which came with the Knight, which found them newly borne, as hath béene before declared: hee was one of the chiefest in that Realme, and brought some troups to the aide of his King, which hee had sent vnder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of his Lieutenant to the Campe; and hee with his two sonnes (for so he called them) went vp that mountain. By reason of the noyse of the battell, they came downe from thence in great haste, and came iust at the time that the Gréekes had the better: for <hi>Rosabel</hi> had wel-néere ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Prince of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Assyrians: and <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> desirous to make the Knight with the Starres, to know that hee was the glorie of armes, hastned so the battell, that he had already made him breathlesse.</p>

Let vs intreate you, gentle Knight, (answered the Princes) to giue it ouer vntill to morrow, because we then may the better enioy the sight of your fortitude. To content the Princes, they all consented, whose beautie and comely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse made them to admire. They all seuen sate downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a gréene Oliue trée, and taking off their Helmes to take breath, it was a marueilous thing to sée, when the one came to behold the other: for if there were beautie in the world, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was withdrawne. <hi>Rosabel</hi> was not yet thirtie yeeres old, neither had his trauels altred his complexion, for hee was the Phenix of his time: for <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> all the sages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée that he was excéeding faire. He with the Starres, and the two young men were but children: for the oldest was not yet fiftéene yeeres old, but so faire, that they contended for beautie with the heauenly inhabitants. The two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Silepsia were so like vnto <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did maruaile thereat, and séeing so much beautie met together in them sixe, that for complexions and armes, they were the flower of the world.</p>
               <p>The two youthes came with a desire to receiue the order of Knighthood, at the hands of the Captaine generall of the Pagans armie, whose fame reached to the starres: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing seene the valiancie of those foure Knights, the elder of these youthes, whose name was <hi>Claribel,</hi> directing his pace towards <hi>Rosabel,</hi> whome according to the constellation of his Natiuitie, hee was inclined to loue, said, Ualorous Knight, my brother and I are desirous to receiue the order of knighthood, at the hands of some worthie man of warre, which desire hath forced vs to come from farre Countries with our father, to haue receiued it of the King of Achaia, whose worthines fame hath spread ouer the earth. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing séene what you haue shewen in this battell, we both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you, that (although we haue not deserued it) yet wee may receiue it at your hand. The Prince did so affect the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:106"/>
two youths, that he was glad in his soule, that occasion was offred to doe them any pleasure, yet hee would not bereaue <hi>Bembo</hi> of that which hee deserued, saying vnto them, The heauens defend it, that séeing that you may receiue it at the hands of so worthie a Knight, as is that Prince whom you haue named, that you should receiue it of me, to whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath not bin so fauourable. This knowledgement, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Knight, sufficeth (answered <hi>Leobello,</hi> which was the younger of these Princes) to assure my brother &amp; me, that it remaining in your hands, there may happen vnto vs some rest of good fortune, and so wee beséech you to graunt that which my brother hath requested. I would be verie glad (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Lirianaes</hi> louer, and Father to these youthes) that this act might be performed with the solemnitie, which your worth deserueth, and not that I doing it, should wrong these Princes. Why then, we wil come to a composition (said the supposed father to these yong princes) that this knight with the stars, shall giue the order to one of my sonnes, and you, to the other; and this doing, both they, &amp; I, shall be bound to doe you seruice all the daies of our life. Quoth <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> It is very fit, that they receiue it from so worthy a knight, as is he with the stars. And so <hi>Claribel</hi> knéeled downe before his father, who kist his faire chéeke, with as great affection, as if he had knowne him. He put on his Helmet, &amp; pulled down the Beauer, and with his sword he smote him on the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, saying, Arise, valorous Knight, &amp; from hencefoorth shew to the world, the vertue which your good countenance &amp; faire resemblance assureth: the like did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnknown Knight with the stars: and <hi>Leobello</hi> lost nothing by receiuing the sword at his hands: for he might wel say, that hee receiued it of the most valiant Knight that was knowne in the world, in that age.

on his Helmet himselfe, desirous to shew the worth of his person. With angrie countenances they came, the one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other. I beléeue, to haue a sight of this cruel war, made <hi>Apollo</hi> to hasten his iournie: for iust as they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, hee shewed his golden face, with shining Garlands out of the East. Well did the one know the other, being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of the valour which either had shewen to the other: particularly <hi>Rosabel,</hi> who addressed himselfe against him with the Starres: and for this cause they fought with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and would not through want thereof, lose that which otherwise they might bee assured of. Being well in breath, they charged, with the points of their swords about a third part before their Targets, standing firmely vpon their right féete, so néere together, that they might strike with their pummels.</p>
               <p>He with the Stars would haue ioyned with the Prince of Britaine, thinking suddainly to haue ouerborne him: but as the other was more nimble, and expert in the warres, then he; so he changed his foote with a thought, and thrust at him, and with a quicke skip he leapt backwards, giuing him in parting a blow in the thigh, whose bloud bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the blow.

For the nephew of the great <hi>Trebatius,</hi> séeing him so néere vnto him, that hee could doe nothing but close with him, tooke him at some aduantage, and within little threw him to the ground: for hee lifted him from ground, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him a little along the field. Hee with the Starres was mightily ashamed, that hee had receiued the first foyle, and that in strugling: for therein he thought to haue béene too
<pb facs="tcp:13979:107"/>
hard for <hi>Anteus</hi>: and locking with the gentle young man, enraged, he tooke footing, thinking againe to recouer what hee had lost: but that was more then hee could doe: for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting goe their hold, with a strong whéeling about they tooke their weapons. The sonne of <hi>Trebatius</hi> séemed to be most couragious, and so was he with the starres, which made the battell doubtfull.</p>
               <p>It was more apparant betwéene <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> and <hi>Don Clarisel:</hi> for there the aduantage was easily to be séene. The Assyrian with a blowe would haue made an end of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; and so with his sword in both his hands, hee made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> who made shew to stay for him: but knowing the ill successe of such desperate blowes, at the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blow, with a light leap he set himselfe 2. fadome off from him: he so followed his blow, that it made him to fall on his brest vpon the pummell of <hi>Milo</hi> his good sword, whereof he strake a third part into the ground. The <hi>Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crian</hi> lost not that good occasion, who turning to ioyne with him, with his hand he thrust him and made him to returne backe, leauing his sword sticking in the ground, breaking the little chayne. The victorie was in his hands, had not the fayre <hi>Leobello</hi> with his sword in his hand come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them, doubting of the Assyrians life, séeing he had lost his sword. Succour came to eyther part; for of the Gréekes (which better knew the countrey) there came the Princes of Hungarie and Bohemia, and with them those of Fraunce and Spayne, which by the Armes knew the Knight to whose ayd they came, whose valour was much esteemed among the Gréekes: they cried to the two youths that they should hold, thinking that they would haue stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him.</p>
               <p>The braue Spanyard came in such haste, that hee met with <hi>Leobello</hi>: but hee might as well haue encountred a rocke, hee stood so fast, hee made his horse returne 2. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces backwards. Then came <hi>Don Clarus</hi> and his brother, Spanyards, of whom in the first part much account was
<pb facs="tcp:13979:108"/>
made, and with much reason, for their valour deserued it: but in this charge they got very little: for thinking to chase <hi>Leobello</hi> in the behalfe of their Prince, <hi>Claribel</hi> stept close to him and smote him on the top of the Helmet, and this was the first blow that euer the young man gaue with the sword, and was so good, that it smote him to the ground: he stayed for his brother, which came mounted vpon a great horse: but hee quickly lost him, and made the Princes of Hungarie and Bohemia hold them company: he rusheth in among them like <hi>Mars,</hi> and giueth not a blow, but that therewith hee bringeth them on their knées or hands vpon the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leobello</hi> entertained the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> while as the Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian recouered his sword. The braue <hi>Torismundo</hi> alighted seeing his friends on foote, and met with the reputed father of the two youthes, who was a good Knight, but he gat lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: for the Spanyard is one of the most valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the world: hee smote him so, that hee made him stoope, and within a little had ouerthrowne him: he would haue followed him, but the furious <hi>Leobello</hi> holp him, who was neere at hand, putting the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> from him with a strong thrust. The young mans valour made him to wonder, and had hee not bene in such fury, hee had not smitten him: but hauing no respect of any, he smote him such a blow vpon the head, that although it was the first, if he had taken such another, as that, it had made an end of him: for it gaue such a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clappe, that hee knewe not not where hee was. They had aide at hand, for by the woods side came <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> and his sister, with <hi>Argante,</hi> and <hi>Thorisiano,</hi> who séeing their brother <hi>Don Clarisel</hi> (for so was he called) they all came a gallop. <hi>Poliphebus</hi> was in feare of their horse brests but drawing force out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> danger (a thing worthy his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour) they were troubled in such sort with their haste, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Don Celindo</hi> and the Ladie were like to fall on their faces, and to auoyd it, it behooued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to leap from their horses; but <hi>Don Argante,</hi> and <hi>Thorisiano,</hi> who reiued their horses, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred

It is very reasonable (valorous Prince) sayd he with the starres, and I would goe to assist you, were it not to hold my credit and word which I haue giuen to be of their party.

The Ladie was not idle, for shée was one which tought most earnestly, and so before that the Sarafin could vnderstand from whence that blow came, shée tooke him another on the side of the head, which if shee had not ouerreached him, without dout had put him in great danger: for in hitting him in this maner, shée made him to fall so backwards, that within little hee had come to the ground.</p>
               <p>The Pagan was terrible when hee was angrie: for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her which had handled him in that maner, there was no Lion so fierce as he. Hee assailed the Ladie, meaning with that blow to haue felled her.

Now was this Prince cleane out of patience, renouncing his gods, and now séemed all they which were in the field, to be but a few: and taking his sword in both his hands, as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine turned, he smote him athwart the shield: hee smote it from his arme, and descending to his Helmet, hee brought him to deathes doore, for hee laide him sencelesse vpon his horses necke: hee meant to haue assured the victorie, and to haue béene reuenged by the death of such a Knight.</p>
               <p>The most mightie <hi>Dacian</hi> hindred him of his purpose, who as he had the best horse in the world, with a leape hee was with him, when his sword was aloft, hee had no more

time but to giue him a cruell blow athwart the armes, and followed his blow so well, that hee gaue life to <hi>Aristoldo,</hi> of whome the Gréekes stood in great néed, and made him with the force of his, to let fall the sword out of his hand. <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundi</hi> came in so good time, that they had ouerthrown him: for they made the Moore to féele two thrusts, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in his flesh. To his aide came hee with the Starres, wondring at the valour of those Knights. It had béene no great matter, had not the two youthes come: who holding their valour, which fought for little in regard of theirs, all hauing taken horse, they repaired thither where they heard the great noyse.</p>
               <p>The faire <hi>Claribel</hi> met with <hi>Aristoldo,</hi> although that in former time they had béen the greatest friends in the world: but he shewed it not now, for hee smote him vpon the rich Helme, making the bloud spring out at his nose &amp; mouth, and laid him on his horses necke: hee ranne vpon him with his horses brest, and had not the Captaine had a good one, he had cast them both to ground: all this was nothing, for now were come to the battell, those which were borne for the warres, which were <hi>Claridiano, Claramante,</hi> and the faire <hi>Archisilora,</hi> who had mist the way, because that they knew not the Countrie, whose famous arriuall doth well deserue a new Chapter.</p>

The young <hi>Mars</hi> receiued it, but made an ill bargaine: for this Quéenes arme was one of the most famous.

Then came the matrone: and to requite the Knight with the Ladies, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting her shield at her backe with both hands, setled vpon her stirrops, shée gaue a mightie blow, it was one of the best that was giuen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day: for as (at ease) she smote him vpon the highest of the head, shée smote away a little Target, which hee ware behind his Helmet, carrying there with part of his gorget of Maile. Shée returned with a thrust which pierced his flesh. But at vnawares, the furious <hi>Leobello</hi> smote her vpon her precious Helmet: hee smote her downe vpon her Saddle bow. Her louer turned his head about, and séeing his Ladie in such a plight, his furie cannot be described for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no accompt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:111"/>The sonne of <hi>Eufronisa</hi> bare no such armes, as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to receiue the blowes of this Gréeke: for hitting him a full blow on the brest, hee gaue him a maruellous wound, although without danger: hee gaue him another, which within little threw him to the ground. <hi>Brauorante</hi> did much affect this young man, séeing with what courage hee fought, and would haue come iust to his aide, but hee found in his way the piller of Grecia, <hi>Claramante,</hi> so néere him, that hee could doe no good with his Axe at large, and therefore drawing backe his arme, he gaue him a thrust in the middest of his shield, and although it had béene of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond, he had cleft it: for his force was rare, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, the best in the world: hee made both him and his horse to make a stand. All men wondred at the blow, it set him so besides himselfe, that hee had time to retire from him, and fetching his Axe about his head, he reached him a knocke on the side of the Helme: and if hee had giuen him a third, I know not how it had gone with the Pagan.</p>
               <p>Then came the gentle <hi>Claribel,</hi> as fierce as a Furie, with a double blow. The Gréeke thought much of it, and knew not well where might bee contained so knightly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. After him came <hi>Bembo,</hi> for hauing heard the blowes, he well knew what it meant (as it was true) to his friends cost: hee gat little by his comming, for <hi>Claramante</hi> being come to him selfe, and missing the young man, hee fastned the blow vpon the <hi>Ach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was that which the Sarafin more feared, then all those which hee had receiued in his life, for the Axe entred his brest, wounding him mortally: he made no boast thereof, for he with the Starres and <hi>Claribel,</hi> smote him both together, the one vpon the shoulder, the other vpon the top of the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met; they laid him on the Saddle pummell. To the noyse came the famous <hi>Floralisa</hi> with <hi>Camillaes</hi> sword, shée came iust as <hi>Claramante</hi> raised and setled himselfe, and with a course shée smote him vpon the Helmet, it sounded like a

bell, and left him halfe astonied: shée would haue sent him another, but that shée found hard by her, the famous <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundi,</hi> with <hi>Semiramis</hi> her diuelish sword, against whose edge, neither freele nor enchantment had any force. Shée gaue her a backe blow vpon one side of the shield, and smote off the one halfe thereof, with great part of her Uantbrace: to her aide came the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded <hi>Don Clarisel,</hi> desiring to die in the sight of her whom he so dearely loued: and like a Uiper, drawing force, not out of his owne féeling, but from his firme faith, hee smote the Dame vpon the rich Helme, and made her bow downe her head lower then shée would: hee gaue place to <hi>Floralisa,</hi> to be reuenged of the Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is no particular combat, but may bee ended: for now, of the Moores side came <hi>Astorildo,</hi> and <hi>Epirabio,</hi> with the <hi>Calipha</hi> of Siconia, and the King of Giant-land, with foure Giants, all Cousins. They entred, treading the Gréekes vnder féete, and were like to doe much harme: for <hi>Brandusio,</hi> and the Prince of Almaine had aduanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, with those troupes which remained at the entrie into the valley: but they found newly come before them, the mightie <hi>Trasondan, Poliphebus,</hi> and his brother <hi>Rosacler,</hi> with the two couragious Giants, <hi>Brandafidel,</hi> and <hi>Brami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro,</hi> with the gentle <hi>Tifereo,</hi> and the faire <hi>Claridiana.</hi> It was a thing worthie a Romans Theatre, to sée the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters: for the Giants matched themselues the one with the other: it was like as if two ships had met in the middle of the Sea. In this encounter, the Gréeke partie had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for <hi>Brandafidel</hi> (who was one of the most famous in the world) laid his aduersarie on the floore: <hi>Bramidoro</hi> did the like: they had them in chace, and presently many after them: for <hi>Tifereo</hi> had likewise ouerturned <hi>Lindauro</hi>; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little the warre had againe béene new begun: for in a maner, the greatest part of the Princes came afoote, either partie to aide their people. <hi>Brandafidel</hi> was furious when he fought; being angrie, they could fasten few blowes vpon
<pb facs="tcp:13979:112"/>
him: for on foote he was very light, and withdrew himselfe to play his part with his club, wherewith he did things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though lawfull, yet verie pitifull: for there happened to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Giant, which came with <hi>Brundusio</hi>: He hit him but two knocks, and both on the Helmet, there needed no more blowes; for he layd him dead at his féete. <hi>Brundusio</hi> would be reuenged; but it was to méete with his death: for <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midoro</hi> was at hand; and in passing by, with his bat he made him goe vpon his hands. <hi>Tifereo</hi> holpe him, for he stretched him out all along. They left their clubs to repaire to him of Gibia, seeing that he of Zardus was come to gripes with him. They had killed him, had not <hi>Brauorante</hi> ariued: whose comming with <hi>Aristoldo</hi> did not onely rescue him, but also renewed the warre: so as it then séemed much more cruell then at the beginning. The great <hi>Alphebus</hi> after his old maner singled out <hi>Brufaldoro</hi>: for hee had long desired it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since that in the woods of Gréece he would haue robbed his mother. The Pagan refused it not, but rather at his first smote him on the strong and rich helme, and made him auale his head downe to his bosome. The Mauritanian would haue seconded it: but the famous Emperour, which with those blowes was nothing amazed, whéeling his horse a little to one side, made him to lose his blow, and would not let slip occasion, but with all his might he reached him a blow vpon the shoulder, which smote away all his vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace: it went not alone, for hee gaue him another, which put him out of his remembrance. The Gréeke spent so much time in s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>riking him, that he gaue opportunity to <hi>Claribel</hi> to come vpon him with a thrust: it was one of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme blowes that ouer the Gréeke had receyued. His La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die would reuenge it; but she could not find him, for he was like an Eagle; and had vpon a sudden hardly handled the great Tartarian <hi>Zoilo</hi>: hee made a thrust at the Troiane; and had not the Princes of Tharsis and Argentaria bene néere, without doubt <hi>Hectors</hi> heyre had bene in danger. The faire <hi>Sarmatia</hi> was troubled to sée her Troiane in such
<pb facs="tcp:13979:112"/>
estate: and grinding her téeth, she set vpon the youngster: she came so néere, that she could not strike him: the blow did him greater fauour then he deserued: for casting her fayre armes ouer his backe, shee griped him so hard, that shee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed his armour in his flesh, as she tooke him at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares; so was it a small matter to vse him so; and had hee bene any other, shee had pluckt him from his horse. In the chase came the great <hi>Tinacrian</hi> vpon his Rubican: he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be no other then a thunder-bolt, whistling betweene the clowds: he first tooke <hi>Don Argante</hi> to taske, and set him without iudgement vpon the saddle bowe: he stretched <hi>Lindauro</hi> all along vpon the ground; and finding <hi>Don Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindo</hi> néere him, with a strong thrust he set him besides his saddle. <hi>Trebatius</hi> his sonne was neuer séene in such a fury, his fiercenesse made them all to wonder; and had not he with the stars come, he alone had ended the battell in that place: for before that he came, he had ouerthrowne the Prince of Almaine: he leapt after him, holding it to haue bene honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to haue taken him prisoner, accounting him for one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most principall by his rich armour in their campe. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne yong man detained him from his purpose, smiting him at the entring, in the chest of his brest: it is a great hap that he had not kild him, for his sword pierced his armour euen to the skin, and with a little more hee had thrust him in the heart pit. <hi>Luzelaes</hi> louer suffered himself to be hurt with a stab, and séeing his bloud spilt vpon anothers weapons, there was neuer Tiger so fierce as he; for the fleshed Lion is tame in respect of him: for bringing his sword about his head with all his might, he smote him with the stars athwart the Helmet, and made him see them within the same with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of bloud. The Gréekes would faine haue ended these battels, because they knew that therein consisted the strength of their armie, and (they being lost) the victorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them was certaine. But now there was no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: for the Emperour of the Romanes was alreadie entred the wood, with aboue a hundred thousand men.

They all offred him their company: but then to be alone did best fit him, accepting (according as was reason) of their gentle offer: he tooke his way with his Ruvican, speaking first to <hi>Rosabel,</hi> whom he entreated y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should not tell who he was, vntill hee had performed his chalenge. He went directly to the place where he had left the Ladies; but went not long to seeke them: for by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nymphes direction they met presently: they made that day holyday, passing it in reciting what had happened betwéene the Gréekes and the Moores; to the which they determined the next day to send their message.</p>
               <p>Their Captaine was much affected to valiant Knights; and seeing what the two youthes had done, he went to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them; who knowing what he was, desired to kisse his hands, putting off their Helmets, discouering more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane beautie; which strake them which were present with admiration, to sée them so young and so valiant. The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Bembo</hi> imbraced them, saying, It were no reason, that they which haue so good hands of their owne, should kisse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans in the world.

               <head>CHAP. XXII. How the Prince of Tinacria sent a Letter of challenge to the Pagans camp, with leaue from the Emperour of Gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cia, and of what followed thereof.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Magining, faire ladies, that chaptere of loue would be more pleasing vnto you, I haue conceiued so much ioy thereof, that it hath eased me of my paine which I begin to feele, as the cause of my life: &amp; if I intreate of any swéete hope, it is but to deceiue mine owne fraile vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, who as a nomes in loue, is of opinion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there can be no remedie for his griefe. And my paine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me liue euer doubtfull of any good: for although I loue in good earnest, my Lady doth not yet know it: an excuse for that which I endure, not to attribute it vnto other, but rather to mine owne mishap. The valorous <hi>Tinacrian</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth free and at libertie: for if he loue well, hee knoweth that hee is also well beloued. There is nothing in the world so swéet, as is mutuall loue, betweene a Lady &amp; her gallant: for it sufficeth to make him cheerefull, &amp; well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: for to sée himselfe beloued, was the occasion why he sent challenges to the 2. camps by the Nymphs, which he brought. She which went to the Citie, well knowing what she had to doe, stayed vntill all those high Emperours and Kings had made an end of their dinner, and til that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were al come forth into the Hall: &amp; séeing occasion, she entred, clad in such attire as was fit for such a message. At her comming in, she did her duty to such as were there: and addressing her spéeches to the mightie Emperor <hi>Trebatius,</hi> she sayd, Soueraigne Prince, whom in reason the world should acknowledge, confident in thy generositie, I am sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Knight with the Eagle, who knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast granted truce to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moores for 15. daies, although that hée came from farre to serue thée (as all men ought to doe)
<pb facs="tcp:13979:115"/>
he would in the meane time with thy leaue, entertaine the louing gallants, giuing them occasion to shew their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: for in the middest betwéene these two camps, hee will maintaine after to morrow, that the two Ladyes which are come in his companie, are indéed the most faire of the world, and this at all perils of battaile. This is my demaund: and if it please thee that he come, he will doe it; and if not, he will stay vntill the truce be past, to come to thy seruice. This seemed to the Greeke Princes to bee a great presumption in a Knight: and so they desired that the Emperour should giue him leaue to come. The Gréeke Lord himselfe had beene so greatly enamored, that hée would haue gone in person to answere the challenge: but trusting in his sonnes, he sayd, Faire Damsell, I thanke the Knight much for that which he wil do for me, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth that a greater request then this should bee granted, and so you may tell him, that hee may come in safetie: for no man shall offer him violence, excepting such as shal fight in combate with him, which will not fayle to doe it. The Damsell would haue kist his hands for the fauour, saying, Then, Soueraigne Emperour, with your leaue, I will deliuer a message to the Ladyes, which I haue brought for them. Do all that you will, (answered the Emperour.) So she we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t directly to the cloth of estate, where they were, which might be sayd to be a new Paradice of beautie: for they were come forth to recreate themselues, some to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour their Gallants with their looks, which sufficeth, for I would be glad to take it of my Lady, if it might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come to sée her. In séeing the Damsell comming (quoth the gallant <hi>Policena,</hi> daughter to the faire <hi>Venus</hi>) &amp; <hi>Polidolpho</hi> which stood hard by the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Helen,</hi> daughter to the Prince of <hi>Babilon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Persia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bransiniano,</hi> with the fayre <hi>Aurelia,</hi> daughter to the great Tartarian <hi>Zoylo,</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Tigliafa,</hi> thrée Ladyes which did darken the Sunne in the middest of his carriere: they were those, which being but children, gaue hope to be most faire. There
<pb facs="tcp:13979:115"/>
was neuer a one there that passed <hi>Rosabela,</hi> daughter of the fayre <hi>Oliuia,</hi> although she were yonger. All which foure sate hard by <hi>Rosamundi.</hi> Quoth the young Girle, I beleeue that this Knight will challenge vs too. Your Ladiship née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to feare it (quoth the second <hi>Helen</hi>) for where these Soueraigne Ladies are, there may wee liue safe from any defiance. It will end according to the equitie of the cause (quoth <hi>Aurelia</hi>) and not for our beauties. Take no care for that (quoth <hi>Rosamundi</hi>) for there will want no Knights which will take pleasure so goe forth in our behalfe. It is to be doubted (quoth <hi>Policena</hi>) séeing how vnpleasing wee are. By this time was the Damsell come, who knéelde downe before the Empresse of Trapisonda; which stood close by her daughter; shée deliuered the letter to her hands, desiring her to be pleased to read it, because shée was spéedily to returne to the knight, who had sent her. It is a great confidence that that Knight reposeth in those Ladies (said the Empresse) &amp; séeing that my Lord the Emperour hath giuen him leaue, we confirme the same. <hi>Rosiluera</hi> presently read the letter, with great laughter of all the Ladies, imagining that it came for her: it would not haue grieued <hi>Rosamundi,</hi> nor <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisilora,</hi> to haue tried the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues against him: with gratefull hearing, the Ladies gaue eare to the letter, which said thus,</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:116"/>This Knight said, <hi>Rosiluera</hi> is in the right, in making no questions against the Gréeke Ladies, which may also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne without armes for his part, &amp; séeing he hath such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in vs, it séemeth good to me (with leaue of my Ladie the Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi>) to send it him with all the fauour possible, to the end, that through our fault he lose not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of those Ladies beauties, which are in his companie. We passe not for that (said <hi>Aurelia</hi>) for hauing no experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this Knight, it should bee ill done to graunt him so much fauour. <hi>Rosabel</hi> came, to the end that his vnkles businesse might be so handled as he did deserue, and said, If my being suretie for the Knight with the Eagle, gallant Dames, may be a meanes to procure this fauour to be done him. I presently impawn my word. There is no cause to stay from giuing it, said the gracious young <hi>Rosabella,</hi> séeing that my Lord and brother hath taken vpon him the charge of our fame.</p>
               <p>They all laught at the girles spéeches, which was not yet aboue twelue yeares old: for so long time had the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans spent in leuying their troupes. They all went to <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundies</hi> lodging, where <hi>Rosiluera</hi> in all their names wrote to the Knight, &amp; giuing it to the Damsel, shée tooke her leaue with great contentment, leauing them very desirous to sée the Knight. I beléeue, Soueraigne Prince (quoth <hi>Policena</hi>) that you doe better know this Knight then we doe, séeing you haue forced vs to fauour him in such a matter as this. His acquaintance and friendship (answered the gentle Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanian) hath cost me so much bloud, that I stand bound to bee his friend, so long as I liue. And this Soueraigne Princesse <hi>Serinda,</hi> being so much bound vnto his valour, I maruaile that shée intreated not for him. Presently, at the intreatie of the Ladies, hee told what happened when hee first knew him, fighting with the most strong <hi>Astratio</hi> for the libertie of <hi>Serinda,</hi> as in the third booke hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, where they two fell acquainted, concluding such friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as was the greatest in the world: besides, they being so

               <p>Great was the contentment, which the Princes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the gentle answere of the Gréeke Ladies, giuing his nephew many thankes for that which hee had done for him: he presently dispatched another message to the Moores Campe, bearing a Cartel with his challenge. All the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Ladies were in the Emperour of the Romanes his pauilion. The damsel went in, and doing her dutie, séeing so many of whome shée was to aske leaue, shée asked it in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, saying, The high gods, soueraigne Princes, haue you in his kéeping. I am sent hither by the knight with the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, to deliuer a message, which I wil deliuer in few words. The president which was the King of Armenia, bade her to deliuer what shée had to say. Quoth the damsell, My Lord

It is a great boldnesse, but I am to bee excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, hauing iustice on my side, wherewith, and with my wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and horse, from to morrow forwards, I will defend my demaund, swearing the battell, against all the enamoured gallants of your Campe at outraunce.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Old, valorous Ladyes, for now it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that you condole my paine, to the end, that I may depaint what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after this defiance: for the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Apollo</hi> had not throughly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his glittering beames, when in the middle betweene the two campes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared one of the most sumptuous tents of the world, for it was little lesse then the Greeke Palace: it was all of coloured cloth of gold, with greene knots, and many sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Eagles embrodered vpon it; a man could desire no more.</p>
               <p>It was work enough for either armie to behold the fayre tent, imagining (as it was truth) that humane hands had wrought but little vpon it. All the Ladyes of the campe would sée the battell, vpon assurance of the truce. So came they in a Chariot triumphant, drawen by 20. Unicornes, as white as the driuen snow, couered all ouer with rich cloth of siluer. The Ladies came as it behooued for their valour and beautie: for there was no lesse to be seene, then in the Citie, from whence they might sée the Greeke La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Princesses begin to come, which as they were many, so of force they must haue two famous Chariots: there was neuer seene a fayrer shew. There were made by the Emperours commaund, certaine most sumptuous roomes for the Ladyes, couered al ouer with most rich Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopies,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:118"/>
where the Ladyes went vp, inuiting (with their standing so) those of the Campe. Some did it, to sée about them, those which they most loued, which were <hi>Rosilia, Arbolinda,</hi> and the fayre <hi>Eufronis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>That day did <hi>Bembo</hi> lay aside his sad deuice, which hee euer vsed to beare. For <hi>Lupertius</hi> had sent him most rich greene armour, all wrought ouer with Sunnes: there was no goodlier sight in all the field, except the challenge. In his shield hee bore Lady Fortune, as though she procured his good, holding her hand out to him, with these words:
<q>
                     <l>My wheele sometime hath little power,</l>
                     <l>If that loue do please to lowre,</l>
                     <l>And the dame reiect valour.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He had about his necke a blew scarfe, fringed with gold, mounted vpon a roane horse. The Greekes tooke great pleasure to see him comming in so good order: for although hee were an enemie, yet vertue wheresoeuer is beloued. Hee brought with him those, which in all mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were most valiant. There came the Knight with the Starres with his ordinarie deuice, so gallant, that hee gaue them all matter to looke vpon. They stayed but little with him: for looking vpon the two youthes, to whom <hi>Lupertius</hi> had sent new Armours, they were all of the Lyons colour, with much Gold-smithes worke, and so many precious stones, that they could not bee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued.</p>
               <p>The Caparisons for their horses were of the same, with great plumes of feathers in their heads: in both their Shields one deuice, which was this, they were depainted betweene Loue and Libertie, with these words:
<q>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13979:119"/>
                     <l>If sorrow must needes come,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Euerie man affected the two valiant youths. After them came with their old deuices, the fiue brothers of the hidden wood, sauing that <hi>Floralisa,</hi> and <hi>Don Argante,</hi> according to that which they felt, had set in their shields: for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bore Ielousie proper, which was painted like a louer, hauing more eyes then <hi>Argos,</hi> with these words:
<q>
                     <l>No eyes can behold</l>
                     <l>The plagues of this torment,</l>
                     <l>Nor heart but will rent.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The new enamored, whose eyes had made his heart to feele the flame, bore Constancie naturally depainted, with this motte:
<q>
                     <l>No griefe but may be endured,</l>
                     <l>If louing at leysure,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>All the place noted the deuice of these two, although that none of the Greekes knew <hi>Floralisa</hi>: for fearing that the Knight would not fight the Combate with her, she coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all her armour with blew silke. There came the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Epirabio,</hi> so gallant, that hee gaue good hope of him: the like did <hi>Lindauro,</hi> and the most mightie <hi>Aristoldo,</hi> with the Prince of Almany, who came all in gray, with many waues of gold wrought with the hammer, on his armour. The mightie <hi>Brandaso,</hi> who would also shew himselfe affected to Ladyes, came into the field, armed with cleane &amp; wel tempered stéele. The Pagan brought for his deuice, a Lyon, which he in his youth had torn in péeces with his hands, with these words:
<q>
                     <l>What force would worke his smart,</l>
                     <l>Which yeelds himselfe in euery part,</l>
                     <l>Sith the Lyon hath no hart?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There went with him the mightie <hi>Coriandro,</hi> a valiant knight, although hee had ill lucke with the Greeke Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.
<pb facs="tcp:13979:119"/>
At last came in, with a gallant shew and furious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, the two emulators, <hi>Brauorante,</hi> although with no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to fight, and the braue <hi>Brufaldoro</hi>: who as hee so déerely loued his Ladie, so could he not endure the wrong which hee thought was done her. They all repaired to the place where the Moorish Ladies stoode, so faire, that they would make the Sunne to séeme foule in the middest of his course.</p>
               <p>The Knight with the Eagle (quoth the Emperour of Trapisonda) had néede of hands to answere all those which haue presented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues at the Lists: &amp; truly he hath procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with much discretion, to craue fauour at the Gréeke La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hands, for such cruell battels as hee is like to haue; which if he performe with his honour, it shall bee to him the greatest of the world; for the Knights with whome he is to fight, are the most famous vnder the Sunne. Al that which may bee giuen him for fauour (said the gallant <hi>Helena</hi>) hath béene giuen him by the hands of these Princesses: for hauing such a suertie as is the Prince of the great Britanie, what attempt but is assured? They could not procéede in their discourse: for in the place was heard a great noyse, which was, that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> comming forth at one side of his Tent, would shew himselfe to the Greeke Ladies. There was neuer swéeter Musick heard in Gréece, then at his comming foorth, without knowing who made it: and there were many Squibs and fireworkes throwne into the ayre, which gaue great pleasure to the beholders: But much more, when they saw <hi>Poliphebus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Trebatius,</hi> come betwéene two Ladies so gallant, that hee carried eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans eyes with him: his Armes were of the colour of his Tent, set with many Eagles of Gold, so artificially done, and with so many stones of sundrie colours, that the Sunne shining vpon them, no man could behold them, in the middest of his rich shield: whose borders were of most bright shining stones: in the middest betweene two tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Herons, he bare an Eagle, so excellently made as was
<pb facs="tcp:13979:120"/>
wonderfull to behold, and vnder it were written these words:
<q>
                     <l>The Eagles wings he ought to haue,</l>
                     <l>Thereby to mount vnto the skies:</l>
                     <l>From scorching flames himselfe to saue,</l>
                     <l>Or other harme that may arise.</l>

               </p>
               <p>His deuice was wel liked of, and for his presence there were very few but were wel affected vnto him. The ladies (whose beautie &amp; brauery made al the assistants to wonder) came clad all in white, cut vpon coloured Tinsell, and tho cuts set with most fine Rubies: their Gownes were after the Spanish fashion with foure sléeues, one paire straight, and imbrodered with Gold, and the other paire, long and large, hanging downe, seruing onely for ornament: their hayre made vp verie faire, and set with rich stones, so faire, that many in beholding them, fell extremely in Loue: and vpon the top of al, rich Garlands. They came alone: for so would the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> haue it. He bare his Launce himselfe, with his Beauer downe, and with the same armes, which the Nimphes had giuen him, so as no man could knowe him. They we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t directly to those standings where the Gréek Ladies were, whither when he came, making his horse to knéele downe, putting vp his Beauer, with great reuerence, he said,</p>

These Ladies beautie (said the Empresse <hi>Claridiana</hi>) is more worthie, and your valour (Sir Knight) bindeth all to fauour you, although that hee which bringeth so good assurance with himselfe, néedeth no greater fauour then from his owne presence, which is such as assureth the palme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battels, whose end we wish may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

bowed downe his head to his saddle bowe, leauing them all amazed as much at his gallant countenance and good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, as at the brauerie and beautie of the Ladies, which séemed to them to be exquisite. They took their leaue, going directly to their Tent, where they were solemnly receiued with such heauenly musicke, as none could bee better vpon earth. In sight of the campe he was armed, but by whom, it was vnknowne. There was a stately Theatre made for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies, to behold the battell. Upon a great piller they hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Princes shield, bringing an infinite many of Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that those which would but onely iust, should want no Launces for that purpose. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> paced ouer the field vpon his Rubican (a bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There wanted not some in a readines to come into the lists: for <hi>Lindauro,</hi> who yet had not lost <hi>Venus</hi> loue, would there shew it. Ah, he that had so excellent a wit, as might be able to depaint (with contentment to all) those battels, which were the best worth the séeing of any that euer were in the world: for the Pagan which first presented himselfe in the lists, was valiant, and who without question was most enamoured; although he neuer attained to any thing whereby he might perceyue that he was beloued.</p>
               <p>He smote his furious horse with the spars: but with the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> he got little; for he made him with the encounter to take hold of the saddle pummell, for feare of falling. The young Gallant past forth with a braue countenance, and turned his horse vpon the hand, so lightly, as could not bee thought. The Prince came ashamed of his ill successe; and desiring to amend what was past, drawing his sword, with both his handes hee smote the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> vpon the Helme: it sounded like a bell; and the enamoured youth well felt the blowe: but seeing how many and how vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Knights there yet remayned to come, it behoued him to giue a good account of himselfe, or not to bee called the sonne of the great <hi>Trebatius,</hi> repaying him another

The Almaine lost his reynes and stirrops, and was so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himselfe, that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> perceyuing it (trusting to his Rubican) ranne vpon him with his horses brest, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbare them both to the ground; wherein fortune was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vnto him; for as hee was taken so at vnawares, he had no leisure to pull his foote out of the stirrop, and so one leg was vnder his horse, who with the force of the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter died presently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trebatius</hi> his sonne alighted, leauing the whole campe amazed at his valiancie, and went to the Almaine, &amp; holpe him to frée himselfe from his horse, saying vnto him, I will not, sir Knight, that you should lose that for want of a horse, which your valor doth assure you: and so you may end the battell on foote. But he was in so ill taking with his fall, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he was enforced to giue ouer the battaile, and to leaue his shield behind, which much despited <hi>Bembo,</hi> who loued him very much, admiring at that which he with the Eagle had vsed towards him. I beléeue (quoth the fayre girle <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabella</hi>) that my Lord, my brother <hi>Rosabel,</hi> did better know this Knight then me, that hee was so readie to bee his suretie: &amp; séeing wee were scrupulous in giuing him this leaue, it is reason y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we should recompense him with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the better to encourage him against the Captaine of the Moores, who (they say) is very valiant.

The Prince séeing her comming, leapt from his horse, receiuing her with much courtesie, which he shewed to women, more then any other Prince of the world. The Damsel sayd vnto him, Ualorous Knight with the Eagle, my Lady the Princesse <hi>Rosabella,</hi> daughter to the Prince <hi>Rosacler,</hi> commendeth her to you, &amp; séeing the valor which you haue shewne, which shee imagineth to come from the Gréeke Ladies ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, which with such generosity gaue you leaue, she sendeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them &amp; her selfe this Iewell, to the end you should know of what credit your suite is, &amp; how highly your valor is estéemed.

He put it about his neck, in sight of all the campe, which was a wound to the Moores Ladies hearts, to sée him so fauoured, which was enemie to their beautie. The Greeke Ladyes did celebrate the courteous answere of the Knight, who séeing the place cleare, tooke horse, as light as a bird, and taking his place, expected the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of some aduersarie, desirous to make them know their errours.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith Soueraigne praises (most excellent Prince) did all Grecia extoll the noble <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> whose fame reached to the heauens: for in lesse then thrée houres, hee had ouercome thrée of the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Princes in the Moores Campe. And <hi>Brundusio</hi> Prince of Gibia, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to reuenge their losses, with a most gallant shew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted <hi>Luzelaes</hi> louer: there was neuer séene a more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie onset: for before the beholders could imagine it, they were together, making little splinters of their great Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whose trunchions flew out of sight, vp into the clouds. The Pagan lost a stirrop: they turned their horses, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to strike both together with such force, as beat their heads into their bosoms, they strake againe, and againe; and comming to the fourth blow, (not able to endure the force of their strong armes) they laid their heads on the Saddle pummels. It was good for the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> that hee came so well armed: for although that hee did not cut his armour, yet he made his flesh black and blew. The contrarie happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Pagan: for in two or thrée places the bloud began to come forth. <hi>Garrofileaes</hi> sonne was not better chafed of all that day: for séeing how the Moore had vsed him, hee
<pb facs="tcp:13979:122"/>
flung his shield at his backe, (he was neuer wont to doe so, but when as in this maner he was in choler) and tooke his sword in both his hands. I beléeue that he of Gibia was afrayd, and had reason; for comming to strike him, he put many in feare to sée him brandish his sword. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan could not auoyd the blow; for Rubican was so swift, that before hee could be in a readines, the young warriour was with him, and cleft his shield from side to side, and the blow lighted vpon his Helme with such force, that it strake away the one halfe, with a péece of his head, and made him ready to fall. He knew not whether it were day or night: he gaue him a second, and hit him vpon one shoulder; it carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away the poldron and vauntbrace: all the camp thought that hee had done the like by his arme; and the Moore to saue himselfe from falling, tooke hold of his horses necke; yet he recouered himselfe, and more fierce then a Lion, he threw his broken shield to the ground; and taking his sword in both hands, hee set vpon the Prince, who lifting vp his sword and shield, receyued the blowe vpon both; and as the edge of his was so excellent, it cut the Moores in two pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, making him to lose the greatest part of the force of the blowe. This notwithstanding, hee strake him with the rest vpon the Helme and Shield, hurling him downe vpon the saddle pummell: hee saw the starres in his Helmet, and much bloud gushed out at his eares and nostrils. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan flung at him the rest of his sword, with such force, as if it had béene shot out of a Culuerine, and as hee raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, it smote him on the middest of the brestplate, such a blow, as smote the best part of the wind out of his bodie. And as he saw him thus troubled, valuing himselfe equall to him in strength, hee closed with him, and had hee beene any other then the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> hee had pulled him from his horse: but it seemed to him that he met with a rocke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trebatius</hi> sonne recouered his breath, and setting vpon the Moore (as he was stronger then he) he pluckt him from
<pb facs="tcp:13979:123"/>
his Saddle, but could not hold him for waight: for hee was a bigge man, and so hee was constrained to leape with him to the ground, where, before he could recouer him self, with his dagger he had almost let out his soule: for he wounded him deadly, and so left him being somewhat wearie (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though beholding his Ladie so faire and so pleasant, and all the rest of the Gréeke Ladies, which ioyfully beheld him to sée his rare valour) with a skip he recouered his saddle, their beauties reuiuing his wearied spirits.</p>
               <p>The most strong <hi>Astorildo</hi> scarcely suffred him to take his launce, when he came armed in skie coloured armour, with Death in his shield, painted so at life, that the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship was pleasing, although the worke were not so. This frée Batchelour loued <hi>Eufronisa</hi> so much, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that hee playnely saw shee loued him not, yet hee neuer left to loue her vntill afterwards, as shalbe declared. Round about Death were written these words:

                     <l>For shee's with me at bed and boord,</l>

               <p>The Lady knew well how dearely this Prince did loue her: but there is no greater griefe to one beloued, then not to be able to helpe, nor fayne any fauour.

glad of his good encounter, and would haue giuen the first blew, bearing his Shield more forward then was reason; but it happened accordingly: for the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was more nimble then hee, who crossing his Sword, bore by the blow, and passing by with his Rubican, gaue him a knock athwart the Helmet, on the right side, and made him to hold his necke at one side. Hee returned at one side with a thrust, which put him from his Saddle, and had he knowne so much, he had ouerthrowne him. <hi>Rosamundies</hi> brother recouered, being ashamed to see himselfe in such a case, and being in breath, hee entred, not knowing his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies strength, and before that they had taken good hold of their swords, he suddenly smote him vpon the rich Helme. It seemed (according to the sparkles which flew out of it) that he had smitten vpon a fine flint stone: and the yong man shewed some forgetfulnes in his saddle, making the Moore more carefull to come with another: hee gaue it him vpon one side of the Shield, and beat it to his Beauer, with such force, that it made him hold his head backwards. Now was choler mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to the highest degrée, and in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were méere madnes to fight with him: for taking his sword in both his hands, he would haue bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Diamonds to péeces: there was no defence in the shield, nor in the Armour, although enchaunted, nor in most pure stéele: for the one his arme breaketh: and the other, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient temper of the sword cutteth, that except <hi>Rosamundies</hi> and <hi>Rosabels,</hi> there was not such another in the world: it smote away a corner of his shield, and the sword lighted on the shoulder: it tormented him so much, that hee could not beare the wayght of the shield; and so hee let it fall, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the yong man opportunitie to come vpon him with a thrust: and had he borne his arme a little more euen, he had thrust him thorow, from side to side, and therewith made him to féele it in his flesh.

there was no speech but of his rare valour. I feare me (said the Emperour <hi>Trebatius</hi> to him of <hi>Tribisonda</hi>) that the Princes of the Campe will encurre some danger, with this furious Knight.</p>
               <p>I am of that opinion (answered the sonne) although I assure your Maiestie, the courage which those thrée knights shewed, (which were, that Knight with the Starres, and the two new Knights) made mee to wonder, and I greatly desire to sée them tried with him. That will quickly be seene, (answered the Father) for as he layeth about him, there are few within the Lists to resist his arme (as it was true:) for turning againe to behold the battell, the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was apparant of <hi>Tinacrian</hi> his side, although that the other by defending and offending himselfe so well, deserued the name of valiant, notwithstanding that hee should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ouercome: for now they said it was no disgrace to be so, by such a Knight as that was: for the gods had not reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to themselues any greater valour, then they had infused into him.

And so caring for nothing but to end the battell, hee griped the Pagan so hard, that he knew not where he was; and would also with a blow haue ended the fight: for taking his sword in both his hands, hee made towards his enemie; he made many afraid, to sée him come with such furie, assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him at one side. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> would haue bettered it: but it was like to haue béene to his owne dammage; for the Moore was subtill, and perceiuing that hee warded not his head, he gaue him the greatest blow that euer he had smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: hitting him at one side, hee beat his Helme round, and made him to lose part of his sight, casting out much bloud: notwithstanding all which, he was stil very heedfull, which in such extremities, was that which did assure him of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If your fauour were euer disagreeable, faire Ladies, sayd the Empresse <hi>Briania,</hi> to the yong Ladyes, in my opinion it is now: for with this comming of the aduersarie, all the companie doth mutter, doubting of your Knight.

They had not stept a foot from the place, when they heard a great noyse in the field, which was, that the one ranne at the other, with a greater swiftnes, then an arrow flyeth out of a bow. The Pagan was extreme strong: but hee met with one which in fighting renewed his courage: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to encounter in the cariere, their Launces flew into small splinters, and <hi>Thorisiano</hi> hardly escaped falling, for he was driuen to seize on his horse neck, without knowing what hee did. <hi>Luzelaes</hi> gentle louer was somewhat trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, which was well perceiued by the assistants, whereby

The Greeke neuer receiued a greater blow: for hee smote him on the brimme of the Helmet, and with a little more had stricken it from his head, making him bow lower then he would haue done: and before he could recouer himselfe, he gaue him a sore thrust, and hit him luckily in the ioynt of the vaunthrace, and was the first that dyed his sword in the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The rest (which remained) freezed in his bodie, and roring within himselfe, more fiercely then a furious Tiger, he ranne vpon <hi>Thorisiano.</hi> Had <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe seene him come with that furie, he would haue beene afraide of him.</p>
               <p>There was no steeled shield, nor plankes of fine steele, but all was too little against the furie of the <hi>Tinacrian.</hi> Hee strake away his shield, and it was a great chance, that hee had not done as much by his arme: the blow passed to his Helmet, with such force, that it made it flye from his head, breaking the buckles, leauing all his face bloudie, which came out at nose and eyes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with was heard a great shout in the field, crying, The Moore Ladyes Champion is dead.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> séeing him so fayre, and so amazed,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:125"/>
was mooued with compassion, and to doe that which he neuer did, which was, to hold his hands: for if he had stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him againe, it had been the last battaile that euer that Prince had fought. But he stayed to let him take breath; &amp; when hee was fully recouered, making himselfe readie for his defence, he sayd vnto him, I would not, sir Knight, that your great mind should bee any occasion of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, for which I should bee sorie: you are wounded and disarmed; the best course will bee, to giue euer the battaile without farther contention.</p>
               <p>The vnknowne <hi>Thorisiano</hi> was of good behauiour, and séeing his gentle offer, hee sayd, I am verie sorie, sir Knight, that by so many wayes you haue the victorie of mee: but séeing the heauens haue so ordained it, all is for the best, and which best fitteth mee. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> tooke his answere verie kindly, calling to his Squire for the Helmet which he gaue him, saying, I wil not that your Shield remaine with mee, as a signe that you are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but for a token that I am yours. The courteous speeches of the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did greatly winne the hearts of all those which were in the field. The yong man went forth of the Lists, of whom was made great account for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his person.</p>
               <p>There was made a great noyse in the campe: for <hi>Don Argante</hi> had taken the place with so angry a countenance, that all men perceiued with how great furie hee came. All this was nothing to mooue the <hi>Tinacrian.</hi> For with greater mildenesse then in such a case was requisite, hee went to the place where the Launces were, and there hee chose a great Launce: and putting vp his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to take the ayre, and to wipe away the bloudie sweate, (for neuer did any Knight endure so much in so little time) hee encouraged his Rubican, and giuing him the spurre, hee became as fresh as the wind, when it commeth foorth of his darke dungeons, and then with a wonderfull and incredible swiftnesse hee made towards

the disguised louer. They met with so great noyse, that if two great Carricks had met in a rough sea, they could haue made no greater. The Fenician with the force of the encounter, lost his horse reynes, but he quickly recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them: they turned their horses with such a grace, that <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, from your beautie, faire Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, springeth his valour which he hath shewen, quoth the Princesse, and let vs see how he fareth with him in the gréen scarfe, who in my opinion is valiant. The one tooke his course more swift then thought, against the other. They met, and made a fearefull noyse at the breaking of their Launces, whose splinters flews out of sight, they entred so farre into the region of the ayre.</p>
               <p>They were both couragious: and so they returned, the <hi>Fenician</hi> hauing lost both his Stirrops, which he so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recouered, that it was scarcely perceiued. The <hi>Tinacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> presuming of his Rubican, would medes make a proude attempt, but his hope failed him: for this louer was one of the most readie men in the world, &amp; in this case would rather dye, then bee ouercome. For as the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> approached (putting his horse aside, hee made him to lose his blow, giuing meanes to <hi>Argante</hi> to smite him as he passed by, a mightie blow backwards, making him to lay his brest on the Saddle pummell. He hastened after him, and both together met with such force, with their Shields and Helmets, that both of them without any
<pb facs="tcp:13979:126"/>
power to auoyde it, fell together to the ground. The <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrian</hi> fell vpon his feete, although so troubled, that whilst hee was in that passion, the <hi>Fenician</hi> had time to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but so brused with the fall, that hee much douted of the battaile. But hee was so couragious, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he supplyed that imperfection, and on foote, held himselfe sufficient to giue battaile to <hi>Hercules.</hi> The battaile was worthie to bee seene by such persons: for both their dexterities were such, as made all the beholders amazed. But it was quickly seene, that the Greeke had the better: for (as it hath beene alreadie sayd) hee had the aduantage of all men. His aduersarie would haue closed, to haue wrestled with him, hoping thereby to haue gotten ground. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> was well breathed, and had his sword with the poynt forwards, which the Greeke crossed, meaning to beare by the blow: but hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his enemies meaning: for hee was not well fitted to that ward, when letting fall his Shield and Sword, hee closed with him so suddenly, that <hi>Poliphebus</hi> could not helpe himselfe with his armes. This Louer tooke so good hold of him, that he raysed him from the earth, and had he bin any other then <hi>Garrofileaes</hi> sonne, he had layd him all along vpon the ground, getting great part of the Lists vpon him: whereat the people made so great a noyse, that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> became as fierce as a Basiliske, and taking footing, hee recouered all that hee had lost.</p>
               <p>Thus they struggled together ouer the field, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselues out of breath, vntill that at last, the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> holding himselfe disgraced, with a round wheeling about, layd him all along vpon the ground, where, in despight of him, (although that hee therewith was more troubled, then hee had beene all the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) he made him leaue his Shield for a remembrance of his ouerthrow: which all men did so admire, that they knew not what to say, seeing that braue Knight ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, who was more furious then a Lyon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:127"/>The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> went into his Tents, to take something of the Nymphs, to refresh him of his wearines, which <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelaes</hi> aunt had giuen them. He stayed but a little, for now the Sunne beganne to withdraw his light, and already was come into the Lists.

The Assyrian was borne backe in his Saddle, with the force of the encounter, although so little, that it was scarcely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but they rather sayd (as it was true indeede) that hee was the most valiant of them all, which had entred into battaile with the Prince of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inacria. They returned with an excellent grace, and with their strokes, each of them bowed downe to the Saddle. They seconded them with others, which with their bloud bore witnesse of their valour.</p>
               <p>The Assyrian was skilfull, and wore an excellent Sword, although that against the Greeke Lyons Armor, the goodnesse thereof serued to small purpose. And so the furie of the battaile was referred to the strength of the arme, striking him so cruelly, that all his flesh was blacke and blew.</p>
               <p>The Assyrian escaped no better cheape: for his armour could not defend him, but that the bloud came forth in sundrie places, not without some greefe to <hi>Floralisa,</hi> who knowing how much that Prince loued her, shee could not choose but loue him againe, and bee sorie for his hurts: the sight of his bloud did redouble his strength. Wherefore taking his Sword in both hands, he set vpon the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> who could not auoyde the blow, which came with such furie, that it made him set one hand to the ground: hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke him with another, which made him set the other to ground, to keepe him from falling downe-right.</p>

The Assyrian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented him, setting one knée to the ground, letting the thrust passe ouer his head: and therewithall thrusting out his arme, he smote him on the left legge. The Greeke bescarde, thought that he had surely lost it, the blow was so terrible: and drawing it after him, he became as fierce as a hungry Lyon, and with both hands smote the Assyrian such a blow vpon the Shield, that it cut away a péece thereof, wounding him somewhat in the shoulder: and therewith closed with him, fearing (because it was almost night) that hee should not ouercome him by day light; which would haue much gréeued him. They came to catch that catch may, where was a terrible struggling: but as the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> led For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by the fore-locke, hee made him hold companie with the rest: yet he went out of the field with double honour, so much extolling the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> that his fame passed the cloudes. Into the place came one of the most choyse knights in all the fields, he was armed in blew, set with hearts of gold, so well and so artificially, that it was very pleasing to behold. In the middest of the Shield, which was of the same colour that his armour was, he bore Fortune depain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as if she with her hand raysed him from the earth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with small contentment, with this writing:

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:128"/>There was no man in that place, but tooke pleasure in that small shew, which fortunes Knight had shewed: for so they all called him, who comming to the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> Tent, and knowing his beloued <hi>Rosaluira,</hi> there is no griefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that which hee felt, when hee saw that it was for her, that this Knight fought these combats, and that shee tooke pleasure therein. The disease of iealousie touched him, and seeing that no man came into the Listes, spurring his horse, he entred, all men wondring at his good countenance. <hi>Poliphebus</hi> made more accompt of him, then of any of the rest past, being much delighted in beholding his good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, perswading himselfe, that he should accordingly be verie strong. With a slow pace bearing his launce vpon his arme, the mightie <hi>Tinacrian</hi> went towards him: and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp his Beauer, séeing that hee was not of the Moores Campe, he said,</p>
               <p>Ualorous Knight, in my Cartel I challenge onely those which are in the Campe, defending the beautie of the Moore Ladies, against her which commaundeth my soule, and so séeing that you are none of them, I cannot enter into the combat with you. This made him more hautie, to heare the mild reasons of the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> gessing that in déede it was for feare, and so he answered him, For many causes I may haue the combat against you: for I assure you, that in the Campe is that whereto I owe most dutifull loue, and the like in your Citie, so as I may well fight with you. I doe beleeue it, aunswered the <hi>Tinacrian.</hi> But yet, except you maintaine the beautie of the Moore Ladies, I am not to fight with you, these fifteene dayes, and then there wil want no occasion for you and me to méete. It may not bee endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that I should goe forth of these Lists, without making you know the errour which you vphold, and although that I may not shew you my Ladie, which is here present, and that you are not worthie to maintaine such a challenge for her, I doe challenge you to fight presently. The yong man was so much displeased herewith, that hee was about to
<pb facs="tcp:13979:128"/>
turne his horse, and had done it, but for displeasing those of the Campe, who attended to fight, and said vnto him, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought, that by vsing you courteously, I should haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you occasion, to shew such pride: but because I will not deferre the reuenge, let vs goe to the Iudges, and they shal say, whether that I may enter into this single combat with you or not, hauing onely challenged the Princes of the Campe.</p>
               <p>All the Iudges, which were foure Kings, said, that hee could begin no battel without leaue from the ladies. Stay, presumptuous Knight, said fortunes Knight, for I will goe to demaund it; for your death doth as much import me, as my owne life. He went to the proud Chariot where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were, where doing a slight reuerence, hee said, Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princesses, seeing the great valiancie of the knights which were appointed to be of your partie, and for that you haue reposed this matter in their hands, I haue not presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to intrude to bee of so valorous a number, but by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way I hope to let you know, how much in the world there is due vnto you, and thereupon I haue de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The most strong <hi>Bembo</hi> drue néere, to heare the Knights Ambassage: to whome (when the Empresse of the Romanes saw him) shée said, This Knights request, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it concerneth you, is to be answered according to your liking, whereupon all these Ladies and my selfe will stand. The pride wherewith he answered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courteous <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> had almost angred him, &amp; thinking that hee would giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of himselfe, he said, There is no more to bee said, but that I may goe with your good leaue: for I shal stand in néed thereof. The Pagan humbled himselfe vnto the Ladies,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:129"/>
although not to <hi>Bembo,</hi> whereat he was not a little offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And returning to the Gréeke, he said with a loud voice, that all those which were in the place might heare it: Goe, to, you cowardly Knight, the Ladies desire to sée how deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your presumption will cost you. At the least, if pride may beare it (answered the <hi>Tinacrian</hi>) there was neuer seene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie more valiant then you. Let the battell begin presently, wherein I will shew you better hands, then you doe mee a tongue.</p>
               <p>The Iudges stayed them, saying, that after Sunne set, a particular combat was not to bee allowed, and therefore they were to stay vntill the morrow. Let it bee as it shall please you, answered Fortunes Knight: for I neuer was in any Countrie in my life, where combats were admitted with so many conditions. He went from the Lists and the Campe also, because he would not bee knowne, before that battell were ended: for you shall vnderstand, that it was the most strong <hi>Lindoriano,</hi> who knowing in Tinacria, that they had stollen away his Ladie <hi>Rosiluira,</hi> went to séeke her, vntill that in Niquea, hee remembred to come to the aide of his Father the Souldan: for where there were so great assemblies of men, hee might peraduenture heare of her: and his fortune brought him in so good time as this: and although that he were one of the most courteous knights in the world, yet iealousie did so torment him, that it made him shew his pride.</p>
               <p>Those in the sumptuous Chariots, came to salute the Gréeke Ladies, betwéene which past many discreete spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the great <hi>Trebatius</hi> inuiting them to the Citie, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the Truce.

               <p>With great ioy the Ladies receiued him, passing the rest of the night in pleasant discourses, although the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> were so angrie with the Knight of Fortune, that he longed to haue him by the eares. <hi>Arbolinda</hi> desired nothing so much, as the day, because shee would send a message to the Prince of <hi>Tharsis.</hi>

The faire Gréeke Ladies came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, as well with beautie as with Knights: for all the best of the Citie came with them. They tooke their stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, attending the comming of the Ladies of the tent, the which were clad all in gréen cut vpon Cornation, so faire, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therewith they did assure the palme of victorie to the knight with the Eagles; who mounted vpon his mighty horse. came armed at all péeces in gréene Armour, with so many artificiall knots, and such aboundance of pretious stones, that more could not be wished for: hee bare in the middest of his shield his vsuall Eagle, so excellently well drawne, that it séemed to be aliue, and had changed the inscription: for by the Herons he had this motte:
<q>
                     <l>Well may firme affection,</l>
                     <l>Which is fixt and will not start,</l>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:130"/>The Gréeke Ladies were much delighted with the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrians</hi> pleasant deuice, who doing reuerence vnto them, with a great Launce in his hand, expected the comming of his enemie, who was not slacke in comming into the lists, armed with his strong Armour: and without speaking one word, séeing his beloued <hi>Rosaluira</hi> clad in the same colours as the Knight was; as malicious as a serpent, he made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him as swift as the wind. The two famous warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours brake their Launces into small sticks, although the Pagan in the encounter lost one stirrop, with a foule backe bending in his saddle: Our Prince did likewise double some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in his, but it was so little as could hardly be seene. He was so earnest and so cholericke, that he did not sée the time to bee reuenged according as hee desired; but spurring his horse, he passed so far forwards, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could giue no blow to the purpose: which the warlike Moore perceyuing, gaue him (before that he could cleare himselfe from him) so huge a blowe athwart the Helme, that it made his téeth chatter in his head; and comming with another with no lesse force, he smote him in the middle of the shield; which although he could not pierce for the finenesse of the mettall, yet he bore it against his head, adding more payne to the former, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to forget himselfe: and with the third he set vpon his horses necke.</p>
               <p>All men wondred at the fiercenesse of the Moore; but much more at the angry lookes wherewith <hi>Garrofileas</hi> son turned to sée himselfe so ill intreated. Hee expected no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in his shield, which he threw at his backe, and as an enraged Knight, he set vpon him of Niquea.</p>
               <p>Euery body was afrayd, and he (as strong as he was) was afrayd; for raysing himselfe in his stirrops, hee gaue him one of the most cruell blowes that had bene giuen in all those battels: for hee smote him off a great corner of his shield, &amp; the terrible sword falling vpon his left shoulder, left all that side disarmed and sore wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and before he could fit himselfe again, he gaue him a thrust, but it was sidelong:
<pb facs="tcp:13979:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was great hap that hee had not nayled the one side to the other, but it carried away the side of his brest-plate, &amp; part of his shirt of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> shewed courtesie to many men, but this Louer had much offended him, and so séeing him in that taking, trusting much to his Rubican, he meant to end the battell, by treading him vnder his horses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this yong man, who had béene in many fights, before he could come at him, made his horse to bound, making him to misse of his cruell intent: and so he passed so farre forwards, and with such furie, as made many to laugh, although hee were none of them; who returned with greater furie, then the hungrie Lion into the heard. They both together strake vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their rich Helmete, and saw within them the cleare skie, when it is most starrie. They doubled their first blowes, making their blood to beare record of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of their armes: if they had giuen the third, I beléeue, that with their liues they had ended the sport: but they both withheld, entring like skilfull men of warre. The Niquean his sword sped best, because that his enemie striking aloft, and finding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, letting fall the point of his sword, hee gaue him a proud thrust beneath his brest-plate, and bare away more then a hundred Mailes of his shirt, with part of his thigh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trebatius</hi> his sonne ranne out of his wits, when he felt himselfe hurt in the thigh: hee cared not for such preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as men doe vsually make: for he suddenly hurled at him, with a mightie blow vpon the Helme, and made it cleane to his head, giuing him a shrewd hurt: hee came vpon him with an other, which put him quite besides himselfe, and with better heede then before, he closed with him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being any way able to defend himselfe, hee pluckt him from his Saddle, leaping with him to the ground, where the Pagan séeing the danger wherein hee was, held the <hi>Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crian</hi> fast, where they began a dangerous wrestling, with great quantitie of bloud falling from either of them. It made all men to admire, to sée how long they did endure the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fight, with such force and obstinacie, with a fierce plucke, the vnseised falling one from another, with great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all that were present, holding the Knight of Fortune for couragious, seeing hee could so long make his part good against the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> who (thinking that his long stay would bee noted for cowardise) began to presse his enemie with such force, that he made him to shift from side to side, being almost out of breath; but he defended himselfe so wel, as purchased him great credite, but it lasted but a little: for within three houres after the battell began, the aduantage did plainely appeare on the <hi>Tinacrians</hi> side. Hee perceiued it, being willing to shorten the battell, which was likely to haue beene to his owne hurt: for the Moore being well aduised, séeing him comming close, stayd for his comming, and before that he could deliuer his blow, he gaue him one, which made him put his hands and knées to the ground. There was neuer any Knight séene in such a chafe as was the <hi>Tinacrian</hi>; for rising againe vpon his féete, hurling his sword about his head, he gaue him athwart the Helmet, a terrible blow, which made him goe backwards ready to fal: he holpe him forward with two thrusts one after another, shaking with anger: but he felled him, and then more light then a Bird he set vpon him, bidding him to yeeld, who for feare of death, and in hope to bee reuenged in the field bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, yéelded, with such feare to the rest which remayned, as is incredible; for now there was no talke but of his great valour.</p>
               <p>Many sayd that it was <hi>Claridiano</hi>; for he had bene long missing from the Gréeke Court: for of the rest of the Gréeke Princes there wanted not one. The Prince was neuer so wearied in any battell as in this: wherefore to bee cured of his hurts, as otherwise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o rest himselfe, he speedily went into the Tent where the Nymphes were, who very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cured him, which studyed nothing else but to giue him content in all things.</p>
               <p>Hee againe came forth out of the Tent, whereat they
<pb facs="tcp:13979:132"/>
wondred more then at his battels: for according to the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse of his countenance, it séemed as though he had done nothing. He chose him a great Launce, wayting for him which would next come, which fayled not; for the braue <hi>Celindo</hi> tooke the matter in hand, who was knowne to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by his Armes.</p>
               <p>Of this battell many were doubtfull, imagining that the vnknowne Prince was more couragious then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréek. They made one at another as swift as the wind, at which time there was a great rumour in the campe, about know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Knight of fortune: for the Souldan his father, seeing him so sore hurt, would not that they should proceed with those battels any farther, but that they should renew the warre, being very desirous to be reuenged for all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and had not <hi>Bembo</hi> bene present, without doubt it had bene so, who saw that therein he should hazard his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which he dissembled. The wise <hi>Lupertius</hi> cured him, but could not imagine what Knight that should bee which was so couragious and valiant: for the wise Lady had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prouided for her Nephew, (for so she tooke him) to end these aduentures: who spurring his good horse Rubican, the Souldan being now turned to behold them, they met in their cariere with so great noyse, as though two great rocks had met. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> encountred him so luckily in the middest of the Beuer, so as he disarmed his head, and made him to misse the shocke. He returned againe vpon him, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the successe of that blow for excéeding good fortune: and before that hee could drawe Quéene <hi>Iuliaes</hi> precious sword, with his hee had giuen him two blowes one after another, which was a thousand to one, but that he had killed him, hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him athwart the Helme, without touching the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, where a great péece was gone.</p>
               <p>The enamored young man returned as fierce as a Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liske, and with his rich sword, smote the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> vpon the Helmet, which was as much as if hee had smitten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

shake like an Aspen leafe: he returned with another so soon, that before that he could defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d himself, or set himself in any good order to fight, he had againe striken him in the same place, and made him bow downe his head to the horses necke. There was neuer séene a readier Knight, then the Sonne of <hi>Meridian,</hi> who séeing the yong men somewhat pes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They now care no more for defence, but ioyning their horses close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as though they smote vpon Anuilles, so did these war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours vpon their Helmets, amazing all that behold them.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the campe (quoth the king of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and Grandfather to the Prince) is of a mightie strength, but I beleeue that no man can compare with the Knight with the Eagle: And had I not séene his face, thereby assured that it is not <hi>Claridiano,</hi> I should haue thought that it had beene the same: for I neuer saw man so like him, in lordly grace, and comelinesse in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, as hee is. Your highnesse saith truth, answered the great <hi>Zoilo,</hi> and I beleeue that the Pagans haue met with one, who will giue them inough to doe. I expect nothing, (quoth the fayre <hi>Archisilora</hi>) vntill the two youths come in: for men of greater courage the world contayneth not.</p>
               <p>The warriours lost no time, which being out of breath, were yet more furious then the raging sea. It séemed vnto the vnknowne <hi>Macedonian,</hi> that hee spent much time in
<pb facs="tcp:13979:133"/>
that battaile, and the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> thought no lesse. It séemed also that they agreed in one: for lifting vp their swords, they smote so great blowes, that cleane without any feeling, they fell vpon their horses neckes. <hi>Garrofileaes</hi> sonne within a while came againe to himselfe: hee was neuer woont to charge at aduantage, but now hee was so blind with passion and furie, that he forgate himselfe, carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with desire to ouercome: and so seeing his enemie, who as yet was scarcely come to his remembrance, with two iumpes he was with him, iust as he came to himselfe; yet he could not strike him, but tooke him at such aduantage, that hee pluckt him out of his Saddle, giuing him so great a fall against the ground, that he could hardly rise, he was so sore brused therewith.</p>
               <p>All the Pagans campe was verie sory for <hi>Don Celin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> his mishap. <hi>Luzelaes</hi> Louer leapt after him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he knew where he was, he gaue him two blowes one after another, which put him past all remembrance, leauing him breathlesse vpon the ground, taking from him the best Shield that euer hee got, and was glad in his soule, that he had so ended the battaile.</p>
               <p>Much did those foure shining Lampes of beauty, extoll the valiancie of the <hi>Tinacrian.</hi> Let vs attribute it, quoth the fayre <hi>Policena,</hi> to our fauour: for it is not possible that it should come elsewhere. He would make a new challenge hereupon, sayd the fayre <hi>Aurelia</hi>: for I rather beleeue, that it procéedeth from the Ladies which hee bringeth in his companie, who are endued with no lesse beautie then courtesie, in fauouring so warlike a Knight. Well may hee bee called fortunate, sayd the fayre Iewish <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timisa,</hi> seeing that they striue to giue him contentment, who are able to giue and take it away, in despight of loue it selfe, There remaineth yet (fayre Ladyes, quoth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly enamoured <hi>Rosaluira</hi>) so much for him to doe, that in my opinion, this may be referred to the end of all these battailes. She sayd this in regard of <hi>Bembo,</hi> whome she
<pb facs="tcp:13979:133"/>
loued with her soule. The proude attempt of <hi>Floralisa</hi> put them from this matter, who séeing her brother ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, there was no Uiper that shewed it selfe so mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. This Lady had a most delicate horse: for in his course he would haue outrunne euen thought it selfe. Shee gaue him the spurre, who passed his carriere swifter then any Eagle, and at their meeting made a greater noyse, then when a great high built house talleth to the ground: they passed with an excellent grace the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>There was no man among the Gréekes that knew the Lady, for shee came disguised, for feare that the Knight should refuse the battaile against her. And hereupon was much suspicion among them, who this might be, séeing it was the first that matched the yong man in the carriere. The Lady was of a mightie courage: for if <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe had béene in the field, she would not haue refused him in the single combat, with that Lords sword, which was the Troians greatest enemie. Shee made towards the Greek so spéedily, that it wan his good will, although hee much felt the blew: for in receiuing it, it made him bow downe as low as his Saddle. The Lady lost no opportunitie; for shee was one that vsed all diligence: and so, before that the Gallant could recouer himselfe, shee, which lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him farre better then her owne soule, gaue him a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               <p>O strange effects of loue! The warlike Damsell entred with her shield somewhat farre from her brest, and came so neere to him, that before that he could deliuer his blowe, shee gaue him so strong a thrust, as had almost set him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his saddle, and made him to lose the halfe of his stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. The Lady gat hereby, otherwise it had gone hard with her; for with that little which hee gaue her, hee made her to sée a thousand stars vnder her faire browes, and troubled her so with the blow, that thereby he gat meanes suddenly to giue her another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:134"/>He smote her crosse the Helme, and smote her so much to one side, that he had almost ouerthrowne her to the ground.</p>
               <p>There was neuer any Dunce like her, for she plyed the yong man so well, that shee put the battaile a thousand times in doubt, which his Lady gaue him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand for she carryed her selfe so in her standing, as though the blowes which he receiued vpon his armour, had pierced to her heart. The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> perceiued it, and imagining as it was, hee charged the Daughter of <hi>Meridian</hi> in such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, as made all the assistants to wonder. The Ladies haue made some signe to that Knight (sayd <hi>Venus</hi>) for the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse wherewith he set vpon his aduersarie, can proceede from no other cause: for nothing doth so much encourage warriours, as the fauour of their Ladies. The second <hi>Venus</hi> sayd not so, without reason: for hauing seene his Ladyes countenance, hee was so grieued, that hee would that that Knight had beene <hi>Mars.</hi> But for all that he could doe, the Lady defended her selfe so well as could bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> entred like a master at the warres, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at his pleasure to haue giuen her a great blow, bearing his sword aloft: but the warlike Matron vnderstood his pretence, and suffering him to come neere to her, with an excellent quicknesse shee foyled his ward, and with her sword in both hands, shee gaue the Prince vpon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, one of the most cruell blowes that euer hee receiued in his life: for falling vpon his horses necke, the bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to spout out at his mouth and eyes. There came a cold sweate all ouer those 2. Ladyes, when they saw their <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebus</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taking. But that being past, there was neuer any Lion so furious as he shewed himselfe. For very despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately he flung his Shield at his backe. There were few in the place but were afraide of his angrie countenance: and gnashing his téeth, he spurred his angrie Rubican, and was so soone with her, that she had no time to defend her: for he smote her vpon the rich Helme so aswash, that he could not
<pb facs="tcp:13979:134"/>
pierce it, yet he brake all the riuets on that side: which the yong man well perceiued, and giuing her another, that the bloud sprung out, hee set hand to her Helmet, and with a touch pluckt it away, leauing her couered with a fine Cawle of gold. All the companie was stricken with admiration, when they perceiued that shee was a woman. The Queene of <hi>Lira</hi> knew her, and doubting that <hi>Poliphebus</hi> would haue vsed her discourteously, she would haue gone down to entreate him to giue ouer the battaile, for the great loue which she bore her, euer since they had beene together in Tinacria, as is aforesayd: But the Greeke was so grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, considering how much loue this Lady had shewen him in time past. He sayd vnto her, You hauing so good assurance of your part, valorous Lady, haue wronged your beautie, to séeke it with your victorious hands, which if in ought I haue offended, as I doubt not but that I haue much, you may with lesse cost take iust reuenge, although that comming hither vpon commandement, it may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what excuse mee. The victorie is yours, and so are all in the world due to your beautie and worthinesse, and so I beseech you in token thereof, to take my shield. To beare a pawn from so warlike a Knight, (quoth the Lady) ought to haue béene done by some valorous knight, for it is not iust that wee should take that, which to your worth belongeth, séeing that you haue so well woonne it: for I am yours, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome in battaile, which otherwise I will not bee.</p>
               <p>She would haue left her Shield, which was held for an excéeding greatnesse of mind, for it was one of the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the world. But the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> would not yeeld there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but rather accompanying her forth of the Lists, offered her his seruice: and so returned to his tent, de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

There was a great hope of those which remained, that they should againe recouer that, which the
<pb facs="tcp:13979:135"/>
rest had lost. In the standings, whither the Emperor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded meate to bee brought for dinner, there was no speech so long as it lasted, but of the valour of this Knight. If euer he had neede, fayre Ladyes, of your fauour, sayd <hi>Liciana,</hi> it will be this euening: for I am of opinion, that there remaine some behind, which will put him to his shifts: and God grant that hee fall not into their danger. Hee shall not, sayd the fayre <hi>Rosamundi</hi>: for sith that these La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fauours haue serued his turne, for so good a beginning, and middle it will be (no doubt) sufficient, to make a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous end of that which remaineth. They all wished it, for they loued him in their soules, and were neuer well, vntill they might againe returne to see him. Those of the campe stayed not long at dinner, they were so sharpe set: and the Greekes being aware of their comming, came to the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding windowes to behold them, whose sight deserueth a new Chapter.</p>

Well did <hi>Lupertius</hi> know what peace would grow of these warres, and that hee should be a friend to the Greeks. But hee was so much offended for the imprisonment of his fellow Scholler <hi>Selagio,</hi> that he sought to bee reuenged of the Greeke Princes.

And for this cause, seeing the furious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, with whom they were to encounter, and the lucke of his hand, hee sent them certaine most rich enchaunted Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which were of the best in the world, all russet, with certaine knots of colours, which made a marueylous faire shew. They both bare one deuice: for the gallant <hi>Claribel</hi> had chosen for his Soueraigne Lady, the fayre <hi>Policena,</hi> daughter of the valorous <hi>Polidolphus,</hi> and of the second <hi>Venus.</hi> In the middest of their shields they bare the God of Loue, giuing him for tribute the spoyles of their hearts and soules, with these words:

The braue Lord of Achaia challenged it to bee his. These fiue had fallen out about it, had not the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Romanes, and the Souldan of Niquea taken vp the matter, which brought them to agréement, which was, that they should draw lots: whereto they agréed, because they would not fal out. The first lot happened to him, which in all was equall to the best, which was <hi>Leobello,</hi> and the second to his brother, the third to the Knight with the stars, and next after him to <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> and the last of all to the furious <hi>Bembo,</hi> who was as fierce as a Lion, who imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that after those Knights, there would bee no meanes left for him to fight the battell: but the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did so wel discharge himselfe, that hee gaue them all their hands full. The youth came into the field, with so gallant a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that all affected him: for putting vp his Beauer, hee went to the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> who entertained him verie courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, for they were maruailous like: to whome the valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous youth said,</p>

so much ground as might suffice for his carriere. The <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrian</hi> did the like. Here, oh Nimphes of <hi>Pernassus,</hi> your helpe is wanting: and in no occasion, O <hi>Mrcurie,</hi> thou canst employ thine better, then to explaine, with what grace the one parted from the other. As for me to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the matter, I shal but wrong those valorous knights, which made the one towards the other, and came so soone together, as could not be imagined. Their strong encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would haue soone broken the hard rockes: but they met with so hard brests, that the Launces being shiuered into small splinters, flew vp into the ayre as high as the clouds; true witnesses of the mightie strength of those two warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, which without any mouing, as though they had béene lockt in their Saddles, with a singular good grace passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the one by the other: they returned with their swords aloft, and terrible were their blowes. The sparkles which flew from their shields, seemed to set them on fire. The <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrian</hi> lost the reynes of his bridle, and thought that the last day had béene come, hee heard such thundring about his eares: and out at his mouth came aboundance of bloud, and hee was a while past remembrance. But the young man which had receiued a full blow, and from the best arme in the world, whose sword hath the best edge, fell vpon his Saddle bow bereft of his sences.</p>
               <p>But his horse carried him ten paces off, and euerie body looked when he would fall: but when he came againe to him selfe, there was no Serpent that was troden vpon, nor Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a feuer, that was so furious.

The <hi>Tinacrian</hi> came againe to himselfe, wondring at the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie blow which he had receiued: and séeing his Cousin come so furious, hee thought it were but folly to stay for that blow: and as he was more nimble, and was better moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so he bare to one side, making him to lose his blow, which came with such force, that it made him to fall downe vpon his Saddle pummell, so hard, that when he would haue set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

The Eagle neuer stooped with greater fury after her pray, then the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the young man, which was not yet fiftéene yeeres old: he was one of the most light young men of the world: and when hee came to perfect age, no man excelled him; and so with a leap he came to the place where the Gréeke alighted, and with a strong thrust hee bare him a great way back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. His strong Armour saued his life; for the sword had pierced thorow both his sides, had not such cunning handes forged it.</p>
               <p>The Gréeke stood no longer vpon his skill, séeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so battered; but layd on such load vpon the new Louer, that he put him quite out of breath, not without losse of some bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for against the Gréeke sword there was no enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that could preuaile.

The blow was so furious, and it was so great, that it drue much bloud, and put him out of breath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Garrosileaes</hi> sonne well perceiued it, and holding the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie for certaine, crossing his sword aloft, hee bare by a weake blow, through want of bloud; and closing with him, he lifted him vp from ground, before hee could recouer his breath; and so in his Armes he sent him to the Knight with the Starres, his shield remaining with the <hi>Tinacrian.</hi> The two youthes were so well beloued in all the Pagans camp, that a man cannot imagine what sorrow there was made for the ouerthrow of <hi>Leobello,</hi> and chiefely <hi>Bembo,</hi> who loued himselfe; and he with the Starres wept bloud out at his eyes, in steade of teares.

They were about to returne to the Campe, but it staied them to sée the braue <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> who séeing the Princes busie about <hi>Leobello,</hi> leaped into the Listes, more furious then the raging Sea. The <hi>Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crian</hi> was glad at the heart; for hee had many a day desired this battell, as hath béene before declared, about a Pagans wife: hee knew him by his Armes, which was, a halfe Moone in a blew field. The young man made haste, because
<pb facs="tcp:13979:138"/>
that <hi>Claribel</hi> should not challenge the fight, whose lot it was. In comming néere to the Moore, he said, Me thinketh by your Armes, Sir Knight, that you should bee the King of Mauritania, to sight with whome I haue much desired. The time is come (quoth the Moore) wherein we may end it, séeing thou hast so much desired it, but I would faine know with whome I should fight this battell. I will tell thée, said the couragious <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> vpon conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that thou wilt sweare vnto me by the order of Knighthood, to kéepe it secrete, vntil my challenge be ended. I will doe so, said the Moore. Then thou shalt know (answered the young man) that I am hee, to whome at Sea thou gauest the order of Knighthood, and which brought thy wife from the hands of those fierce Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants: and I am glad that so old a challenge shall now bee ended, for I will not giue it ouer, vntill one of vs lie in the dust. Nothing could so well haue pleased the Pagan, who no lesse desired it then the Greeke. Without answering one word, he went to his place, while as the young man refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed himselfe, praying to the god of his Father to graunt him victorie, against that furious Pagan, with a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to forsake his Law and to bee baptized. With this new vow, hee returned, more couragious, then with any thing that the Nimphes had giuen him, which charged him to be verie circumspect: for it should bee behouefull in this battell, because it should be the last. They were all verie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue, without mouing so much as their eye-lids, for feare, that in the meane space they should encounter, and they not sée them.</p>
               <p>There was neuer any Galley that went so swift with sayles and Oares, driuen by a fresh gale, as they flew one against another, ending their carriers, with farre greater noyse then the Sea maketh, when in a tempest it assaileth the firme rockes. On the shoares side they brake their Launces, as if they had béene little réedes. The one passing by the other without any mouing, they turned their horses, with their naked swords in their hands, giuing such blowes
<pb facs="tcp:13979:139"/>
as caused great feare, euen in those which were farthest off. They were expert in Armes, and therefore they made good shewe, with charging and retiring with such spéed, that thought could not ouertake them. The Gréeke had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage, by reason of his rich Armour and weapons: for he neuer gaue blow but it was bloudy: and although that he saw not his bloud, he was so weakened with the blowes which he receiued, that it put him out of breath. The Knight entred, bearing his sword aloft, meaning to haue ouerborne him with a course: but the Pagan who in strength was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to <hi>Milo,</hi> drawing backe his sword to one side, gaue him two thrusts one after another, which séemed vnto the Gréeke as though he had broken all his ribs: He staied so long, by reason of his paine, that the furious African had meanes to strike him behind vpon the Helms; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the hardnesse thereof gaue him life, yet it could not saue him from turning his head more to one side then he had would: he trusting in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength of his armes, would néeds close with him; but his presumption cost him deare: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valorous <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> who although almost choked with bloud, which ran out of his mouth downe his throte, had not therefore lost any part of his vnderstanding; but séeing him comming, he spurred his good horse Rubican so hard, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him to run vpon the Moores horse: there was neuer séene a more fearfull shock in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world; for whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moore would or n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ward lasted but a little while: for <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batius</hi> his sonne changing footing, lifted vp his right arme, and suddainely with all his strength, strake him vpon the top of his Helmet with his rich sword, hee rapt away his Plumes, with part of his gilded Crest: and stepping backe, drawing his sword after him, he gaue him a thwart blow, which was the luckiest that hee gaue in all this battell: for hitting him below the skirt of his brest-plate, it strake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way aboue a hundred péeces of his shirt of Mayle, cutting his Taces, and therewith part of his thigh, he could not so safely doe it, but that the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> fastned a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Pagan in these cases was not so carelesse, but that hee would giue him another before hee should recouer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and made him set his hands to the ground; hee would haue shouldred him, but hee found him as fixt as a rocke, and came so neere vnto him, that the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> could not strike him, but casting his Shield at his backe, hee tooke hold of him, which he did so suddainely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee had almost throwne him to the ground.</p>

in this maner they spent much time, and so with a strong whéeling about, the one hurled the other away from him, with greater force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they had bin shot out of a Cannon.

               <p>All men prepared themselues for the field battell, which should be about eyght dayes thence: for the Emperour was weary of this long warre. The most mighty sonne <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebus</hi> made no longer stay, but tooke his leaue of the Nimphes, with teares charging them to recommend him vnto the wise Ladie. Hee went foorth armed with the best Armour that was in the world, sending his Lent to the Gréeke Emperour his father, to whom he went betwéene the two Ladies, whose beauty dazeled the Sun, and made the most faire enuious. They were clad in lion colour,
<pb facs="tcp:13979:142"/>
cut vpon blew, and the cuts set with precious stones of sundrie colours: they agréed with the Prince, whose ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was of the same colour, set with so many stones, that they could not be beheld, they gaue such a reflection like the sunne. The Emperour vnderstood of their comming. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabel</hi> and his father, with many Princes, came to receiue the <hi>Tinacrian,</hi> amazed at his beauty and constitution.

Your Maiestie may suffer it, said his Nephew <hi>Rosabel,</hi> receiuing them for your Maiesties children. For the valiant Knight with the Eagle, is the famous Prince of Tinacria, &amp; this Lady (poynting to the fayre <hi>Rosaluira</hi>) is his sister, together with this royall Princesse of Egypt, <hi>Luzela,</hi> whom the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens haue giuen to your déere sonne for his wife.

A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot imagine what a slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they made: for where <hi>Brandafidel, Bramidoro,</hi> and the gentle <hi>Tefereo</hi> went, there was no defence against their clubs, for they trode all vnder foot. The greatest part of the Pagans was slain, before that their succors came from the campe.

                  <hi>Leobulo</hi> by reason of his hurts, was not to haue taken armes so soone.

And the greatest euil was, that <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> desirous to make shew of himselfe, in company with his brother and Nephew, wan the Standard of <hi>Comagena,</hi> &amp; the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the rescue, lost his life honorably, because it was by the hands of the <hi>Tinacrian.</hi> This king was cousin and great friend to <hi>Bramarante,</hi> and vncle to the furious <hi>Brauorante,</hi> who when he knew of his death, <hi>Gualtenor</hi> durst not tell how angry he was: for before that the Gréeks were wholly

The diuelish young man went so compassed with his enemies, that in despight of them hee went into the citie, where I would gladly sée thée (O <hi>Homer</hi>) to sing the acts which he there performed: he would not refuse to fight with a hundred, for hee sought with them all. He met with the Princes of Hungarie and Bohemia: it was nothing to strike them to the ground, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what he pretended. He turned to <hi>Thorisiano,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he left sencelesse at his horses héeles. And the braue <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> although he deserued it not, hee had neere bereaued of life; for casting bloud at his mouth and nostrils, he threwe him to ground.</p>
               <p>The strong <hi>Florisiano</hi> and the Prince of Croacia escaped not scotfrée, for he left them astonied. A proud attempt: six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene Princes he threw to the ground, in so ill plight, that it was doubted of their liues. He came to encounter the two famous Giants, <hi>Bramidoro,</hi> and <hi>Brandafidel</hi>: to which he had an eie euer since their méeting in the willow valley. He entred betwéene them, nothing weyghing their terrible clubbes: and they which were borne to be feared, nothing feared him: for whorling about their feareful weapons, they both together smote him so strongly, that they made him bow both his knées to the ground, and had taken him, but the terrible young man bestirring himselfe with his broad sword, strake <hi>Brandafidels</hi> club out of his hands, and came vpon him with another, which set him from him, faster then a good pace, which gaue him place to rise, and ouertake the furious <hi>Bramidoro.</hi> Hee had paid no lesse then his life, for the displeasure of this angrie young man: for hee made him to fall vpon his hands, and would haue closed to make a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall end of him, and had done it, had not the gentle <hi>Tifereo</hi> come, who with a fierce blow, hindred the purpose of the fierce <hi>Brauorante.</hi> But he paid that which he ought to <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebus</hi>: for with a thrust he wounded him verie sore in the middest of his brest; and if his sword had entred a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

hee had nayled the one side to the other. <hi>Brandafidel</hi> came to the rescue, laying hand to his monstrous crooked Fawchion, wherewith he thought to haue defeated the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and smote him athwart the Helme, and made him sée a thousand starres therein. The Prince of Fraunce, <hi>Clarin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> by chance came at one side of him, who was so eager, that he could not strike, although hee would faine, but was likely to haue met with his death: for the Pagan séeing him so néere him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee could not strike him with his sword, gaue him so sound a knocke with the Hilts, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All this did but inflame his rage, had not the Gréeke Princes béene aduertised thereof, who desirous to kill him, came in all haste.</p>
               <p>The Dane came first vpon his Tirian, very cholericke, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had ouerthrowne his Captaine, which brought his troupes out of Dacia, who entred pale with anger, and ran vpon him with his horse brest, but hee stirred him as much, as if he had met with a rocke. Then came the braue <hi>Clara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante,</hi> who had many times made him to feele what hee could doe with his Halbert, who leapt from his horse, to whome euerie one gaue place: hee stood somewhat aloofe, and whorling his weapon about his his head, smote him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Helmet, and did more then <hi>Don Heleno</hi> his horse could doe, for he made him set his hands to ground: he secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it with another, which made him starke mad: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:13979:144"/>
no reckoning of the third (although that he saw it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) hee ioyned with him, giuing him a suddaine blow with both his hands vpon the Helmet, and made him to set both his hands and knées to the ground: no man came to his rescue, for feare to offend him, thinking that he would make an end of the Pagan: but hee was become such a Basiliske, that if the whole Greeke Armie had beene there, hee would not haue refused the battell, against them all. The louer gaue him a thrust in the brest, and had not his armour béene so good, hee had nayled him thorow, and made him make two steps backwards.</p>
               <p>By this time had all the flowre of the Greekes compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him about: and the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> had so great a desire to trie himselfe against him, that hee leapt from his horse, with his Shield vpon his arme, desiring his brother to leaue that battell to him, wherein he should doe him pleasure. All me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> desired to content him: for he was beloued of all. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan knew him well by his Eagle, and knowing that he had slaine his good Unkle, hee assailed him, bidding them both to prepare themselues: which <hi>Claramante</hi> would not doe by any meanes, but left the battell for his brother, who as hee came fresh and eager, before hee could turne about, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him two blowes, one after another: there was no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment against his weapons, nor force equall to his; for both his knees he made him set to the ground, and reached him another, no lesse then the former.</p>
               <p>The Pagan sawe that which hee neuer had seene: for the swordes point entring at a cracke in his brest-plate, as it found a little entrance, it cut the rest, till it set out the bloud: it was a great chance; and God preserued him, to the end he should bee his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:145"/>The braue Pagans bloud did fréeze in his belly, to sée it vpon the Grecians sword, and giuing a fierce crie, he assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him; and but that his nimblenes did much helpe him, I beléeue, that hee had incurred great danger: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, he hit him a blow vpon the rich shield, and made him runne stumbling forwards readie to fall.</p>
               <p>The Pagan (to his owne hurt) closed with him: for the Prince was as strong as hee, who letting goe his shield, set hand to his rich dagger. But the Moore had such confidence in his armour, that hee made no accompt thereof, and the young man remembring the vertue of that weapon, gaue him vpon the top of his shoulder, two sore wounds, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, which made much bloud to run out. The Moore was so highly angred, that with a push hee put him far from him: and séeing that it was meere madnesse to striue any longer, hauing no assistance, hee assailed the Knight <hi>Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> who was mounted vpon a good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> horse: hee pluckt him out of his Saddle, pulling him ouer those which were on horsebacke, and with a leape hee gat the Saddle, and rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the thickest, aboue foure lost their liues, in the Pagans going forth.</p>
               <p>At the top of a hill all the whole armie staied, expecting him, hearing the noyse, but they were not able to come to helpe him: for from the turrets and Parrapets of the wals, they threw so many stones &amp; Darts; that without manifest danger they could not come néere him, and the Pagan esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not without it: so as when he came to the Campe, he was as wearie, as furious: he would speake to no man, but rather méeting with <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> not remembring their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, he set vpon him, roaring like a baited bull. The braue <hi>Mauritanian</hi> encountered, for hee neuer feared him, where they began one of the most fierce battels that euer was in the world: for they were two of the best Knights therein: but <hi>Bembo</hi> came to part them. Herein did the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans blindnesse appeare, who not respecting him, turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, saying, that they should all fight against him, for
<pb facs="tcp:13979:145"/>
his deare Uncles death could not be reuenged with lesse, then with the destruction of all the world. The great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine would not lay hands on him, although hee had much angred him. All the whole Campe could not haue made him giue ouer the battell, had not <hi>Floralisa</hi> come, whom the Pagan euer since he met her in Mauritania, had chosen for his God: for hee was of opinion, that there was nothing in the world worthy to be regarded, but her beautie. Well did the Lady know how dearely the Moore did loue her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were single loue, for she was otherwise prouided, although she liued the most sorrowfull life of the world, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hope to marry with the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> frustrate: yet to appease the battell, she tooke off her Helmet, and putting herselfe betweene them, she sayd, Giue roome, Knights, for this battell cannot now be ended, and you wrong the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan of Niquea his whole campe, if in time of necessitie any of your Armes should be missing.</p>
               <p>The Pagan lifted his sword no more vp, after he heard his mistris voyce. Strange power of affection: for what so many Princes could not doe, was ended with her sight one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I would haue bene very glad, valorous Lady, (said the <hi>Mauritanian</hi>) if you would haue suffred mee to haue ended it: but seeing it is your pleasure, I leaue it in your hands. Let it rest (sayd the Ladie) vntill the field battell be ended. Let it be as you will appoint it (sayd he, now very gentle) which before seemed to be a Lion; for from henceforth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part I will not breake it: and so they returned to their campe, and although against his will, yet she made him to sup in the Ladies Tent, where (although fained) she shewed him a thousand fauours: they were meanes to withhold him from his fury, for he had determined to pursue them al, to be reuenged of the death of his Uncle.</p>
               <p>There was great sorrowe for the losse of that day; and meaning to make amends in the field battell, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that it should be eight daies after. What happened in the meane season, you shall knowe by the next Chapter.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith such contentment as winners vse to enioy, most excellent Prince, the Greekes remained in the Citie of Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cambela, wondring at the furie of that Pagan, holding it for a matter incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if with their eyes they had not séene it, and so much to the cost of such perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, as they were.</p>
               <p>There was none of the Princes but desired alone to fight with him, especially <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> of whome the old King of Macedonia (returning to Constantinople) repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wonders; all were glad thereof, especially his Father, who loued him in the same degree, as he did the Emperour <hi>Alphebus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Ladies which boldly might doe it, those knights were disarmed, some helping one with their hands, and with their eyes and soule, another. What passed in the Campe was discouered, and how that from thence, eight dayes, they had appointed the field battell: because that by that time, <hi>Leobello</hi> would be cured of his hurts: <hi>Lupertius</hi> cured him verie carefully, that all might sée how much hee loued them.</p>
               <p>One night the discréete <hi>Selia</hi> came by chance, who had folded them in their swadling cloathes at the time of their birth, being much affected to their valour, without any

Shee came as <hi>Lupertius</hi> was dressing of him, and as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are verie bold, and being by night, for that shée would seeme to doe him some fauour therein, shee tooke the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to giue him light to dresse him: but hee had scarcely lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Shee desired to stay with him, to the end to know more of this matter: fortune was her friend, desiring to doe that Princesse some new fauour; and there being no fit companie to stay with the Prince, if hee would haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing, shee offered her selfe to stay for that purpose: which the young man much esteemed, and more would haue done, if hee had knowne the occasion thereof: And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her selfe alone with him, shee came to his beddes side, saying,</p>
               <p>I would, valorous Knight, that you could impart your paine to her, who feeleth the same as much as your selfe.</p>
               <p>Your visiting me, faire Damsell, answered the yong man, is a sufficient ease for all that I feele, being from my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the Princesse <hi>Eufronisa</hi>: which in conclusion, doth that which is annexed to her valour, which is, to remember them which are in need, as I am.</p>
               <p>And to remedie it with losse of her owne contentment, (answered the Damsell) I doe beleeue, that shee gladly would doe it. And for my part, I should take it for much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to know what marke that is vpon your brest, which I saw when you were a dressing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:147"/>I know not the cause thereof, answered the young man, but that I was borne with this face, and my brother <hi>Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> with an heart crossed, and hitherto we knew no other, but that we were the sonnes of the discreet <hi>Sergio,</hi> for hee brought vs vp: but within these two dayes, hee hath put vs out of doubt, telling vs that we be not his children, but that in Silepsia, néere vnto the Citie of Golbergt, he found vs newly borne, and his mother brought vs vp in stead of her owne children: wherein, as I say, we haue continued vntill now, that hee hath otherwise assured vs. The pleasure which this Damsell conceiued was such, that shée presently taking her leaue of him, went into her Ladies Chamber, and without speaking one word, shee imbraced her. The Princesse maruailing at the newes, asked her the cause thereof, which should not be little. So great (answered the the Damsell) is the good, which the heauens (deare Ladie) this day haue done you, that you may liue merrie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented all the dayes of your life: for know, that the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous youthes are your two lost sonnes.</p>
               <p>The Princesse could giue no answere, shée was so surprised with suddaine ioy, which was then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test that could happen vnto her. Ah, my <hi>Selia,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beléeue that so great a good as this, can happen vnto so vnluckie a woman, no way deseruing it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be possibly. Without doubt it is as I tel you, for I haue seene the verie markes wherewith they were borne, and that which <hi>Cleobulo</hi> hath, I saw this night, when hee was a dressing: and then shée told her what had passed betwéene the Prince and her, whereof the Princesse was not able to containe the pleasure: and being vnable to make an end of renewing her delight, she said, It behooueth me to see it, to the end to make me liue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented. That shal be an easie matter to doe, answered the Damsell: for now euerie body being at rest, I wil leade you thither, without discouerie: but why will you not beléeue that I haue told
<pb facs="tcp:13979:147"/>
you of him? She presently came forth with her: for the hope to sée him, did encourage her in such sort, that she would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to come to the Princes lodging: to whome at her comming she said, My Damsell, Sir Knight, hath told me so many and so rare things of you and your brother, (that being somewhat hard of beléefe, although it may be noted for lightnesse) that I in exchange to see it, haue put my selfe in danger to be noted. It is to me, Soueraigne Princesse, a great fauour that which you doe, and the cause being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, bringeth therewith the defence: as for the rest, seeing it is your pleasure, there is no more to be done, but to sée it with your eies: and so putting his shirt a little by, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that faire face.</p>
               <p>The Princesse had so imprinted it in her heart, that shee presently knew it. She had almost discouered her selfe: but considering what might ensue thereof, and to publish her contentment, shee tooke her leaue of him, the most ioyfull of any woman in the world. Well did shee deserue it, hauing recouered two such sonnes as shee had, being in all so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. Shee was now of opinion, that fortune could doe her no greater pleasure, then that which shee had recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the sight of her two sonnes.</p>
               <p>They withdrew them to their lodging, with determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neuer to marry, seeing she had two such children; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make them knowne to the Greeke their father, for feare that they would stay with him in Greece. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they passed the seuen dayes which remayned: shee in one campe, and be in another; vntill that that wished day did come, wherein should be the generall death of him, or of his enemies.</p>
               <p>It seemed that <hi>Apollo</hi> this day hastened his course, to the end that there should want no time for this bloudie warre: he appeared of a bloudie colour, and <hi>Mars</hi> with his armed Trident appeared low, wherewith he touched <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> Shield. There was neither Faune, Satyre, nor god in the woods, which came not to the top of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mountaines to
<pb facs="tcp:13979:148"/>
sée the battell. In the Campe, before the Captaine <hi>Bemboes</hi> Tent, was pitcht vp a blacke standard, the sides being of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: a signe that the warres should be made with fire and sword, and bloud, and that he should die for it, which tooke a prisoner: he drue forth his Infanterie, which was innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, making thereof his maine battell, lyning it with the fierce Parthians, which were aboue a hundred thousand men al Archers, with their bowes and quiuers, wherewith they did notable harme: for being on horsebacke, before they came to charge their Launces, they wrought great hurt in the head of the Cauallerie, which were diuided into twelue mightie squadrons. Foorth came those two mightie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Soldan of Niquea, and the Emperour of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, whose persons compassed with huge Giants, were garded with no lesse care, then <hi>Achilles</hi> was with the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midons. With the rest of the people he made 2. Battalio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: one of which he tooke for himself, leading them to the right hand. At one side of him, went those two braue competitors <hi>Brauorante,</hi> and <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> with the most principal troups of Achaia. In the Arrere gard, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Africanes came those thrée mightie young men, he with the starres, <hi>Claribel,</hi> and <hi>Leobello,</hi> whose comly personages were pleasing to al. The Duke <hi>Ferrer</hi> bare the Standard royall, with all the fierce Almaines, hauing twentie foure Giants for his gard. On the other side went the mightie Soldan of Egypt, bearing downe towards the valley of willowes: in whose compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie went the fiue of the faire wood, with the flowre of Giant land, which séemed as high as Pine-trées. The King of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia, and the mightie Assyrian, had in charge the gard of the Campe: the charge of battering the Citie, with all the Chariots with Sithes, and the strong Castles vpon the mightie Elephants, wherewith they thought it an easie matter to batter it, with all the Rams and engines, which seemed to bee greater then the Citie of Constantinople, was committed to the King of England, with part of the Frenchmen, &amp; a brother of the Duke of Thebes, who was
<pb facs="tcp:13979:148"/>
no lesse fit for it, then his brother for the campe: who tooke good order for the gard of the Citie, putting all the Ladies into <hi>Mars</hi> his Castle, making thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the comming of <hi>Trebatius</hi> his power (which séemed no lesse then the Moores:) the Captaine generall commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Emperour of Trapisonda <hi>Alphebus,</hi> the leading of one poynt of the horsemen: who with his beloued Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, and the braue <hi>Oristides</hi> and his wife, with the Giants of the Ilands Baleares, which were aboue 2000. tooke downe into the valley, ouer against the Souldan of Egypt. The other point he recommended to the mighty <hi>Trebatius,</hi> whose company was no lesse in shew, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> had: he went betwéene <hi>Poliphebus</hi> and <hi>Rosacler,</hi> with his Nephew, the valorous <hi>Rosabel, Bramidoro</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dafidel,</hi> with the gentle <hi>Tifereo</hi> and the sonnes of <hi>Tituan,</hi> tooke charge of his person: the Battalions in the middest he deuided, as best fitted: hee reserued the auaunt gard for himselfe: by him went the flower of Chiualry, <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and <hi>Claramante,</hi> with all the Spanyards, Lirians, and Antiochians: although that one halfe of the Spanyards, with part of the Hungarians and Albanois, he had made passe by 2. and 2. &amp; 4. and 4. to the number of 60000. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the campe, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lodging themselues among those crags and bushes, they should there make a stand, vntill y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should come to giue assault to the campe: it was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test stratageme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer Captaine deuised, as shall appeare.

Knights of his chamber had charge of his Ladie. The great Tartarian <hi>Zoilo,</hi> &amp; the prince <hi>Meridian</hi> were left with a maine troup for supplies, with many spare horses for those which should be lost. The Roiall sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dard was borne by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Theban Duke.

                  <hi>Floristano</hi> and <hi>Polidolpho,</hi> with the good king <hi>Sacridoro,</hi> and the valiant <hi>Lisart</hi> of Argentaria were reserued, for that the Captaine had sent them to commaund the Ambuscado, committing to their discretion and valour, a matter of so great importance.

wherein an excellent wit and loftie stile is very requisite. A sight worthie to bee séene, although it made some afraid, but to the rest it yéelded new courage, to sée so many faire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes flying in the aire, so many Cornets wauing, so much Armor glittering, such neighing of horses striking one at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, such thundring of Ordinance, so many instruments of warre, such crying of Souldiours, such encouraging of Captaines, fixing their eyes on the palme of the victorie, which turned the most cowardly Souldier, to a fierce Lion, the noyse of the Charriots, and the snorting of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants: hauing séene this, who would not haue thought, but that the last day had béene come? The infantrie of either side extended it selfe at large; whose Pike heads did so shine, as they dazelled the Sunne.</p>
               <p>The most Christian Emperour full of water, lifted vp his eyes to heauen, saying, Séeing this is thine (O Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy people.) Both together in the points met these two angry Captaines, charging the first battels, that it séemed that the earth was not onely oppressed in it selfe: but that the highest heauens were vnhung. In the Auaunt-gard of these battels, came the flowre of both armies: for with the Generall <hi>Bembo,</hi> were ioyned the two competitors, which aduanced themselues forwards.

The thrée famous Pagans turned backwards hearing the noyse, and those which were a foote, were like to bee in danger by their comming, for in the Generals gard, they had done much harme.

               <p>O who had then séene the angrie Moore, more furious then a Basiliske! hee was nothing amazed, neither did hee strike sayle to furie, but rather drew out a sharpe skeane, wherewith hee would haue smitten the Gréeke: but it was too late, for he had alreadie the edge of his Axe vpon his Helme: here he saw that which he neuer thought of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; for hitting him athwart the Creast, he smote it cleane away, &amp; a great part of his stéele Cap.

But the Pagans were so many, that although that they, where they went, had the aduantage; yet the Moores had it in the rest of the campe, fighting sometimes foure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one, and sometimes at more ease. On that side where the Souldan of Egypt was, there the Gréekes had the better; because on that side happened to fight the inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>Alphebus,</hi> with the no lesse furious then redoubted Knight <hi>Oristides,</hi> who séemed no other, then as <hi>Hercules</hi> among the Giants in the plaines of Egypt: or as <hi>Samson</hi> among the Philistims. <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> reporteth, that before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee had euer drawne his sword, hee had felled ten Giants: those with that in his hand he sought, and not the weake simple Knights.

But <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> who was of greater force then the Troiane, sorry for his friends blowe, parted from him, and assayled the Trapisonda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lord. He was neuer weary with fighting, for therewith he was refreshed: he let him enter, and with all his might, stepping aside, as he was more nimble &amp; vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, seizing vpon him with his armes, he pluckt him out of his saddle: and but for feare to bee ouerborne by the beasts which the Giants rode on, he had kild him: hee let him goe, spurning him with his feete: but he was presently remou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Ladie was

Doe not desire it, my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Heleno,</hi> answered the Matrone: for what pleasure can she which loueth you, haue in rest, without your presence? and to bee perswaded to this, were a notabid iniurie: for yet my mind doth serue me to conquere another, <hi>Don He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leno</hi>: and therewith she pulled downe her Beuer; and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for a Launce to them which had the charge to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shee turned to her husband, saying, Now see what it is to haue you by my side.

Thither came so many for reuenge, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gréeke had beene in danger, had not <hi>Bramidoro</hi> and his friend <hi>Brandafidel</hi> with <hi>Tefereo</hi> come to his aide: for to the noyse came <hi>Brauorante,</hi> ouerthrowing more Greekes then the wind doth leaues in <hi>Autumne.</hi> There began a braue battell, for the Gréeke desired it, and the other was readie to die for it. By this time were the two famous warriours come to the little hill, <hi>Poliphebus,</hi> and <hi>Rosabel</hi> meeting there the flowre, not onely of the Campe, but of the whole world, <hi>Claramante,</hi> and <hi>Claridiano,</hi> with the faire <hi>Archisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lora.</hi> There was great ioy at their meeting: for they did reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally loue extremely, and not without great griefe they beheld the successe of the battell: for although that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men did preuaile, yet the multitude of the rascall Moores was so great, that they gat ground vpon them, although that at Sea the famous <hi>Astrusio</hi> sped better: for therein hee was the most expert in the world.</p>
               <p>For as being better of sayle, with his greatest vessels he bare towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> South, where, with a fine Southeast wind, which blew a faire gale, haling their Tackles close aboord, they weathered the enemies Fléete, and comming hard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord them, they cast so much wild fire into it, that they set certaine shippes on fire, which they left burning in a light flame, with such a mortall slaughter of men, as cannot bee imagined: for as the wind from the shore was a helpe vnto them, comming close aboord the enemies ships, they fired the greatest part, and the best rigged and appointed in the Fléete: and but for the losse by land, it had beene great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to haue seene them: but that which made them most to wonder, was, to see come from the South with both sayles and Oares, a great Fléete, which drawing néere the shore a little beneath where the battell was fought, vpon a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine landed so many men, as excéeded the number of two hundred thousand, with aboue thirtie thousand mightie Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. They saw them diuided into two battels, and that the one ouer the valley towards the Citie, went in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of a

Crescent, without charging Launce, or assailing any body, gathering together those which were dispersed ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fields. As the Sunne was then at the highest, shining vpon their armour, it was a faire sight to behold: the other battell wherein there séemed to be a Chariot triumphant, drawn by twelue Elephants, tooke the lower way. Both armies were much troubled herewith: for they well saw that to whether partie this should leane, there the victorie was certaine. Now is there néede of your horses swiftnesse, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of your arme, said the Captaine <hi>Oristoldo</hi>: first to the sonne of <hi>Garrofilea,</hi> and then to the vnknowne <hi>Claridiano,</hi> who obeying the commaundement of the braue and discréet Captaine, answered, Let it bee as it shall please you: but it fitteth better for our businesse, séeing that they are friends, that wee should at our pleasure sacke their Campe: for I haue to day a great desire to steale some Ladies, or at the least, if I misse thereof, that ensigne, which is set yonder in the side of the little hill: for they shall not ioy at our losses. And therefore, valorous Prince, (with your fauour) I will winne it, and with my owne hand will giue it to the most faire and ingratefull Ladie of the world, in the behalfe of the most faithfull Louer therein, and worst rewarded. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they descended downe the hill, farre more swift then thought.</p>
               <p>The exployts which were done in this iournie, are not to be written in so true a Historie as is this, which I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: for there were no foure Knights of the most valiant in all the Campe, that durst to stand two blowes: for a stone doth no more easily strike down the tender eares of Corne, then their swords did fell those Infidels. They threw to the ground aboue two hundred, not wounded, which had béene a greater harme, but starke dead. The furious Giants which opposed themselues against them, could not stay them in their iournie: for against them, like the lightning, finding some resistance, they shewed themselues more furious. As they were perceiued to mount vpon the side of the little hil,

some from the Imperiall Standard came to their reliefe, among which were the sonnes of <hi>Rosabel</hi>: but both one and other came too late: for the furious <hi>Claridiano,</hi> much stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a thunderbolt, rushed in among the flowre of the Almaines, which had the gard there.</p>
               <p>The blowes which they gaue, nor the Launces and Darts which they hurled, could not defend them: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lifting vp his sword, he assailed him that had any, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him downe with his fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They crossed the Campe (although with much adoe) which did encourage those which were ouercome, to see the Pagans Standard in the hands of the Knight with the Ladies. They came to vnderstand of the armie which was arriued, and séeing by the wauing of their colours, that they were Greeke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, without longer stay, holding now the victorie on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side for certaine, in the twinkling of an eye, they came to the place: where the Generall with his friends stayed for them, glad of the exploite which they had done: and the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious young man, taking the ensigne in his hand, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to his Lady, saying, Although that it be a presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and apparant errour, valorous Ladie, I bestow this Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard vpon your beautie and valour: but seeing it is done, and that I haue gotten it in your name, my ouer-boldnesse is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable.

And presently they tooke their way downe the hill, vntill they were out of sight of those of the Campe, who were busied with beholding the great armie, which was newly arriued. The sixe valorous Princes came to the Ambuscado, where <hi>Florisarte</hi> ioyfully receiued them, and with all spéede put their people in order.

In the triumphant Charriot they thrise sounded three great Clarions, so lowd, that the noyse was heard ouer all the fields. As they left, the mighty yong <hi>Daristeo</hi> stayed no longer, but with the greatest courage of the world, casting vp his golden trunchion, taking a great Launce in his hand, he turned about to behold his Ladie, which to him séemed now more beautifull then before.

               <p>The fierce yong man hauing well imployed his Launce, drew out a rich sword, wherewith hee began by the déedes which he performed, to resemble <hi>Hector</hi> of Troy: for hee gaue no blow, but ouerthrew a Knight, and somtime, both horse and man.

The Affricane was more accustomed to labour: but the young man, being in his sprouting youth, and being newly wounded with loue, was so ready to strike and retire with his well made horse, that he made the Moore sweat drops of bloud.

               <p>Let this satisfaction suffice (said the most faire Quéene of <hi>Lira,</hi> putting off her rich Helmet, whose rare beautie made them all to wonder) vntill you come to the Citie, where shall want no meanes to fauour your cause. And so I beseech you, in behalfe of all these Knights and my selfe, you wil be pleased to come with vs: for so faire a prise is not to be left for any thing in the world: and more, I being the cause, and onely instrument which hath ordained it. To many of them, it was no griefe to goe prisoners thither, and although that others grieued, yet perforce they dissembled it. Loue tooke good order herein: for the faire <hi>Arbolinda,</hi> seeing her beloued Prince <hi>Florisarte</hi> of Argentaria, was glad to goe in his Armes, &amp; <hi>Clabela,</hi> with <hi>Oristoldo,</hi> which was life to the young man.</p>

               <p>In such times, valorous Captaine, you are to take order, not with your disliking, but with fortune, which declareth it selfe for your enemie: for I see all the Armie at the point to bee lost.

patience, and know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it commeth through the small equitie of your cause, which was great, to couet those spoyles which the heauens had prepared for the Brittish Prince.

               <p>The discreet Ladie had taken off her Helmet; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Captaine knew her, who wel considering, that what shée had said, was wrought by the Almightie hand, and preserued for some great Christian, hee put the matter in the Princesses hands, willing her to doe as best pleased her: although that being so many, which hold themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieued, it will bee a hard matter to obtaine any peace, in the middest of such a tempest, I desire nothing, but that some occasion may bee offered, wherein I may bee able to doe <hi>Liriana</hi> any seruice.

               <p>Shée tooke so good order, that shee perswaded the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan of Niquea to peace, séeing how much it concerned him, seeing he thereby should recouer such friends and kinsmen.

And as of these men depended the commaund of all the rest, and the new enamoured <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoldo</hi> agreeing herein for the loue of his Ladie, with all haste the retreite was sounded betwéene both armies, that valiant Ladie being the occasion of all that good: they were parted at an instant (for it behoued them that were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, séeing it was for their good) and the others, to please their Princes, sheathed their swords.</p>

               <p>Well did the famous <hi>Bembo</hi> vnderstand that, when he so easily yeelded to all that which the Princesse of Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia required, who the better to make her doings more famous, had spoken to the most principall gallants, to the

They were all content to please her, séeing that therein she had done the like by them. The next day with new beautie, not with any bloudy colour, the Sunne shewed himselfe, hastening his course to behold so much brauery as there was among those Gallants, which by that time were gone forth of the imperiall Citie in a well marshalled squadron, all light, with their swords one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with such costly attire, as a man would not desire to see more in all his life time.</p>
               <p>Betwéene <hi>Claramente</hi> and <hi>Claridiano,</hi> went the fayre <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> armed with most rich Armour, which <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> had giuen her, without any Helmet, and in stead thereof, a coloured hatte of the colour of her Armour, with such costly workmanship, that the price thereof could not bee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued.</p>
               <p>In the middest of her brest (for shee bare no Shield) shee ware Peace paynted so at life, that it was very pleasing to behold it, with these words:
<q>

               <p>Soueraigne Princes, and valiant Knights, because you shall know how much the Gréekes doe estéeme of the peace graunted on your behalfe, they commend them vnto you, praying you to accept of their Citie at your seruice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they will shew you (in doing you seruice) that, if they fought, it was but to come to enioy this day: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sweete, but what is gotten with paine, which seeing it hath beene betweene both Campes, it is reason that they both should enioy that which is redounded thereof. Ualo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ladie, answered the courteous <hi>Bembo,</hi> although it were but to be delighted with your valour and discretion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so many tempests, they were all employed, and we will accept of the fauour which those Princes offer vs, entring into their Citie, from whence it will be more hard for them againe to put vs out, in peace, then in open warre. They all tooke their way towards the Citie, where was nothing to be seene but Knights and Ladies, the sight where of excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly much pleased the Pagans.</p>
               <p>I know not how, discreete reader, I am entred, neither the middle, nor ending of these entertainments: for euen to imagine it, is as much as for mee to wade thorow the swolne Sea drie-foote. Who is able to describe what <hi>Bembo</hi> felt, when the faire <hi>Liriana</hi> came to speake to him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I neuer thought, famous Prince, that your arme should haue wrought me so much displeasure: but now to content you, I will requite you, praying you to dispose of all: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue gone with you in the opinion of a tyrant, I will draw you from that by experience. The young man could not suddainely answere her, vntil that feare was past, and then hee said, Most excellent Princesse, I euer thought that your beautie would one day come to take compassion of my griefe, but not to remedie it: I neuer pretended, but that all the whole world might knowe, of what
<pb facs="tcp:13979:163"/>
power my sorrow was: and if I came to this warre, I was forced thereto, to the end to enioy the sight of you.</p>
               <p>Let those old quarrels proceede no farther (said the most fayre <hi>Lindabrides</hi>) for hearing of this Prince his valour, I had affected him without offence to <hi>Claramante</hi>: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him in our power, he shall see, how much worse it shall be for him to get out of our hands, then from the Gréeke Princes.</p>
               <p>As these things passed, it was a life for <hi>Bembo</hi>: for it séemed to him that fortune would turne to fauour him. The excellent <hi>Sarmatia</hi> had made such haste, and taken so good order, that shee had procured for <hi>Bembo,</hi> no lesse then for <hi>Rosiluira,</hi> which was, to giue him what hee desired, and her, what shee desired, although that <hi>Don Celindo</hi> was grieued thereat in his soule, who by <hi>Lupertius</hi> his order, who was there present, was made knowne to bee <hi>Meridian</hi> his sonne.</p>
               <p>Hee restored to the Assyrian, his sonne, and to the King of Fenicia, and the Sophy, theirs: a thing which anewe renewed their content, and for them also: for they knewe that their father <hi>Selagio</hi> was at libertie: who what hee did when hee sawe himselfe frée, shall bee declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>The Emperour of the Romanes was very glad, that <hi>Don Celindo</hi> was so high a Prince, which was the cause why hee gaue him his daughter.</p>
               <p>The fayre <hi>Arbolinda,</hi> vpon the way séeing herselfe in the armes of her beloued <hi>Florisarte,</hi> told him the effect of all her loue: hee made them to betroth <hi>Rosabel,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that there should bee perpetuall peace, they gaue to the prince of Niquea, <hi>Lindoriano</hi>: the fayre <hi>Tinacrian, Rosiluira,</hi> whom hee loued as his soule: to <hi>Astorildoes</hi> lot, fell the faire <hi>Clarintea</hi> of Celandia: and to the Prince of Fraunce <hi>Clarindo,</hi> the fayre English <hi>Artemisa</hi>: to the Princes of Bohemia and Hungarie, to the one, the fayre
<pb facs="tcp:13979:164"/>
                  <hi>Troyla,</hi> and to the other, the faire <hi>Feniciana,</hi> sister to <hi>Don Argante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The mightie Tartarian <hi>Daristeo</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was so enamoured of the young <hi>Rosabela,</hi> that her Gréeke parents were glad to giue her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing how much they were beholding to him, which cut the heart of the Knight with the starres, for therevpon grewe a great quarrell, which lasted long, to the losse of much bloud, as you shall heare.</p>
               <p>All these marriages were deferred for the space of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes, because that <hi>Bembo</hi> was to bee christianed, and <hi>Poliphebus</hi> and his wife, with <hi>Lindoriano</hi> and his wife.</p>
               <p>Triumphes are a preparing, which will bee reported ouer all the world. In the meane time, vpon agréement, the Moores discharged their Nauies, remayning for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Monarch, twelue Galleyes. They set at libertie all prisoners, and amongst the rest, <hi>Epirabio,</hi> whom, as hee had deserued, they gaue <hi>Lisiana,</hi> which hee so much desired. The great Assyrian, <hi>Don Clarisel</hi> (by the consent of all the Greeke Princes) marryed with <hi>Floralisa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this pleasure, remained all those Princes and fayre Ladies, which of all the world were the flowre, when as <hi>Selagio</hi> framed a newe reuenge; for herein is crueltie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paynted in his colours: hee obtayned so much by ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Lupertius</hi> his bookes, that hee came to finde this prophesie:
<q>Into Mars his Castle, no man shalbe suffred to enter, but him which mounting vpon the hill Olympus, shall winne the passage, and after that hee is entred, shall bereaue Mars of his Armes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hee was verie glad, imagining that no man could doe it: and hee stealing away the greatest part of the Ladies, which were busied with pleasing feastings, being so hard to set them at libertie, hee should remayne somewhat satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<pb facs="tcp:13979:164"/>
In a moment hee put it in execution: for taking a Charriot with flaming fire, which hee brought into the hall at Constantinople, so as no man could stirre, with such lightnings and thunder, as though heauen and earth should haue come together: which being past, there were missing the fayrest Ladies of the world, which were <hi>Policena, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, Aurelia,</hi> and <hi>Rosabela,</hi> with the faire <hi>Artemisa</hi>: and of the Moores, the daughter of the Sophie, of the Assyrian, of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All the Court was in an vprore, and there would goe to séeke them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Rosabel</hi> his sonnes, and hee with the starres, with the great Tartarian: but in the meane time in came <hi>Nauato,</hi> who pacified them, saying, that then to goe to séeke them, was to no purpose: for hee found, that they should not so soone be set at libertie: for there was a prophesie, that vntill that the disguised Lion should hold the Ounce in his pawes at the poynt of death, who loued him as her selfe, hauing wounded her, and set her in such maner, not springing from thence the furious Basiliske, which may breake open that which is lockt, it shall be impossible for the world to sée the inclosed Nymphes. So as, excellent Princes, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you to make merry (although there be so many Ladies missing) by reason of the peace which hath cost you so much: and because I haue much to doe, and all for your seruice, I can stay no longer, neither sée any body, vntill all be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished: and so he presently vanished, lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb facs="tcp:13979:166"/>All the Gréekes discoursed of the successe thereof, but durst leane no more to the one then the other, not to disgrace eyther, although that in secret, some more affected <hi>Brauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> for that which they had séene him doe in those warres.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Apollo</hi> began to shew his golden lockes bathed in the Spanish seas, all the Court began to stirre: some set vp tables: others, scaffolds: there was nothing in the place, but was put to vse.</p>
               <p>Then came forth the Gréeke Ladies, so fayre, that if the Sunne had not taken care of those warriours, hee could haue taken no benefit of the counsell which he gaue to his sonne, it would so much haue troubled him to see so much rare beauty together, séeing that hee onely for one, left his aboade in the heauens, liuing in a rude office, and held it for greater glorie, then in his rich Charriot to compasse the heauens, who séemed to stay, which was for that, that at one side of the place, the two famous warriours presented themselues: with the one, came all the Affricanes: he would not haue his armes brought to him, for hee came in with his Beauer downe, and with his Launce in his hand, with so angrie a pace, that there was great hope of him: hee was couered all ouer with cleane and well tempered steele, enamelled greene, with many knots of gold.</p>
               <p>In the middest of the shield, which was of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, hee had his Ladies picture, when hee tooke her from foure Giants, which he slue in requitall for their presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot in the borders;
<q>
                     <l>A strong conceite in a louing mind,</l>
                     <l>Maketh easie what euer it doth find.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hee rode round about the place, with a greater grace then <hi>Mars,</hi> causing at one side thereof, a great Launce to bee set vp, and thereon to set vp the Armes which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb facs="tcp:13979:166"/>
to <hi>Brauorante</hi>: to the end, that hee who gat the victorie, should beare them away for a Trophe and token of his valour.</p>
               <p>Hee presently tooke his place, attending the great Scythian, who had chalenged the famous Affrican, if euer there were any in that land.</p>
               <p>On the other side came in (in valour) the rare <hi>Brauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> with all the Assyrians (that were left) in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>It was a thing worthy to bee séene by the Greekes, to see how prowdly hee came in, all in cleane tempered steele, from the head vnto the foote: his colours were Lyon-colour, with many streames of greene, and the skirtes gilt.</p>
               <p>There was neuer seene in the world (except it had beene a Giant) a greater or a goodlier Warriour: and in remembrance of the Ladie which hee had chosen for his god, hee bare her paynted so at life in his Shield, as when hee met her in the kingdome of Mauritania, where hee fought for her, as in the beginning of the third part is declared.</p>
               <p>The borders were so set with precious stones of such inestimable price, that there was no fayrer shewe to bee seene. Therein was also a Warriour farre in loue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the two, these words:
<q>
                     <l>Well may hee presume to winne,</l>
                     <l>Who first found you,</l>
                     <l>And by his seruice bound you.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hee came in, with a furious aspect confronting his aduersarie. The Iudges of the field were the two famous Quéenes of beautie: for the Affrican chose for his part, the fayre <hi>Archisilora</hi>: and the great <hi>Brauorante</hi> chose his goddesse <hi>Floralisa,</hi> which doing that, which to that office
<pb facs="tcp:13979:167"/>
did appertaine, appointing them an equall space for their carriere, armes, and sunne, they withdrew them to one side, to giue the more roome.</p>
               <p>Although this be the last, faire Dames, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he which in the beginning craued leaue to begin this Historie, and to giue it, in the middle should now leaue to repaire to your beauties, to giue it a pleasing ending, and to extoll the blowes of the most famous warriours vpon the earth: for with angrie paces they set themselues face to face, and the Sunne betweene them both staying his course, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should hasten theirs; which they did more swift then the fresh wind in <hi>Autumne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None of those which beheld them, durst cast their eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, for feare to lose the sight of the effect of their swift car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere. They performed it (gallant Ladies) with greater noyse, then the raging Sea maketh, when it threatneth the highest heauens, and being vnable to reach vnto them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth it selfe with beating the rockes vpon the shores side. And although that their Launces had beene Shippes masts, they would haue broken them in small peeces: for they came more strongly seated in their Saddles, then any rocke in the Mountaines, and their Launces being broken into splinters with the force of their encounter, flew into the ayre cleane out of sight. I beleeue they flew so high, as to the Throne where the angrie god maketh his abode, who did malice their péerelesse encounter: they past one by another with a better grace, then he could haue done. They returned in the ayre with their swordes in their hands, with so fierce a countenance, and so proud an aspect, that the most valiant of the Greekes cast their cloakes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their faces, because they would not see it, all their bloud of their bodies being retired to their hearts.</p>
               <p>And seeing that <hi>Claramante</hi> was afraid, and <hi>Claridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi> shrunke aside, what shall my wearied pen, and my dul short wit, but make an end of this booke, entreating par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb facs="tcp:13979:167"/>
for the faults which are in them all, not looking into them, as into a worke of so tender yeeres; but onely into my desire so giue content? But being now entred into more ryper yeeres, I doe promise the fourth part: in the which, an end shall bee giuen of this terrible battell, and also of the loue of the vnknowne Greeke, with the noble acts of the sonnes of <hi>Eufronisa</hi>: and also of the Knight with the starres, with the mighty <hi>Daristeo</hi>: for the things which they did in seeking the Ladies, were wonderfull to the world, which doth anewe encourage mee to treat of their loues, which were not comparable with the Quéenes of Lira.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (worthy Ladies) excuse my errors, and my so abrupt giuing ouer this Historie: whereof if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
