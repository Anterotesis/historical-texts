            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>And Bread and Meate (to banish hungers feare)</l>
            <l>With Sayles, with Ancker, Cables, Sculs and Oares,</l>

            <l>Twixt <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> we to <hi>Grauesend</hi> fell.</l>
            <l>There I had welcome of my friendly Host,</l>

            <l>Good meate and Lodging at an easie Rate,</l>

            <l>Whilest <hi>Zephirus,</hi> and <hi>Auster,</hi> mix'd together,</l>
            <l>Breath'd gently, as fore-boding pleasant weather.</l>
            <l>Olde <hi>Neptune</hi> had his Daughter <hi>Thames</hi> supplide,</l>
            <l>With ample measure of a flowing Tide,</l>

            <l>And with her Ebbes, payde <hi>Neptune</hi> backe his Floods.</l>
            <l>Then at the time of this Auspicious dawning,</l>
            <l>I rowz'd my men, who Scrubbing, stretching, yawning,</l>
            <l>Arose, left <hi>Grauesend,</hi> Rowing downe the streame,</l>
            <l>And neere to <hi>Lee,</hi> wee to an Ancker came.</l>
            <l>Because the Sands were bare, and Water lowe,</l>

            <l>Thus past we on the braue East Saxon Coast,</l>
            <l>From 3. at morne, till 2. at noone almost,</l>
            <l>By <hi>Shobury, Wakering, Fowlenesse, Tittingham,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And then wee into deeper water came.</l>
            <l>There is a crooked Bay runnes winding farre,</l>
            <l>To <hi>Maulden, Esterford,</hi> and <hi>Colchester,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Which cause 'twas much about, (to ease mens paine)</l>
            <l>I left the Land, and put into the mayne.</l>
            <l>With speed, the crooked way to scape and passe,</l>
            <l>I made out straight for <hi>Frinton,</hi> and the <hi>Nasse.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But being 3. Leagues then from any Land,</l>
            <l>And holding of our Maine sheate in my hand,</l>
            <l>We did espy a coleblacke Cloud to rise,</l>
            <l>Fore-runner of some Tempest from the Skies;</l>
            <l>Scarce had we sayl'd a hundred times our length,</l>
            <l>But that the winde began to gather strength:</l>
            <l>Stiffe <hi>Eolus,</hi> with <hi>Neptune</hi> went to Cuffes,</l>
            <l>With huffes, and puffes, and angry counter-Buffes,</l>
            <l>From boyst'rous Gusts, they fell to fearefull flawes,</l>
            <l>Whilest we 'twixt winde &amp; water, neere Death's iawes</l>
            <l>Tost like a Corke vpon the mounting maine,</l>
            <l>Vp with a whiffe, and straight way downe againe,</l>
            <l>At which we in our mindes much troubled were,</l>
            <l>And said <hi>God blesse vs all, what Wethers heere</hi>?</l>
            <l>For (in a worde) the Seas so high did growe,</l>
            <l>That Ships were forc'd to strike their topsailes lowe,</l>
            <l>Meane time (before the winde) wee scudded braue,</l>
            <l>Much like a Ducke, on top of euery waue.</l>

            <l>Who all were borne when wit was out of Towne,</l>
            <l>And therefore got but little of their owne:</l>

            <l>I rather wish that them I hang'd may see,</l>

            <l>A Towne-Clarke, altogether in one order,</l>
            <l>And vniformity doe gouerne so,</l>

            <l>Are borne before the Maior, and Aldermen,</l>
            <l>And on Festiuities, or high dayes then</l>
            <l>Those Maiestrates their Scarlet Gownes doe weare,</l>
            <l>And haue sixe Sergeants to attend each yeare.</l>
            <l>Now let men say what Towne in <hi>England</hi> is,</l>
            <l>That truly can compare it selfe with this:</l>
            <l>For scituation, strength, and gouernment,</l>
            <l>For charity, for plenty, for content,</l>
            <l>For state? and one thing more I there was told,</l>
            <l>Not one <hi>Recusant,</hi> all the Towne doth hold,</l>
            <l>Nor (as they say) there's not a <hi>Puritan,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or any nose-wise foole <hi>Precissian,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But great and small, with one consent and will,</l>
            <l>Obay his Maiesties Iniunctions still.</l>
            <l>They say that once therein two sisters dwelt,</l>
            <l>Which inwardly the prick of Conscience felt,</l>
            <l>They came to <hi>London,</hi> (hauing wherewithall)</l>
            <l>To buy two Bybles, all <hi>Canonicall,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Th' <hi>Apocripha</hi> did put them in some doubt,</l>
            <l>And therefore both their Bookes were bound without,</l>
            <l>Except those two I ne're did heare of any</l>
            <l>At <hi>Hull,</hi> though many places haue too many.</l>
            <l>But as one scabbed sheepe a flock may marre,</l>
            <l>So there's one man, whose nose did stand a iarre:</l>
            <l>Talk'd very scuruily, and look'd ascue,</l>
            <l>Because I in a worthy Townes-mans Pue,</l>

            <l>This Squire of low degree, displeased than,</l>

            <l>'Twas more then I with manners could forsake:</l>

            <l>There in the Citie were some men of note,</l>
