            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpryse and ventering of myne, as it will be most subiect vnto their eye, and consequentlie vnto their prying and examyning: so haue I taken vnto me, the counsell of a perfect wyse man, and wel practised, which hath tawght me,
<pb facs="tcp:20451:3"/>
how to procede against them, that I neede not to mistrust my boldnes. For thus he saieth in his boke of Prouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, a boke of good authoritie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, <hi>Doe not aunswer a foole</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prouer. 26</note> 
               <hi>according to his folishnes, least thow be made lyke vnto hym.</hi>

            <p>And in the next sentence folowing: <hi>Aunswer</hi> (saieth he) <hi>a foole accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto his folishnes, that he may not seeme to hymselfe to be wyse.</hi> To folow now therefor, this duble and good counsell, of not auns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering, and yet aunswering a foole, I will sett furth vuto the (Reader) two challenges, to plaie the foole with a foole in the first of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, that he may beholde his artificiall wysedome: and in the second, not to agree with hym in his folie, because I will refuse his waies and order.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20451:3"/>
if that waie be taken with hym? Marie, lyke as some madd men (I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue heard saie) haue ben meetlie well browght to themselues, when an other hath stared and gaped vpon them, all counterfaicting an owtragiouse beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyor: so vndowbtedlie against fond questions, it ys a profitable waye of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, to putt the lyke againe vnto madd aduersaries, and cawse them to behold the absurditie. For, as the fault which an other maketh, doth more sensiblie appeere vnto vs, then the lyke of owr owne vsing, thowgh owrselues be neerest to owrselues: so, to declare the absurditie of the challenge, which M. Iuell with much opinion of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome pronounced against all Catholy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: lett one of a lyke proportion to his, be made furth vnto hym, that he may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sider, the well fauorednes of his owne worke, when the lyke example of it, shall greatlie mislyke hym.

there were not so good lykelyhode and reason, why this counterfaicted chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge (so to call it) shoulde be vttered profitablie: yet the wyseman so plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie either counselling or licensing vs, <hi>To aunswer a foole according to his foolishnes,</hi> his authoritie ys suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient inowgh for me, to beare me owt in this my doing, and to saye, that, if I playe the foole, yowr example M.

geaue reason of it vnto their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries: (allthowgh the lack of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with their felowes, of free printing, and open vttering of their bokes, might with reason haue stayed them from their purpose, and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue moued to chainge their contrie for the matter) how much more cawse and reason ys it, that they, which are so fauored in their procedinges, should not lett to stand vnaunswered, such principall questions, as are moued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst them, nor goe at that tyme backward, and flee from the quarell, when most of all, they should shew them selues, and spread furth their cunnyng and sinceritie.</p>
            <p>And yet if these forsaid articles are to manye, for their leysure: or yf they seeme to much particular, for their profite, which would not be espied: or yf the answering vnto them should be sayed to be forbydden by wyse hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:

(for a rumor may sone be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to faine, that it serueth to a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to make such challenges, and combattes) Lett me be quietlie suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered then, to speake a few wordes and indifferent, such as to which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie religion must agree, yf with any reason it will be credited.</p>
            <p>The heretykes (sayeth Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian) <note place="margin">Libr. de praescr. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersus hae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reticos.</note> make a shew of Scriptures, and by this their boldnes, strayt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes some they moue. Now in the very conference it selfe and meetyng togeather, they weerie the stedfast and sure men, they catche and intrapp the weake, and the indifferent they dymisse, and lett goe with grudges and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. But this way must be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vpp against them at the fyrst, and they are not to be suffered to dispute and reason vpon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And why so? Marye, for
<pb facs="tcp:20451:16"/>
good cause (sayeth Tertullian.) For some one heresye doth not admitt certayne Scriptures, and those which it doth alow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, it turneth vnto her purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, by putting vnto them, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng awaie somwhat from them. Some againe are so presumptuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, and take so much vpon them, that they will not acknowledge that for Scripture, by which they may be conuicted. Ergo, we must not appeale vnto the Scriptures, (sayeth he) and the triall ys not to be apoynted in them, by which the victorie ys either none, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, or not verie sure. For all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thowgh the conference vpon the scriptures shold come to that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, that it would leaue both sydes alyke: yet the order of thinges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that to be fyrst and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most proponed and putt furth, of
