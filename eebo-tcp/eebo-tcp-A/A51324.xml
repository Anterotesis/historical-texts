            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Free hee was of his exspences, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above his power liberall; with large gifts he gat him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedfast friendship: for which cause he was faine to borrow, pill and extort in other places, which gat him stedfast hatred. Hee was close and secret, a deep dissembler, lowly of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, arrogant of heart, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly familiar where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly hated, not letting to kisse whom he thought to kill, spitefull and cruell, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for ill will, but oftner for ambition and to serve his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; friend and foe were all indifferent: where his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage grew, hee spared no mans

He slew in the Tower King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth;<note place="margin">King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 6. slaine in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the 3.</note> saying, Now is there no Heire male of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, but we of the House of <hi>Yorke</hi>: which murder was done without King <hi>Edward</hi> his assent, which would have appointed that butcherly office to some other, rather then to his owne Brother.</p>
                  <p>Some Wise men also thinke, that his drift lacked not in helping forth his owne Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Clarence</hi> to his death, which thing in all appearance he resisted, although hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly minded it. And the cause thereof was, as men no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his doings and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings did marke (because that he long in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time thought to obtaine the Crown, in case that the King his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (whose life he looked that ill dyet would soone shorten)

should happen to decease, as he did indeed, his children being young. And then if the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> had lived, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensed purpose had been farre hindered: For if the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> had kept himselfe true to his Nephew the young King, every one of these casts had bin a Trumpe in the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesters</hi> way: but when he was sure that his Brother of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> wat dead, then hee knew that hee might worke without that danger.

enterprise, as apparently shall be opened, I must a little put you in remembrance of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and charitable act, no lesse profitable then pleasing to the whole Commonalty, if it had bin so inwardly thought as it was outwardly dissembled, which King <hi>Edward</hi> did, lying on his death bed, not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed. For in his life, although that the division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his friends somewhat grieved and vexed him, yet in his health he lesse regarded and tooke heed to it, by reason that he thought that he was able in all things to rule both parties, were they never so obstinate: But in his last sicknesse (which continued longer then false and fantasticall tales have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly and falsely surmised, as I my selfe that wrote this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet truely knew) when hee perceived his naturall strength
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53752:10"/>
was gone, and hoped little of recovery by the arts of all his Physicians, which he perceived onely to prolong his life; Then he began to consider the youth of his Children, howbeit hee nothing lesse mistrusted then that that hapned; yet he wisely foreseeing and considering, that many harmes might ensue by the debate of his Nobles, while the youth of his children should lack discretion and good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of their friends, (for hee knew well that every part would worke for their owne commodity, and rather by pleasant advice to win them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves favour, then by profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advertisement to doe the Children good:) wherefore ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his death bed at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> hee called to him such Lords as then were about him, whom hee knew to be at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, especially the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse

And when these Lords with divers other of both parties were come unto the Kings presence, he caused himselfe to be raised up with pillowes, and as I can guesse, said thus or much like in sentence to them.<note place="margin">An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4. on his death bed.</note>

                  <p>My Lords, my deare kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and allies, in what plight I now lye, you see, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly feele; by the which I look

the lesse while to live with you, therefore the more deeply I am moved to care in what case I leave you; for such as I leave you, such are my children like to finde you, which if they should finde at variance (as God forbid) they themselves might hap to fall at warre, ere their discretion would serve to set you at peace: You see their youth, of which I reckon the onely surety to rest in your concord. For it sufficeth not all you to love them, if each of you hate other: If they were men, your faithfulnesse might hap to suffice, but childhood must bee maintained by mens authority, and slippery youth underpropped with elder counsell; which they can never have except you give it, nor you give it except you agree; for where each laboureth to breake that the other maketh,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53752:12"/>
and for hatred each impugneth others counsell, there must needes be a long tract, ere any good conclusion can issue. And further, while each partie laboureth to be chiefe flatterer, adulation shall then have more place, then plaine and faithfull advice, of which must needes ensue the evill bringing up of the Prince, whose minde, in tender youth infected, shall readily fall to mischiefe and riot, and draw downe this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Realme to ruine: But if grace turne him to wisedome (which God send him) then they which by evill meanes pleased him best, shall after fall farthest out of favour, so that at the length evill drifts drive to naught, and good plaine wayes prosper and flourish. Great variance hath beene betweene you, not alwayes for great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: Sometime a thing right
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53752:12"/>
well intended and misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hath beene turned to the worse, or a small displeasure done to you, either by your owne affection, or by insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of evill tongues, hath beene sorely aggravated. But this I know wel, you had never so great cause of hatred, as you have of love, because wee be all men, and that we be all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men.</p>
                  <p>This I will leave to Preachers to tell you, and yet I know not whether any Preachers words ought more to move you, then I that am going by and by to the place that they alpreach of. But this shall I desire of you to remember, that the one part of you being of my bloud, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my allies, and each of you with other either of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or affinity, which is the very spirituall affinity and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Christ, as all partakers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53752:13"/>
of the Sacraments of Christs Church. The weight of which consanguinity if we did beare, as would to God wee did, then should wee more be moved to spirituall charity then to flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consanguinity. Our Lord forbid that you love the worse together for the selfe-same cause that you ought to love the better, and yet that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; for no where finde wee so deadly debate as amongst them which by nature and law most ought to agree together. Such a Serpent is ambition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of vaine glory and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, while amongst estates, when he is once entred, he cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth forth so farre, till with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision and variance hee turneth all to mischiefe; First longing to be next to the best, afterward equall with the best, and at the last chiefe and above the best.

And therewithall, the King for faintnesse no longer enduring to sit up, layed him downe on his right side, his face toward them. And there was none present that could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare weeping, but the Lords comforted him with as good words as they could, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered for the time, as they thought should stand with his pleasure.

wealth, after in adversity, till the benignity of her Nephew King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth brought her into a sure estate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her degree and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny.</p>
                  <p>This King <hi>Edward</hi> was such a Prince of Governance and behaviour in the time of peace (for in the time of warre each must bee others enemy) that there was never any King in this Realme attaining the Crowne by warre and battaile, so heartily beloved with the more substance of his people, nor hee himselfe so specially favoured in any part of his life, as at the time of his death: which favour and affection yet after his death, by the cruelty, mischiefe and trouble of the tempestuous world that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, highly towards him more encreased. At such time as he dyed, the displeasure of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53752:16"/>
those that bare him a grudge for King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth his sake (whom he deposed) was well asswaged, and in effect quenched within the space of 22. yeeres, which is a great part of a mans life, and some were reconciled and growne into his favour, of the which he was never strange, when it was with true heart demanded. Hee was goodly of Personage, and Princely to behold, of heart couragious, politicke in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and in adversity nothing abashed, in prosperity rather joyfull then proud, in peace just and mercifull, in war sharpe and fierce, in the Field bold and hardy, and yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse no farther then reason and policie would adventure, whose warres whosoever circumspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and advisedly considereth, hee shall no lesse commend his wisedome and policie where
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53752:16"/>
he avoided them, then his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood where hee vanquished them. Hee was of visage full-faced and lovely, of body mighty, strong and clean made: with over-liberall and wanton dyet he waxed something cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent and burly, but never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse not uncomely. Hee was in youth greatly given to fleshly wantonnesse, from the which health of body in, great prosperity and fortune, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an especiall grace hardly refraineth. This fault little grieved his people; for neither could any one mans pleasure stretch or extend to the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of very many, nor a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude bee grieved by a private mans fantasie or voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when it was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence. And in his latter dayes he left all wild dalliance, and fell to gravity, so that hee brought his Realme into a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53752:17"/>
wealthy and prosperous estate, all feare of outward enemies were cleerely extinguishe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and no warre was in hand, nor none toward, but such as no man looked for. The people were toward their Prince not in a constrained feare, but in a true, loving, and wilfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience among themselves, and the Commons were in good peace. The Lords whom hee knew at variance, hee on his death bed (as hee thought) brought to good concord, love and amity. And a little before his death, he had left gathering of money of his subjects, which is the onely thing that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearts of <hi>English</hi> men from their Kings and Princes: nor nothing he enterprised nor tooke in hand, by the which he should be driven thereunto. For his tribute out of <hi>France</hi> he had a little before recovered
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53752:17"/>
and obtained. And the yeere before he dyed, hee recovered againe the Towne of <hi>Barwicke</hi> against the King of <hi>Scots.</hi> And albeit that all the time of his reigne, he was so benigne, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and familiar, that no part of his vertues was esteemed more than those high humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Yet that condition in the end of his last dayes decayed not, in the which many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by a long continued Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, decline to a proud port and behaviour from their conditions accustomed at their beginning. Yet lowlinesse and gentlenesse so farre forth in him increased, that the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer before he dyed, hee being at Havering at the Bower, sent for the Maior of <hi>London</hi> thither, onely to hunt and make pastime, where hee made them not so hearty but so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and friendly cheere, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53752:18"/>
sent also to their Wives such plenty of Venison, that no one thing in many dayes before gat him either more hearts or more hearty favour amongst the common people, which oftentimes more esteeme and take for great kindnesse a little courtesie, then a great profit or benefit.</p>
                  <p>And so this Noble Prince deceased, as you have heard, in that time his life was most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, and when his people most desired to keepe him: Which love of his people, and their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire affection toward him, had beene to his Noble Children (having in themselves also as many gifts of Nature, as many Princely vertues, as much good towardnesse as their age could receive) a marvellous fortresse and a sure armour, if the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and dissention of their friends had not unarmed them,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53752:18"/>
and left them destitute, and the execrable desire of Soveraignty provoked him to their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which if either kind or kindnesse had holden place, must needes have beene their defence. For <hi>Richard Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> by nature their Uncle, by Office their Protectour, to their Father greatly beholden, and to them by oath and allegiance bounden, all the bonds broken and violated which binde man and man together, without any respect of God or the World, unnaturally contrived to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave them, not onely of their dignity and pre-eminence, but also of their naturall lives and worldly felicity.</p>
                  <p>And first to shew you, that by conjecture he pretended this thing in his Brothers life, yee shall understand for a truth that the same night that King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> dyed, one called <hi>Mistel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke,</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53752:19"/>
long ere the day sprung, came to the house of one <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> dwelling in <hi>Redcrosse-street</hi> without <hi>Cripple Gate</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and when he was with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty wrapping quickly let in, the said <hi>Mistelbrooke</hi> shewed unto <hi>Pottier</hi> that King <hi>Edward</hi> was that night deceased: by my truth, quoth <hi>Pottier,</hi> then will my Master the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> be King, and that I warrant thee. What cause hee had so to thinke, hard it is to say, whether hee being his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant knew any such thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or otherwise had any inkling thereof, but of all likelihood hee spake it not of nought.</p>
                  <p>But now to returne to the true History, were it that the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> had of old sore practised this conclusion, or was before-time moved thereunto, and put in hope by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53752:19"/>
the tender age of the young Princes his Nephews, as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and likelihood of speed putteth a man in courage of that that he never intended. Certaine it is, that he being in the North parts, for the good governance of the Countrey, being advertised of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, contrived the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his Nephewes with the usurpation of the Royall Dignity and Crowne. And forasmuch as he well wist, and had holpe to maintaine a long continued grudge and heart-burning betweene the Queenes kindred and the Kings Bloud, either part envying others au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he now thought, as it was indeed, a furtherly begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the pursuit of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and a sure ground and situation of his unnatural buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if hee might under the pretence of revenging of old
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53752:20"/>
displeasures, abuse the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and anger of the one party to the destruction of the other, and then to win to his purpose as many as he could: and such as could not be won, might be lost ere they looked for it. But of one thing hee was certaine, that if his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent were once perceived, hee should have made peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both parties with his owne bloud: but all his intent he kept secret till hee knew his friends; of the which <hi>Henry</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was the first that sent to him, after his Brothers death, a trusty ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his, called <hi>Persivall,</hi> to the City of <hi>Yorke,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> kept the K. his brothers Funeralls. This <hi>Persivall</hi> came to <hi>Iohn Ward</hi> a cret Chamberer to the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> desiring that hee in close and covert manner might
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53752:20"/>
speake with the Duke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: whereupon in the dead of the night, the Duke sent for <hi>Persivall</hi> (all other being avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) which shewed to the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> his Master, in this new World would take such part as hee would, and would farther waite upon him with a thousand good fellowes, if need were.</p>
                  <p>The Duke sent backe the Messenger with great thankes, and divers privie instructions by mouth: which <hi>Persivall</hi> did so much by his travell, that he came to the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his Master into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Wales,</hi> and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with new instructions met with the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> at <hi>Notingham,</hi> which was come out of the North-country with many Knights and Gentlemen, to the number of 600.

                  <p>The young King, at the death of his Father, kept hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold at <hi>Ludlow,</hi> for his Father had sent him thither for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to be done in the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> to the end that by the authority of his presence, the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53752:21"/>
wilde <hi>Welshmen</hi> and evill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed persons should refraine from their accustom'd murthers and outrages. The governance of this young Prince was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Lord <hi>Anthony Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> Earle <hi>Rivers</hi> and Lord <hi>Scales,</hi> Brother to the Queene, a wise, hardy, and honourable personage, as valiant of hands as politick in Counsell; and with him were associate others of the same party, and in effect, every one as hee was neere of kin unto the Queene, so was he planted next about the Prince. That drift by the Queene see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be devised, whereby her bloud might of right in tender youth be so planted in the Princes favour, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it should hardly be era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated out of the same.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all this to their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and upon that ground set

him, is, quoth he, neither ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to his Majesty, nor to us, and also to him lesse surety, to have his Nobles and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest of his friends from him, and to us all no little danger to suffer, and especially our ill willers to grow into great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the King in youth, namely, which is light of beliefe and soone perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>Yee remember, that King <hi>Edward</hi> himselfe, albeit he was both of age and discretion, yet was he ruled in many things by that faction, more then stood ther with his honour, or our profit, or with the commodity of any man else, except onely the immoderate advancement of themselves, which whether they thirsted sore after their owne weale or no, it were hard I thinke to guesse. And if some folkes friendship had not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

new friend made of an old foe, or to thinke that any onely kindenesse so sodainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in an houre, continued scantly yet a fortnight, should be deeper set in our stomackes then a long accustomed malice many yeeres rooted.</p>
                  <p>With these perswasions and writings, the Duke of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> set on fire them which were easie to kindle, and especially two, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings,</hi> and Lord Chamberlaine, both men of honour and of great power, the one by long succession from his Ancestors, the other by his Offices and the Kings favour. These two not bearing each to other so much love, as hatred both to the Queenes bloud, accorded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> that they would remove from the King all his Mothers
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53752:24"/>
friends, under the name of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> being advertised that the Lords about the King intended to bring him to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to his Coronation, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with such a number of their friends, that it should be hard for him to bring his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to passe, without the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling and gathering of people, and in manner of open warre, wherof the end he knew was doubtfull, and in the which the King being on the other side, his part should have the name and face of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</p>
                  <p>He secretly therefore by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers meanes, caused the Queene to be pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>swaded, that it was neither need, and should also be dangerous for the King to come up so strong; for as now, every Lord loved other, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53752:24"/>
no other thing studied for, but the triumph of his Coronation, and honour of the King. And if the Lords about the King should assemble, in the Kings name, much people, they should give the Lords betwixt whom and them there had beene some time debate, an occasion to feare and suspect, lest they should gather this people, not for the Kings safe-guard, whom no man impugned, but for their destruction, having more regard to their old variance, then to their new atonement; for the which cause, they on the other part might assemble men also for their defence, whose powers shee knew well stretched farre; and thus should all the Realme fall in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare, and of the mischief that thereof should ensue (which was likely to be not a little) the most harme was like to fall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53752:25"/>
where she least would, and then all the World would put her and her kindred in the blame; saying, That they had unwise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and untruly broken the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace, which the King her Husband had so prudently made between her kindred and his, which amity his Kinne had alwayes observed.</p>
                  <p>The Queene being thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, sent word to the King and to her Brother, that there was no cause nor need to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble any peope, and also the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> and other Lords of his side, wrote unto the King so reverently, and to the Queenes friends there so lovingly, that they nothing earthly mistrusting, brought the King toward <hi>London</hi> with a sober company in great haste (but not in good speed) till hee came to <hi>Northampton,</hi> and from thence hee removed to <hi>Stony
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53752:25"/>
Stratford.</hi> On which day, the two Dukes and their traine came to <hi>Northampton,</hi> faigning that <hi>Stony Stratford</hi> could not lodge them all, where they found the Earle <hi>Rivers,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the next morning to have followed the King, and to bee with him early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. So that night, the Dukes made to the Earl <hi>Rivers</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheere, but as soone as they were departed, very familiar, with great courtesie in open sight, and the Earle <hi>Rivers</hi> lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the two Dukes with a few of their privie friends fell to Councell, wherein they spent a great part of the night, and in the dawning of the day, they sent about privily to their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in their lodgings, to haste to horsebacke, for their Lords were in manner ready to ride, whereupon all their servants were ready ere the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53752:26"/>
servants were awake. Now had the Dukes taken the keyes of the Inne into their possession, so that none should issue out without their consent. And over this in the high way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Stony Stratford,</hi> they set certaine of their folkes that should cause and compell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe all persons that were passing from <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to <hi>Stony Stratford,</hi> saying that the Dukes themselves would be the first that should come to the King from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi>: thus they bare folks in hand. But when the Earle <hi>Rivers</hi> understood the Gates closed, and the wayes on every side beset, neither his servants, neither himselfe suffered to goe out, perceiving so great a thing without his knowledge, not begun for nought, comparing this present doing with the last nights cheere, in so few houres
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53752:26"/>
so great a change, marvellously misliked it. Howbeit, sith hee could not get away, hee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to keepe himselfe close, lest hee should seeme to hide himselfe for some secret feare of his owne fault, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he saw no such cause in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; wherefore on the surety of his owne conscience hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to goe to them, and to inquire what this matter might meane: Whom as soone as they saw, they began to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with him, affirming that he pretended to set distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and them, to bring them to confusion, which should not lye in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; and when he began, as he was an eloquent and well-spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken man, in goodly wise to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himselfe, they would not heare his answer, but tooke him by force and put him in ward. And then they moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53752:27"/>
on horsebacke and came in haste to <hi>Stony Stratford,</hi> where the King was going to horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, because hee would leave the lodging for them, for it was too straight for both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. And when they came to his presence, they alighted and their company about them, and on their knees salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and hee them gently received, nothing earthly knowing nor mistrusting as yet. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> said aloud, On afore Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Yeomen keepe your roomes, and therewith in the Kings presence they picked a quarrell to the Lord <hi>Richard Grey</hi> the Queenes sonne, and Brother to the Lord Marquesse, and halfe Brother to the King, saying, that hee and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse his Brother, and the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> his Uncle, had compassed to rule the King and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53752:27"/>
the Realme, and set variance betweene the estates, and to subdue and destroy the Noble Bloud of the Realme. And to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the accomplishment of the same, they said, the Lord Marquesse had entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and thence had taken out treasure, and sent men to the Sea, which things these Dukes knew well were done for a good purpose, and as very necessary, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the whole Counsell at <hi>London,</hi> but somewhat they must say: Unto the which words the king answered, what my Brother Marquesse hath done, I cannot say, but in good faith, I dare well answer for my Uncle <hi>Rivers</hi> and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here, that they bee inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of such matters. Yea, my Liege, quoth the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> they have kept the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of these matters farre from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53752:28"/>
the knowledge of your good Grace. And forth-with they arrested the Lord <hi>Richard</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Hawte,</hi> knights, in the Kings presence, and brought the King and all backe to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> where they tooke farther counsell in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. And there they sent from the King whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them, and set about him such servants as better pleased them then him. At which dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he wept and was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but it booted not. And at dinner, the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> sent a dish from his owne Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> praying him to be of good cheere, and all should be well: hee thanked him, and prayed the Messenger to beare it to his Nephew the Lord <hi>Richard</hi> with like words, whom he knew to have need of comfort, as one to whom such
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53752:28"/>
adversity was strange, but hee himselfe had beene alwayes enured therewith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could beare it the better. But for all this message, the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> sent the Lord <hi>Rivers,</hi> the Lord <hi>Richard</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Hawte</hi> into the North parts into divers pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but at last, all came to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> where they all foure were beheaded without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>In this manner as you have heard, the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> tooke on him the Governance of the young King, whom with much reverence hee conveighed towards <hi>London.</hi> These ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings came hastily to the Queene before midnight, by a very sore report, that the King her sonne was taken, and that her Brother and her other son, and other her friends were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53752:29"/>
and sent, no man knew whither. With this heavie ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings the Queene bewailed her childs ruine, her friends mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, and her owne misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, cursing the time that ever she was perswaded to leave the gathering of people to bring up the King with a great power, but that was passed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now she tooke her younger sonne, the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and her daughter, and went out of the Palace of <hi>Westminster</hi> into the Sanctuary, and there lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Abbots place, and shee and all her children and company were registred for Sanctuary persons. The same night there came to Doctor <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theram</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and Lord Chancelour, a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger from the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine to <hi>Yorke place</hi> beside <hi>Westminster</hi>; the Messenger was brought to the Bishops Bed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53752:29"/>
side, and declared to him that the Dukes were gone back with the young King to <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and declared further, that the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> his master sent him word, that hee should feare nothing, for all should be well. Well, (quoth the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop) be it as well as it will, it will never be so well as wee have seene it, and then the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger departed. Whereupon the Bishop called up all his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and tooke with him the great Seale, and came before day to the Queen, about whom hee found much heavinesse, rumble, haste, businesse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance and carriage of her stuffe into Sanctuary; every man was busie to carry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beare and convey stuffe, chests and fardels, no man was unoccupied, and some carried more then they were commanded to another place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:53752:30"/>The Queene sat alone below on the Rushes all desolate and dismaid, whom the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop comforted in the best manner that he could, shewing her, that the matter was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so sore as she took it for, and that hee was put in good hope and out feare by the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage sent to him from the Lord <hi>Hastings.</hi> A woe worth him, quoth the Queene, for it is hee that goeth about to destroy me and my bloud. Madame, quoth he, be of good comfort, and I assure you, if they crowne any other King then your sonne, whom they now have, we shall on the morrow crowne his Brother, whom you have here with you. And here is the Great Seale, which in likewise as your Noble Husband deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to mee, so I deliver it to you, to the use of your Son, &amp; therewith delivered her the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53752:30"/>
Great Seale, and departed home in the dawning of the day. And when hee opened his windowes and looked on the <hi>Thames,</hi> hee might see the River full of Boats, of the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> his servants wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that no person should goe to Sanctuary, nor none should passe unsearched.</p>
                  <p>Then was there great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and commotion in the Citie, and in other places, the people diversly divined upon this dealing. And divers Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, either for favour of the Queene, or for feare of themselves, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled companies, and went stocking together in harnesse. And many also, for that they recounted this demanour at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, not so specially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst other Lords, as against the King himselfe, in distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of his Coronation,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53752:31"/>
therefore they assembled by and by together, to commune of this matter at <hi>London.</hi> The Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> fearing that it would be ascribed (as it was indeed) to over-much lightnesse, that he so suddenly had yeelded up the Great Seale to the Queene, to whom the custody thereof nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained without especiall commandement of the King, secretly sent for the Seale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and brought it with him, after the accustomed manner, to meete with the Lords.</p>

And one thing hee advised them to beware of, that they judged not the matter too farre forth ere they knew the truth, nor turning their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate grudges into the common hurt, irriting and provoking men unto anger; and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Kings Coronation, toward which the Dukes were comming, for that, then might peradventure bring the matter

so farre out of joynt, that it should never bee brought in frame againe, which if it should hap as it were likely to come to a field, though all parties were in all other things equall, yet should the authority bee on that side, where the King is himselfe; with these perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> whereof part hee himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, and of part hee knew well the contrary, these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions were somewhat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased.

And for the colour thereof, such of the Dukes servants as rod with the Carts of their stuffe which was taken, among the which stuffe, no marvell though some were harnesse, which at the breaking up of such an houshold must be brought away or cast away, they shewed to the people, and as they went, said, Lo, here be the Barrels of harnesse that these Traytors had privily conveyed in their carriages to destroy the Noble Lords with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.

Wherefore incontinent at the next meeting of the Lords in Councell, hee propounded to them, that it was an heinous thing of the Queene, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of great malice toward the Kings Councellors, that she should keepe the Kings Brother in Sanctuary from him whose speciall pleasure and comfort were to have his Brother with him, and that to bee done by her to no other intent, but to bring all the Lords in an oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53752:34"/>
and murmure of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as though they were not to bee trusted with the Kings Brother, which Lords were by the whole assent of the Nobles of the Realme, appointed as the Kings neere friends, to the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of his Royall Person, the prosperity whereof (quoth he) standeth not alone in keeping from enemies and evill dyet, but partly also in recreation and moderate pleasure, which hee cannot take in his tender youth in the company of old and ancient persons, but in the familiar conversation of those that be not farre under, nor farre above his age, and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, of estate convenient to accompany his Majesty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with whom rather then with his owne Brother? and if any man thinke this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration light (I thinke no man so thinketh that loveth the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53752:35"/>
King) let him consider, that sometime without small things greater cannot stand, and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it redoundeth greatly to the dishonour of the Kings high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and of all us that bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Grace, to have it come in any mans mouth, not in this Realme onely, but also in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lands (as evill words walke farre) that the Kings Brother should bee faine to keepe Sanctuary. For every man will judge, that no man will so doe for nought, and such opinions fastned in mens hearts be hard to bee wrested out, and may grow to more griefe then any man here can divine. Wherefore, mee think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it were not the worst to send to the Queene some hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and trusty personage, such as tendreth the Kings weale and the honour of his Counce, and is also in credit and favour with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53752:35"/>
her; for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> considerations none seemeth more meetly to me the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reverend Father, my Lord Cardinall, Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> who may in this matter doe most good of all men, if it please him to take the paine, which I doubt not of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hee will not refuse, for the Kings sake &amp; ours, and wealth of the young Duke himselfe, the Kings most honourable Brother, and for the comfort of my Soveraigne Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, my most dearest Nephew; considering, that thereby shall be ceased the slanderous rumor and obloquy now going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and the hurts avoided that thereof might ensue, and then must rest and quietnesse grow to all the Realme. And if shee perhaps be so obstinate, and so precisely set in her own will and opinion, that neither his wise and faithfull advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53752:36"/>
can move her, nor any mans reason satisfie her, then shall wee by my advice, by the Kings authority fetch him out of that prison, and bring him to his Noble presence, in whose continuall company hee shall be so well cherished, and so honourably intreated, that all the world shall to our honour and her reproach, perceive that it was onely malice, froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and folly, that caused her to keepe him there. This is my minde for this time, except that any of you, my Lords, perceive to the contrary, for never shall I by Gods Grace so<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed my selfe unto mine owne will, but I shall bee ready to change it upon your better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                  <p>When the Protectour had said, all the Councell affirmed that the motion was good and reasonable, and to the King
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53752:36"/>
and the Duke honourable, and a thing that should cease great murmure in the Realme, if the Mother might by good meanes be induced to deliver him; which thing the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whom they all agreed also to be most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient thereunto, tooke upon him to move her, and thereto to doe his uttermost endeavor. Howbeit if shee could in no wise be intreated with her good will to deliver him, then thought he and such of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality as were present, that it were not in any wise to bee attempted, to take him out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her will, for it would be a thing that should turne to the grudge of all men, and high displeasure of God, if the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of that place should bee broken, which had so many yeeres been kept, which both Kings and Popes had granted
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53752:37"/>
and confirmed, which ground was sanctified by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe more then five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres agoe. And sith that time, was never so unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout a King, that ever enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that sacred priviledge to violate, nor so holy a Bishop that durst presume the Church of the same to consecrate: and therefore, quoth the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, God forbid that any man should, for any earthly enterprise, breake the immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and liberty of that sacred Sanctuary, that hath beene the safeguard of so many a good mans life: but I trust, quoth he, wee shall not need it, but for any manner of need I would we should not doe it, I trust that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hee with reason shall bee contented, and all things in good manner obtained. And if it hap that I bring it not to passe, yet shall I further it to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53752:37"/>
my best power, so that you all shall perceive my good will, diligence, and endeavour: But the Mothers dread and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish feare shall bee the let if any be.</p>
                  <p>Nay, womanish froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, quoth the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> for I dare take it on my soule, that she well knoweth that shee needeth no such thing to feare, either for her sonne or for her selfe. For as for her, here is no man that will be at warre with women, would God some men of her kin were wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men too, and then should all be soon at rest. Howbeit, there is none of her kinne the lesse lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for that they be of her kin, but for their owne evill deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p>And put the case, that wee neither loved her nor her kin, yet there were no cause why wee should hate the Kings No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53752:38"/>
Brother, to whose Grace wee our selves bee kin, whose Honour if shee desired as our dishonour, and as much regard tooke to his wealth as to her owne will, she could be as loth to suffer him to be absent from the King as any of us, if she had any wit, as would God she had as good will as shee hath frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard wit. For shee thinketh her selfe no wiser then some that are here, of whose faithfull mindes she nothing doubteth, but verily beleeveth and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that they would be as sory of his harme as her owne selfe, and yet they would have him from her if shee abide there.</p>
                  <p>And we all, I thinke, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that both her children bee with her, if shee came from thence, and abide in such a place where they may be with their honour. Now if shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53752:38"/>
in the, deliverance of him, to follow the wisedome of them, whose wisdome shee knoweth, whose approbate fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity shee well trusteth; it is easie to perceive frowardnesse letteth her, and not feare. But goe to, suppose that she feareth (as who may let her to feare her owne shadow) the more we ought to feare to leave him in her hands, for if shee cast such fond doubts that shee feare his hurt, then will she feare that he shall be fetcht thence, for shee will soone thinke, that if men were set (which God forbid on so great a mischiefe) the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary wil little let them, which Sanctuary good men, as mee thinketh, might without sinne somewhat lesse regard then they doe.</p>
                  <p>Now then, if she doubt lest he might bee fetched from her, is it not likely that she will send
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53752:39"/>
him somewhere out of the Realme? Verily I looke for none other. And I doubt not but she now as sore mindeth it, as wee minde the let thereof: And if shee might hap to bring that purpose to passe, as it were no great mastery to doe, we let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her alone, all the world would say, that wee were a sort of wise Counsellors about a King, to let his Brother be cast away under our noses. And therefore I ensure you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for my minde, I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ger her stomack; fetch him away, then leave him there till her feare or fond froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse convey him away, and yet will I breake no Sanctuary, for verily sith the priviledge of that place,<note place="margin">Of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries.</note> and other of that sort, have so long continued, I would not goe about to breake it, but if they were now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, I would not be hee should
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53752:39"/>
make them; yet will not I say nay, but it is a deed of pittie, that such men as the chance of the Sea, or their evill debtors have brought into povertie, should have some place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to keepe in their bodies out of the danger of their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell creditors. And if it fortune the Crowne to come in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it hath done before this time, while each part taketh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Traytors, I thinke it necessary to have a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for both: But as for theeves and murderers, whereof these places be full, and which never fall from their craft after they once fall thereunto, it is pittie that every Sanctuary should serve them, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wilfull murtherers, whom God commandeth to bee taken from the Altar, and to bee put to death. And where it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then in these cases,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53752:40"/>
there is no need of Sanctuaries, appointed by God in the Old Law. For if necessity of his owne defence, or misfortune drived him to that deed, then a pardon serveth him, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is granted of course, or the King of pitty and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion giveth.</p>
                  <p>Now looke how few Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary men there be, whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity or misfortune compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to goe thither: And then see on the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ide, what a sort there be commonly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of such, whom wilfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftinesse hath brought to naught; What a rabble of Theeves, Murtherers and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hainous Traytors be, and that in two places especially, the one at the elbow of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the other in the very bowels, I dare well avow it, if you weigh the good that they doe, with the hurt that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53752:40"/>
of them, yee shall finde it much better to lose both then to have both. And this, I say, although they were not abused, (as they now bee and so long have been) that I feare me ever they will be while men be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to set their hands to the amendment, as though God and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of ungracious living. Now unthrifts riot and run in debt upon boldnesse of these places; yea, and rich men run thither with poor mens goods, there they build, there they spend and bid their creditors goe whistle. Mens Wives run thither with their Husbands Plate, and say they dare not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with their Husbands for beating; Theeves bring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stolne goods, and live thereon. There devise they new robberies nightly, and steale out and rob, rive, and kill
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53752:41"/>
men, and come again into those places, as though those places gave them not only a safeguard for the harme that they have done, but a license also to doe more mischiefe: howbeit, much of this great abusion, (if wise men would set their hands there unto) might be amended, with great thankes of God and no breache of the priviledge. The conclusion is, sith it is so long agoe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wot not what Pope and what Prince, more pitious then politicke, hath granted it, and other men sensible of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feare, have not broken it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us take paines with it, and let it stand a Gods Name in his force, as farre forth as reason will, which is not so farre forth as may serve to let us of the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forth of this Noble man, to his honour and wealth, out of that place, in the which hee neither is nor can be a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53752:41"/>
or priviledged man. A Sanctuary ever serveth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the body of that man that standeth in danger abroad, not of great hurt only, but of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hurt; for against unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hurts and harmes, no Pope nor King intended to privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any one place, wherein it is lawfull for one man to doe another man wrong. That no man unlawfully take hurt, that liberty, the King, the Law, and very nature forbiddeth in every place, and maketh in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, for every man, every place a Sanctuary; but whereas man is by lawfull meanes in perill, there needeth he the tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some speciall privilege, which is the onely ground of all Sanctuaries, from which necessity this Noble Prince is farre, whose love to his King, Nature and kindred proveth, whose innocencie to all the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53752:42"/>
world, his tender youth affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and so Sanctuary as for him is not necessary, and none he can have. Men come not to Sanctuary, as they come to Baptisme, to require it by God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, he must aske it himselfe that must have it, and reason, sith no man hath cause to have it, but whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of his own fault maketh him have need to require it. What will then hath yonder Babe, which if hee had discretion to require it, if need were, I dare say would be now right angry with them that keep him there? And I would thinke without any scruple of conscience, without any breach of priviledge, to bee somewhat more homely with them that be their Sanctuary men indeed, that if one goe to Sanctuary with another mans goods, why should not the King, leaving his body at liberty, satisfie the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53752:42"/>
party of his goods even within the Sanctuary; for neither King nor Pope can give any place such a priviledge, that it shall discharge a man of his debts, being able to pay.</p>
                  <p>And with that, divers of the Clergy that were there present, whether they said it for his pleasure, or as they thought, agreed plainely by the Law of God and of the Church, that a Sanctuary man should be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in payment of his debts, and stolne goods to the owner, and onely liberty reserved to him, to get his living by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his hands. Verily, quoth the Duke, I thinke ye say very truth: And what if a mans wife take Sanctuary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee list to run from her husband? I would thinke, if she can alledge no other cause, hee may lawfully, without any displeasure done to Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:53752:43"/>
take her out of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church by the arme. And if no body may bee taken out of Sanctuary, because he saith hee will abide there, then if a child will take Sanctuary, because he feareth to goe to Schoole, his Master must let him alone. And as simple as that example is, yet is there lesse reason in our case then in it; for there, though it be a childish feare, yet is there at the least some feare, and herein is no feare at all. And verily I have heard of Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary men, but I never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Sanctuary children; and therefore, as for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of my minde, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may deserve to have need of it, if they thinke it for their surety, let them keepe it, but he can be no Sanctuary man, that hath no other discretion to desire it, nor malice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, whose life nor liberty
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53752:43"/>
can by any lawful processe stand in danger: and hee that taketh one out of Sanctuary to do him good, I say plainely hee brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>When the Duke hand done, the temporall men wholly, and the most part of the spirituall men also, thinking no hurt earthly meant toward the yong Babe, condescend in effect, that if hee were not delivered hee should be fetched out. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, they thought it best in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of all manner of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that the Cardinall should first assay, to get him with her good will. And thereupon all the Councell came to the Star-Chamber at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the Cardinall leaving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and other Lords in the Starre-Chamber, departed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sanctuary to the Queen, accompanied with certaine Lords, were it for the respect
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53752:44"/>
of his honour, or that shee should by the persons of so many, perceive that his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand was not onely one mans minde, or were it for that the Protector intended not in this matter to trust one man alone, or else if she finally were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to keepe him, some of the company had peradventure some secret instruction incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, mauger her will, to take him, and to leave her no respit to conveigh him.</p>
                  <p>When the Queene and these Lords were come together in presence, the Cardinall shewed unto her, that it was thought to the Lord Protectour and the whole Councell, that her kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Kings Brother in that place highly sounded, not onely to the grudge of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their obloquy, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the importable griefe and displeasure of the Kings Royall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53752:44"/>
Majesty, to whose Grace it were a singular comfort to have his naturall Brother in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and it was to both their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours, and hers also, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him in Sanctuary, as though the one Brother stood in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and perill of the other. And hee shewed her farther, that the whole Councell had sent him to require of her the delivery of him, that hee might bee brought to the Kings presence at his liberty out of that place, which men reckoned as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and there should he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned according to his estate and degree, and she in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, should both do great good to the Realme, pleasure to the Councell, profit to her selfe, succour to her friends that were in distresse, and over that, which he knew well shee specially ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, not onely great comfort and honour to the King, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53752:45"/>
also to the young Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, both whose great weale it were to be together, aswel for many greater causes, as also for both their disport and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which things the Lords esteemed not light, though it seemed light, well pondering that their youth without recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and play cannot endure, nor any stranger for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of both their ages and estates so meet in that point for any of them, as the either of them for the other.</p>
                  <p>My Lord (quoth the Queen) I say not nay, but that it were very convenient that this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman whom you require were in the company of the King his Brother, and in good faith, me thinketh it were as great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to them both, as for yet a while to be in the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their Mother, the tender age considered of the elder of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53752:45"/>
them both, but especially the younger, which besides his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, that also needeth good looking to, hath a while beene so sore diseased with sicknesse, and is so newly, rather little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended then well recovered, that I dare put no person earthly in trust with his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, but my selfe onely, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering there is, as Physicians say, and as wee also finde, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the perill in the resiluation that was in the first sicknesse, with which disease Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sore laboured, forewearied and weakned, waxeth the lesse able to beare out a new surfeit. And albeit there might bee found other that would haply doe their best unto him, yet is there none that either knoweth better how to order him then I, that so long have kept him, or is more tenderly like to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish him, then his owne Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53752:46"/>
that bare him. No man denyeth, good Madame, quoth the Cardinall, that your Grace of all folke were most necessary about your children, and so would all the Councell, not onely be content, but also glad that it were, if it might stand with your pleasure, to be in such place as might stand with their honour. But if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point your selfe to tarry here, then thinke they it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> were with the King honourably at his liberty to the comfort of them both, then here as a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary man to both their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honors and obloquy, sith there is not alway so great necessity to have the child with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that occasion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time may be such, that it should be more expedient to keep him elsewhere, which in this well appeareth, that at such time
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53752:46"/>
that your most dearest sonne then Prince and now King, should for his honour and good order of the Country keepe houshold in <hi>Wales</hi> farre out of your keeping, your Grace was well content therewith your selfe. Not very well content (quoth the Queene) and yet the case is not like, for the one was then in health, the other is now sicke, in which case I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell greatly why my Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector is so desirous to have him in keeping, where if the childe in his sicknesse miscarried by nature, yet might hee run into slander and suspition of fraud. And they call it a thing so sore against my childes honour and theirs also, that hee abideth in this place, it is all their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, there to suffer his abode, where no man doubteth h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53752:47"/>
intend not to come forth and danger my selfe after other my friends, which would God were rather here in surety with me, then I were there in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with them.</p>
                  <p>Why Madame (quoth the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>) know you any thing, why they should bee in danger? Nay verily (quoth she) nor why they should be in prison neither, as they now be, but I trow it is no great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, though I feare lest those that have not letted to put them in durance without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, will let as little to procure their destruction without cause. The Cardinall made a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> that he should harpe no more upon that string; and then said hee to the Queene, that he nothing doubted, but those Lords of her kinne, the which remained under arrest, should upon the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53752:47"/>
matter examined doe well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and as toward her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble person, neither was, nor could be any manner of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>Whereby should I trust that (quoth the Queene) in that I am guiltlesse, as though they were guilty, in that I am with their enemies better beloved then they, when they hate them for my sake, in that I am so neere to the King, and how farre be they off that would helpe, as God send Grace they hurt not. And therefore as yet I purpose not to depart hence: As for this Gentleman, my son, I minde he shall bee where I am till I see further, for I see some men so greedy without any substantiall cause to have him, which maketh mee much more warie and scrupulous to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him.</p>
                  <p>Truly Madame (quoth the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53752:48"/>
Cardinall) the further that yee bee to deliver him, the further be other men to suffer you to keepe him, lest your causelesse feare might cause you farther to conveigh him, and many thinke he can here have no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, which can have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will to aske it, nor yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or offence to need it. And therefore, they reckon no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge broken, although they fetch him out of Sanctuary, which if you finally refuse to deliver him, I thinke verily the Councell will enfranchise him, so much dread hath my Lord his Uncle, for the tender love he beareth him, lest your Grace should send him away.</p>
                  <p>Ah, quoth the Queene, hath hee so tender a zeale to him, that hee feareth nothing, but lest hee should escape him? Thinketh hee, that I would send him hence, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53752:48"/>
in the plight to send out? and in what place could I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon him sure, if he be not sure in this Sanctuary? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was there never Tyrant yet so devillish, that durst at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to breake the priviledge, and I trust God is now as strong to withstand his adversaries as ever he was. But my sonne can deserve no Sanctuary, you say, and therefore hee can not have it, forsooth the Lord Protector hath sent a goodly glose, by the which that place that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send a theefe, may not save an innocent: but he is in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor hath no need thereof, I would God hee had not. Troweth the Protector, (I pray God he may prove a Protector, rather then a destroyer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto his painted processe draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) that it is not honourable that the Duke bide here? it were more comfortable to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53752:49"/>
them both, that he were with his Brother, because the King lacketh a play-fellow, yea bee sure, I pray God send him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter play-fellowes then him that maketh so high a matter upon such a trifling pretext, as though there could none bee found to play with the King, but that his Brother, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath no lust to play for sicknesse, must come out of Sanctuary, out of his safeguard, to play with him; as though that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces so young as they be, could not play without their Peeres, or children could not play without their kindred, with whom for the most part they agree much worse then with strangers. But the childe, you say, cannot require the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, who told the Protector so? Aske him, and you shall heare him aske it, and so shall hee, if yee will. Howbeit, this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53752:49"/>
is a strange matter; suppose hee could not aske it, and thinke he would not aske it, and imagine he would aske to goe out, if I say he shall not: Note, if I aske the priviledge for my selfe, I say, that hee that against my will taketh out him, breaketh Sanctuary. Serveth this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for my person onely, or for my goods too? you may not from hence take my Horse from me, if I stale him not nor owe you nothing: then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it, that you may not take my childe from me, hee is also my ward, for as farre as my learned Councell sheweth me, he hath nothing by descent holden by Knights service, but by socage: then the Law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me his guardian, then may no man lawfully (I suppose) take my ward from mee out of this place, without the breach of Sanctuary, and if my privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53752:50"/>
could not serve him, nor he aske it for himselfe, yet sith the Law committeth to me the custody of him, I may require it for him, expect the Law give the Infant a guardian onely for his goods, discharging him of the care and safe-keeping of his body, for which onely both goods and lands serve: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here intend I to keep him, sith mans Law serveth the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian to keepe the infant, and the Law of Nature willeth the Mother to keep the child, and Gods Law priviledgeth the Sanctuary, and the Sanctuary priviledgeth my Sonne, sith I feare to put him to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors hands, that hath his Brother already, which is (if both failed) inheritor to the Crowne as heire Male, as hee saith. The cause of my feare no man hath to doe to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and yet feare I no further
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53752:50"/>
then the Law feareth, which as learned men tell mee, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth every man the custody of them, by whose death he may inherit lesse Land then a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>I can say no more, but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hee be that breaketh this holy Sanctuary, I pray God send him shortly need of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, when he may not come to it, for I would not that my mortall enemy should be taken out of Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinall perceived that the Queene ever the longer the farther off, and also that shee began to kindle and chafe, and speak sore biting words against the Protector, and such as hee neither beleeved, and also was loth to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re, he said to her, for a finall conclusion, that hee would no more dispute the matter, and if she were content to deliver the Duke to him and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53752:51"/>
to the other Lords there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, hee durst lay his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule both in pledge, not onely for his surety, but also for his estate, and surely he knew nor suspected any cause but he might so doe (but hee knew not all.) And further he said, if shee would give him a resolute answer to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hee would therewith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part incontinent, and shift who so would with his businesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, for he never intended further to move her in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the which shee thought that he and all other also, save her selfe, lacked either wit or dull truth; Wit, if they were so that they nothing could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what the Protector inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and if they should procure her sonne to be delivered into his hands, in whom they should perceive towards the child any evill will intended, then shee
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53752:51"/>
might thinke all the Councell both evill advised, and of little fidelity to their Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Queene with these words stood in a great study, and forasmuch as she saw the Lord Cardinall more readie to depart then the remnant, and the Protector himselfe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand, so that shee verily thought that shee could not keepe him there, but he should bee incontinent taken thence, and to conveigh him elsewhere, neither had shee time to serve her, nor place determined, nor persons appointed to conveigh him, and so all things were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, when this message came so suddenly on her, nothing lesse looking for, then to have him out of Sanctuary, which she knew now men to be set in all places about, that hee could not be conveighed out untaken, and party as shee thought it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53752:52"/>
might fortune her feare to bee false: so well shee knew it was either needlesse or bootlesse. Wherefore, if shee should needs goe from him, shee deemed best to deliver him, and especially of the Cardinals faith shee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting, nor of some other Lords whom shee saw there, which as she feared lest they might be deceived, so well was she assured, that they would not be corrupted: then thought she that it would make them the more warily to looke to him, and the more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly to see his surety, if shee with her owne hands betooke him them by trust, and at the last she tooke the young Duke by the hand, and said unto the Lords, my Lord (quoth shee) and all my Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither am I so unwise to mistrust your wits, nor so suspicious to mistrust your truths: of the which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53752:52"/>
thing I purpose to make such a proofe, that if either of both lacked in you, might turn both me to great sorrow, the Realm to much harme, and you to great reproach. For loe, here is, quoth shee, this Gentleman, whom I doubt not, but I could keepe safe if I would, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any man say, and I doubt not also, but there be some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad so deadly enemies unto my Bloud, that if they knew where any of it lay in their owne body, they would let it out: wee have also experience, that the desire of a Kingdome knoweth no kindred, the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath beene the Brothers bane, and may the Nephewes be sure of the Uncle? each of these children are others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, while they be asunder, and each of their lives lyeth in others body, keepe one safe and both be sure, and nothing to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53752:53"/>
both more perilous then both to be in one place: for a wise Merchant never adventureth all his goods in one Ship. All this notwithstanding, here I deliver him and his Brother in him, to keepe to your hands, of whom I shall aske them both before God and the world. Faithfull you be, and that I know well, and I know you be wise, and of power and strength if you list to keep him, for you lacke no helpe of your selves, nor need to lacke no helpe in this case, and if you cannot else-where, then may you leave him here: But onely one thing I beseech you, for the trust that his Father put you in ever, and for the trust I put you in now, that as far as you thinke that I feare too much, yee bee well ware that you feare not too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. And therewithall she said to the Childe, Farewell mine
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53752:53"/>
owne sweet Sonne, God send you good keeping, let me once kisse you ere you goe, for God knoweth when we shall kisse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againe, and therewith she kissed him, and blessed him, and turned her backe and wept, going her way, leaving the poore innocent childe weeping as fast as the Mother.</p>
                  <p>When the Cardinall and the other Lords had received the young Duke, they brought him into the Star-Chamber, where the Protector tooke him into his armes, and kissed him with these words; now welcome my Lord with all my very heart, and hee said in that of likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood even as hee inwardly thought, and thereupon forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with brought him to the King his Brother into the Bishops Palace at <hi>Pauls,</hi> and from thence through the Citie hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably into the Tower, out of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53752:54"/>
which after that day they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came abroad. When the Protector had both the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in his possession, yea and that they were in a sure place, he then began to thirst to see the end of his enterprise. And to avoid all suspition, hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all the Lords which hee knew to be faithfull to the King, to assemble at <hi>Baynards Castle,</hi> to commune of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Coronation, while he and other of his complices and of his affinity, at <hi>Crosbies Place,</hi> contrived the contrary, and to make the Protectour King; to which Councell there were adhibited very few, and they very secret.</p>
                  <p>Then began here and there some muttering amongst the people, as though all things should not long be well, though they knew not what they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor wherefore: were it,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53752:54"/>
that before such great things, mens hearts (of a secret instinct of Nature) misgive them, as the South wind sometime swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of it selfe before a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest: or were it that some one man haply somewhat percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, filled many men with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition, though hee shewed few men what he knew: howbeit, the dealing it selfe made men to muse on the matter, though the Councel were close, for by little and litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e all folke drew from the Tower where the King was, and drew to <hi>Crosbies Place,</hi> so that the Protector had all the resort, &amp; the King was in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner desolate. While some made suit unto them that had the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, some of them were by their friends secretly warned, that it might haply turn to no good to them, to be too much attendant on the King without the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors appointment, which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53752:55"/>
removed diverse of the kings old servants from him, and set new in their places about him.</p>
                  <p>Thus many thinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming together, partly by chance, and partly by purpose, caused at length, not common people onely, which waver with the wind, but wise men also and some Lords to marke the matter and muse therupon: insomuch that the Lord <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> which afterward was Earle of <hi>Derby,</hi> wisely mistrusted it, and said to the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> that he much misliked these two severall Councels: for while we, quoth he, talke of one matter at the one place, little know we whereof they talke in the other: peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Lord, quoth the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi>; on my life, never doubt you, for while one man is there, which is never thence, neither can there bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53752:55"/>
thing once minded that should sound amisse towards me, but it should be in my eares as soone as out of their mouths. This hee meant by <hi>Catesby</hi> which was neere of his seeret counsell, and whom hee most familiarly used in his weighty matters, putting no man in so speciall trust as hee, reckoning himselfe to bee beloved of no man more then he; knowing well that there was no man so much beholding to him as was this <hi>Catesby,</hi> which was a man well learned in the lawes of this Realme, and by the speciall favour of the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> in good authority, and bore much rule in the countries of <hi>Leicester</hi> &amp; <hi>Northampton,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> power lay. But surely great pittie was it that he had not more thruth or lesse wit, for his dissimulation onely, kept all that mischiefe

                     </gap>uth the Protector and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> did seeme to shew very much countenance unto the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> and kept him often in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And undoubtedly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector loved him well, and loth he was to have lost him, saving for feare lest his life should have quailed their purpose; for the which cause hee moved <hi>Catesby</hi> to prove with some words cast out afarre off, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee could thinke it possible
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53752:56"/>
to winne the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> to their part. <hi>But Catesby,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee assayed him or assayed him not, reported unto him that hee found him so fast, and heard him speake so terrible words, that he durst no further breake unto him: and of a truth the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> of very trust shewed unto <hi>Catesby</hi> the mistrust that others began to have in the matter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fearing least their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might with the Lord <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings</hi> diminish his credit, whereunto onely all the matter leaned; procured the Protectour hastily to rid him, and much the rather, for he trusted by his death to obtaine much of the rule which the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> bare in his countrey; the onely desire whereof, was the the thing that induced him to bee procurer, and one of the specia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest contrivers of all this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53752:57"/>
treason. Whereupon the Lord Protector caused a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to bee set at the Tower on the friday the thirteenth day <hi>Iune,</hi> where was much commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the honorable solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Coronation, of the which the time appointed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached so neare, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants were a making day and night at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes killed, which afterwards was cast away.</p>
                  <p>These Lords thus sitting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning of this matter, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector came in among them about nine of the clocke, salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them curteously, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himselfe that hee had beene from them so long, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merrily that he had beene a sleepe that day. And after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle talking with them, he said to the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> my Lord, you have very good strawberies in your garden at <hi>Holbourne,</hi> I
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53752:57"/>
require you let us have a messe of them. Gladly (my Lord, quoth he) I would I had some better thing as ready at your pleasure as that, and with that in all hast he sent his servant for a dish of Strawberies. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour set the Lords fast on communing, and thereupon prayed them to spare him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and so he departed and came againe betweene ten and eleven of the clocke into the chamber, all changed with a sowre angry countenance, knitting the browes, frowning and fretting, gnawing of his lips and so set him downe in his place. All the Lords were dismayed, and sore marvelled at this manner and suddaine change, what hee should ayle. When he had sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a while, thus hee began: What were they worthy to have, that compasse and imagine the destruction of mee being so
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53752:58"/>
neare of blood to the King and Protector of this his Royall Realme? At which question, all the Lords sate sore astonied, musing much by whom the question should bee meant, of which every man knew himself cleere.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> who for the familiarity that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, thought he might be boldest with him, answered and said, that they were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e to be punished as haynous traytors whatsoever they were, and all the other affirmed the same: that is (quoth he) yonder Sorceresse, my brothers wife, &amp; others with her, meaning the Queene: at these words many of the Lords were sore abashed which favored her, but the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> was better content in his minde, that it was moved by her, then by any other that hee loved better, albeit his heart
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53752:58"/>
grudged that hee was not afore made of the counsell of this matter, as well as hee was of the taking of her kindred, and of their putting to death, which were by his assent before devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be beheaded at <hi>Pomfrete,</hi> this self same day, in the which he was not aware that it was by others devised, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe should the same day be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed at <hi>London</hi>: then said the Protectour, See in what wise that Sorceresse, and others of her councell, as <hi>Shores</hi> wife with her affinitie, have by their sorcery and witchcraft thus wasted my body: and therewith plucked up his doublet sleeve to his elbow on his left arme, where hee shewed a werish wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered arme, and small, as it was never other. And therefor eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans minde misgave them, well perceiving that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was but a quarrell; for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53752:59"/>
they knew that the Queene was both too wise to goe about any such folly, &amp; also if she would, yet she would not make <hi>Shores</hi> wife of her counsell, whom of al women she most hated, as that concubine whom the King her husband most loved.</p>
                  <p>Also, there was no man there but knew that his arme was ever such since the day of his birth: Neverthelesse the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> which from the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> kept <hi>Shores</hi> wife, on whom he som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doted in the Kings life, saving it is said that he forbare her for reverence towards his King, or else of a certaine kind of fidelity towards his friend; Yet now his heart somewhat grudged to have her whom hee loved so highly accused, and as he knew well, untruly; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he answered and said, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely my Lord, if they have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53752:59"/>
so done, they bee worthy of haynous punishment. What, quoth the Protectour, thou ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest mee, I thinke with if and with and, I tell thee they have done it, and that I will make it good on thy body, traytor. And therewith (as in a great anger) he strooke his fist on the boord a great rappe; at which token given, one cryed treason without the chamber, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a doore clapped, and men in armes came rushing in, as many as the chamber could hold. And anone the Protector said to the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thee Traytour: what me my Lord quoth he? yes thou Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, quoth the Protector. And one let fly at the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> who shrunke at the stroke, and fell under the Table, or else his head had been cleft to the teeth, for as suddenly as he shrunk; yet the blood ran about his eares.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53752:60"/>
Then was the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and Doctour <hi>Morton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> and divers others ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and bestowed in severall chambers, save the Lord <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings</hi> (whom the Protectour commanded to speede and shrive him apace) for by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (quoth he) I will not dine till I see thy head off. It booted him not to aske why, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily hee tooke a Priest at aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and made a short shrift, for a longer would not be suffered, the Protectour made so much hast to his dinner, who might not goe to it till this murther were done, for saving of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious oath. So was hee brought forth into the greene besides the Chappell within the Tower, and his head layed downe on a logge of timber that lay there for building of the Chappell, and there ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannously
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53752:60"/>
stricken off; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his body and head were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred at <hi>Windsor</hi> by his Master King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, Late deceased.</p>
                  <p>A miraculous case it is to heare, either the warnings that he should have avoyded, or the tokens of that hee could not avoid. For the next night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> sent to him a trusty messenger at midnight in all the haste, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to rise and ride away with him, for hee was disposed utterly no longer for to abide, for he had a fearefull dreame in the which hee thought that a Bore with his tuskes so rased them both by the heads, that the blood ran about both their shoulders; and for asmuch as the Protectour gave the Bore for his cognisance, hee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that it should be he. This dreame made such a fearefull
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53752:61"/>
impression in his heart, that he was throughly determined no longer to tarry, but had his horse ready, if the Lord <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings</hi> would goe with him. So that they would ride so farre that night, that they should bee out of danger by the next day. A good Lord (quoth the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi>) to the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, leaneth my Lord thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster so much to such trifles, and hath hee such faith in dreames, which either his owne feare fantasieth, or doe rise in the nights rest by reason of the daies thought? Tell him it is plaine witchcraft to beleeve in such dreames, which if they were tokens of things to come, why thinketh hee not that wee might as likely make them true by our going if we were caught and brought backe, (as friends flyers) for then had the bore a cause likely to rase us with his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53752:61"/>
tuskes, as folkes that fled for some falshood: wherfore either there is perill, but indeed there is none, or if any be, it is rather in going then abiding. And if wee must needes fall into perill one way or other, yet had I rather that men should see it were by other mens falshood, then thinke it were either our owne fault or faint feeble heart, and therefore goe to thy Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and commend me to him, and tell him I pray him to bee merry and have no feare, for I assure him, I am assured of the man he wotteth of, as I am sure of mine owne hand. God send grace (quoth the messenger) and so departed. Certaine it is also, that in riding towards the Tower the same morning in which he was beheaded, his horse that hee accustomed to ride on, stumbled twice or thrice almost to the falling,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53752:62"/>
which thing although it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to them daily to whom no mischance is towards, yet hath it beene as an old evill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken observed as a going toward mischiefe. Now this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth was no warning, but an envious scorne: the same mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before he was up from his bed, where <hi>Shores</hi> wife lay with him all night, there came to him sir <hi>Thomas Haward</hi> son to the Lord <hi>Haward</hi> (which Lord was once of the priviest of the Lord Protectours counsell and doing) as it were of curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to accompany him to the councell, but of truth sent by the Lord Protectour to hast him thitherward.</p>
                  <p>This sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> while the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> stayed a while commoning with a Priest who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he met in <hi>Towerstreete,</hi> brake the Lords tale, saying to him merrily, what my Lord I pray
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53752:62"/>
you come on, wherefore talke you so long with that Priest, you have no neede of a Priest yet, and laughed upon him, as though he would say, you shall have neede of one soone: But little thought the other what hee meant (but before night these words were well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by them that heard them) so the true Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> little mistrusted, and was never meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor thought his life in more suretie in all his dayes, which thing is often a signe of change: but I shall rather let any thing passe mee then the vaine surety of mans minde so neere his death; for upon the very <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwharfe,</hi> so neere the place where his head was off so soone after, as a man might cast a ball, a Pursievant of his owne called <hi>Hastings</hi> met with him; and of their meeting in that place hee was put in remembrance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53752:63"/>
time, in which it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to meete before toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the place, at which time the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused to King <hi>Edward</hi> by the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> the Queenes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, insomuch that he was for a while, which lasted not long, highly in the Kings indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as hee now met the same Pursevant in the same place, the jeoperdie so well passed, it gave him great pleasure to talke with him thereof, with whom he had talked in the same place of that matter, and therefore he said; Ah <hi>Hastings,</hi> art thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred when I met thee here once with a heavie heart? Yea my Lord (quoth he) that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well, and thankes bee to God they got no good, nor you harme thereby; thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest say so (quoth hee) if thou knewest so much as I do, which few know yet, and more shall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53752:63"/>
shortly, that meant he that the Earle <hi>Rivers,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> should that day be beheaded at <hi>Pomfret,</hi> as they were indeed, which act he knew well should be done, but thought not that the Axe hung so neere his owne head.</p>
                  <p>In faith man (quoth hee) I was never so sory, nor never stood in so great danger of my life, as I did when thou and I met here, and loe the world is turned now, now stand mine enemies in the danger, as thou maist hap to heare more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and I never in my life merrier, nor never in so great surety. I pray God it prove so (quoth <hi>Hastings</hi>) prove, quoth he? doubtest thou that) nay, nay, I warrant thee; and so in manner displeased, hee entred into the Tower, where he was not long alive, as you have

heard. O Lord God, the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our mortall nature, when he most feared, he was in most surety, and when he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned himselfe most sure, hee lost his life, and that within two houres after. Thus ended this honourable man, a good Knight and gentle, of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with his Prince, of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving somewhat dissolute, plaine and open to his enemy, and sure and secret to his friend, easie to beguile, as hee that of good heart and courage fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

dinner (intending to set some colour upon the matter) sent in all the haste for many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall men out of the City into the Tower, and at their comming, himselfe with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> stood harnessed in old ill-favoured Briganders, such as no man would thinke that they would have vouchsafed to have put on their backes, except some so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine necessity had constrained them. Then the Lord Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor shewed them, that the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> and other of his conspiracie, had contrived to have suddenly destroyed him and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> there the same day in Councel, and what they intended far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was yet not well known, of which their treason hee had never knowledge before ten of the clock the same forenoone, which sodaine feare drave them
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53752:65"/>
to put on such harnesse as came next to their hands for their defence, and so God holpe them, that the mischiefe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon them that would have done it, and thus he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to report. Every man answered faire, as though no man mistrusted the matter, which of truth no man belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Yet for the further appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the peoples mindes, hee sent immediately after dinner an Herald of Armes with a Proclamation through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>London,</hi> which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the Kings Name, that the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> with divers other of his trayterous purpose, had before conspired, the same day, to have slaine the Protector and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> fitting in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; and after to have taken upon them the rule of the King and the Realme at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53752:65"/>
and thereby to pill and spoile whom they list uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled, and much matter was devised in the same Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the slander of the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> as that he was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Councellor to the Kings Father, entising him to many things highly redounding to the diminishing of his honour, and to the universall hurt of his Realme, by his evill company, and sinister procuring, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious example, aswell in many other things, as in viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous living, and inordinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing of his body, both with many other, and especially with <hi>Shores</hi> wife, which was one of his secret Councell in this heinous treason, with whom hee lay nightly, and namely the night passed next before his death, so that it was the lesse marvell, if ungracious living brought him to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53752:66"/>
end, which he was now put to by the command of the Kings Highnesse, and of his honorable and faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, both for his demerits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so openly taken in his false contrived treason, and also lest the delaying of his execution might have encouraged other mischievous persons partners of his conspiracie, to gather and assemble themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in making so great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion for his deliverance, whose hope now, being by his well deserved death politickly repressed, all the Realme shall by Gods grace rest in good quiet and peace.</p>
                  <p>Now was this proclamation made within two houres after hee was beheaded, and it was so curiously indited, and so faire written in Parchment in a faire set hand, and therwith so large a processe, that every child
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53752:66"/>
might perceive that it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and studied before, and (as some men thought) by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesby,</hi> for all the time betweene his death and the publishing of the Proclamation could scarce have sufficed to the bare wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it alone, albeit that it had beene in paper, and scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled forth in hast at adventure. So that upon the proclaiming thereof, one that was schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master at <hi>Pauls</hi> standing by, and comparing the shortenesse of the time with the length of the matter, said to them that stood about him: here is a gay good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast, fouly cast away for haste. And a Merchant that stood by him, said, that it was written by inspiration and prophesie. Now then by and by, as it were for anger, and not for covetousnesse the Protector sent Sir <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> to the house of <hi>Shores</hi> wife (for her
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53752:67"/>
Husband dwelt not with her) which spoyled her of all that ever she had, above the value of two or three thousand Markes, and sent her body to prison. And the Protector had laid to her for the manner sake, that shee was of Councell with the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> to destroy him. In conclusion, when no colour could fasten upon these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then he layed heinously to her charge that thing that shee could not deny, for all the world knew that it was true, and that notwithstanding every man laughed to heare it then so suddenly, so highly taken, that she was naught of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And for this cause, as a godly continent Prince, cleane and fau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

open penance, going before a crosse one Sunday at procession with a taper in her hand. In the which she went in countenance and pace so womanly, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit she was out of all array sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her kirtle onely, yet went shee so faire and lovely, and namely when the wondering of the people cast a comly red in her cheekes, of the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she had most misse, that her great shame woon her much praise amongst them that were more amorous of her body, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> curious of her soule: and many good folk that hated her living and were glad to see sinne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, yet pittied they more her penance then rejoyced at it; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they considered that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour did it more of a corrupt minde then any vertuous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.<note place="margin">The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of <hi>Shores</hi> wife.</note>

                  <p>This woman was borne in <hi>London,</hi> well friended, honestly

brought up, and very well mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, saving somewhat too soon, her husband an honest and a young Citizen, godly and of good substance, but forasmuch as they were coupled before she was well ripe, shee not very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently loved for whom shee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver longed, which was the thing (by chance) that the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily made her to incline to the Kings appetite, when hee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her. Howbeit the respect of his royaltie, the hope of gaine, apparrell, ease, pleasure, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanton wealth was able soone to pierce a soft tender heart: but when the King had abused her, anon her husband being an honest man would not presume to touch a Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, but left her up to him altogether. When the King died, the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> tooke her, which in the Kings dayes, albeit that he was sore enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Proper shee was and faire, nothing in her body that you could have changed, but if you would have wished her somewhat higher. This say they that knew her in her youth, some said and judged that she had beene well favored, and some judged the contrary, whose judgement seemeth like as men gesse the beauty of one long before departed, by a shape taken out of a charnell house, and this judgement was in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, in the eighteenth yeare of whose reigne she dyed, when she had nothing but a rivelled skin &amp; bone. Her beauty pleased not men so much as her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant behaviour, for shee had a proper wit, and could both reade and write, merry in

But the merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est was <hi>Shores</hi> wife, in whom the King therefore tooke great pleasure, for many he had, but her hee loved, whose favour to say the truth (for it were sinne to belie the devill) she never ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53752:69"/>
to any mans hurt, but to many mens comfort and reliefe. For where the King tooke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, shee would mitigate and appease his minde, where men were out of favour, shee would bring them into his grace, for many that had high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended, shee obtained par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and of great forfeitures she gate remission, and finally in many weighty suites shee stood many men in great stead, either for none or for very small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and those rather gay then rich, either that shee was content with the deede well done, or for that shee delighted to bee sued unto, and to shew what shee was able to doe with the King, or for that that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton women and wealthy be not alwaies covetous.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53752:70"/>
matters, which they shall specially thinke that happily saw her in her age and adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but we thinke the chance so much more worthy to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, in how much after wealth she fell to poverty, and from riches to beggery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended, out of acquaintance, after great substance, after so great favour with her Prince, after as great suite and seeking to with all those which in those dayes had businesse to speed, as many other men were in their times, which bee now famous only by the infamy of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill deedes, her doings were not much lesse, albeit they be much lesse remembred, because they were not evill, for men use to write an evill turne in marble stone, but a good turne in the dust; which is not worst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by her, for after her wealth she went begging of many that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53752:70"/>
had begged themselves if shee had not hope them, such was her chance.</p>
                  <p>Now was it devised by the Protectour and his Councell, that the same day that the Lord Chamberlain was headed in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and about the same houre, should be beheaded at <hi>Pomfret</hi> the Earle <hi>Rivers,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Richard</hi> the Queenes sonne, sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan,</hi> and sir <hi>Richard Haute,</hi> which as you heard were taken at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Stony stratford</hi> by the consent of the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi>; which execution was done by the order and in the presence of sir <hi>Richard Ratclif</hi> knight, whose service the Protectour specially used in the Councell, and in the execution of such lawlesse enterprises, as a man that had beene long secret with him, having experience of the world, a notable wit, short
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53752:71"/>
and rude in speech, rough and boysterous of behaviour, bold in mischiefe, and as farre from pittie as from all feare of God.</p>
                  <p>This Knight brought these foure persons to the Scaffold at the day appointed, and shewed to all the people that they were Traitours, not suffering the Lords to speake, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their innocency, lest their words might have inclined men to pitty them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to hate the Protectour and his part, and so without judgement and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the Law caused them to bee beheaded without other earthly guilt, but onely they were good men, and true to the King, &amp; too nie to the Queene; insomuch that sir <hi>Thomas Vaughan</hi> going to his death said; A mischeife take them that tooke the prophesie that <hi>G.</hi> should destroy King <hi>Edwards</hi> children, for <hi>George</hi> Duke of

                     <hi>Clarence,</hi> Lord <hi>George,</hi> which for that suspition is now dead, but now remaineth <hi>Richard G.</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> which now I see is he that shall and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the Prophesie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy King <hi>Edwards</hi> children, and all their allies and friends, as it appeareth by us this day; whom I appeale to the high tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of God for his wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full murther, and our true inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. And then <hi>Ratclife</hi> said, you have well appealed, lay downe your head, yea quoth sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> I dye in right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware you dye not in wrong, and so that good Knight was beheaded, and the other three, and buried naked in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie at <hi>Pomfret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> and those other Lords and Knights were thus beheaded and rid out of the way, then the Protectour caused it to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53752:72"/>
that the Coronation for divers great and urgent causes should bee deferred till the second day of <hi>November,</hi> for then thought he, that while men mused what the matter meant, and whiles the Lords of the Realme were about him, out of their owne strengths, and while no man knew what to thinke, nor whom to trust, or whether they should have time or space to digest the matter, and make parts; it were best hastily to pursue his purpose, and put himselfe in possession of the Crowne, before men could have time to devise any waies to resist. But now was all the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, how this matter, being of it selfe so haynous, might be first broken to the people in such wise as it might bee well taken.</p>
                  <p>To this councell they tooke divers, such as they thought
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53752:72"/>
meet to be trusted, and likely to be induced to that part, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to stand them in stead, either by power or by policie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom, they made of Councell <hi>Edmond Shaw</hi> then Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> which upon trust of his owne advancement, where he was of a proud heart, highly desirous, tooke upon him to frame the Citty to their appetite. Of Spirituall men they tooke such as had wit, and were in authority amongst the people for opinion of their learning, and had no scrupulus conscience. Amongst these had, they tooke <hi>Ralph Shaw</hi> clearke, brother to the Mayor, and Frier <hi>Pinkie,</hi> provinciall of the <hi>Augustine</hi> Friers, both Doctors in Divinity, both great Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, both of more learning then vertue, of more fame then lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and yet of more learning then truth. For they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53752:73"/>
greatly esteemed among the people, but after that, never none of those two were regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Shaw</hi> made a Sermon in praise of the Protectour before the Coronation, and <hi>Pynkie</hi> made one after the Cornation, both so full of tedious flattery, that no good mans eares could abide them: <hi>Pynkie</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon so lost his vocye, that hee was faine to leave off and come downe in the midst: Doctor <hi>Shaw</hi> by his Sermon lost his honesty, and soone after his life, for very shame of the world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which he durst never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much come abroad: but the Frier feared no shame, and so it harmed him the lesse. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, some doubt, and many thinke, that <hi>Pynkie</hi> was not of Councell before the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but after the common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fell to flattery after; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because his Sermon was not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53752:73"/>
incontinent upon it, but at S. <hi>Mary Spitle</hi> the Easter after. But certaine it is, that Doctor <hi>Shaw</hi> was of Councell in the beginning, in so much that they determined that hee should first breake the matter in a Sermon at <hi>Paules Crosse,</hi> in which hee should by the authority of his Preaching induce the people to encline to the Protectors ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purpose. But now was all the labour and study in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of some convenient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, for which the people should be content to depose the Prince, and accept the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour for their King. In which deuers, things they devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but the cheife thing, and the weight of all that invention rested in this; that they should alledge bastardy in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> himselfe, or in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or both; so that he should seeme disabled to inherite the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53752:74"/>
Crowne by the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Prince by him. To lay bastardy in King <hi>Edward</hi> sounded openly to the rebuk of the Protectours owne mother, which was mother to them both. For in that point could be no other colour, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that his owne mother was an Adultresse; but neverthelesse he would that point should bee lesse and more finely and close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, not even fully plaine and directly, but touched upon craftily, as though men spared in that point to speake all the truth for feare of his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But that other point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bastardy they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to surmise in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> his Children, that hee desired should be openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and enforced to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most. The colour and pretext whereof cannot be well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, except wee repeate some
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53752:74"/>
things long before done about King <hi>Edwards</hi> Marriages.</p>
                  <p>After King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth had deposed King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, and was in peaceable pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Realme; hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with himselfe to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (as was requisite) both for himselfe and for the Realme: he sent the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> and divers other noble men in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage to the French King, to entreate a marriage betweene the King and <hi>Bona,</hi> sister to the French Queene, then being in France. In which thing the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> found the parties so toward and willing, that hee speedily without any difficultie according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions brought the matter to a good conclusion. Now happeneth it in the meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, there came to make a sute to the King by Petition; Dame <hi>Elizabeth Gray,</hi> (which after
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53752:75"/>
was his Queene) then a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, borne of noble blood, specially by her mother, which was Dutches of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and she was married to sir <hi>Richard Woodvile,</hi> Lord <hi>Rivers,</hi> her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, this <hi>Elizabeth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in service with Queene <hi>Margaret</hi> wife to King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, was married to one <hi>Iohn Grey</hi> Esquier, whom King <hi>Henry</hi> made Knight at the last battell of Saint <hi>Albons,</hi> but little while hee enjoyed his knighthood, for at the same field he was slaine.</p>
                  <p>After when King <hi>Edward</hi> was King, and the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> beeing on his Embassage, this poore Lady made her sute to the King to bee restored to such small lands as her husband had given her in joynture; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when the King beheld, and heard her speak, as she was both
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53752:75"/>
faire and of good favour, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate of stature, well made, and very wise; he not alone pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her, but also waxed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amored on her, and taking her secretly aside, began to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to talking more familiarly, whose appetite when shee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, shee vertuously denyed him, but that shee did so wisely, and that with so good manner, and words so well set, that shee rather kindled his desire then quenched it. And finally, after many a meeting &amp; much woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and many great promises, she well perceived the Kings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards her so greatly increased, that shee durst some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the more boldly say her minde, as to him whose heart she perceived more fervently set then to fall off for a word. And in conclusion shee shewed him plaine, that as shee thought her selfe too simple to bee his wife,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53752:76"/>
so shee thought her selfe too good to be his concubine. The King much marvelling at her constancy, as hee that had not beene before elswhere so stiffely said nay, so much esteemed her continency and chastity, that he set her vertue in stead of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session and riches: And thus taking counsell of his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, determined in haste to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her.</p>
                  <p>And after that hee was thus appointed, and had betw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ene them twaine assured her, then asked he counsell of his secret friends, and that in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they might easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it booted them not to say nay. Notwithstanding, the Dutches of <hi>York</hi> his mother was so sore moved therewith, that she disswaded that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as much as shee possible might: alleaging that it was his honour, profit, and surety,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53752:76"/>
to marry in some noble proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of his Realme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon depended great strength to his estate by that affinity, and great possibility of increase of his dominions. And that hee could not well otherwise doe, considering the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> had so farforth entred into the matter already, which was not like to take it well if all his voyage were in such wise frustrate, and his appointment deluded. And she said further, that it was not Princely to marry his owne Subject, no greater occasion leading there unto; no possessions nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commoditie depending thereupon, but onely as a rich man would marry his maiden onely for a little wanton do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon her person. In which marriage many men commend more the maidens fortune then the mans wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53752:77"/>
and yet shee said that there was more honesty, then honour in this marriage; for asmuch as there is not betweene a Merchant and his maide so great a difference, as betweene a King and his Subject, a great Prince and a poore widdow. In whose person, although there were nothing to bee mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, yet was there, said shee, nothing so excellent, but that it might bee found in divers other that were more mee (quoth she) for your estate, yea and maidens also, the onely widowhood of Dame <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Grey</hi> (although she were in all other points and things convenient for you) should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as I th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nke, to refraine you from her marriage, since it is an unfitting thing, and a great blemish to the sacred Majesty of a Prince, that ought as neere to approach priesthood in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53752:77"/>
cleannesse, as he doth in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be defiled with bigamy in his first marriage. The King made his Mother an answer, part in earnest, and part in play merrily, as hee that knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of her rule: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he would gladly that shee should take it well, yet was hee at a point in his owne minde, tooke shee it well or otherwise. Howbeit, somewhat to satisfie her, hee said, that albeit mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage being a spirituall thing, ought rather to be made for the respect of God; where his grace inclineth, the parties ought to incline to love together (as he trusted it was in his case) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then for the regard of any temporall advantage: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse he deemed this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage well considered not to be unprofitable, for hee reckoned the amity of no earthly Nation to be so necessary for him, as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53752:78"/>
the friendship of his owne, which hee thought likely to beare him so much the more hearty favour, in that hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained not to marry with one of his owne Land: and yet if outward alliance were thought so requisite, he would finde the meanes to enter thereunto much better by other of his kin, where all parties could be contented, then to marry himselfe, wherein hee should never haply love, and for the possibility of possessions lose the fruit and pleasure of this that he had already. For small pleasure taketh a man of all that ever he hath beside<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if hee be wived against his appetite, and I doubt not (quoth he) but there be, as you say, others that be in every point compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with her; and therefore I let not them that like them to marry them, no more is it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53752:78"/>
reason that it mislike any man that I marry where it liketh me. And I am sure, that my Cousin of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> neither loveth me so little, to grudge at that that I love, nor is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, to looke that I should in choice of a wife ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ruled by his eye then by mine owne, as though I were a ward that were bound to marry by the appointment of a Guardian. I would not be a King with that condition, to forbeare mine owne liberty in choice of mine owne marriage. As for possibility of more inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance by new affinity in strange Lands, is oft the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of more trouble then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. And wee have already title by that meanes, as sufficeth to so much as sufficeth to get and keepe well in one mans dayes. That she is a widdow and hath already children: By God his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53752:79"/>
blessed Lady, I am a Batchelor and have some too, and so each of us hath a proofe, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us is like to be barren. And therefore, Madame, I pray you be content, I trust to God she shall bring forth a young Prince that shall please you. And as for the bigamy, let the Bishop hardly lay it to my charge when I come to take orders, for I understand it is forbidden a Priest, but I never knew that it was forbidden a Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Dutchesse with these words nothing appeased, and seeing the King so set on, that she could not pluck him backe, so highly she disdained it, that, under pretence of her duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shee devised to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe this marriage, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to helpe, that hee should marry one Dame <hi>Elizabeth Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> whom the King not long
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53752:79"/>
before had gotten with childe; wherefore the Kings Mother objected openly against this marriage (as it were in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of her conscience) that the King was sure to Dame <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth Lucy,</hi> and her husband before God, by reason of which words such obstacle was made in that matter, that either the Bishop durst not, or the King would not proceed to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of the marriage, till his fame were cleerely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the truth well and openly testified. Whereupon Dame <hi>Elizabeth Lucy</hi> was sent for, and albeit shee was by the Kings Mother and many other put in good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort that she was ensured to the King, yet when she was solemnly sworne to say the truth, she confessed she was never ensured. Howbeit, shee said, his Grace spake such lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving words to her, that shee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53752:80"/>
hoped, that he would have married her, and if such kinde words had not been, she would never have shewed such kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to him, to let him so kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get her with child. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination solemnely taken, it was cleerely proved, that there was no impediment to let the King to marry; wherefore, he shortly after at <hi>Grafton</hi> beside <hi>Stony Stratford</hi> married the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Elizabeth Grey</hi> very privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which was his enemies wife, and had prayed heartily for his losse, in the which God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her better, then to grant her her boon, for then had shee not been his wife: And after that shee was crowned Queene, and her father was created Earle <hi>Rivers,</hi> and her sonne created Marquesse <hi>Dorset.</hi> But when the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> understood of this marriage, he took it so highly, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53752:80"/>
ensued much blood-shed, as is declared before in the Story of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth.</p>
                  <p>I have rehearsed this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage somewhat the more at length, because it might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the better appeare upon how slippery a ground the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector builded his colour, by which he pretended King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> children to be Bastards: but the invention, as simple as it was, liked them to whom it sufficeth to have somewhat to say, while they were sure to bee compelled to no larger proofe then themselves list to make.</p>
                  <p>Now to returne where I left, as I began to shew you, it was by the Protector and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell concluded, that this Doctor <hi>Shaw</hi> should in a Sermon at <hi>Pauls Crosse</hi> signifie to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that neither King <hi>Edward</hi> himselfe, nor the Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:53752:81"/>
were lawfully begotten, nor were the very children of the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> but begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unlawfully by other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by adultery of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse their Mother. And Dame <hi>Elizabeth Lucy</hi> was the very wife of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and so Prince <hi>Edward</hi> and all the children begotten on the Queen were Bastards. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this device, Doctor <hi>Shaw</hi> the Sunday after, at <hi>Paules Crosse,</hi> in a great audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (as alwayes a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber assembled to his preaching) came into the Pulpit, taking for his Theme, <hi>Spuria vitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina non dabunt radices altos, Sapien.</hi> 4. that is to say, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard slippes shall never take deepe rootes: Whereupon when he had shewed the great grace that God giveth, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly infundeth in right ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration after the Lawes of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53752:81"/>
Matrimony, then declared hee, that those children commonly lacked that grace and (for the punishment of their parents) were for the most part unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, which were ilegitimate, and especially in adultery, of which though some (by the ignorance of the world, and truth hid from knowledge) have inherited for a season other mens Lands, yet God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so provideth, that it continueth not in their bloud long, but the truth comming to light, the rightfull inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors be restored and the bastard slippes plucked up ere it can be rooted deepe. And when hee had layed for the proofe and confirmation of this sentence, examples taken out of the old and new Testament and other ancient Histories, then began he to descend to the praise of the Lord <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53752:82"/>
calling him father to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and declared his Title to the Crowne by inheritance, and also by entai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e authorised by Parliament after the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth. Then shewed he, that the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector was only the right heire of his body lawfully begotten. Then declared hee, that King <hi>Edward</hi> was never lawfully married to the Queene, but his wife before God, was Dame <hi>Elizabeth Lucy,</hi> and so his children were Bastards. And besides that, that neither King <hi>Edward</hi> himselfe, nor the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> (amongst them that were secret in the Duke of <hi>Yorkes</hi> houshold) were never reckoned surely to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Noble Duke, as those that by their favours more resembled other knowne men, then him; from whose vertuous conditions, hee said
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53752:82"/>
also, that King <hi>Edward</hi> was farre off. But the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector (quoth hee) that very Noble Prince, the speciall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Knightly Prowesse, as well in all Princely behavior, as in the lineaments and favour of his visage, representeth the very face of the Noble Duke his Father. This is (quoth he) the Fathers owne figure, this is his owne countenance, the very print of his visage, the sure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted image, the plaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse likenesse of that Noble Duke.</p>
                  <p>Now was it before devised, that in the speaking of these words, the Protector should have come in amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Sermon, to the end, that these words so meeting with his presence, might have beene taken amongst the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, as though the Holy Ghost had put them in the Preachers
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53752:83"/>
mouth, and should have moved the people even there to have cryed, King <hi>Richard,</hi> that it might have been after said, that he was specialy chosen by God, and in manner by miracle: but this device quailed, either by the Protectors negligence, or the Preachers over-hasty diligence. For while the Protector, found by the way tarrying, lest he should have prevented these words, the Doctor fearing, that he should come ere his Sermon could come to those words, hasting his matter thereto, he was come to them and past them, and entred into other matters ere the Protector came, whom when hee beheld com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, hee left the matter in hand, and out of all order, and out of all frame, began to repeat those words againe: This is the very Noble Prince, the especiall Patrone
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53752:83"/>
of Knightly prowesse, which aswell in all Princely behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as in the lineaments and favour of his visage, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the very face of the Noble Duke of <hi>York</hi> his father. This is his Fathers owne figure, this is his owne countenance, the very print of his visage, the sure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted image, the plaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse likenesse of that Noble Duke, whose remembrance can never dye while hee liveth: While these words were spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the Protector accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> went through the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple up into the place where the Doctors stand, where they heard out the Sermon: but the people were so farre from cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King <hi>Richard,</hi> that they stood as they had beene turned into stones for wonder of this shamefull Sermon: after which once ended, the Preacher gat
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53752:84"/>
him home and never after durst looke out for shame, but kept him out of sight as an owle, and when hee asked any of his old friends, what the people talked of him, although that his owne conscience will shew him that they talked no good, yet when the other answered him, that there was in every mans mouth of him much shame spoken, it so strooke him to the heart, that in few dayes after hee withered away.</p>
                  <p>Then on the Tuesday after, next following this Sermon, being the seventeenth day of <hi>Iune,</hi> there came to <hi>Guild Hall London,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and divers Lords and Knights, more then happily knew the message that they brought. And at the East end of the Hall where the Hoystings be kept, the Duke and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor and the other Lords sate
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53752:84"/>
downe, and the Aldermen also, all the commons of the Citty being assembled and standing before them. After silence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded upon a great paine in the Protectours name: The Duke stood up, and as hee was well learned and of nature mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velously well spoken, he said to the people with a cleare and a loud voyce: Friends, for the the zeale and hearty favour that we bare you, we bee come to breake off a matter right great and weightie, and no lesse weightie then pleasing to God, and profitable to the Realme, nor to no part of the Realme more profitable, then to you the Citizens of this noble Citie. For why, the thing that you have long lacked, and as we well know, sore longed for, that you would have gone farre to fetch: that thing we be come hither to bring you, without your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

paine, cost, adventure, or danger. What thing is that? Certainely the surety of your owne bodies, the quiet of your wives and daughters, and the safegard of your wives and daughters, and the safegard of your goods: Of all which things in times past you stood in doubt. For who was hee of you all that could reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Lord of his owne goods, amongst so many gynnes and trappes as were set for them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so much pilling and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, among so many taxes and talliages, of the which there was never end, and often times no neede, or if any were, it grew rather of riot, or of unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wast, then any necessary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ge, so that there was daily plucked and pilled from good and honest men great substance of goods, to bee lashed out among unthrifts, so
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53752:85"/>
farre forth that fifteenes sufficed not, nor any usuall termes of knowne taxes, but under an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie name of benevolence and good will, the commissioners tooke so much of every man, as no man would with his good will have given. As though the name of benevolence had sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that every man should pay, not what he of himselfe of his good will list to grant, but what the King of his good will list to take, who never asked lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but every thing was haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above the measure, amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments turned into fines, fines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to treason, where I thinke that no man looketh that wee shall remember you of examples by name, as though <hi>Burdet</hi> were forgotten, which was, for a word spoken, in haste cruelly beheaded. (This <hi>Burdet</hi> was a Merchant dwelling in <hi>Cheape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi> at the signe of the Crowne,

which now is the signe of the Flower-de-luce over against <hi>Soper-lane</hi>: This man merily in the ruffling time of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourths raigne, said to his owne sonne, that hee would make him inheritor of the Crowne, meaning his owne house: but these words King <hi>Edward</hi> made to be misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and interpreted that <hi>Burdet</hi> meant the Crowne of the Realme: wherfore within lesse space then foure houres, he was apprehended, judged, drawne and quartered in <hi>Cheapeside,</hi> by the misconstruing of the lawes of the Realme for the Princes pleasure; with no lesse honour to <hi>Markam</hi> chiefe Justice then, which lost his office rathen then hee would assent to that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>What neede I to speake of sir <hi>Thomas Cooke,</hi> Alderman and Mayor of this noble Cittie?

who is of you either for negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that wotteth not, or so forgetfull that hee remembreth not, or so hard-hearted that he pittieth not that worshipfull mans losse? what speake I of losse, his wonderfull spoyle and undeserved destruction, onely because it happened him to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them whom the Prince fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored not. We need not rehearse of these any more by name, sith I doubt not that here be many present, that either in themselves or their nigh friends, aswell their goods as their persons, were greatly endangered either by fained quarrells or small matters aggravated with hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous names, and also there was no crime so great, of which there could lacke a pretext. For sith the King preventing the time of his inheritance, attained the Crowne by battell, it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a rich man for a pretext

For whom trusted hee that mistrusted his owne brother? Whom spared
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53752:88"/>
hee that killed his owne Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Could not such manner of folke that he most favoured doe somewhat (wee shall for his honour spare to speake) howbeit, this you know well all, that whoso was best, bare ever the least rule, and more suite in his dayes was to <hi>Shores</hi> wife, a vile and abominable strumpet, then to all the Lords in <hi>England,</hi> except unto those that made her their Protector, which simple woman was yet well named and honest, till the King for his wanton lust and sinfull affection bereft her of her Husband, a right honest man and substantiall amongst you. And in that point, which in good faith I am sory to speake of, saving that it is vaine to keepe in Counsell that thing that all men knowe, the Kings greedy appetite was insatiable, and every where
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53752:88"/>
over all the Realme intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For no woman was there any where, young or old, poor or rich, whom he set his eye upon, whom hee any thing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, either for person or beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, speech, pace or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but without any feare of God, or respect of his Honour, murmure, or grudging of the world, hee would importunately pursue his appetite and have her, to the great destruction of many a good woman, and great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to their husbands and friends, which being honest people of themselves, so much regarded the cleannesse of their houses, the chastity of their wives and children, that they had rather lose all that they had besides, then to have such a villany done to them.</p>
                  <p>And albeit, that with this and other importable dealing,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53752:89"/>
the Realme was in every place annoyed, yet specially you the Citizens of this Nobility, as for that amongst you is most plenty of such things as mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster matter to such injuries, as for that you were neerest hand, sith that neere here about was his most common abiding. And yet be yee a people whom he had as singular a cause well and truly to intreat, as any part of his Realme: not onely for that the Prince by this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Citie, as of his speciall Chamber and renouned Citie of this Realme, receiveth much honourable fame amongst all other Nations, but also for that, you not without your great cost and sundry favours and dangers in all his warres, bare ever your especiall favour to his part: which your kinde mindes borne to the house of <hi>Yorke,</hi> sith hee hath nothing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53752:89"/>
worthily requirid you, there is of the house now which by Gods grace shall make you full recompence, which thing to shew you, is the whole summe and effect of our arrand. It shall not neede I hope, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse unto you againe that you have already heard of him that can better tell it, and of whom I am sure ye will better beleeve it, (and reason it is that it should bee so) I am not so proud to looke therefore that you should receive my words of so great authority as the Preachers of the word of God, namely a man so cunning and so wise, that no man knoweth better what hee should doe and say, and thereto so good and vertuous that he would not say the thing, which hee ought not to say in the pulpit, namely, into the which no honest man commeth to lie: which hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53752:90"/>
preacher, ye well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, substantially declared to you at <hi>Paules Crosse</hi> on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day last past, the right and title of the most excellent Prince <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> now Protector of this his Realme, which he hath unto the Crowne of the Kingdome of the same. For that worshipfull man made it perfectly and groundedly open unto you. The children of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth were never lawfully begotten, for as much as the King (leaving his very wife Dame <hi>Elizabeth Lucy</hi>) was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lawfully married to the Queene their mother, whose blood, saving hee set his volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous pleasure before his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, was full unmeetly to bee matched with his (the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of which two bloods toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath beene the effusion of a great part of the noble
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53752:90"/>
blood of this Realme) whereby it may well be seene, that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was not well made, of which there is so much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe growne. For lacke of which lawfull copulation, and also of other things which the said worshipfull Doctor, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther signified then fully explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and which thing shall not be spoken for me, as the thing that every man forbeareth to say that hee knoweth, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the displeasure that my noble Lord Protector, bearing, as nature requireth a filiall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Dutches his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For these causes before remembred, I say that for lacke of issue lawfully comming of the late noble Prince <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to whose Royall blood the Crownes of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi> are by the high authority of a parliament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed, the right and title of the

same is by just course of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of this land, devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and come unto the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince the Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, as to the very lawfull begotten sonne of the fore-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred noble Duke of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Which thing well considered, and the knightly prowesse with many vertues which in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble person singularly doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; The Nobles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of this Realme, and specially of the North parts, not willing any bastard blood to have the rule of the land, nor theabuses in the same before used and exercised any longer to continue, have fully condescended and utterly determined to make humble petition unto the puisant Prince the Lord Protector, that it may like his grace at our humble request, to take upon
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53752:91"/>
him the guiding &amp; government of this Realme, to the wealth and increase of the same, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his very right and just title; which thing, I know well hee will bee loth to take upon him, as he whose wisedome well perceiveth, the labour and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy both of mind and body that shall come therewith to him, whosoever shall occupy that rome. I dare say he will, if he take it (for I warrant you that that roome is no childes office) and that the great wise man well perceived when he said <hi>Vae regno, cujus Rex puer est,</hi> woe to that Realme whose King is a child; wherefore so much the more cause have we to thanke God, that this noble personage which is so righteously entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereto, is of so solid age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereto of so great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, joyned with so great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which albeit, he will

bee loth as I have said, to take upon him, yet shall hee to our petition in that behalfe the more graciously inclin if ye the worshipfull Citizens of this Cittie, being the cheife cittie of the Realme, joyne with us the nobles in our said request, which for your owne weale we doubt not but that ye will. And yet neverthelesse, wee pray yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> so to doe, whereby ye shall doe great profit to all this his Realme: Beside that, in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them so good a King, it shall bee to your selfe a speciall commoditie, to whom his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie shall ever after beare so much the more tender favour, in how much hee shall perceive you the more prone and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volently minded towards his election: wherein deare friends, what minde ye have we require you plainely to shew us: When the Duke had said, and looked
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53752:92"/>
that the people whom he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that the Mayor had framed before, should after this flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring proposition made, have cried King <hi>Richard,</hi> King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> all was still and mute, and not one word answered unto: wherewith the Duke was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously abashed, and taking the Major neere to him, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that were about him privie to the matter, said unto them softly; What meaneth this, that the people be so still? Sir, quoth the Major, perhaps they perceive you not well; that shall we amend, quoth he, if that will helpe, and therewith some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lowder rehearsed the same matter againe, in other and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, so well and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and neverthelesse so evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plaine, with voice, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and countenance so come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and so convenient, that every man much marvelled that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53752:93"/>
heard him, and thought that they never heard in their lives so evill a tale so well told. But were it for feare, or that each looked that other should speake first, not one word was there answered of all the people that stood before but all were as still as the midnight, not so much as whispering among them, by which they might seeme once to commune what was best to doe. When the Major saw this, hee with other partners of the Councell, drew about the Duke and said, that the people had not beene accustomed there to be spoken unto, but by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder, which is the mouth the Citie, and happily to him they will answer. With that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder, called <hi>Thomas Fitz-Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> a solid man and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, which was but newly come to the office, and never had spoken to the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53752:93"/>
and loth hee was with that matter to beginne, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, being thereunto commanded by the Major, made a rehearsall to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of that which the Duke had twice proposed himselfe; but the Recorder so tempered his tale, that hee shewed every thing as the Dukes words were, and no part of his owne, but all this made no change in the people, which all as one stood as they had beene amased. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Duke whispered with the Major, and said, this is a marvellous obstinate silence, and therewith turned to the people againe with these words: Deare friends, wee come to move you to that thing which peradventure wee greatly needed not, but that the Lords of this Realme, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of other parts might have sufficed, saving such love wee
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53752:94"/>
beare you, and so much set by you, that we would not gladly doe without you, that thing in which to bee partners is your weale and honour, which as to us seemeth you see not, or weigh not: Wherefore wee require you to give us an answer, one or other, whether ye be minded, as all the Nobles of the Realme be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have this Noble Prince now Protector to be your King? And at these words the people began to whisper among themselves secretly, that the voyce was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lowd nor base, but like a swarme of bees till at the last at the nether end of the hall a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany of the Dukes servants and one <hi>Nashfield,</hi> &amp; others belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Protector, with some prentises and lads that thrusted themselves into the hall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the preasse, began so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely at mens backes to cry out as loude as they could, King
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53752:94"/>
                     <hi>Richard,</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi>; and there threw up their cappes in token of joy, and they that stood before cast backe their heads marvelling thereat, but nothing they said. And when the Duke and the Major saw this manner, they wisely tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to their purpose, and said it was a goodly cry and a joyful, to heare every man with one voyce, and no man saying nay. Wherefore friends (quoth the Duke,) sith wee perceive that it is all your whole mindes to have this noble man for your King, whereof wee shall make his grace so effectuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that we doubt not but that it shall redound to your great wealth and commoditie. Wee therefore require you, that to morrow ye goe with us, and we with you to his Noble Grace to make our humble Petition and request to him in manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53752:95"/>
remmebred. And therwith the Lords came downe, and the company dissolved and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the most part all sad, some with glad semblance that were not very merry, and some of them that came with the Duke, not able to dissemble their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, were faine even at his back to turne their face to the wall, while the dolour of their hearts brast out of their eyes.</p>
                  <p>Then on the morrow the Major and Aldermen, and chiefe commanders of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in their best manner aparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, assembling them together at <hi>Pauls,</hi> resorted to <hi>Baynards Castle</hi> where the Protector lay, to which place also according to the appointment repaired the Duke of <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>kingham,</hi> and divers nobles with him, besides many Knights and Gentlemen. And thereupon the Duke sent word to the Lord Protector of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53752:95"/>
the being thereof a great hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company to move a great matter to his Grace. Wherupon the Protector made great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie to come downe to them, except hee knew some part of their errand, as though hee doubted, and partly mistrusted the company of such a number to him so suddenly, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny warning or knowledge, whether they came for good or harme. Then when the Duke had shewed this to the Major and others, that they might thereby see how little the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector looked for this matter; they sent againe by the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, such loving message, and therewith so humbly besought him to vouchsafe that they might resort to his presence to propose their intent, of which they would to no other person disclose any part; At the last hee came out of his chamber,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53752:96"/>
and yet not downe to them, but in a galery over them, with a Bishop on each hand of him, where they beneath might see him and speake to him, as though he would not yet come neere them, till hee knew what they meant. And thereupon, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> first made humble petition to him on the behalfe of them all, that his grace would pardon them, and licence them to shew unto his grace the intent of their comming without his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; without which pardon obtained, they durst not bee so bold to moove him of that matter. In which, albeit they meant asmuch honour to his grace, as wealth to all the Realme besids, yet were they not sure how his grace would take it, whom in no wise they would offend. Then the Protector, as he was very gentle of himselfe,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53752:96"/>
and also longed sore apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know what they meant, gave him leave to deliver his message, verily trusting for the good minde that hee bare unto them all, none of them would intend any thing to his hurt, wherewith hee thought to be grieved. When the Duke had this leave and pardon to speak, then waxed hee bold to shew him their intent and purpose, with all the causes moving them thereunto, as ye before have heard. And finally, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech his grace that it would like him of his accustomed goodnesse and zeale unto the Realme, now with his eye of pitty to behold the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued distresse and decay of the same, and set his gracious hand to the redresse and amendment thereof, by taking upon him the Crowne of the Realme accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his right and title law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53752:97"/>
descended unto him, and to the laud of God, profit and surety of the Land, and unto his grace so much the more honour and lesse paine, in that that never prince reigned upon any people that were so glad to live under his obeisance, as the people of this realme under his.</p>
                  <p>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Protector had heard the Proposition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he looked very strangely there at, and made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that albeit he knew part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the things by them alleged to bee true, yet such entire love he bare to King <hi>Edward</hi> and his children, &amp; much more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his honour in other Realmes about, then the crowne of any one, of which hee was never desirous, for in all other nations where the truth were not well knowne, it should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure bee thought that it were his owne ambitious mind
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53752:97"/>
and device to depose the Prince, and to take the Crowne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; with which infamy hee would in no wise have his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour stayned for any crowne, in which he ever had perceived much more labour and paine, then pleasure to him that so would use it, as hee that would not and were not worthy to have it. Notwithstanding, hee not onely pardoned them of the motion that they made him, but also thanked them for the love and harty favour they bare him, praying them for his sake to beare the same to the Prince under whom he was and would bee content to live, and with his labour and counsaile, as far as it should like the King to use it, he would do his utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most devoir to set the Realme in good estate which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the little time of his Protectorship (praysed be God)
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53752:98"/>
well begun, in that the malice of such as were before the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the contrary, and of new intended to bee, were now partly by good policy, partly more by Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then mans provision, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and put under.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this answer given, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> by the Protectors licence a little roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as well with other noble men about him as with the Major and Recorder of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> And after that upon like pardon desired and obtained, he shewed alowd unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, for a finall conclusion, that the Realme was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that King <hi>Edwards</hi> line should no longer reigne over them, both that they had so far gone, that it was now no suretie to retreate (as for that they thought it the best way for the whole Realme, although they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53752:98"/>
had not yet begun it) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it would like his Grace to take the Crowne upon him, they would humbly beseech him thereunto, and if he would give them a resolute answer to the contrary (which they would be loth to heare) then must they seek, and should not faile to find some other noble man that would. These words much moved the Protector, which, as every man of small intelligence may judge, would never have enclined thereto: but when he saw there was no other way but that he must take it, or else hee and his both to goe from it, hee said to Lords and Commons, sith it is, we perceive well, that all the Realme is so set (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we be very sorry) that they will not suffer in any wise King <hi>Edward</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his line to governe them, whom no man earthly can governe against their wills:
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53752:99"/>
And we also perceive that there is no man to whom the Crown can by so just title appertaine as to our selfe, as very right heire lawfully begotten of the body of our most dread and deare Father <hi>Richard</hi> late Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to which title is now joyned your election, the nobles and commons of the Realme, which wee of all titles possibly take for most effectuall, wee bee content and agree favorably to encline to your petition and request, and according to the same, here we take upon us the Royall estate of preheminence and Kingdome of the two Noble Realmes, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the one from this day forward by us and our heires to rule, governe, and defend, the other by God his grace and your good helpe to get againe, subdue and establish for ever in due obedience unto this realme
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53752:99"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> the advancement whereof, we never aske of God longer to live then we intend to procure and set forth. With this there was a great cry and shout, crying King <hi>Richard,</hi> and so the Lords went up to the King, and so hee was after that day so called. But the people departed talking diversly of the matter, every man as his fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie gave him, but much they marvelled of this manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying, that the matter was on both parts made so strange, as though never the one part had communed with the other part thereof before, when they knew that there was no man so dull that heard them, but he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved well enough that all the matter was made betweene them. Howebeit, some excused that againe, saying; all things must bee done in good order, and men must sometimes for the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53752:100"/>
manner sake not bee knowne what they know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For at the consecration of a Bishop, every man perceiveth by payment of his Bulles that hee intendeth to bee one, yet when hee is twice asked whether he will bee a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, he must twice say nay, and at the third time take it upon him as compelled thereto by his owne will. And in a stage play, the people know right well that hee that playeth the Soldan, is perhaps a cobler yet if one of his acquaintance perhaps of little nurture should call him by his name while hee stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in his Majesty, one of his tormentors might fortune to breake his head for marring the play. And so they said, these matters bee Kings games, as it were stage-playes, and for the most part played up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on scaffolds, in which poore men bee but lookers on, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53752:100"/>
they that bee wise, will med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle no further, for they that step up with them, when they cannot play their parts, they disorder the play, and doe themselves no good.</p>

Countesses, Barronesses, Ladies, and many faire Gentlewomen: in this order they passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the palace, &amp; entred the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie at the West end, and so came to their seates of estate.

Then both the King and the Queene changed them into cloathes of gold, and ascended to their seates, where the Cardinall of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and other Bishops Crowned them according to the old custome of the Realme, giving him the Scepter in his left hand, and the ball with the crosse in the right hand, and the Queene had the Scepter in her right hand, and the rod with the Dove in the left hand:

After that, the Heralds cried <hi>a largesse</hi> thrice in the Hall, and so went up to their stage. At the end of dinner, the Major of <hi>London</hi> served the King and Queene
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53752:108"/>
with sweete wine, and had of each of them a cup of gold with a cover of gold. And by that time that all was done, it was darkenight: and so the King returned to his chamber, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man to his lodging. When this feast was thus finished, the King sent home all the Lords into their countries that would depart, except the Lord <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> whom hee retained till hee heard what his sonne the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> went about. And to such as went home, hee gave straight charge and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to see their Countries well ordered, &amp; that no wrong nor extortion should bee done to his subjects. And thus hee taught others to execute justice and equitie, the contrary wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he daily exercised: hee also with great rewards given to the Northerne men which hee sent for to his Coronation, sent
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53752:108"/>
them home to their Countrey with great thankes. Whereof divers of them, (as they all bee of nature very greedy of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and especially when they thinke to have any comfort or favour,) tooke on them so highly, and wrought such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, that the King was faine to ride thither in his first yeare, and to put some in execution, and stay the Country, or else no small mischiefe had ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Incontinent after this, he sent a solemne Embassage to <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King, to conclude a league and amitie with him, trusting also to obtaine the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute which King <hi>Edward</hi> his brother had before out of <hi>France</hi>: but the French King so abhorred him and his crueltie, that he would neither see nor heare his Embassadors, and so in vaine they returned.</p>

                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:53752:109"/>Now after this triumphant Coronation there fell mischiefs thicke and thicke, and as the thing evill gotten is never well kept, so through all the time of his usurped reigne, never ceased there cruell murther, death and slaughter, till his own destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ended it. But as hee finished with the best death and most fitting, that is to say his owne, so beganne he with the most pitteous and wicked, I meane the lamentable murther of his innocent Nephewes, the young King and his tender bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whose death and finall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath neverthelesse so farre come in question that some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained long in doubt whether they were in his dayes destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or no.

and taken for the yonger of these two: But for that also that all things were so covertly demeaned, one thing pretended, and another meant, that there was nothing so plaine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly proved, but that yet for the common custome of close covert dealing, men had it ever inwardly suspect, as many well counterfet jewels make the true mistrusted.

                  <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> after his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he sent <hi>Iohn Greene,</hi> whom he specially trusted, unto sir <hi>Robert Brakenbury</hi> Constable of the Tower, with a letter and credence also, that the same sir <hi>Robert</hi> in any wise should put the two children to death. This <hi>Iohn Greene</hi> did his errand to <hi>Brakenbury,</hi> kneeling before our Lady in the Tower, who plainely answered that hee
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53752:110"/>
would never put them to death to dye therefore. With the which answer <hi>Greene</hi> returned, recompting the same to King <hi>Richard</hi> at <hi>Warwicke</hi> yet on his journey, wherewith hee tooke such displeasure and thought, that the same night hee said to a secret page of his: Ah, whom shall a man trust? they that I have brought up my selfe, they that I thought would have most surely served mee, even those faile me, and at my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will doe nothing for mee. Sir, quoth the page, there lieth one in the palet chamber with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that I dare say, will doe your Grace pleasure, the thing were right hard that he would refuse, meaning this by <hi>Iames Tirell,</hi> which was a man of a goodly personage, and for the gifts of nature worthy to have served a much better Prince, if he had well served God, and by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53752:111"/>
grace obtained to have as much truth and good will, as hee had strength and wit. The man had an high heart and sore longed upward, not rising yet so fast as he had hoped, being hindered and kept under by sir <hi>Richard Ratcliffe,</hi> and sir <hi>William Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,</hi> which longing for no more partners of the Princes favour, namely not for him, whose pride they knew would beare no peere, kept him by secret drifts out of all secret trust: which thing this page had well marked and knew: wherefore this occasion offered, of very speciall friendship spied his time to set him forward, and in such wise to doe him good, that all the enemies that he had (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the devill) could never have done him so much hurt and shame; for upon the pages words, King <hi>Richard</hi> arose (for this communication had he sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53752:111"/>
on a draft, a convenient carpet for such a councell) and came out into the palet cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where hee did finde in bed the said <hi>Iames Tyrell</hi> and sir <hi>Thomas Tyrell,</hi> of person like, and brethren of blood, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of kinne in conditions. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> said the King merrily, what sirs, bee you in bed so soone? and called up <hi>Iames Tyrell,</hi> and brake to him secretly his minde in this mischievous matter, in the which hee found him nothing strange. Wherefore on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he sent him to <hi>Brakinbury</hi> with a letter, by the which hee was commanded to deliver to the said <hi>Iames</hi> all the keyes of the Tower for a night, to the end that he might there accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the Kings pleasure in such things as hee there had given him in commandement. After which letter delivered, and the keyes received, <hi>Iames</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53752:112"/>
the next night ensuing to destroy them, devising before and preparing the meanes.</p>
                  <p>The Prince assoone as the Protector tooke upon him to be King, and left the name of Protectour, was thereof adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised and shewed, that he should not reigne, but his Vncle should have the Crowne. At which word the Prince sore abashed, began to sigh and say: Alas I would mine Vncle would let mee have my life although I leese my Kingdome. Then he that told him the tale used him with good words, and put him in the best comfort that hee could, but forthwith hee and his brother were both shut up, and all other removed from them, one called <hi>Black Will,</hi> or <hi>William Slaughter</hi> onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which were set to serve them, and foure other to see them sure. After which the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53752:112"/>
the Prince never tyed his points, nor any thing regarded himselfe, but with that young babe his brother lingered in thought and heavinesse, till this trayterous deede delivered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that wretchednesse.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Iames Tirrell</hi> devised that they should bee murthered in their beds, and no blood shed: to the execution wherof, he appointed <hi>Myles Forest,</hi> one of the foure that before kept them, a fellow flesh-bred in murther before time: and to him he joyned one <hi>Iohn Digh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> his owne horsekeeper, a big, broade, square, and strong knave. Then all the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed from them,<note place="margin">King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> Children murthered</note> this <hi>Miles Forest</hi> and <hi>Iohn Dighton</hi> about midnight, the silly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lying in their beddes, came into the chamber, and suddenly lapped them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the cloathes, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53752:113"/>
them, keeping downe by force the fetherbed and pillowes hard under their mouthes, that within a while they smothered &amp; stifled them, and their breaths failing, they gave up to God their innocent soules into the joyes of heaven, leaving to the tormenters their bodies dead in the bed, which after the wretches perceived, first by the strugling with the pang of death, and after long lying still, to be through dead, they layed the bodies out upon the bed, and fetched <hi>Iames Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi> to see them, which when he saw them perfectly dead, hee caused the murtherers to bury them at the stayre foote, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deepe in the ground, under a heape of stones.</p>
                  <p>Then rode <hi>Iames Tirrell</hi> in great haste to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and shewed him all the manner of the murther, who gave him
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53752:113"/>
thankes, and as men say, there made him Knight, but hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not their buriall in so vile a corner, saying; that hee would have them buried in a better place, because they were a Kings sonnes: Loe the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable courage of a King, for he would recompence a detestable murther with a solemne obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie. Wherupon a priest of Sir <hi>Robert Brakenburies</hi> tooke them up &amp; buried them in such a place secretly as by the occasion of his death (which was shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> only knew it, the very truth could never yet bee very well and perfectly known. For some say that King <hi>Richard</hi> caused the Priest to take them up and close them in leade and to put them in a coffin full of holes, hooked at the endes with two hookes of iron, and so to cast them into a place called the <hi>Blacke deepes</hi> at the <hi>Thames
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53752:114"/>
mouth,</hi> so that they should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rise up nor bee seene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. This was the very truth unknowne, by reason that the said Priest died so shortly and disclosed it never to any person that would utter it. And for a truth, when sir <hi>Iames Tirrell</hi> was in the Tower for treason committed to King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, both he and <hi>Dighton</hi> were examined together of this point, and both they confessed the murther to bee done in the same manner as you have heard, but whither the bodies were removed, they both affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med they never knew. And thus as I have learned of them that knew much, and little cause had they to lie, where these two noble Princes, these inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent tender children, borne of the most royall blood, and brought up in great wealth, likely long to live, to raigne
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53752:114"/>
and rule in the Realme, by trayterous tyrannie taken and deprived of their estate, shortly shut up in Prison and privily slaine and murthered by the cruell ambition of their unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Vncle and his dispiteous tormenters: which things on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part well pondered, God gave this world never a more notable example, either in what unsurety standeth this worlds weale, or what mischiefe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the proud enterprise of an high heart, or finally, what wretched end insueth such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piteous crueltie.</p>
                  <p>For first to beginne with the Ministers, <hi>Miles Forest,</hi> at Saint <hi>Martins le grant,</hi> by peece meales miserably rotted away: <hi>Iohn Dighton,</hi> lived at <hi>Caleys</hi> long after, no lesse disdained and hated then pointed at, and there dyed in great miserie: But sir <hi>Iames Tirrell</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53752:115"/>
on the Tower hill for Treason: And King <hi>Richard</hi> himselfe was slaine in the field, hacked and hewen by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, hurried on a horse backe naked being dead, hee is here in despight torne and tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged like a curre dogge. And the mischiefe that hee tooke within lesse then three yeares, of the mischief that he dyed in three moneths bee not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and yet all the meane time spent in much trouble and paine outward, and much feare, dread, and anguish within. For I have heard by credible report of such as were secret with his chamberers, that after this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable deede done, hee never was quiet in his minde, he never thought himselfe sure where he went abroad, his body privily fainted, his eye wherled about, his hand ever on his dagger, his countenance and manner like
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53752:115"/>
alwayes to strike againe, hee took ill rest on nights, lay long waking and musing, for wearied with care and watch, rather slumbred then slept, troubled with fearefull dreames, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly sometime start up, leape out of his bed and looke about the chamber; so was his rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse heart continually tossed and tumbled with the tedious impression and stormy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his abhominable murther and execrable Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> by this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable mischiefe and scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act, thinking himselfe well relieved both of feare and thought, would not have it kept councell but within a few dayes caused it to run in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rumour that the two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were suddenly dead, and to this intent as it is to be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that now no heire Male

being alive of King <hi>Edwards</hi> body lawfully begotten, the people would be content with the more patient heart and quiet minde, to obey him and suffer his rule and governance: but when the same of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable fact was revealed, and divulged thorow the whole Realme, there fell generally such a dolour and inward sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row into the hearts of all the people, that all feare of his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty set a side, they in every Towne, street, and place, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wept, and pittiously sobbed. And when their sorrow was somewhat mitigate, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grudge could not refraine but cry out in places publike and also private, furiously say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what creature of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is so malicious and so obstinate an enemy either to God, or to Christian Religion, or to humane Nature, which
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53752:116"/>
would not have abhorred, or at the least abstained from so miserable a murther of so exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable a tyranny? To murther a man is much odious, to kill a woman, is in manner unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but to slay and destroy innocent Babes, and young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the whole world abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and the blood from the earth cryeth to Almighty God for vengeance. If the common people cryed out, I assure you the friends of the Queene and her children, made no lesse exclamation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint with loud voyce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably crying and saying, alas what will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53752:117"/>
hath invaded the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; now wee see that in him is neither hope of Justice nor trust of Mercy, but abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of cruelty and thirst of innocent bloud.</p>
                  <p>But when this newes was first brought to the infortunate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the dead children yet being in Sanctuary, no doubt but it strake to her heart, like the sharpe dart of death; for when shee was first informed of the murther of her two Sonnes, shee was suddenly amazed with the greatnesse of the cruelty, that for feare she sounded and fell downe to the ground, and there lay in a great agony like to a dead corps. And after that shee came to her memory, and was revived againe, shee wept and sobbed, and with pittifull scrieches shee replenished the whole Mansion, her brest shee strooke, her faire haire shee tore,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53752:117"/>
and pulled in pieces, and being overcome with sorrow and pensivenesse, rather desired death then life, calling by name divers times her sweet Babes, accounting her selfe more then mad, that she deluded by wile and fraudulent promises, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her younger sonne out of the Sanctuary to his enemy to be put to death, thinking that next the oath made to God broken, and the duty of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance toward her children violated, she of all creatures in that point was most seduced and deceived. After long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, when shee saw no hope of revenging otherwise, she kneeled downe and cryed on God to take vengeance for the deceitfull perjury, as who said shee nothing mistrusted but once hee would remember it. What is hee living, that if hee remember and behold these
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53752:118"/>
two noble infants without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, so shamefully murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that will not abhorre the fact, yea and be moved and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with pitty and mercy. And yet the world is so fraile, and our nature so blinde, that few be stirred with such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, obliviously forgetting, and little considering, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes for the offences by the Parents perpetrate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that sinne is punished in their line and posterity. This chance might so happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to these innocent children, because King <hi>Edward</hi> their Father and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent offended in staining his conscience: hee made his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath before the Gate of the City of <hi>Yorke</hi> (as you have heard before) and promised and sware one thing by his word, thinking cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his heart, as after did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. And afterward by the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53752:118"/>
death of the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> his brother, hee incurred (of likelihood) the great displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure toward God.</p>
                  <p>After this murther thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated, and that hee had visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Towne of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> which hee for his old Dignity both loved and with ample li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and priviledges en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed and decorated, he tooke his journy toward the County of <hi>Yorke,</hi> where the people abusing his lawfull favour (as hee both favoured and trusted them in his heart) had of late presumed to attempt divers routs and riots contray to his lawes, and infringing of his peace, and upon hope of his maintenance, were so elated, that no Lord, were he never of so great power, could either pacifie or rule them, till the King himselfelfe came perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally thither, to set a concord
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53752:119"/>
and an unity in that Country, and to bridle and rule the rude rusticall and blustering bold people of that region, and so he by long journeying came to the Citie of <hi>Yorke,</hi> where the Citizens received him with great pompe and triumph, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the qualities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their education, and quantity of their substance and ability, and made divers dayes, playes, and Pageants in token of joy and solace. Wherefore King <hi>Richard</hi> magnified and applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the North Nation, and also to shew himself apparantly before them in habit royall with Scepter in hand and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem on his head, made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that all persons should resort to <hi>Yorke</hi> on the day of the Ascention of our Lord, where all men should both behold and see him, his Queene and Prince in their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53752:119"/>
high estates and degrees, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for their good wills, should have received many thankes, large benefits &amp; magnificent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. At the day appointed the whole clergie assembled in Copes richly vested, and so with a reverent ceremonie went about the citie in procession, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whom folowed the King with his Crowne and Scepter apparelled in his Circot robe royall acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with no smal number of the nobilitie of his Realme: after whom marched in order Queene <hi>Anne</hi> his wife crowned, leading in her left hand Prince <hi>Edward</hi> her son, ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving on his head a demy crown appointed for the degree of a Prince. The King was had in that triumph in such honour and the common people of the North so rejoyced that they extolled and praysed him farre above the Starres. After this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53752:120"/>
feast and glorious pompe he kept great counsellers there, as well for the ordering of the countrey in time, as for the brideling and punishing of such as there had misgoverned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and further of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that countrey, he aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the number of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestical Ministers and servants, in the which persons he put his whole trust and affiance. When all things were thus discreetly ordered, hee returned by <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> and after came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> whom more for dread then for love, the Citezens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in great companies.</p>
                  <p>Thus King <hi>Richard</hi> by a new invented crueltie, &amp; late practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed tyranny, obtained and grew to high praise and honour, and then by the admiration and judgment of the common mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, he was most esteemed to bee exalted into Heaven, when
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53752:120"/>
hee covertly had intelligence, that hee was like to loose his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and could by no meanes have long continuance in his usurped power: for assuredly after the death of King <hi>Edwards</hi> children, when any bluste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring winde, perrilous thunder, or terrible tempest, chanced or were apparently like to happen: Sodainely the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple having in their fresh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie the facinorous act of their King and Prince, would openly cry and make voci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feration, that God did take vengance and punish the poore Englishmen, for the crime and offence of their ungratious King, whom they blamed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed and wished to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame tortures. Although King <hi>Richard</hi> heard often of these slaunderous words &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious sayings, and knew well by what persons they were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53752:121"/>
yet he durst not with strong hand bee on the first inventors revenged, knowing that some time it is no wisedome to refuse or disdaine them that tell a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler his dutie or declare to him his misbehaviour towards the common wealth, or counsell him to amend and change his ill life. After this great felicity, he fell againe into a great feare and pensivenesse of minde, and because he could by no meanes either correct or amend things that were past, he determined by doing his dutie in all things to his commons, to obliterate and put out of memorie that note of infamie with the which his fame was justly spotted and stayned, and to cause the people to conceive so good an opinion of him, that from thence forth no calamity nor trouble should bee adjudged to happen to the common wealth, either by his
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53752:121"/>
negligence or by his misgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (although it is difficile and strange shortly to turne and plucke out such qualities and usages as have of long time beene incorporated in a mans minde, and rooted in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conditions.) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether it was for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his former intent of amendment, or (as common fame flew abroad) that he tooke repentance of his mischievous acts and scelerate doings, hee turned over the leafe, and began an order of a new life, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have the name of a good and vertuous man, by the reason that hee shewed himselfe more just, more meeker, more familiar, more liberall (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally amongst the poore people) then before hee had accustomed to doe; and so by this meanes he firmely trusted first to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of God forgivenesse of his
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53752:122"/>
offences and crimes, and after to live and take away the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and inward grudge that the common people bare in their mindes towards him, and in conclusion, to obtaine their friendly love and assured fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Hee furthermore began and enterprised divers things as well publike as private, the which hee being prevented by sodayne death did neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish nor begin to conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>egan to found a Colledge of a hundred Priests, which foundation with the founder shortly tooke an end. To please the common people also, hee in his high Court of Parliament enacted divers and sundry good lawes and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble statutes, and especially one against strangers and foren wrought wares, not to bee transported into this Realme, which commodious act for the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53752:122"/>
common wealth, if hee had lived, hee had fully purposed to have advanced and set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and put in execution. But afterwards evidently it appeared to all persons, that onely feare (which is not a master long in office and in continuall authoritie) and not justice, caused King <hi>Richard</hi> at that very time to waxe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and amend his wicked and sinfull life, for shortly after, the goodnesse of the man which was but painted and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, suddenly waxed cold and vanished away. And from thenceforth not onely all his Councellors doings and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding suddenly decayed and resorted to none effect: But also fortune began to frowne and turned her wheele downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from him, in so much that he lost his onely begotten sonne <hi>Edward</hi> in the third

And after the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> came with three hundred horse to <hi>Northampton,</hi> and still continued with him, as partner and chiefe organ of his devices till after his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they departed, seeming all to bee very good friends at <hi>Gloucester.</hi> From whence as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as the Duke came home, hee so highly conspired against him, that a man would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell whereof the change grew in so short a space. Some say this occasion was, that a little before the Coronation, the Duke required the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the Earle of <hi>Herfords</hi> lands: and forasmuch as the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53752:124"/>
title which hee claymed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, was somewhat inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced with the title of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> which house made a title to the Crowne, and enjoyed the same three descents, as all men knew, till the house of <hi>Yorke</hi> deprived the third King, which was <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> somewhat mistrusted and conceived such an indignation, that he rejected the Dukes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, with many spitefull, and minatorie words, which so wounded the Dukes heart with hatred and mistrust, that hee could never after indure to looke right on King <hi>Richard,</hi> but ever feared his owne life, so farre forth, that when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour should ride to his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, hee feigned himselfe sicke, because he would doe him no honour.

And therefore men said that each of them ever after lived continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in such hatred and distrust of other, that the Duke looked ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to have beene murthered at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> from which hee in faire manner departed: but surely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such as were right secret with both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affirmed all this to be untrue; and otherwise men thinke it unlikely, the deepe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling nature of both these men well considered. And what
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53752:125"/>
neede in that greene world the Protector had of the Duke, and in what perill the Duke stood if hee fell once in suspition of that tyrant, that either the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour would give the Duke occasion of displeasure, or the Duke the Protectour occasion of mistrust. And surely men thinke, that if King <hi>Richard</hi> had any such opinion conceived in him, hee would never have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to avoide his hands or escape his power: but very true it is, that the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> was an high minded man, and ill could beare the glory of another, so that I have heard of some that saw it, that he at such time as the Crowne was set upon the Protectors head, his eye could never abide the sight thereof, but wryed his head another way, but men said he was not well at ease, and that was both to King <hi>Richard</hi> well

And as for the late protector, and now King, and

with that word hee left, saving that he said that he had already medled too much with the world, and would from that day meddle with his booke and beades, and no further. Then longed the Duke sore to heare, what hee would have said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee ended with the King, and there so sodainely stopped, and exhorted him familiarly, betweene them both to be bold and to say whatsoever hee thought, whereof he faithfully promised there should never come hurt, and peradventure more good then hee would thinke: And that hee himselfe intended to use his faithfull se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret advice and counsaile, which he said was the onely cause for the which hee procured of the King to have him in his custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, where he might reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at home, or else hee had beene put in the hands of them

with whom he should not have found like favour. The Bishop right humbly thanked him, and said, in good faith my Lord, I love not much to talke of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In faith, quoth he, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know nor care, so I were once hence, because of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation made against horned beasts. What foole, quoth the foxe, the Lyon never meant it by thee, for that which thou

hast is no horne in thy head. No marry, quoth hee, I know that well enough, but if hee say it is a horne, where am I then? The Duke laughed merrily at the tale, and said, my Lord I warrant you, neither the Lyon nor the Bore shall picke any matter at any thing here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for it shall never come neere their eares. In good faith sir, said the Bishop, if it did, the thing that I was about to say taken as well, as before God I meant it, could deserve but thankes, and yet taken as I thinke it would, might happen to turne mee to little good, and you to lesse.</p>
                     <p>Then longed the Duke much more to know what it was. Whereupon the Bishop said. In good faith my Lord, as for the late Protector<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sith hee is now King in possession, I purpose not to dispute his title, but for the wealth of this realme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53752:129"/>
his grace hath now the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance, and whereof I my selfe am a poore member, I was about to wish that to those good abilities whereof hee hath already right many, little nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my praise, yet might it have pleased God for the better store to have given him some of such other excellent vertues meet for the rule of the Realme, as our Lord hath planted in the person of your grace, and there left off againe. The Duke some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what marvelling at his sodaine pauses, as though they were but parentheses, with a high coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance said: my Lord, I evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perceive, and no lesse note your often breathing and sudden stopping in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, so that to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence your words neither come to any direct or perfect sentence in conclusion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by either I might perceive and

have knowledge what your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward intent is now toward the King, or what affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you beare toward me. For the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of good qualities ascribed to us both (for the which I my selfe knowledge and recognise to have none, nor looke for no praise of any creature for the same) maketh me not a little to muse, thinking that you have some other privie Imagination, by love or by grudge ingraved and imprinted in your heart, which for feare you dare not, or for childish shamefastnesse you be ashamed to disclose and reveale and especially to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your friend, which on my honour doe assure you to bee as secret in this case, as the deafe and dumbe person is to the singer, or the tree to the hunter. The Bishop being somewhat bolder, considering the Dukes promise, but most of all anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53752:130"/>
and incouraged, because hee knew the Duke desirous to bee exalted and magnified, and also he perceived the inward hatred and privie rancor which hee bare towards King <hi>Richard,</hi> was now bouldned to open his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke even to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, intending thereby to compasse how to destroy and utterly to confound King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> and to deprive him of his dignity royall, or else to set the Duke so faire with the desire of ambition, that hee himselfe might be safe, and escape out of all danger and perill, which thing hee brought shortly to conclusion both to the Kings destruction and the Dukes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion &amp; to his owne safegard, and finally, to his high promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And so (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) upon trust and confidence of the Dukes promise, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop said: my singular good
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53752:131"/>
Lord, sith the time of my cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, which being in your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces custodie, I may rather call it a liberall liberty more then a straight imprisonment, in avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding idlenesse, the mother and nourisher of all vices, in reading bookes and ancient pamphlets, I have found this sentence writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that no man is borne free and in liberty of himselfe only, for one part of duty hee oweth or should owe to his parents for his procreation by a very naturall instinct and filiall cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie: another part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to his friends and kinsfolke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for proximitie of blood, and naturall amity doth of verie duty chalenge and demand: But it the native countrey in the which hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted first the sweet aire of this pleasant flattering world after his nativitie, demandeth as a debt by a naturall bond neither to be forgotten, nor yet to bee
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53752:131"/>
put in oblivion, which saying causeth me to consider in what case this Realme my native countrey now standeth, and in what estate and assuranc before this time it hath continued: what governour we now have, and what ruler we might have, for I plainely perceive the Realme being in this case must needes decay and be brought to utter confusion and finall exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: But one hope I have incorporate in my breast, that is, when I consider and in my minde doe diligently remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and daily behold your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble personage, your justice and indifference, your fervent love towards your countrie &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise theirs to you, the great learning, pregnant wit and goodly eloquence, which so much doth abound in the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your grace, I must needes thinke this Realme fortunate,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53752:132"/>
yea twise more then fortunate, which hath such a Prince in store, meete and apt to bee a governour, in whose person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with so many quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties consisteth and resteth the very undoubted similitude and image of true honour. But on the other side when I call to memorie the good qualities of the late Protector and now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led King, so violated and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by tyranny, so changed and altered by usurped autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so clowded and shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by blind and insatiable am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, yea and so suddenly (in manner by a metamorphosis) transformed from politicke ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, to detestable tyrannie; I must needes say, and justly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that he is neither meete to be a King of so noble a Realme, nor so famous a Realme meete to be governed by such a tyrant: Was not his first enterprise to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53752:132"/>
obtaine the Crowne begun and incepted by the murther of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers noble, valiant, true, and vertuous personages? Oh a holy beginning to come to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous ending: did hee not secondarily proceede contrary to all lawes of honesty, shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully against his owne naturall mother, being a woman of much honour, and more vertue, declaring her openly to bee a woman given to carnall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and dissolute living (which thing if it had beene true, as it was not indeede: every good and naturall child would have rather beene silent, then have blased it abroade, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shee beeing alive.) Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring furthermore his two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and his two nephewes to be bastards, and to bee borne in adultery, yet not with all this is hee content. After that he had obtained the garland for
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53752:133"/>
the which hee so long thirsted, he caused the two poore inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents his nephewes committed to him for especiall trust, to bee murthered and shamefully to be killed. The blood of which sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and little babes daily cries to God, from the earth for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: alas my heart sobbeth, to remember this bloody butcher and cruell murtherer, what surety shall bee in this Realme to any person, either for life or goods under such a cruell Prince, which regardeth not the destruction of his owne blood, and then lesse the losse of others. And most especially, as often times it chanceth, where a covetuous or a cruell Prince taketh suspicion, the smalest swarving that is possible (if the thing bee misconstured) may bee the cause of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of many giltlesse persons: and especiall of noble and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53752:133"/>
wealthie personages having great possessions and riches: Such a Lord is Lucifer when he is entered into the heart of a proud Prince given to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse and crueltie.</p>
                     <p>But now, my Lord, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what I meane towards your noble person, I say and affirme, if you love God, your linage, or your native contrie, you must your selfe take upon you the Crowne and Diadem of this noble Empire, both for the maintenance of the honour of the same (which so long hath flourished in fame and renown) as also for the deliverance of your naturall countrey men, from the bondage and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (worse then the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Egypt</hi>) of so cruell a tyrant and arrogant oppressor. For thus I dare say, if any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Prince or potentate, yea the Turke himselfe would take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

So the nex day, the Duke sent for the Bishop and rehearsed to him in maner, (for he was both witty and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent) all the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had betweene them before, and so paused a while, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little season putting off his
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53752:135"/>
bonet hee said: O Lord God creator of all things, how much is this Realme of <hi>England</hi> and the people of the same boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to thy goodnesse, for where wee now bee in vexation and trouble, with great stormes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, sayling and tossing in a desperate ship without good Master or Governour: by thy helpe good Lord I trust ere long time past, that wee shall provide for such a ruler as shall be both to thy pleasure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the security and safeguard of this noble Realme. And then he put on his bonet, saying to the Bishop, my Lord of <hi>Ely,</hi> whose true heart and sincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection toward me at all times I have evidently perceived and knowne, and now most of all our last privie communication and secret devising, I must needs in heart think and with mouth confesse and say, that you bee a

sure friend, a trusty counsellor, a vigilant foreseer, a lover of your countrey, a anturall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman: for which kindnesse, for my part, I most lovingly render to you my harty thanks now with words: hereafter trusting to recompence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerate you with deedes, if life and power shall serve. And sith at our last communication, you have disclosed, and opened the very secrets and privities of your stomacke, touching the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> now usurper of the Crowne, and also have a little touched the advancement of the two noble families of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster:</hi> I shall likewise not onely declare and manifest unto you, all my open acts, attempts and doings, but also my privie intents, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cogitations. To the intent that as you have unbuckled your heart of your privie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53752:136"/>
and secret puposes to me: so shal all my cloudy working, close devices, and secret imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, bee (as cleare as the sunne) revealed, opened, and made lightsome to you.</p>
                     <p>And to begin, I declare; that when King <hi>Edward</hi> was decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to whom I thought my self little or nothing beholden, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee two had married two sisters) because, he neither promoted nor preferred mee, as I thought I was worthy and had deserved, neither favored nor regarded me, according to my degree and birth: for sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I had by him little authority and lesse rule, and in effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: which caused mee the lesse to favour his children, because I found small humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or none in their parent. I then began to study, and with mature deliberation, to ponder and consider, how and in what
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53752:137"/>
manner this Realme should be ruled and governed. And first I remembred an old proverbe worthy of memory, that often ruineth the Realme, where children rule, and women go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne. This old Adage so sunke, and setled in my head, that I thought it a great errour, and extreme mischiefe to the whole Realme, either to suffer the young King to rule, or the Queene his mother to bee a governour over him, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that her brethren, and her first children (although they were not extract of high and noble linage) tooke more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and more exalted themselves by reason of the Queene, then did the Kings bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or any Duke in his Realme: Which in conclusion turned to their confusion. Then I being perswaded with my self in this point, thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53752:137"/>
both for the publique and profitable wealth of this Realme, and also for mine owne commodity and emolument, to take part with the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi>: Whom I asure you I thought to be as cleane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dissimulation, as tractable without injury, as mercifull without crueltie, as now I know him perfectly to bee a dissembler without verity, a tyrant without pitty, yea and worse then the tyrant <hi>Phalaris,</hi> destitute of all truth &amp; clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: And so by my meanes, at the first councell holden at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> when hee was most sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of that thing that after happened, (as you my Lord know well enough) hee was made Protectour and defender, both of the King and of the Realme, which authority once gotten, and the two children partly by policie brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53752:138"/>
his governance, hee being moved with the gnawing and covetous serpent, desired to raigne, and never ceased privilie to exhort and require (yea and somtimes with minatorie termes to perswade me &amp; other Lords aswell spirituall as temporall, that hee might take upon him the Crowne, till the Prince came to the age of foure and twenty yeares, and were able to governe the Realme, as a mature and sufficient King: Which thing when hee saw me somewhat sticke at, both for the strangenesse of the example (because no such president had beene seene) and also because wee remembred that men once ascended to the highest tipe of honour and authority will not gladly discend againe, hee then brought in instruments, authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Doctors, Proctors, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the Law, with deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53752:138"/>
of divers witnesses, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying King <hi>Edwards</hi> children to be bastards, which depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then I thought to bee as true, as now I know them to be fained, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>estified by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with rewards untruely subordinate. When the said depositions were before us read and diligently heard, he stood up bareheaded, saying; Well my Lords, even as I and you sage and discreete councellers would that my Nephewes should have no wrong: So I pray you to doe mee nothing but right. For these witnesses and sayings of famous Doctors being true, I am onely the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted heire to Lord <hi>Richard Plantagenet</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi>; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to bee the very heire to the Crowne of this Realme by authority of Parliament, which things, so by learned men to us for a veritie declared, caused me
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53752:139"/>
and other to take him for our lawfull and undoubted Prince and soveraigne Lord. For well we know that the Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> Son, by reason of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of his Father, was disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to inherite, and also the Duke himselfe was named to be a bastard, as I my selfe have heard spoken, and that upon great presumptions more times then once: so againe by my ayde and favour, hee of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour was made a King, and of a subject made a Governour, at which time he promised mee upon his fidelitie, laying his hand in mine at <hi>Baynards Castle</hi> that the two yong Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should live, and that hee would so provide for them, and so maintaine them in honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estate, that I and all the Realme ought and should bee content. But when he was once Crowned King, and in full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53752:139"/>
of the whole Realme, he cast away his old conditions as the Adder doth his skinne, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the old proverbe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours change manners, as the Parish Priest remembreth not that he was ever Parish Clarke. For when I my selfe sued to him for my part of the Earle of <hi>Hartfords</hi> lands, which his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Edward</hi> wrongfully detyned and withheld from mee, and also required to have the office of the high Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ship of <hi>England,</hi> as divers of my noble ancestors before this time have had, and in long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent continued:</p>
                     <p>In this my first suite, shewing his good minde towards me, he did not onely first delay me, and afterward deny me, but gave me such unkind words, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uch taunts and retaunts, yea in manner checke and check mate to the uttermost proofe of my
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53752:140"/>
patience. As though I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver furthered him but hindred him, as though I had put him downe, and not set him up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet al these ingratitudes &amp; undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unkindnesses I bare closely and suffer patiently and covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, outwardly dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling that I inwardly thought, and so with a painted counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance I passed the last sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in his last company, not without many faire promises, but without any good deedes. But when I was credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the death of the two young innocents, his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Nephewes, contrary to his faith and promise, to the which God bee my judge I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agreed nor condiscended, O Lord, how my veines panted, how my body trembled, and my heart inwardly grudged, in so much that I so abhorred the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53752:140"/>
sight, and much more the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of him, that I could no longer abide in his court, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I should bee openly reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. The end whereof was doubtfull, and so I fained a cause to depart, and with a merry countenance and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pightful heart I tooke my leave humbly of him (hee thinking nothing lesse then that I was displeased) and so returned to <hi>Brecknocke</hi> to you.</p>
                     <p>But in the journey as I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether it were by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the holy Ghost, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Melancolous disposition, I had divers and sundry imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations how to deprive this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Vncle, and bloody butcher, from his royall seate, and princely dignity. First I fantasied, that if I list to take upon me the Crowne, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Scepter of the Realme, now was the time fit and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53752:141"/>
convenient. For now was the way made plaine, and the gate opened, and occasion given, which now neglected, should peradventure never take such effect and conclusion. For I saw hee was disdained of the Lords temporall, execrate and accursed of the Lords spiritual, detested of all gentlemen, and despised of all the commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: So that I saw my chance as perfectly, as I saw my owne Image in a glasse, that there was no person (if I had beene gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to attempt the enterprise) could nor should have won the ring, or got the gole before me. And on this point I rested in imagination secretly with my selfe, two dayes at <hi>Teukesbury.</hi> And from thence sojourning I mused &amp; thought it was not best nor convenient to take vpon me as a conquerour, for then I knew that all men, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53752:141"/>
the nobilitie, would with all their power withstand me, both for rescuing of possessions and tenours, as also for subverting of the whole estate, Lawes, and Customes of the Realme: Such a power hath a conquerour, as you know well enough my Lord. But at the last, in all this doubtfull case there sprang a new branch out of my head, which surely I thought should have brought forth faire flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but the sunne was so hot that they turned to dry weedes; for I suddenly remembred that Lord <hi>Edmond</hi> Duke of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi> my Grandfather was with King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt in the second and third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> lawfully begotten: So that I thought sure my mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eldest daughter to Duke <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> that I was next to King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt of the house of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53752:142"/>

                           </gap>r.</hi> This title pleased well such as I made privie of my counsell, but much more it encouraged my foolish desire, and elevated my ambitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, in so much that I clerely judged, and in mine own minde was determinately resolved, that I was indubitated heire of the house of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon concluded, to make my first foundation, and erect my new building. But whether God so ordered, or by fortune it so chanced, while I was in a mase, either to conclude so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely on this title, and to set it open amongst the common people, or to keepe it secret a while, see the chance: as I rode betweene <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,</hi> I encountered with the lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Countesse of <hi>Richmond,</hi> now wife to the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> which is the very daughter and sole heyre to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53752:142"/>
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> my grandfathers elder brother: Which was as cleane out of my minde as though I had never never seene her, so that shee and her sonne the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> be both bulwarke and portco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice betweene, and the gate, to enter into the majesty royall and getting of the Crowne. And when wee had communed a little concerning her sonne, as I shall shew you after, and were departed, shee to our Lady of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and I toward <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury:</hi> I then new changed and in manner amased, began to dispute with my selfe, litle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that thus my earnest was turned even to a tittle not woth esteeme. Presently I imagined whether I were best to take upon me, by the election of the nobilitie and commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which me thought easie to be done, the usurper King thus
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53752:143"/>
being in hatred and abhorred of this whole Realme, or to take it by power, which stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in fortunes chance, and difficile to bee atchieved and brought to passe. Thus rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling &amp; tossing, in the waves of ambiguitie, betweene the stone and sacrifice, I considered first the office, duty, and paine of a King, which surely thinke that no mortall man can justly, and truely observe, except hee bee called, elected, and specially appointed by God, as King <hi>David</hi> and divers others have beene.</p>
                     <p>But further I remembred that if I once tooke on mee the Scepter, and the governance of the Realme: That of two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame enemies I was daily sure, but of one trusty friend (which now adayes bee gone a pilgrimage) I was neither assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nor credibly ascertained
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53752:143"/>
(such is the worlds mutation) for I manifestly perceived that the daughters of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and their alies, and friends, which be no small number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both, for his sake much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and also for the great injurie &amp; manifest tyranni done to them, by the new usurper, much lamented, and pittied, would never cease to barke if they cannot bite at the one side of me. Likewise my cousin the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> his aides &amp; kinsfolke, which be not of little power, will surely attempt like a fierce grayhound, either to bite or to pierce mee on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side. So that my life and rule should ever hang by a haire, never in quiet, but ever in doubt of death or deposition. And if the said two linages of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> which so long have strived for the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Diadem, should joyne in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53752:144"/>
one against mee, then were I surely mated and the game got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Wherefore I have clearely determined, and with my selfe concluded, utterly to relinquish all such fantasticall imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the obtaining of the Crowne. But all such plagues, calamities and troubles (which I feared and suspected) might have chanced on me if I had taken the rule and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this reale, I shall with a reredemaine so make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound to our common enemie that calleth himselfe King, that the best stopper that hee hath at tenice shall not well stop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fault: for as I told you before, the Countesse of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in my returne from the new named King, meeting mee in the high way, prayed me first for kindred sake, secondly for the love I bare to my grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duke <hi>Humphrey,</hi> which
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53752:144"/>
was sworne brother to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to move the King to bee good to her sonne <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and to licence him with his favour to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into <hi>England</hi>: and if it were his pleasure so to doe, shee promised that the Earle her sonne should marry one of King <hi>Edwards</hi> daughters at the appointment of the King without any thing to be taken or demanded for the said e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spousals, but onely the Kings favour, which request I soone overpassed, and gave her faire words and so departed. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in my lodging, when I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to memorie with a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate studie, and did circumspct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ponder them, I fully adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the holy Ghost caused her to move a thing (the end whereof she could not consider) both for the security of the Realme as also for the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53752:145"/>
of her child, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and finall confusion of the common enemy King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</hi> Which thing shee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thought, I am sure, as I by her words could make conjecture, nor I my selfe cast not her desire to be so profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Realme as I now doe perceive, but such a Lord is God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that with a little sparkle he kindleth a great fire, and so finally to declare to you the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conclusion to the which I am both bent and set, my mind is, and my power and purpose shall helpe, that the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> very heire of the house of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of the which linage, both my father and grandfather lost their lives in battell) shall take to wife Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldest daughter to K. <hi>Edward</hi>; by the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> marriage both the houses of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> may bee
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53752:145"/>
obtained and united in one, to the cleare stablishment of the title to the Crowne of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Realme. To the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion if the mothers of both parties, and especially the Earle himselfe, and the Lady will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, I doubt not but the brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bore, which with his tuskes raseth every mans skinne, shall not only be brought to confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he hath deserved, but that this Empire shal ever be certain of an undubitate heire, and then shall all civill and intestine war cease, which hath so long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, to the parting of many mens Crownes, &amp; this Realme shall bee reduced againe to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse, renoune, and glory. This invention of the Duke many men thought after, that it was more imagined for the inward hatred that he beare to King <hi>Richard,</hi> then for any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that hee bare to the Earle
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53752:146"/>
of <hi>Richmond.</hi> But of such doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matters, it is not best to judge for erring to farre from the minde and entent of the actour: But whatsoever he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, this device once opened to King <hi>Richard</hi> was the very occasion, that hee was rounded shorter by the whole head, without attainder or judgement.</p>
                     <p>When the Duke had said, the Bishop, which ever favored the house of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> was wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous joyfull, and much rejoyced to heare this device, for now came the winde about even as hee would have it; for all his imagination tended to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to have King <hi>Richard</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and to have the lines of K. <hi>Edward</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt againe raised and advanced. But Lord how hee rejoyced to thinke how that by this marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the linages of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> should bee conjoyned
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53752:146"/>
in one, to the very stead fastnesse of the publique wealth of this Realme.</p>
                     <p>And lest the Dukes courage should swage, or his minde should againe alter, as it did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, as you may easily perceive by his owne tale; Hee thought to set up all the sailes hee had, to the intent that the ship of his pretended purpose might come shortly to some sure port: And said to the Duke, my Lord; sith by Gods high provision &amp; your incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable wisedome and policie, this noble conjunction was first moved, now it is convenient, yea and necessary to consider, what personages and friends we shall first make privie of this high device and politicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. By my truth quoth the Duke wee will begin with my Lady of <hi>Richmond</hi> the Earles mother which knoweth where
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53752:147"/>
he is, either in captivitie or at large in Brytaine. For I heard say that the Duke of Britaine restored him to liberty imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> by whose meanes hee was restrayned. Sith you will begin that way (said the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) I have an old friend with the Countesse, a man sober, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and well witted, called <hi>Reignold Bray,</hi> whose prudent policie I have knowne to have compassed things of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for whom I shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly send if it bee your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, &amp; I doubt not he wil glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come, and with a good will. So with a little diligence, the Bishop wrote a letter to <hi>Reigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold Bray,</hi> requiting him to come to <hi>Brecknock</hi> with speede, for great and urgent causes touching his Mistresse: and no other thing was declared in the letter. So the messenger rode
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53752:147"/>
into <hi>Lancashire</hi> where <hi>Bray</hi> was with the Countesse and Lord <hi>Thomas Stanley</hi> her husband, &amp; delivered the letter, which when hee had read, hee tooke it as a signe or presage of some good fortune to come, and so with the messenger hee came to the Castle of <hi>Brecknocke,</hi> where the Duke and the Bishop declared what thing was devised both to set the Realme in a quiet stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse, and also for the high preferment of the Earle of <hi>Richmonds</hi> sonne to his Lady and Mistrisse: Willing her first to compasse how to obtaine the good wil of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and also of her eldest daughter bearing the same name: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter secretly to send to her son into <hi>Britaine</hi> to declare what high honour was prepared for him if he would sweare to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> assoone as hee was King and in Royall
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53752:148"/>
possession of the Realme. <hi>Reigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold Bray</hi> with a glad heart for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting nothing hiven to him in charge, in gread hast and with good speede returned to the Countesse his Lady and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Bray</hi> was departed and this great dolefull vessell once set a broach, the Bishop thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting for nothing more then for liberty, when he saw the Duke pleasant and well minded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him told, the Duke that if he were in his Isle of <hi>Ely</hi> hee could make many friends to further their enterprise, and if he were there &amp; had but foure daies warning, hee little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the malice of King <hi>Richard,</hi> his countrey was so strong. The Duke knew well all this to bee true, but yet loth hee was that the Bishop should depart, for he knew well that as long as the Bishop was with him, hee was
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53752:148"/>
sure of politique advice, sage councell, and circumspect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. And so hee gave the Bishop faire words, saying that hee should shortly depart, and that wel accompanied for feare of enemies. The Bishop being as wittie as the Duke was wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, did not tarry till the Dukes company were assembled, but secretly disguised in a night de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted (to the Dukes great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure) and came to his see of <hi>Ely,</hi> where he found money and friends, and so sayled into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> where he did the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> good service, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returned againe till the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> after being King sent for him, and shortly promoted him to the See of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Thus the Bishop wound himselfe from the Duke when he had most neede of his ayde, for if hee had tarried still the Duke had not made so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53752:149"/>
blabbes of his councell, nor put so much confidence in the <hi>Welshmen,</hi> nor yet so temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously set forward without knowledge of his friends as hee did, which things were his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine overthrow as they that knew it did report.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Reighnald Bray</hi> had declared his message, and privie instruction to the Countesse of <hi>Richmond</hi> his Mistrisse, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell though she were joyous and glad, both of the good newes and also for the obtaining of such a high friend in his sonnes cause as the Duke was, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shee willing not to slip this matter, but to farther it to the uttermost of her power and abilitie, devised a meanes how to breake this matter to Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> then being in sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary at <hi>Westminster.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon shee having in her family at that time for the preservation
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53752:149"/>
of her health, a certaine Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>Lewes,</hi> learned in Physicke, which for his gravitie and experience was well known and much esteemed amongst great estates of the Realme: with whom she used sometimes liberally and familiarly to talke; now having oportunity and occasion to break her mind unto him of this weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, declared that the time was come that her sonne should bee joyned in marriage with Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> daughter and heire to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and that King <hi>Richard</hi> being taken and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all men for the common enemy of the Realme, should out of all honour and estate bee dejected, and of his rule and kingdome be clearely spoyled and expulsed: and required him to go to Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (with whome in his facultie hee was of counsell) not as a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53752:150"/>
but as one that came friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to visite and consolate her, and as time and place should require to make her privie of this device, not as a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but as a purpose by him imagined. This Physitian did not long linger to accomplish her desire, but with good dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence repaired to the Queene, being still in the sanctuary at <hi>Westminster.</hi> And when hee saw time proper and convenient for his purpose, hee said unto her: Madam, although my imagination bee very simple, and my device more foolish, yet for the entire affection that I beare towards you and your children, I am so bold to utter unto you a secret and privie conceit that I have cast &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed in my fantasticall braine. When I well remember, and no lesse consider the great losse and dammage that you have sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

by the death of your noble and loving husband, and the great dolour and sorrow that you have suffered and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the cruell murther of your innocent children: I can no lesse doe both of bounden duty and christian charity, then daily study, and hourely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine not onely how to bring your heart to comfort &amp; glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but also devise how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the righteous quarrell of you and your children on that bloody blood-sucker and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell tyrant King <hi>Richard.</hi>

joy and gladnesse. And first gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laude to almighty God as the chiefe authour of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, secondly to Master <hi>Lewes</hi> the deviser of the good newes and tidings, instantly besought him, that as hee had beene the first inventer of so good an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, that now hee would not relinquish nor desist to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the same: desiring him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (because hee was appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Countesse of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> mother to the Earle <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>) that hee would with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence resort to her then lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her husbands place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the citie of <hi>London,</hi> and to declare on the Queenes behalfe to the Countesse, that all the friends and favourers of King <hi>Edward</hi> her husband, should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and take part with the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> her sonne, so that he would take a corporall oath after the Kingdome obtained,

to espouse and take to wife the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her daughter, or else Lady <hi>Cecile,</hi> if the eldest daughter were not then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                     <p>Master <hi>Lewes</hi> with all dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie so sped his businesse, that he made and concluded a finall end and determination of this enterprise betweene the two mothers, and because hee was a Physitian, and out of all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and misdeeming, hee was the common currer and daily messenger betweene them, ayd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and setting forth the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted conspiracie against King <hi>Richard.</hi> So the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> Countesse of <hi>Richmond</hi> brought into a good hope of the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53752:152"/>
of nobility to joyne with her, and to take her part as hee knew to bee ingenious, faithfull, diligent, and of activity. This <hi>Reighnold Bray</hi> within few daies brought unto his lure (first of all taking of every person a solemne oath to be true and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) sir <hi>Gyles Daubeney,</hi> sir <hi>Iohn Cheiney</hi> knight, <hi>Richard Guyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Raine</hi> Esqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and divers others. The Countesse of <hi>Richmond</hi> was not so diligent for her part, but Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was as vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant on the other side, and made friends, and appointed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellers to set forward and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance her businesse. In the meane season the Countesse of <hi>Richmond</hi> tooke into her service <hi>Christopher Vrswicke,</hi> an honest and a wise Priest, and after an oath of him for to bee secretly taken and sworne, shee uttered to him all her mind &amp; councell,

adhibiting to him the more confidence and truth that he all his life had favoured and taken part with King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, and as a speciall jewell put to her service by sir <hi>Lewes</hi> her Physitian. So the mother studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the prosperitie of her sonne appointed this <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Vrsewicke</hi> to saile into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and to declare and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to him all pacts and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments betweene her and the Queene agreed and concluded: But sudenly shee remembring that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was one of the first inventers, and a secret founder of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, determined to send some personage of more esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation then her chaplaine, and so elected <hi>Hugh Conway</hi> esquire, and sent him into with a great some of money to her son, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him charge to declare to

and both made such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and had such winde and weather, the one by land from <hi>Calice,</hi> and the other by water from <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> that within lesse then an hower both arrived in the Duke of <hi>Britaines</hi> court, and spake with the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> from the death of K. <hi>Edward</hi> went at his pleasure and liberty, and to him counted and manifested the cause and effect of their message and Embassage. When the Earle had received this joyfull message, which was the more pleasant because it was unlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, hee rendred to Jesu his saviour his most humble and harty thankes, being in firme credence and beleefe that things as hee with busie minde and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious entent had wished and desired, could never have taken any effect without the helpe and preferment of Almighty

upon interrogatories examined what things he knew prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the Kings person, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and declared frankely and freely all the conjuration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dissembling or glosing, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting because he had truely and plainely revealed and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all things that were of him required, that hee should have licence to speake to the King which (whether it were to sue for pardon and grace, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee being brought to his presence, would have sticked him with a dagger, as men then judged) he sore desired and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.

at the hands of King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> whom he before in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, purposes and enterprises had holden, sustayned and set forward above all Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode.</p>
                     <p>By this all men may easily perceive that hee not onely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth both his labour, travell and industry, &amp; further stayneth and spotteth his line with a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ignominy and reproach, which in evill and mischiefe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth and aideth an evill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed person, considering for the most part, that hee for his friendly favour should receive some great displeasure or infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate chance.

The ship wherein the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> was, associate onely with one other barke was all night tossed and turmoyled. In the morning after, when the rage of the furious tempest was asswaged, and the ire of the blustering was something ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, about the hower of noone the same day, the Earle approached to the south part of the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> even at the mouth of the Haven of Pole in the county of <hi>Dorset,</hi> where hee might plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the Sea bankes and shores garnished and furnished with men of warre and souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers appointed and deputed there to defend his arrivall and landing as before is mentioned. Wherefore hee gave straight charge and sore commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that no person should once presume to take land and goe to the shore, untill such

Kings humanity adventured to send his ships home into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and to set forward him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by land on his journie, making no great haste till his messengers were returned, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being with the benefit so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and with hope of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous successe so encouraged, marched towards <hi>Britaine</hi> with all diligent celeritie, intending there to consult further with his lovers and friends of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and enterprises.</p>
                     <p>When hee was returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into <hi>Britaine</hi> hee was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by credible information that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had lost his head, and that the Marques <hi>Dorset,</hi> and a great number of noble men of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had a little before enquired and searched for him there, and were now returned to <hi>Vanues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When hee had heard these newes thus reported, hee first
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53752:167"/>
sorrowed, &amp; dolorously lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the first attempt and setting forward of his friends, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of the Nobility not to have more fortunately succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Secondly, hee rejoyced on the other part, that God had sent him so many valiant and prudent Captaines to bee his companions in his martiall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, trusting surely, and nothing doubting in his owne opinion, but that all his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse should bee wisely compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and brought to a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. Wherefore hee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining with all diligence to accelerate and set forward his new begun businesse, departed to <hi>Renes,</hi> and sent certaine of his privie servitours to conduct and bring the Marquis and the other Noble men to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. When they knew that hee was safely returned into <hi>Britaine,</hi> Lord how they rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53752:168"/>
and applauded, for before that time they missed him, and knew not in what part of the world to make investigation or search for him.</p>
                     <p>For they doubted and no lesse feared lest hee had taken land in <hi>England,</hi> and fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of King <hi>Richard,</hi> in whose person they knew wel was neither mercy nor compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Wherefore in all speedy manner they galloped towards him, and him reverently salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which meeting after great joy and solace, and no small thanks and gratifications given and rendered on both parts, they consulted and advisedly debated &amp; commoned of their great businesse and weightie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, in the which season the solene feast of the Nativitie of our Saviour Christ happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, on which day all the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Lords went with great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53752:168"/>
to the chiefe Church of the Cittie, and there each gave faith and promise to other.

                     <p>Which solemne oathes made

and taken, the Earle of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> declared and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all these doings to <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> desiring and most heartily requiring him to aide him with a great army to conduct him into his Countrey, which so sore longed and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his returne, and to the which he was by the more part of the Nobilitie called and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which (with Gods ayde and the Dukes comfort) hee doubted not in short time to obtaine, requiring him further to lend to him a convenient some of money, affirming that all such somes of money which he had received of his especiall friends, were spent and exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the preparation of the last journey made towards <hi>England,</hi> which somes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney after his enterprise once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chived, he in the word of a Prince faithfully promised to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53752:169"/>
repay and restore againe. The Duke promised him aide and helpe, upon confidence wherof he rigged his ships, &amp; set forth his Navie well decked with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, &amp; warlikely furnished with all things necessary, to the intent to saile forward shortly, and to see no convenient time slackly overpassed, nor bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted.</p>
                     <p>In the meane season, King <hi>Richard</hi> apprehended in divers parts of the Realme, certaine gentlemen of the Earle of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> faction and confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which either intended to saile into <hi>Britaine</hi> towards him, or else at his landing to assist and aide him. Amongst whom, sir <hi>George Browne,</hi> sir <hi>Roger Clifford</hi> and foure others were put to execution at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and sir <hi>Thomas Sentliger</hi> which had married the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Exeter</hi> the Kings owne
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53752:170"/>
sister, and <hi>Thomas Rame</hi> and diverse others were executed at <hi>Exeter.</hi> Besides these persons, diverse of his houshold servants whom either hee suspected or doubted, were by great crueltie put to shamefull death. After this hee called a Parliament in the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he attainted the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> and all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which were fled out of the Realme for feare of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause, as enemies to him &amp; their naturall countrey, and all their lands, goods, and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were confiscate and seased to the Kings use. And yet not content with this prey which no doubt was of no small va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and moment, hee laid on the peoples neckes a great taxe and tollage, and surely necessity to that act in a manner compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him. For what with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and declaring his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie concerning the murther
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53752:170"/>
of his Nephewes towards the world, &amp; what with cost to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the love and favour of the commonaltie (which outwardly glosed and openly dissembled with him) hee gave prodigally so many and so great rewards, that now both hee lacked and, scarce knew honestly how to borrow.</p>
                     <p>In this troublous season, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more marvelled at then that the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> had not beene taken and reputed as an enemie to the King, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the working of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Margaret</hi> his wife, mother to the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi>: but forasmuch as the enterprise of a woman was of him reputed of no regard or estimation, and that the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had purged himselfe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to be innocent of all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and attempts by her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53752:171"/>
and committed, it was given him in charge to keepe her in some secret place at home, without having any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or company, so that from thenceforth shee should never send letter nor messenger to her sonne nor any of his friend or confederates, by the which the King might bee molested or troubled, or any hurt or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice might bee attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his realme and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie. Which commandement was a while put in execution, and accomplished according to his dreadfull commandement. Yet the wild worme of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance wavering in his head, could not bee content with the death of divers gentlemen suspected of treason, but also he must extend his bloudy fury against a poore gentleman cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Collingborne</hi> for making a small Rime of three of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat

                     <p>The King of <hi>Scots</hi> having neede of Friends, but not so much neede as King <hi>Richard</hi>

w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was of necessitie compelled to seeke aiders, and to entertaine fautours, the one for favouring of flatterers and base borne persons, and the other not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for tyranny and unnaturall homicide, but also for the usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Crowne being of all the Realme detested and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, gladly accepted and joyously consented to King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi> device and conjunction of amitie, perfectly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that amongst all bonds and obligations of love and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, that there is neither a surer nor a more perfect locke, then the knot of conjunction in the Sacrament of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which was in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of the first age of man, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and instituted in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place of Paradice terrestiall by God himselfe: by reason whereof, the propagation and succession of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said Princes sent their Embassadours and Councellors againe to the Towne of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> where the said mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was by writings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments covenanted, condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended and agreed, and affian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made and taken by Procters and Deputies on both parts, and shee immediately called Princesse of <hi>Rothsay,</hi> which name shee shortly lost by the short life of King <hi>Richard</hi> her loving Uncle. Here may well bee noted the unnaturall love and disordered affection which this kinde kinseman shewed to his blood: for he not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53752:182"/>
the tyranny that he had executed against his brothers sons, the wrong &amp; manifest inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that he had done to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers daughters, both in taking fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them their dignity, possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and living, thought it should redound greatly to his honour and fame, if hee promoted his sisters child (to whom hee was nothing bound in conscience to make testification) to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Queene, rather then to preferre his brothers daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whom hee had untruly and by force disinherited, and of all their right deprived, to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of a meane Esquire: such was his fraternall kindnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his brother, and such was his large conscience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his brothers children.</p>
                     <p>After this league and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age thus concluded and agreed, the King of <hi>Scots</hi> disdaining that the strong Castle of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre</hi>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:53752:182"/>
should remaine in the Englishmens hands and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wrote a gentle letter to K. <hi>Richard,</hi> declaring to him that where in the league concluded betweene them, it was agreed and appointed that hee should within forty daies next ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, expresse and declare his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and meaning concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Castle of <hi>Dumbarre,</hi> whether the said castle should be occupied &amp; stand still in the hands of the Englishmen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of the truce, or else for the time of sixe moneths onely; He now certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied King <hi>Richard</hi> by his letters, that he was content that he and his should enjoy the possession of the said Castle quietly and peaceably during the said truce and amity. Neverthelesse hee required him for the love and familiaritie that now both by treatie &amp; aliance was sprung &amp;
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53752:183"/>
knit betweene them, that hee would redeliver the said Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle into his hands, which was untruely possessed of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish nation by deliverie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and traytours, contrarie to all right, equitie, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. King <hi>Richard</hi> dalied with pleasant letters &amp; faire words, and so fooled forth the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> that hee never had <hi>Dumbarre</hi> delivered while King <hi>Richard</hi> lived, after whose death, whether it were by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or by appointment, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle was rendred to the King of <hi>Scots</hi> to his great contentation &amp; rejoycing. Albeit this league and amitie thus covenanted and concluded, it might manifestly seeme to all persons, that all conjurations and confederacies against King <hi>Richard</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and put to silence, and in especially cousidering tha the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and his
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53752:183"/>
alies were made out of his way, some by death, and some by banishment and exiling into far Countries and Regions: Yet King <hi>Richard</hi> more doubting then trusting to his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and friends, was continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed, tossed and unquieted with feare of the returne of the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices and fautoures, which dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dread, and hourely agony, caused him to live in dolefull misery, ever unquiet, and in manner in continual calamitie. Wherefore he intending to bee relieved, and to have all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous imagination alleviated, determined cleerely to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate &amp; plucke up all the matter and ground of his feare and doubts. Wherefore after long &amp; deliberate consultation had, nothing was for his purpose and intent thought either more necessary or expedient, then
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53752:184"/>
once againe with price, prayer, and rewards, to attempt the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> in whose ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> then abode, to deliver the said Earle into his hands, by which onely meanes he should bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of all feare of perill, and brought to rest and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse both of body and mind. Wherefore incontinent he sent certaine Embassadours to the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> which tooke upon them (besides the great and ample rewards that they brought with them into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>) that King <hi>Richard</hi> should yeerely pay and answer the Duke of all the revenues, rents, and profits, of the signories, lands, and possessions, aswell belonging and appertaining to the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> as to any other noble or gentleman which then were in the Earles company, if he after that time
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53752:184"/>
would keepe them in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prison and restraine them from liberty.</p>
                     <p>The Oratours furnished with these and other instructions, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and came to the Dukes house, where with him they could have no manner of communication concerning their weightie affaires, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that hee being fatigate and weakened by a long and daily infirmity, began a little to waxe idle and weake in his wit and remembrance. For which cause <hi>Peter Landoyse</hi> his chiefe Treasurer, a man both of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wit and great authoritie, ruled and judged all things at his pleasure and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the which cause (as men set into high authoritie be not best beloved) he excited and provoked against him the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and evill will of the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Britaine,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53752:185"/>
for divers great offences by him during his authority perpetrate and committed, by their meanes was brought to death and confusion.

                     <p>This <hi>Peter</hi> which was no lesse disdayned then hated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of all the people of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> thought that if he did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and satisfie King <hi>Richards</hi> Petition and desire, hee should be of power and ability suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to withstand and refell the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53752:185"/>
malicious attempts and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his envious adversaries. Wherefore hee faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to accomplish King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi> request and desire, so that he kept promise with him, that he might bee able to withstand the cankered malice of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret enemies. This act that hee promised to doe, was not for any grudge or malice that hee bare to the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> for as you have heard before, he delivered him from perill of death at Saint <hi>Malos</hi> when he was in great doubt of life and jeopardie, but as cause riseth we ever offend, and that cursed hunger of gold and execrable thirst of lucre, and inward feare of losse of authoritie, driveth the blind mindes of covetous men and ambitious persons to evills and mischiefes innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not remembring losse of name, obloquie of the people,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53752:186"/>
nor in conclusion the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God for their merits and deserts. But fortune was so favorable to the publique wealth of the Realme of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> that this deadly and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous compact tooke none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or place. For while posts ranne, and letters were sent to and fro for the finishing of this great enterprise betweene King <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Peter Landoyse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iohn Morton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing then in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> was was of all this craftie conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance certified by his secret and sure friends: wherefore he sent <hi>Christopher Vrswicke</hi> (which at that verie season was come out of <hi>Britaine</hi> into <hi>Flaunders</hi>) to declare to the Earle of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> how all the deceit and craftie working was conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and compassed, giving him in charge to counsell and advise the Earle in all haste possible
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:53752:186"/>
with all his company to retire out of <hi>Britaine</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> When these newes were brought to the Earle, he then kept house in <hi>Vannes,</hi> and incontinent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched againe <hi>Christopher Vrs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> K. requiring him that hee and his might safely passe into <hi>France,</hi> which desire, impetrated and obteyned, the messenger short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned to his Lord and Prince. The Earle well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that it was expedient and necessarie with all speede and diligence, to looke to this weightie matter, calling verie few to councell, he made explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and search of all secret and by waies, and sent before all his noble men, as though for a certaine familiarity and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they should visit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Duke, which then for recreation and change of aire, lay on the borders and confines
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53752:187"/>
of <hi>France.</hi> And secretly hee gave charge to the Earle of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> which was the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and conducter of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that when they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the marches and limits of <hi>Britaine,</hi> they should divert and take the next way into <hi>France.</hi> The noble men somewhat sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of things newly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, without any tarrying or by the journey gasing, scouring the waies as fast as their horse would runne, or as they conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently might beare &amp; sustaine, came out of the Dutchy of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> into the Dutchy of <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou</hi> in the dominion of <hi>France,</hi> where they expected the Earles comming, which two dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter departed out of <hi>Vannes,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied with five servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, as though hee had gone to visite some familiar friend of his in a small village adjoyning. No man suspected that hee
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53752:187"/>
would depart, considering that a great multitude of English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were left and continued in the citie, but after he had passed directly five miles forward, hee suddenly turned into a solitary wood next adjoyning, where cloathing himselfe in the simple coate of his poore servant, made and appointed his said minister, leader and master of his small co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, &amp; he as an humble page diligently followed and served his counterfeit governour, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver resting nor themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing, except the bayting of their horses, till they by waies unknowne, now this way, now turning that way, came to their company abiding them in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth day after the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> was thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, that craftie merchant <hi>Perter Landoyse,</hi> trusting still af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his prey promised by King
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53752:188"/>
                        <hi>Richard,</hi> was ready to set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his crew of souldiers, which he privily had consigned with certaine trustie captaines for that onely purpose appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and elected, to performe and atchieve his pretensed enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, dissembling &amp; feigning them to be conducted and hired by him to serve the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and him to conduct in his returne towards his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive countrey, meaning none other thing but to apprehend him and the other noble men in his retinue, which no such fraud suspecting, nor yet any treason imagining, unawares and unprovided and destitute of all aide, and them to cast and detrude suddenly into continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all captivitie and bondage, to the intent that by this facino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and naughty act, he might satisfie the charitable request and louing desires of good K.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53752:188"/>
                        <hi>Richard,</hi> more for his owne profit then for King <hi>Richards</hi> gaine. But when this crafty dissembler <hi>Peter Landoyse,</hi> which was no wiliar then an old Foxe, perceived that the Earle was departed (thinking that to bee true that hee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) Lord how curriours ran into every coast, how light-horsemen galloped to every streete to follow and detaine him, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> by any possibility hee could bee subsecuted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and him to incarcerate and bring captive into the citie of <hi>Vannes.</hi> The horsemen made such diligence, and with such celeritie set forward their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that nothing was more likely then they to have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yea and seazed their prey. For the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> was not entred into the Realme of <hi>France</hi> scarse one houre, but the followers came to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53752:189"/>
and confines of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and durst adventure no further, but vainely without their desire sorrowfully returned. At which season were left at <hi>Vannes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the number of three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen, which not being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to counsell, and unawares of this enterprise, but knowing of the Earles sudden departure, were so incontinently astonied, that in a manner they were all in despaire both of him and their owne securitie and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. But fortune turned her saile, and otherwise it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then their feare them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combred. For the Duke of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> now being somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, was sore displeased, and nothing contented that the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> was in his dominion so uncurteously tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and intreated, that hee should bee by fraud and untruth compelled to leave and fly out
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53752:189"/>
of his Dutchy and countrey contrary to his honour. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee tooke great displeasure with <hi>Peter Landoyse</hi> his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, to whom (although hee knew not and was ignorant that all the drift was driven and devised by him) he laid the fault and imputed the crime. Wherefore he sent for <hi>Edward Woodvile,</hi> and <hi>Edward Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges</hi> valiant Esquiers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and delivered unto them money sufficient for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, willing them them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the rest of the Englishmen being in <hi>Britaine,</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Richmonds</hi> presence.</p>
                     <p>When the Earle was thus furnished and appointed with his trusty company, and was escaped all the dangerous laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes and snares that were set for him, no marvell though he were jocund and glad of the prosperous successe that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53752:190"/>
in his affaires. Wherefore lest hee should seeme to be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the note of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, hee sent divers of his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> the which should publish and declare to him on the behalfe of the Earle, that hee and his were onely by his benefit and favour conserved and delivered from the imminent danger that they were like to be trapped in. Wherefore at that time he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to him most heartie thanks in words, trusting and not doubting, but in time to come liberally to recompence him with acts and deedes.</p>
                     <p>After this, the Earle tooke his journey to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, living then at <hi>Langes,</hi> upon the river of Leyre, to whom after great thankes given for manifold gratuities by him to the Earle shewed, hee disclosed and manifested the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53752:190"/>
cause and occasion of his accesse and repaire to his person. After that hee required of him helpe and succour, to the intent that by his immortall benefit to him at that time shewed, hee might safely returne to the nobilitie of his Realme, of whom he was generally called to take upon him the Crowne and Scepter of the Realme, they so much hated and abhorred the tyranny of King <hi>Richard.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> promised him aide and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and bad him bee of good courage and make good cheere, for hee assured him that hee would gladly shew to him his benevolent minde and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full liberalitie. Which King from thence removed to <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>targis,</hi> leading with him the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and all the noble personages of his retinue and faction.</p>
                     <p>While the Earle was thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53752:191"/>
in the <hi>French</hi> Court, <hi>Iohn Vere</hi> Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> (which as you have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was by King <hi>Edward</hi> kept in prison within the Castle of <hi>Hammes</hi>) so perswaded <hi>Iohn Blunt</hi> captaine of the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, and sir <hi>Iohn Fortescewe</hi> porter of the towne of <hi>Caleys,</hi> that he himselfe was not onely dismissed and set at liberty, but they also abandoning and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their fruitfull offices, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended to goe with him into <hi>France</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> and to take his part. But <hi>Iames Blunt</hi> like a wise captaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he left his wife remaining in the Castle before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hee fortified the same both with new inventions and new souldiours. When the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> saw the Earle of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> hee was ravished with an incredible gladnesse, that hee being a man of so high nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53752:191"/>
of such knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in feates of warre, and so constant, trusty and assured (which alwaies had studied for the maintenance &amp; preferment of the house of <hi>Lancaster</hi>) was now by Gods provision delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of captivitie and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, and in time so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and convenient come to his aide, succour, and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in whom more sure then any other he might put his trust and confidence, and take lesse paine and travile in his owne person. For it was not hid from him, that such as had ever ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken paines with King <hi>Edward</hi> before this time, came to doe him service either for malice that they bare to K. <hi>Richard,</hi> or else for feare to fall under his truculent rule and tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous governement. But this man which so often times had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally fought in mortall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53752:192"/>
in the quarrell of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixt, hee judged by divine power and heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration to be delivered out of captivitie and imprisonment for this onely purpose, that hee should have a man of his owne faction and schoole, to whom he might surely and faithfully communicate and credite all things as to his owne proper person, and therefore being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with an immortall joy for the Earles comming, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to have a good hope of the happie successe of all his pretensed enterprises.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, the French King returned againe to <hi>Paris,</hi> whom the Eale of <hi>Richmond</hi> followed, intending there to solicite his matter to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion Wherupon he besought King <hi>Charles</hi> to take upon him the whole tuition and defence of him and his cause, so that he
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53752:192"/>
and his company being by his meanes aided and comforted, should confesse and say, their wealth, victory and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have flowed and bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded forth of his bountifulnesse &amp; liberality, which they would God willing shortly require. In the meane season divers En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen, which either fled out of <hi>England</hi> for feare, or were at <hi>Paris</hi> to learne and studie good literature and vertuous doctrine came voluntarily and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves to the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and vowed and sware to take his part. Amonst whom was <hi>Richard Foxe</hi> a Priest, a man of great wit, and no lesse learning, whom the Earle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent received into secret familiaritie, and in briefe time erected and advanced him to high dignities and promotions, and in conclusion he made him Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:53752:193"/>In the mean season King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> was credibly advertised what promises and oathes the Earle and his confederates had made and sworne together at <hi>Renes,</hi> and how by the Earles meanes al the Englishmen were passed out of <hi>Britaine</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> Wherefore being sore dismaid, and in manner despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, because his crafty mischief tooke no effect in <hi>Britaine,</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined and devised how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe and disturbe the Earles purpose by another meane, so that by the marriage of Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his neece, hee should pretend no claime nor title to the Crowne. For hee thought if that marriage failed, the Earles chiefe combe had beene cleerely cut. And because that he being blinded with the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious desire of rule before this time, in obtaining the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, had perpetrate and done
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53752:193"/>
many flagitious acts and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable tyrannies, yet according to the old proverbe, let him take the bull that stole away the calfe, hee thought all facts by him committed in times past to be but of small moment and not to be regarded in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of that mischievous imagination which hee now newly beganne and attempted. There came into his ungrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minde a thing not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable to bee spoken of in the remembrance of man, but much more cruell and abominable to be put in execution. For when hee revolved in his wavering minde how great a fountaine of mischiefe toward him should spring, if the Earle of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> should be advanced to the marriage of his neece, which thing hee heard say by the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of her people, that no small number of wise and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53752:194"/>
personages enterprised to compasse and bring to conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>He clearly determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile to his favour his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wife, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by faire words or liberall promises, firmely beleeving her favour once obtained, that shee would not stick to commit and lovingly credit to him the rule and governance both of her and her daughters, and so by that meanes the Earle of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> of the affinity of his Neece should be utterly defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and beguiled. And if no ingenuous remedy could be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise invented to save the innumerable mischiefes which were even at hand, and like to fall, if it should happen Queen <hi>Anne</hi> his wife to depart out of this present world, then hee himselfe would rather take to wife his cousin and neece, the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53752:194"/>
Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> then for lacke of that affinity the whole Realm should runne to ruine, as who said, that if hee once fell from his estate and dignity, the ruine of the Realme must needs short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ensue and follow. Wherefore he sent to the Queene, being in Sanctuary, divers and often Messengers, which first should excuse and purge him of all things before against her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted or procured, and after should so largely promise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions innumerable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, not onely to her, but also to her sonne Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse <hi>Dorset,</hi> that they should bring her if it were possible into some wan hope, or as men say, into a fooles paradise. The Messengers being men both of wit and gravitie, so perswaded the Queene with great and pregnant reasons, then with faire and large promises, that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53752:195"/>
she began somewhat to relent, and to give to them no deafe eare, insomuch that she faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promised to submit and yeeld her self fully and frankly to the Kings will and pleasure. And so she putting in oblivion the murther of her innocent children, the infamy and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour spoken by the King her husband, the living in adultry layed to her charge, bastarding of her daughters, forgetting also the faithfull promise and open oath made to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse of <hi>Richmond</hi> mother to the Earle <hi>Henry,</hi> blinded by avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious affection, and seduced by flattering words, first deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into King <hi>Richards</hi> hands her five daughters, as Lambes once againe committed to the custody of the ravenous Wolfe.</p>
                     <p>After shee sent Letters to the Marquesse her sonne, being
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53752:195"/>
then at <hi>Paris</hi> with the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> willing him in any wise to leave the Earle, and without delay to repaire into <hi>England,</hi> where for him were provided great honours and honourable promotions, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining him further, that all offences in both parties were forgotten and forgiven, and both he and she highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate in the Kings heart. Surely the inconstancie of this woman were much to bee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at, if all women had bin found constant, but let men speake, yet women of the very bond of Nature wil follow their owne kinde.</p>
                     <p>After that King <hi>Richard</hi> had thus with glorious promises and flattering words pleased and appeased the mutable mind of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which knew nothing lesse then that he most intended, he caused all his
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53752:196"/>
brothers daughters to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed into his Palace with solemne receiving, as though with his new familiar and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entertainment they should forget, and in their mindes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate the old committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and late perpetrate ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
                     <p>Now nothing was contrarie and opposite to his pernicious purpose, but that his Mansion was not void of his wife, which thing he in any wise adjudged necessary to be done. But there was one thing that so much feared and dragged him from committing this abominable murder, because, as you have heard before, hee began to counterfeit the image of a good and well disposed person, and therefore he was afraid lest the sudden and immature death of his wife once openly knowne, hee should lose the good and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53752:196"/>
credible opinion which the people had of him without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert conceived and reported. But in conclusion, evill counsell prevailed in a wit lately min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to mischiefe, and turned from all goodnesse. So that his ungratious desire overcame his honest feare.</p>
                     <p>And first to enter into the gates of his imagined enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, hee abstayned both from the bed and company of his wife. After hee complained to divers Noble men of the Realm, of the unfortunate ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilitie and barrennesse o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his wife, because she brought forth no fruit and generation of her body. And in speciall hee accompted to <hi>Thomas Rothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> (whom lately hee had delivered out of ward and captivity) these impediments of his Queene and divers others, thinking
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53752:197"/>
that hee would reveale and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to her all these things, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the sequell hereof to take his effect, that shee hearing this grudge of her husband, and taking therefore an inward thought, would not long live in this world. Of this the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop gathered (which well knew the complection and usage of the King) that the Queenes dayes were short, and that hee declared to certaine of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret friends. And thus he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a common rumour (but hee would not have the authour knowne) to bee published and spread abro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

lose her life, whether the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would impute her death to the thought or sicknes, or ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would lay the blame to him. When the Queene heard tell that so horrible a rumour of her death was sprung amongst the commonaltie, shee sore sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and judged the world to be almost at an end with her, and in that sorrowfull agony, shee with lamentable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and sorrowfull cheere, repaired to the presence of the King her husband, demanding of him, what it should meane that he had judged her worthy to die. The King answered her with faire words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling blandiments and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering leasings comforted her, bidding her to bee of good comfort, for to his knowledge shee should have no other cause. But howsoever it fortuned, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by inward thought and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53752:198"/>
pensivenesse of heart, or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication of poyson (which is affirmed to bee most likely) within a few dayes after, the Queene departed out of this transitorie life, &amp; was with due solemnitie buried in the church of S. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Westminster.</hi> This is the same <hi>Anne,</hi> one of the daughters of the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi> which as you have heard before, at the request of <hi>Lewes</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, was married to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> son to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixt.</p>
                     <p>The King thus (according to his long desire) loosed out of the bonds of matrimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to cast a foolish phantasie to Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his neece, making much suite to have her joyned with him in lawfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony: But because all men, and the maiden her selfe most of all, detested and abhorred this unlawfull and in a manner

                        </gap>fer the matter till he were in a more quietnesse. For all that very season hee was oppressed with great, weightie, and urgent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and businesses on every side, considering, that daily part of the nobilitie sailed into <hi>France</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Richmond:</hi> other privily favoured and aided cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the conjuration, so that of his short end, few or none were in doubt. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people for the most part were brought to such despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that many of them had rather be reputed and taken of him in the number of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then to abide the chance and hazard to have their goods taken as a spoyle of victorie by his enemies Amongst the noble men whom hee most mistrusted, these were the principall, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> Sir <hi>William
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53752:199"/>
Stanley</hi> his brother, <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi> and six hundred other, of whose purposes although King <hi>Richard</hi> were ignorant yet he gave neither confidence nor credence to any one of them, and least of al to the Lord <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> because hee was joyned in matrimony with the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> mother to the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> as afterward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ye may perceive. For when the said Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> would have departed into his Countrey to visite his familie, and to recreate and refresh his spirits (as he openly said) but the truth was to the intent to be in a perfect readinesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> at his first arrivall into <hi>England</hi>: the King in no wise would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to depart, before he had left as an hostage in the Court, <hi>George Stanley</hi> Lord <hi>Strange</hi> his first begotten son &amp; heire.

While King <hi>Richard</hi> was thus troubled and vexed with ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the tumultuous time that was like to come: Loe even suddenly hee heard newes that fire was sprung out of the smoake, and the warre present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begun, and that the Castle of <hi>Hammes</hi> was delivered into the hands of the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> by the meanes of the Earle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that not onely hee, but also <hi>Iames Blunt</hi> Captaine of the Castle, were fled into <hi>France</hi> to aide the Earle <hi>Henry.</hi> Wherefore he thinking it great policie to withstand the first brunt, sent the most part of the garison of <hi>Calice,</hi> to recover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by force the castle of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</hi> They which were in the Castle perceiving their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to approach, prepared mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and engins for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and sent also the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> to advertise him of

their sodaine obsession, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him of hasty ayde &amp; spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die succour. The Earle slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping not this first begun assault, sent the Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> with an elected company of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to raise the siege and rescue the Castle: Which at their first arriving pitched their campe not farre from their enemies And while King <hi>Richards</hi> men gave vigilant eye, weighing lest the Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> should take any advantage of them that laie on that side of the Castle, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Brandon</hi> with thirty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved men of warre by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish which lay on the other side entred into the Castle.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53752:200"/>
enemies on the forepart: the Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> no lesse mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and unquieted them on the other part, which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that King <hi>Richards</hi> men offered of their owne meere motion license to all being within the Castle to depart in safetie with bagge and baggage nothing excepted: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Earle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming onely for that purpose to deliver his loving friends out of all perill &amp; danger, and chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all, his old hostesse <hi>Iane Blunt</hi> wife to <hi>Iames Blunt</hi> the Captaine, would in no wise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiate or refuse. And so lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Castle bare and ungar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished both of vitaile and artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, came safe to the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> sojourning in <hi>Paris.</hi> During this time, King <hi>Richard</hi> was credibly informed of his explorators and espials, that the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> was with
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53752:201"/>
long suite in the Court of <hi>France</hi> sore fatigate and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and desiring great aide, could obtaine small reliefe. In so much that all things went so farre backward, that such things as were with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and no lesse deliberation purposed and determined to be set forward, were now dashed and overthrown to the ground. King <hi>Richard</hi> either being to light of credence, or seduced and deluded by his craftie tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers, greatly rejoyced as though he had obtained the oo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhand of his enemies with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and victorie, and thought himselfe never so surely delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all feare and dreadfull imaginations so that he needed now no more once for that cause either to wake or breake his golden sleepe. Wherefore he called home againe his ships of warre which he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53752:201"/>
to keepe the narrow seas, and dispatched all such souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as hee had deputed to keepe certaine garisons, and to stoppe certaine passages, as you have heard before. Yet lest he might for lacke of provision bee sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly trapped, hee straightly charged and gave in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to all noble men, and in especial such as inhabited neere to the Sea coast, and on the frontiers of <hi>Wales,</hi> that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the usage of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, they should keepe diligent watch and strong ward, to the intent that his adversaries in no wise should have any place apt or oportune easily to take land without defence or rebutting backe. For the custome of the Countreyes adjoyning neere to the Sea is (especially in the time of warre) on every hill or high place to erect a Beacon with a great lanthorne in the toppe,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53752:202"/>
which may be seene and discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great space off. And when the noyse is once bruted that the enemie approacheth neere the land, they suddenly put fire in the lanthornes, and make shoutes &amp; outrages from towne to towne, and from village to village. Some runne in post from place to place, admonishing the people to bee ready to resist the jeopardy, and defend the peril. And by this policie the fame is soone blowne to every citie and towne, insomuch that as well the citizens as the rurall people be in short space assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and armed to refell and put backe the new arrived ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>Now to returne to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: King <hi>Richard</hi> thus alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate of his accustomed pensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, began to bee somewhat more merrier, and tooke lesse thought and care for outward

Such is the force and puissance of divine justice, that every man shall lesse regard, lesse provide, lesse bee in doubt of all things, when hee is most neerest punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and next to his mischance for his offences and crimes.</p>
                     <p>About this season, while the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> was desiring aide of the <hi>French</hi> King, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine noble men were there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to rule the Realme of <hi>France</hi> during the minoritie of King <hi>Charles,</hi> which amongst themselves were not of one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. Of which dissention, <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> was the chiefe stirrer, which because he had married Lady <hi>Iohanne</hi> sister to the <hi>French</hi> King, tooke

upon him above other the rule and administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole Realme. By reason of which controversie, no one man onely was suffered to rule all, wherefore the Earle of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was compelled to make suite to every one of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell severally one after another, requiring and desiring them of aide and reliefe in his weighty businesse, and so his cause was prolonged and deferred. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, <hi>Thomas</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques <hi>Dorset,</hi> which was as you have heard entised by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to returne againe into <hi>England,</hi> partly despairing in the good successe of the Earle of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and partly onerate and vanquished with the faire glosing promises of King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> secretly in the night sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son stole out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and with all diligent expediton tooke his journey towards <hi>Flanders.</hi>

When relation of his departure was made to the Earle of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and the other Noble men, no marvell though they were astonied and greatly amased.

Wherefore making not many of his counsell, after diverse consultations hee determined not yet to set forward, but to tarry and attempt how to get more aide, more friends, and more stronger succours. And amongst all other, it was thought most expedient to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure by affinity in his aide as a companion in armes Sir <hi>Walter Harbert,</hi> a man of ancient stock and great power amongst the welshmen, which had with him a faire Lady to his sister, of age mature and ripe to bee coupled

And for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiving of this purpose, messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were secretly sent to <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> had before married another si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Sir <hi>Walter Herberts</hi>) to the intent that hee should set forward all this device and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: but the waies were so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly watched, and so many spies laid, that the messenger proceeded not in his journey and businesse.

horsemen which the Earle had sent to make exploration and search, returned and reported all the countrey to be quiet, and no let nor impediment to bee laid or cast in their journey.

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53752:210"/>
they ought or might doe. The Earle <hi>Henry</hi> brought in good hope with his pleasant message, continued foorth his entended journey and came to a little towne called <hi>Newport</hi> &amp;, pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his campe on a little hill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, reposed himselfe there that night. In the evening, the same day came to him Sir <hi>George Talbot</hi> with the whole power of the young Earle of <hi>Shrewesbury</hi> then being in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward, which were accompted to the number of two thousand men. And thus his power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing he arrived at the towne of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and there pawsed. To whom came Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> accompanied with a few persons, and after that the Earle and hee had communed no long time together, he rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his souldiers which hee had congregate together to serve the Earle, which from
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53752:210"/>
thence departed to <hi>Lichfield,</hi> &amp; lay without the walles in his campe all the night. The next morning hee entred into the towne, and was with all honour like a Prince received. A day or two before the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> having in his band almost five thousand men, lodged in the the same towne, but hearing that the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> was marched thitherward, gave to him place, dislodging him and his, and repayred to a towne called <hi>Adrestone,</hi> there abiding the comming of the Earle; and this wilie Foxe did this act to avoide all suspicion, being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid lest if hee should bee seene openly to be a fautour or ayder to the Earle his son in law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of the battell, that King <hi>Richard</hi> which did not utterly put in him diffidence and mistrust, would put to some cruell death his sonne and heire
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53752:211"/>
apparent, <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> whom King <hi>Richard,</hi> as you have heard before, kept with him as a pledge or hostage to the intent that the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> his father should attempt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prejudiciall to him.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> at this season keeping his house in the Castle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> was informed that the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> with such banished men as fled out of <hi>England</hi> to him were now arrived in <hi>Wales,</hi> and that all things necessary to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise were unprovided, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purveyed and very weake, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing meete to withstand the power of such as the King had appointed to resist him. This rumour so inflated his minde, that in manner disdaining to heare speake of so poore a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, determined at the first to take little or no regard to this so small a sparcle, declaring the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53752:211"/>
Earle to bee innocent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise because that hee temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously attempted such a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise with so small &amp; thinne a number of warlike persons, and therefore hee gave a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sentence, that when hee came to that point that hee should be compelled to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will, he either should be apprehended alive, or else by all likelihood hee should of necessitie come to a shamefull confusion, and that he trusted to be shortly done by Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Herbert</hi> and <hi>Rice ap Thomas,</hi> which then ruled <hi>Wales</hi> with equall power and like authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But hee revolving and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in his minde that a small warre begun and winked at, and not regarded, may turne to a great broyle and tumultuous trouble, and that it was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent policie not to asperne and disdaine the little small power
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53752:212"/>
and weakenesse of the enemie, be it never so small, thought it necessary to provide for after clappes that might happen and chance. Wherefore hee sent to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke, Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Earle of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his especiall and trusty friends of the nobility, which he judged much more to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre and esteeme his wealth and honour then their owne riches and private commoditie, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to muster and view all their servants and tenants, and to elect and chuse the most couragious and active persons of the whole number, and with them to repaire to his presence with all speede and diligence. Also he wrote to <hi>Robert Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

armes Sir <hi>Thomas Burchier,</hi> and sir <hi>Walter Hungerford,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Knights and Esqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in whom he had cast no smal suspition.</p>
                     <p>While hee was thus ordering his affaires, tidings came that the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Severne</hi> &amp; come to <hi>Shrewes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> without any detriment or encombrance. At which mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage hee was sore moved and broyled with Melancolie and dolour, and cryed out, asking vengeance of them that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their oathes and promises had fraudulently deceived him. For which cause he beganne to have diffidence in others, in so much that hee determined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of hand the same day to occurre and resist his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries; And in all haste sent out explorators to view and espie what way his enemies kept and passed. They diligently doing
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53752:213"/>
their dutie, shortly after retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, declaring to the King that the Earle was encamped at the Towne of <hi>Lichfield.</hi> When he had perfect knowledge where the Earle with his army was sojourning, he having continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all repaire of his subjects to him, began incontinently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay to marshall and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locate in order his battailes (like a valiant captaine and politique leader) and first hee made his battailes to set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward foure &amp; foure in a rancke, marching toward that way whither his enemies, as was to him reported, intended to passe. In the middle part of the army he appointed the trafficke and carriage appertaining to the armie. Then hee (environed with his satellites and yeomen of the Crowne) with a frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning countenance and truculent aspect mounted on a great
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53752:213"/>
white courser, followed with his footmen, the winges of horsemen coasting and ranging on every side: And keeping this array, he with great pompe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the towne of <hi>Leiceste</hi> after the sunne set. The Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> raised his campe and departed from <hi>Lichfield</hi> to the towne of <hi>Tomworth</hi> thereto neere adjoyning, and in the mid way passing, there saluted him Sir <hi>Walter Hungerford,</hi> and sir <hi>Thomas Burchier</hi> Kinghts, and divers other, which yeelded and submitted themselves to his pleasure. For they being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised that King <hi>Richard</hi> had them in suspition and jelousie, a little beyond <hi>Stony stratford</hi> left &amp; forsooke privily their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Robert Brakenbury,</hi> and by nocturnall wandering, and in manner by unknowne pathes and uncertaine waies searching, at the last came to the Earle
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53752:214"/>
                        <hi>Henry.</hi> Diverse other noble personages which inwardly hated King <hi>Richard</hi> worse then a toade or a serpent, likewise to him resorted with their power and strength. There hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this progression to the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> a strange chance worthy to be noted: for albeit he was a man of hautie and valiant courage, and that his army encreased, and daily more and more he waxed pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt and stronger, yet hee was not a little afraid because he in no wise could bee assured of his father in law <hi>Thomas.</hi> Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> which for feare of the destruction of the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> his sonne (as you have heard) as yet enclined to neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For if hee had gone to the Earle, and that notified to King <hi>Richard,</hi> his sonne had shortly beene executed. Wherefore sith the Earles feare sprang not of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53752:214"/>
nothing, he accompanied with twenty light horsemen linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his journey as a man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate, musing and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what was best to bee done. And the more to aggravate his melancholy pensivenesse, it was shewed him that King <hi>Richard</hi> was at hand with a strong pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and a populous army. While he thus pensive dragged behind his hoast, the whole army came before the town of <hi>Tomwoorth,</hi> &amp; when he for the deepe darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse could not perceive the steppes of them that passed on before, and had wandered hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither, seeking after his company, and yet not once hearing any noyse or whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them, hee diverted to a little village being about three miles from his army, taking great thought, and much fearing lest hee should be espied and so trapped by K. <hi>Richards</hi> scout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watch.
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53752:215"/>
There hee tarried all night, not once adventuring to aske or demand a question of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature, he being no more amased with the jeopardy and perill that was passed, then with this present chaunce, sore feared it should bee a prognostication or prodigiall signe of some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate plague afterward to succeede. As he was not merry being absent from his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, likewise his army much marvelled and no lesse mourned for his sodaine and in tempesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous absence.</p>
                     <p>The next morning early in the dawning of the day hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and by the conduct of good fortune espied and came to his army, excusing himselfe, not to have gone out of his way by ignorance, but for a policie devised for the nonce he went from his campe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some glad message from
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53752:215"/>
certaine of his privie friends &amp; secret alies. This excuse made, hee privilie departed againe from his hoast to the towne of <hi>Aderstone,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> and sir <hi>William</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their bands were abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. There the Earle came first to his fatherinlaw in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle close, where hee saluted him and sir <hi>William</hi> his brother, and after diverse congratulations &amp; many friendly embracings, each rejoyced of the state of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and suddenly were surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with great joy, comfort, and hope of great fortunate successe in all their affaires and doings. Afterward they consulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how to give battaile to K. <hi>Richard</hi> if hee would abide, whom they knew not to be far off with an huge army. In the evening of the same day, sir <hi>Iohn Savage,</hi> sir <hi>Brian Sanford,</hi> sir <hi>Simon Digby,</hi> and many other,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53752:216"/>
leaving King <hi>Richard,</hi> turned &amp; came to the part of the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> with an elect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men. Which refusall of King <hi>Richards</hi> part by men of such experience, did augment and increase both the good hope and the puissance of the Earle of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the meane season King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> (which was appointed now to finish his last labour by the very divine justice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, which called him to condigne punishment for his scelerate merits and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous deserts) marched to a place meete for two battailes to encounter by a village called <hi>Bosworth,</hi> not farre from <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and there hee pitched his field, refreshed his souldiers, and tooke his rest.</p>
                     <p>The fame went that hee had that same night a dreadfull and terrible dreame; for it seemed to
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53752:216"/>
him being asleepe, that hee saw divers images like terrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills, which pulled and haled him, not suffering him to take any quiet or rest. The which strange vision not so suddenly strake his heart with a sudden feare, but it stuffed his head and troubled his minde with many dreadfull and busie Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>For incontinent after, his heart being almost damped, hee prognosticated before the doubtfull chance of the battaile to come, not using the alacritie and mirth of minde and of countenance as he was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to doe before hee came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the battell. And lest that it might bee suspected that hee was abashed for feare of his enemies, and for that cause hee looked so pittifully, hee recited and declared to his familiar friends in the morning his
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53752:217"/>
wonderfull vision and terrible dreame. But I thinke this was no dreame, but a punction and pricke of his sinfull conscience; for the conscience is so much more charged and aggravate, as the offence is greater and more haynous in degree: which prick of conscience although it strike not alwaies, yet at the last day of extreame life it is wonte to shew and represent to us our faults and offences, and the paines and punishments which hang over our heads for the same, to the intent that at the instant we for our deserts being penitent and repentant may bee compelled to lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile our sinnes like forsakers of this world, jocund to depart out of this miserable life.</p>
                     <p>Now to returne againe to our purpose, the next day after, K. <hi>Richard</hi> being furnished with men and all abiliments of wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53752:217"/>
bringing all his men out of their campe into the plaine, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his foreward in a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous length, in which hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed both horsemen and footmen, to the intent to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in the hearts of them that looked a farre off, a sodaine ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and deadly feare, for the great multitude of the armed souldiers: and in the fore front hee placed the archers like a strong fortified trench or bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke: over this battaile was captaine <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,</hi> with whom was <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Surrey</hi> his sonne. After this long vangard followed King <hi>Richard</hi> himselfe, with a strong company of chosen and approved men of warre, having horsemen for winges on both the sides of his battell.</p>
                     <p>After that the Earle of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was departed from the communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his friends as
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53752:218"/>
you have heard before, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be of a better stomacke, and of a more valiant courage, and with all diligence pitched his field just by the Campe of his enemies, and there he lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that night. In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betime hee caused his men to put on their armour, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell themselves ready to fight and give battell, and sent to the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> (which was now come with his Band in a place indifferently betweene both the Armies) requiring him with his men to approach neer to his Army, and to helpe to set the Souldiers in array<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee answered, that the Earle should set his owne men in a good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of battell, while hee would array his company, and come to him in time convenient: Which answer made other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the Earle thought or would have judged, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the opportunity of the time, and the weight of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and although hee was therewithall a little vexed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan somewhat to hang the head, yet hee without any time delaying, compelled by necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after this manner instructed and ordered his men. He made his fore-ward somewhat single and slender, according to the small number of his people. In the front hee placed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, of whom he made Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of <hi>Oxford:</hi> to the right wing of the battell, hee appointed Sir <hi>Gilbert Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> to be the leader: to the left wing hee assigned Sir <hi>Iohn Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage,</hi> and hee with the aide of the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> accompanied with the Earle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> having a good company of horse-men, and a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of footmen: For all his whole number exceeded not five

thousand men beside the power of the <hi>Stanleys,</hi> whereof three thousand were in the field un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Standard of Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi>: The Kings number was double as much, and more.</p>
                     <p>When both the Armies were thus ordered, and all men rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to set forward King <hi>Richard</hi> called his Chieftains together, and to them said: Most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and assured fellowes, most trusty and welbeloved friends and elected Captaines, by whose wisdome and policie, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Crowne and Type of this famous Realme and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Region, by whose puissance and valiantnesse I have enjoyed and possessed the state Royall and dignity of the same ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For they bee contemned, and out of the palace of fame degraded, dying without renowne, which doe not as much preferre and exalt the perpetuall honour of their native Countrey, as their owne mortall and transitory life. Now Saint <hi>George</hi> to borrow, let us set forward, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber well, that I am he which shall with high advancements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reward and preferre the valiant and hardy Champions, and punish and torment the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cowards and dreadfull dastards.</p>

                        <pb n="429" facs="tcp:53752:223"/>This exhortation encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all such as favoured him, but such as were present, more for dread then love, kissed them openly, whom they inwardly hated; others sware outwardly to take part with such, whose death they secretly compassed, and inwardly imagined; others promised to invade the Kings enemies, which fled and fought with fierce courage against the King; others stood still and looked on, intending to take part with the victors and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commers: So was his people to him unsure and unfaithfull at his end, as he was to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes untrue and unnaturall in his beginning.</p>
                     <p>When the Earle of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> knew by his fore-riders, that the King was so neere em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battailed, hee rode about his Armie, from ranke to ranke, from wing to wing, giving
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:53752:224"/>
comfortable words to all men, and that finished (being armed at all peeces saving his Helmet) mounted on a little hill, so that all his people might see and behold him perfectly, to their great rejoycing: For he was a man of no great stature, but so formed and decorated with all gifts and lineaments of Nature, that hee seemed more an ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall creature, then terrestriall personage; his countenance and aspect was cheerefull and couragious, his haire yellow like burnished Gold, his eyes grey, shining and quick, prompt and ready in answering, but of such sobriety, that it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be judged, whether he were more dull then quicke in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (such was his temperance) And when hee had over-looked his Armie over every side, hee paused a while, and after with a loud voyce and bold spirit,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:53752:224"/>
spake to his Companions these or like the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
                     <p>If ever God gave victory to men fighting in a just quarrell; Or if he ever aided such as made warre for the wealth and tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their owne naturall and nutritive Countrey; Or if hee ever succoured them which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured their lives for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of innocents, suppressing of malefactors and apparent offenders; No doubt, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and friends, but he, of his bountifull goodnesse, will this day send us triumphant victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a lucky journey over our proud enemies, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant adversaries: For if you remember and consider the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cause of our just quarre, you shall apparently perceive the same to be true, Godly and vertuous. In the which I doubt not but God will rather aide us
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:53752:225"/>
(yea and fight for us) then see us vanquished and profligate by such as neither feare him nor his lawes, nor yet regard justice or honesty. Our cause is so just that no enterprise can bee of more vertue, both by the lawes divine and civill, for what can be a more honest, goodly, or godly quarrell then to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a captaine, being a homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide and murtherer of his owne blood and progeny? An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme destroyer of his nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to his and our countrey and the poore subjects of the same, a deadly malle, a firebrand and burden untolerable? besides him, consider who bee of his band and company, such as by murther and untruth commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against their owne kindred and linnage, yea against their Prince and Soveraigne Lord, have disherited mee and you, and hath wrongfully detained
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53752:225"/>
and usurpe over lawfull patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and lineall inheritance. For he that calleth himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> king keepeth from mee the Crowne and regiment of this noble Realme and Countrey, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all justice and equity. Likewise, his mates and friends occupie your lands, cut downe your woods and destroy your mannors, letting your wives and children range abroad for their living: which persons for their penance and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I doubt not but God of his goodnesse will either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver into our hands as a great gaine and booty, or cause them being grieved and compuncted with the pricke of their corrupt consciences, cowardly to fly and not abide the battell: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this I assure you that there be yonder in that great battell, men brought thither for feare and not for love, souldiers by
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:53752:226"/>
force compelled, and not with good will assembled: persons which desire rather the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then the salvation of their master and captaine: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a multitude, whereof the most part will bee our friends, and the least part our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For truly I doubt which is greater, the malice of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers towards their captaine, or the feare of him conceived of his people: for surely this rule is infallible, that as ill men dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covet to destroy the good, so God appointeth the good to confound the ill, &amp; of al world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods the greatest is, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse tyrants, and relieve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, whereof the one is ever as much hated as the other is beloved. If this bee true (as Clerkes preach) who will spare yonder tyrant <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> untruely calling himselfe King, considering that
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:53752:226"/>
hee hath violated, and broken both the law of God and man, what vertue is in him which was the confusion of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and murtrerer of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes? what mercy is in him that flieth his trusty friends as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as his extreme enemies? Who can have confidence in him which putteth diffidence in all men? If you have not read<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have heard Clerkes say, that <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud for the vice of the body lost the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the name of <hi>Tarquin</hi> banished from the Citie for ever: yet was not his fault so detestable as the fact of cruell <hi>Nero,</hi> which slew his owne mother, and opened her entralls to behold the place of his conception. Behold yonder <hi>Richard,</hi> which is both <hi>Tarquin</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> yea a tyrant more then <hi>Nero,</hi> for he hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murthered his Nephewe
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:53752:227"/>
being his King and soveraigne Lord, bastarded his noble bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and defamed the wombe of his vertuous and womanly mother, but also compassed all the meanes and waies that hee could invent how to stuprate &amp; carnally know neece his under the pretence of a cloaked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, which Lady I have sworne and promised to take and make my wife, as you all know and beleeve. If this cause bee not just, and this quarrell godly, let God the giver of victory judge and determine. We have (thankes be given to Christ) escaped the secret trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and avoyded the subtile snares of our frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent enemies there, passed the troublous seas in good and quiet safegard, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance have penetrate the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple region and large countrey of <hi>Wales,</hi> and are now come to

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us not feare to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the toyle where wee may surely slay him, for God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that wee have lived in the vales of miserie, tossing our shippes in dangerous stormes: let us not now dread to set up our sailes in faire weather, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us both him and good fortune.

Therefore labour for your gaine, and sweat for your right: while wee were in <hi>Britaine</hi> wee had small livings

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all feare be set aside, and like sworne brethren let us joyne in one, for this day shall bee the end of our travell, and the gaine of our labour, either by honorable death or famous victory: And as I trust, the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>These chearefull words hee set forth with such gesture of

body &amp; smiling countenance, as though already hee had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished his enemies and gotten the spoyle.</p>
                     <p>Hee had scantly finished his saying, but the one armie espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other: Lord how hastily the souldiers buckled their helmes, how quickly the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers bent their bowes and frushed their feathers, how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily the billmen shooke their billes and prooved their staves, ready to approach and joyn, when the terrible trumpet shall sound the bloody blast to victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or death. Betweene both armies there was a great marsh which the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> left on his right hand for this intent, that it should be on that side a defence for his part, and in so doing he had the sunne at his backe, and in the faces of his enemies.</p>
                     <p>When King <hi>Richard</hi> saw the

The Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> bringing all his band together on the one part, set on his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies afresh; againe, the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries perceiving that, placed their men slender and thinne before, and thicke and broade behind, beginning againe hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the battell. While the two forwards thus mortally fought, each intending to vanquish and convince the other, King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> was admonished by his ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plorators and espialles, that the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi> accompanied small with a number of men of armes was not far off, and as he

approched &amp; marched towards him, he perfectly knew his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage by certaine demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tokens which hee had learned and knowne of others. And being inflamed with ire, and vexed with outragious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, he put his spurres to his horse, and rode out of the side of the range of his Battaile, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the avantguards fighting, and like a hungry Lion ran with Speare and rest toward him.

                     <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> set on so sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the first brunt, that he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew the Earles Standard, and slew Sir <hi>William Brandon</hi>

Sir <hi>William Catesbey</hi> learned in the Lawes of the Realme, and one of the chiefe Counsellors to the late King, with divers others, were two dayes after beheaded at <hi>Leicester.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them that ranne away, were Sir <hi>Francis</hi> Vicount <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</hi> and <hi>Humfrey Stafford,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Stafford</hi> his Brother, which took Sanctuary at Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> at <hi>Gloucester.</hi> Of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and prisoners there was a great number for after the death of King <hi>Richard</hi> was knowne and published, every man in manner vnarming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and casting away his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliment of warre, meekly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves to the obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance and rule of the Earle of <hi>Richmond</hi>: of the which the more part had gladly so done in the beginning, if they might have conveniently escaped from King <hi>Richards</hi> espyals, which

having as cleare eyes as <hi>Linx,</hi> and as open eares as <hi>Midas,</hi> ranged and searched in every quarter.
