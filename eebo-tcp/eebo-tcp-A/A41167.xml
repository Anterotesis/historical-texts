            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMong all the Sins which are said to cry for vengeance, there is none to which a louder voice is ascribed in the ears of God as well as Men, than that of <hi>Murder.</hi> For as it is the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Creature, which carries the stamp and impress of the Divine image, and therein a defacing the most visibl' repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, which God hath vouchsav'd unto, and left of himself in sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Beings; so it is a most daring insurrection against the Authority of the Supream Lawgiver, who designed his inhibition for a sufficient Fence about our Lifes. Nor does any Crime more audaciously controul the End of Divine Wisdom in making us sociable Creatures, and furnishing us with faculties and powers by which we are inabled as well as instructed to help and shelter one another. And therefore in proportion to the heynousness of the guilt of the sin of <hi>Murder,</hi> are both the denounciations of God in the Word, and his vindictive dispensations of providence against it, wrote in more legible Characters, than those wherein we find his displeasure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded and testified against other Crimes. Profane as well as Sacred Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's are filled with instances of Gods inquisition after the shedding inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood, and of the wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thful severity which he hath shown against Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies as well as persons in whose skirts it hath been found.</p>
            <p>And as no Transgression is more provoking to God, so none does so much incense and exasperate mankind. The destroying one innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is construed as a threatning of all; nor can we hear of the cutting our Neighbours throat, but we judg our selves alarm'd and bid look to our own. Nor is it only by the instinct, but by the Authority of the Law of Nature, that Murderers have in all places and ages been pursued with an Universal hatred. He abandon's his own life to the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the next assailant, who esteems it not his duty not only to wrest the weapon out of a murderers hand, but to bring the malefactor to publick punishment.</p>
            <p>And tho there is no person so dignified or priviledged, in whom assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and murders are not highly detestable, and to be prosecuted with the utmost impartiality and zeal; yet they deserve the greatest abhorrency, when perpetrated by those, whose duty it is to defend our lifes instead of invading them. For if it be criminal in a very enemy to kill the person whom he reckons himself most injured by, unless empowered thereunto by a judicial Sentence or a legal warrant; how infinitely more enormous is it, for those to be Author's of, or instrumental in our ruine, to whom the care of our preservation is committed and entrusted. And by how much any are vested with the Administration of the Law, to avenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42060:4"/>
and the community upon offenders; by so much does their crime and guilt become enhanced, if when they can not gratifie their indignation in the person and quality of Magistrates, they espouse the work and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and assume the weapons of an assassinate. And who know's, but that as the Attorney General had the boldness in print to call the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commitment of the <hi>Earl of Essex,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddons Trial p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>a convictment for high Treason,</hi> but that others upon that <hi>conviction</hi> might have the impudence to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for his Execution. What more hateful sight can there be to heaven, or more enraging spectacle to men, than to find those, who by the places they are advanced unto, and the Trust that is reposed in them, ought to watch for our safety, conspiring our ruine, and what they have not the courage themselves to execute, tempting and hiring others to commit?</p>
            <p>As it will be easily allowed, being indelibly ingraven in our Natures, that every Murder is to be registred amongst crimes of the deepest die; so it cannot be denied, but that one may be of a more heynous nature than another, and receive aggravation from the worth and quality of him that is assassinated. For as the value of kindnesses grows in proportion to the meaness of the persons on whom they are bestowed; so crimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an encrease of guilt, from the dignity and usefulness of those against whom, they are committed. By how much higher the station of any one is in the Commonwealth, and by how much through his wisdom, power, bounty and influence, he is beneficial to the Nation; by so much is the destruction of such, a person attended with the higher aggravations, and to be resented as a most enormous crime. Nor are we only to esteem our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves injured and threatned in and by the example of such a person's ruine, but we are to account our selves wronged, and ought to demand repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, answerably to the benefits we reapt by him, and which we are rob'd of by the loss of so useful and worthy a person. Our Law in making that against a <hi>Peer</hi> liable to an <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>Scandal,</hi> which it takes not so much as cognisance of as an offence against little and inferior people; could not be so improvident in reference to the lifes of Noblemen, as not to set a stronger and higher hedge about them, than those of Mechanicks are fenced and defended by.</p>

But there is a certain great man in the World whom I shall forbear to name, whose temper is to bestow his Favours upon such as have been his Majesties greatest enemies, as well as the most proffligate and basest among men, and in the mean time recompence such not only with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect but hatred, whose parents as well as themselves had shed their blood and ventured their fortunes in the behalf of the King and the Royal cause. How true is that of <hi>Tacitus, lib. 4. Annal. Beneficia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For whereas they are altogether uncapable of being won and impressed by courtesies, they are either to be chained up or menaced from doing mischief.</p>
            <p>And as all I have suggested, makes but too suitable an introduction into this following Discourse of the Assassination of the Earl of <hi>Essex;</hi> so it is no small reflection upon the honour of the Nation, and proclaims the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crableness of the Fact, and impudent boldness of the Actors, that they durst perpetrate this horrid villany not only in the Royal Prison, where the Government in the account of the Law is responsible and pledge for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the captive, but in one of his Majesties Palaces, where the King himself is to be esteemed security for the preservation and forthcoming of all who come under his roof. This honorable Gentleman being the Kings Prisoner, and deprived of all means and advantages of defending himself; these trusted with the administration of the Government, and particularly the King, were to be responsible for him in case he miscarried. Nor can his Majesties best friends, and these who are most zealous for his honour, think otherwise of that villanous Fact, than that they who where the contrivers of it, intended at once to rob the King of one of the best and ablest Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters he had ever employ'd, and to give a mortal wound to the Royal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, by perpetrating the bloody crime in such a place. And whereas the <hi>Queen</hi> had lain under an imputation of reproach, upon the account of <hi>Sr. Edmond Bury Godfrey's</hi> being assassinated in <hi>Somerset-house,</hi> they might hope to involve the <hi>King</hi> under the like dishonor, by cutting the Throat of this Noble Peer in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>

Nor ought any man whom the providence of God hath furnished with means and advantages of detecting so horrid a murder, be judged either officious, or held for dissaffected to the Government, if he reveal what he hath attained to the knowledg of, and publish those evidences, which as they have satisfied himself, may be sufficient to convince all the unbyaz'd part of mankind, of the truth and reality of this barbarous assassination. And as it is impossible he should be a good Christian, so he ought not to be esteem'd a good Subject to his Majesty, nor a sincere friend to his Country, who shall more value his own ease and safety, than the delivering the throne from guilt, or saving the Nation from that vengeance, which the cry of innocent blood barbarously and treacherously shed, is ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive and bring upon it. And it is no small evidence by whose countenance and authority this murder was committed, that such discouragements have been given to the discovery of it, and that an honest Gentlemen hath been so severely proceeded against, in defiance of all Law as well as without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, for but offering to represent what he had learned in relation to the destruction of that honourable person. But as we shall have occasion to speak more fully of that afterwards, I shall only add here, that the barbarity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to <hi>Mr. Braddon,</hi> is so far from deterring others to pursue this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, that his ill treatment at the <hi>Council Board</hi> and <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> was one of the motives of my undertaking this Province. And as by reason of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement I have confined my self unto, and the privacy I have used in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing these researches, I labour not under the inconvenience of dreading a sine or prison which does so much frighten others; so I dare boldly affirm that the terror of these things, (were I to encounter them) would not so affect me, as to make me neglect what I reckon a necessary as well as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duty. <hi>Patriae deesse quoad vita suppetat, aliis turpe, mihi etiam nefas,</hi> was the saying of <hi>Camillus</hi> in <hi>Livy.</hi> And tho I be not so vain and ambitious, as to desire the world should know who I am, yet I judg it absolutely needful that they should understand who I am not, least others come into trouble for that which ought not to be charged upon them, and which none but my self can with any equity or justice be made accountable for. And seeing <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> hath been singled forth as the object of some men's indignation, for the service he was willing to have done his Majesty in the detection of this Murder; I reckon my self bound to publish to all the world that I know not the Gentleman, and that to the best of my remembrance I never saw him, much less have ever conversed, or had any communication with him. I will not deny, but that he is a person whom I do infinitely esteem for his integrity, zeal, and courage in this matter; yet I will not be so far inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42060:5"/>
to him, as to commence an acquaintance with him during the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action and dependence of this affair, and while he is under the power of those that will be ready to declare him criminal, for the least intercourse with a person that is likely to become so obnoxious to the rage of <hi>St. Jame</hi>'s and <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> as I may come to be for this service to the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But besides the common tyes, which I lye under equally with the rest of mankind for endeavouring to detect so horrid and barbarous a Murder, there are some special obligations upon me, by which I esteem my self more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly bound than others are, to do all the right and justice I can to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this massacred Lord, and to redeem his Name from the infamy with which they have aspersed him of being <hi>Felo de se.</hi> For I had not only the honour to be known to him, which <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> pretends not unto, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the favouring me with diverse Testimonies of his respect, he did me the kindness to own and befriend me at a juncture, when I was in no small hazard from the malice of very Powerful as well as considerable persons. And seeing that honourable Peer has been so unhappy, as to find nothing but ingratitude as well as injustice from those of the highest and sublimest qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity whom he had most effectually served and infinitely obliged; it is not amiss that the world should understand there are some remains of vertue and gratitude among the mean and little people, and that tho their condition does not inable them to recompence favours conferred upon them by great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, yet they have that ingenuity which others want, <hi>viz.</hi> to sense and acknowledg them.</p>
            <p>And as I reckon it no small honour to have been known to the deccased <hi>Peer,</hi> so I thereby enjoyed an advantage which others wanted, namely an opportunity of learning the principles and observing the Temper of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent person. Whom as I found to be one imbu'd with the most vertuous and religious, as well as heroick and generous principles of any Noble Man in the Kingdom; so I observed him to be a Gentleman of the greatest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dateness of mind, least subject to the undue agitation of unruly passions, and most under the conduct of a calm, steady, strong, clear and well poised Reason, of any Man of Quality, I ever had the happiness of access unto. And if either the succors of Nature, Education, or Grace, were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to fortifie and preserve a person from such an enormity and crime, then must the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> above all men be acquitted from the guilt of so exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable a fact, as being contrary to the Frame and constitution of his Nature, as well as to all the intellectual and moral habits of his Mind. So villanous a Deed, was inconsistent with his Temper, as well as repugnant to his vertue.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42060:6"/>
As he was an excellent Christian, he durst not allow a thought that might give encouragement to so heynous a sin; and as he was a well accomplisht Gentleman, he scorned to render himself guilty of a thing that was so mean and base. Nor was the folly of the Assassinates less, in hoping to obtain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a report, that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> cut his own throat, than their wickedness was, in contriving and perpetrating themselves, that bloody mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon him.</p>
            <p>Yea as if it had not been enough, to have first cut the throat of this innocent tho unfortunate <hi>Earl,</hi> and then to have fastned the guilt and infamy of their own Fact upon his untainted vertue and spotless Soul; they have sought to gain credit to their calumnious accusation, and to reconcile unthinking people to their opinion, by assuming that he used to commend and justifie self Murder, in case there remained no other way to escape a capital punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the being made a spectacle to the little and gazing part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And to give the better gloss to this malicious fiction, they report that he used to extol the action of his Ladies Grandfather the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who being prisoner in the Tower for Treason, shot himself in the head with a Pistol. Put as the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> had he entertained so ungedly and corrupt a sentiment, was more prudent and discreet than to publish and avow an opinion so contrary to the Rules of Religion, the principles of honor, and the common sense and persuasion of mankind; so it is enough to detect the falsehood as well as the malice that is in this report, that the Authors and dispersers of it, either dare not declare the persons to whom the <hi>Earl</hi> should have discovered and revealed his mind in this matter, or else such as they have named for vouchers of the truth of this story, have not only denyed their having at any time heard him express the least word in favour of self murder, but do affirm with all the sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness imaginable, that he used to speak always of it with the utmost abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ency, and to brand it as the greatest and most heynous sin. For whereas they have had the impudence to affirm that this report either proceeded ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from his own <hi>Lady,</hi> or was at least assented unto and attested by her; she hath upon application to her <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ship</hi> for the knowledge of the truth or falsehood of this Story, not only with all the solemnity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in a matter of this importance, vindicated my Lord from having ever spoken a word that might induce the Lawfulness of self murder, or give countenance to a person's being <hi>Felo de se,</hi> but she hath further assirmed that he used to speak against it with an emotion beyond what was custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary to him, and that he hath often declaned that no circumstances what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever could extenuate the guilt, or lessen the infamy of so unnatural and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42060:6"/>
wicked a Fact. So that this Story, which hath been so maliciously and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously spread, to gain, belief to the Report of my Lords having mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered himself, may upon this detection of its Falshood, be very justly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for the establishing an Assurance that he was assassinated by others. For it is impossible to imagine upon what other Motive it could be invented, unless to palliate the Crime of those who had destroyed him.</p>
            <p>But should it be granted that the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> used to speak with all Candor and Respect of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>thumberland,</hi> who slew himself in the Tower; it was no more than what might be expected from a Gentleman of Civility and good Breeding, partly out of <hi>Decorum</hi> and Complacency to his Lady, whose Grand-father the said <hi>Duke</hi> was, and partly out of respect to that Noble Mans Personal Merit and Worth, being upon many accounts a truly great Person. For is it not enough to condemn a Fact, without heaping Obloquy and Reproach upon him that hath been guilty of it? It is sufficient to represent the Evil of a Thing in <hi>Thesi,</hi> and to demonstrate the Sin as well as Dishonour in committing it; but it neither agrees with the Rules of Religion, nor the Measures of Conversation among Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to be over severe in <hi>Hypothesi,</hi> and to pronounce this or that Man wicked and infamous, though upon the score of that which we have doctrinally, and in way of Argumentation censured and condemned. Nor was the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Case parallel to that of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rthumberland,</hi> that the latter should make the former a President. For whereas that <hi>Duke</hi> was not only accused, but condemned for High Treason when he committed that Fact; the <hi>Earl,</hi> though accused and committed, not only knew himself innocent of the Crime wherewith he was charged, but was well assured that there was no Evidence upon which they could proceed to try, and much less to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him. For of all the Witnesses who had undertaken the Drudgery of swearing Men out of their Lives, there was only my Lord <hi>H.</hi> that could pretend to so much as acquaintance with him. Whose Testimony being but that of one Man, and a very infamous one too, it could not found an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Treason, much less be esteemed a sufficient Proof in Law for the Conviction and Condemnation of the meanest Subject.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to another <hi>Topick,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> did not destroy himself, but was murthered by others. For whereas it is not only sworn, that he cut his own Throat, but <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial, p. 45. 55.</note> 
               <hi>that he had ordered his Servants two days before, to provide a Pen-knife for him, on pretence of cutting his Nails; but with an Intent, as</hi> Bomeny <hi>insinuates in his Deposition, of committing that fatal and tragical Act:</hi> I doubt not but to make it appear, that he was so far from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42060:7"/>
any previous Intention of that nature, that he took all imaginable care, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Safety, and being fully secure, as to any hurt he might do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, was only apprehensive and jealous of what might be attempted upon him by others, and was accordingly solicitous how to prevent it. And therefore he had the very day before his Murther, appointed his Servants to bring up out of the Country, several Vessels of Silver, necessary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and dressing of Victuals, with an intent to have them brought into the Tower, not so much because he would have his Diet provided and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by his own Cook, by reason of being curious in what he eat, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was jealous of his Safety whilst his Meat was made ready by any of the Officers of the Prison, and was not without Suspition that some violent and illegal means would be used towards his Destruction. Nor is it unworthy of our further remark, that he was so far from having abandoned himself to despair, or having entertained the least thought of being his own Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the very day before the perpetration of the barbarous and horrid Fact upon him, he had ordered a considerable quantity of the best sort of Wines to be bought and brought into his Lodgings for his own Drinking, resolving out of a Regard to his Safety, rather than his Health, to taste none that was sold in or about the Tower. And whereas he knew that they had no intentions at Court of bringing him to a Tryal, nor indeed could, having but only one Person that pretended to be a Witness against him, he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly appointed the providing such a quantity for him, as would have sufficed some Months for his own drinking, till he could have been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a due Course of Law. Nor can unbiassed and impartial Men, make any other Inference and Deduction from these Circumstances, than that the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> instead of having designed any Violence upon himself, was only suspitious of what might be attempted against, and perpetrated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by other Hands.</p>
            <p>But if we will allow our selves leave to observe, what <hi>Ends</hi> the violent Death of that Earl hath been improved unto, and what Designs his Majesties Justices and Ministers have studied to serve by it; we shall both let our selves and the World into a fuller view and knowledge of this hellish Mystery of Darkness, and be able to detect the Contrivers of it, and by whose encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Authority that excellent, though unfortunate Person was brought to an untimely and bloody Death. In order whereunto, we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, how that after diverse Contrivances and Essays of involving Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in <hi>Sham</hi> Plots against the Person of the King and the established Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they were at last possessed of a Pretence of a Conspiracy of this nature, and had furnished themselves with some Witnesses, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42060:7"/>
the swearing the best and chiefest men of the Kingdom into a conjuration for levying war and destruction of his Majesty. But being conscious that their witnesses were not of a reputation to win belief to what they had prepared in charge against the principal Patriots of our Religion and Laws, they resolved to murther the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> (being one of these they had committed upon an accusation of being guilty of that pretended conspiracy) and then to give out that he had destroyed himself from the shame and horror of being concerned in so treasonabl' a design. This they judged to be the most effectual way to support the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their witnesses, and gain over the Nation to give faith to the truth and reality of the plot. For as his Mejesties Ministers knew what infamous persons most of the witnesses were, and how far from deserving that any thing should be received from their Testimony; so they were very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibl' that the generality of the Kingdom were not over inclinabl' to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Protestant plot, there having been so many endeavours before, of imposing upon them in this way and kind. This was the design in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which the murder of this honourabl' and innocent person was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and resolved; and to this end did the <hi>Attorney General</hi> and my Lord <hi>Chief Justice</hi> with all the Eloquence and Artifice as well as all the malice they are Masters of, endeavour to make it useful and subservient. <hi>The Lord of Essex being committed to the Tower for the Plot, and killing himself there, was more,</hi> say's the <hi>Attorney General, than a thousand witnesses to open the eyes of the people, and confirm the belief of the conspiracy.</hi>

                  <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial p. 3. ibid. pag. 63.</note> 
               <hi>There was Digitus Dei in it,</hi> say's my Lord <hi>Chief Justice Jeffryes, and enough to satisfie all the world of the Truth of the conspiracy, that the Earl of Essex being conscious of the great guilt he had contracted in being concerned in it, did rather than abide his Trial, and for the avoiding the methods of justice in his own particular case destroy himself.</hi> The improvement of the Murder of that noble Peer to the establishing the belief of a plot, gives no small ground to suspect who were the contrivers of his death, and upon what design they did first assassinate, and then endeavour to cast and divert the infamy and guilt of it upon himself. But I hope they will from their own way's of argumentation, allow us the liberty of inferring, that in case my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> was not <hi>Felo de se,</hi> that then there was no such Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant plot as they have filled the world with the noise of, seeing the only motives upon which they suppose and alledg' his having committed that unnatural fact upon himself, were the reproach and horror of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy. Nay we doubt not, but that all the honest and disinterested part
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42060:8"/>
of mankind, will upon conviction of their having destroyed that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Gentleman, become fully satisfied, that there hath been no such Treasonable combination, as his Majesties Ministers have endeavoured to impose the belief of upon the Nation, but that all his Court and Popish Sham, and only devised and fram'd for subverting our liberties and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by cutting off those that had the integrity and courage to espouse the protection and defence of them.</p>
            <p>And as the end whereunto the unnatural death of my Lord <hi>Essex</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and improved, shows by whom it was contrived and effected; so the <hi>Tim'ing</hi> of that murder, does further evidence and demonstrate, where the guilt of it ought to be charged, and what service it was calculated for the promoting of. For as if it had not been enough to murder <hi>one</hi> innocent person in a way of the most <hi>barbarous violence</hi> imaginable, they resolved to adjust it to such a juncture of time, as that it might serve to facilitate and compass the ruine of an <hi>other</hi> Noble Person in the way of their <hi>Legal Form's</hi> And therefore no sooner was my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> entred on his Trial for life, upon an indictment of being guilt of that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded conspiracy for which the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> stood committed, but they assassinated the <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and immediately dispatched away the news of his having murdered himself to the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> thereby to amuse and prepossess the jury, and byaz them to convict that <hi>other</hi> virtuous, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and innocent person. And with what satisfaction in themselves, as well as malice and artifice against the prisoner at the Barr, did his Majesties Councel lay hold on the tyd'ings, and apply them towards the begetting a belief of the guilt of that admirable person who stood then arraigned, and whom they were at that very time harrangu'ing and pleading out of his life. As if it had not been enough to impress the minds of a jury suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prejudiced, and which to all mens knowledge was grosly partial, for the <hi>Attorney General</hi> to say, <note n="*" place="bottom">My Lord Russels Tryal, p. 38.</note>

justice.</hi> Yea so evident was it to all impartial persons, who were then present at the Tryal, that the Murder of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated by himself but by others, and that it was time'd and adjusted to that season, in order to influencing the jury to give up my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> with the more ease as a sacrifice and victime to the rage of the Court; that a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noble Lord, who was always in the interests of <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and who was then very zealous in the prosecution of those accused for the Plot, being at that time on the Bench, did upon the hearing of my Lord of <hi>Essex's</hi> death, and who were then walking in the Tower when it fatally fell out, and upon observing with what diligence, care and artifice the news was brought into Court as my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was at the <hi>Bar,</hi> and how the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil thereupon acted their parts, rise up in great consternation from the Bench where he sat, and pulling his hat over his eyes press out of Court, saying he plainly saw the bottom of the business, and all the Mysteries wrapt up in it. And indeed such influence and success had the news of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi>'s having murder'd himself, from the shame and horror he was under for being concerned in the Conspiracy whereof my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> stood then arraigned, that diverse of the <hi>Inquest</hi> have confessed and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Report of the Earl's death, especially as improved and managed by the Kings Council, had greater power over their minds for the convicting him, than all the other evidence which was given, and that they do really believe they should never have sound him guilty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervention of that fatal stroke, and the crafty application which the Kings Council at Law made of it. But so far was the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> from entertaining any foregoing thoughts of murdering himself, or from calculating the perpetration of it to that unhappy season, that the very day before my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Trial, (being also the day before his own Throat was cut) he gave private directions to his <hi>Steward,</hi> to place himself with all the conveniency in Court which he could at the said Trial, the better to take the evidence in short hand, instructing him withall how he might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards convey it to him for his perusal and to be made use of as he should have occasion And as the <hi>Earl of Essex</hi> was a person of that sedateness, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and vertue, that no rational or good man can believe he would commit so horrid a crime upon himself; so such was the entire friendship between <hi>him</hi> and my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> that we must renounce common sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, before we can admit that the <hi>Earl of Essex</hi> would be guilty of so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous an injury to his dearest and best Friend, as to calculate and adjust the murdering himself to such a season, which he must needs know would be too probable a means, to derive the destruction of a person whom he infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely valued and loved after it.</p>

Having now shown the end unto which the murder of this incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Earl</hi> was designed and adapted, and the improvement which was made of it, not only through endeavouring to establish thereby the belief of a <hi>Protestant Plot</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> but to compass and facilitate the ruine of that religious and noble person my Lord <hi>Russel in particular;</hi> we shall as a further inducement to perswade and convince the inquisitive part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that some about St. <hi>James</hi>'s and <hi>Whitehall</hi> where the contrivers and authorisers of that barbarous assassination, lay open and unfold the motive and pique upon which it was done, and what it was which gave the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rise to some mens implacable malice against that loyal as well as virtuous person. And as it cannot be denied but this late Nobl' <hi>Earl</hi> had received Titles of honor, and places of Trust, interest and advantage from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; so it will be acknowledged that not only his Father but himself, had laid all the obligations upon the Crown, which it was possibl' for Subjects in way of Acting or Suffering to do. Nor is it less evident, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing both the <hi>Father</hi> my Lord <hi>Capel</hi>'s Laying down his life for <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> and the English Monarchy, and his Son <hi>Essex's</hi> manifold suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and services for <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> and the Royal Family; yet this honorable Person instead of quietly possessing any longer the just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>his own</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> merits, or enjoying any more the wonted signs of his Princes favour, was not onely debarred from, and deprived of the respect and confidence which his Majesty had used to show him, but was become the object of a great mans implacable hatred and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less malice For though the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> was a person, whom nothing could corrupt from his loyalty to the King and the Established Government: yet he was also a sincere and zealous Patriot of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, and a couragious Defender as well as owner of the Protestant Religion. And as he was none of those mercinary, base, and timorous Lords, who would either connive at, or concur in the introduction of Slavery and Popery; so he was one of the principal of those heroick and generous Peers, who had been active in detecting the Popish Conspiracy, and who had laboured with the greatest industry to prevent the effects of that hellish conjuration of the <hi>Valican, Louvre</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi>'s, for the extirpation of the Reformed Worship, and the subversion of the ancient Laws and Priviledges of <hi>England.</hi> And as he was known to understand more of the nature and extent of the Popish Conspiracy, and who were concerned in it, and to what degree, than most persons in the Kingdom either were or ever had oportunities for; so nothing can be more certain, than that as hereby he became the most dangerous man in the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42060:9"/>
to the Papists, but that he must consequently be the most special ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their jealousie, fear, and hatred. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> as his publick Station in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as his having been long a Member of His Majesty's <hi>Privy Council</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> furnished him with manifold advantages, which others wanted, of knowing the tendency, and penetrating into the bottom of all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Counsels which have been carrying on against our Religion and Legal Government; so his scorning and abhorring to sacrifice his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and Honour by either falling in with the Conspirators, or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding to withstand and oppose them in their attempts for the introduction and establishment of Popery and Arbitrariness, made them to think of all ways and means how to destroy him And besides these forementioned advantages which he had above other men, of knowing all the dimensions of the Popish Plot; he received no small accession of light in that affair, by having been always a Member of those Secret Committees, which had the Examination of Persons, and Inspection of Papers, concerning that devilish Conspiracy. Nor was the <hi>Earl</hi> insensible of the danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was in upon this account, and accordingly was wont sometimes to say to his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends, that as generally all the Papists, and more particularly such of them as make the greatest figure in the Kingdom dreaded him by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the detection he was able to make of their horrid Machinations; so he could not be without apprehension, but that they would seek to destroy him in order to prevent it.

What Family in <hi>England</hi> had done or suffered more for Monarchy, and for his present Majesty as well as his Father, than that of my Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> some whereof had sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their Lives, and all lost their Estates and Fortunes, upon the alone score and account of their Loyalty; and yet notwithstanding all this, my late Lord <hi>Lucas</hi> could no sooner declare his jealousie concerning the entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were making upon the Laws of the Land, and with zeal and courage avow his integrity in the Protestant Religion, and his resolution to assert by all legal ways the ancient Rights and Priviledges of <hi>England,</hi> but the Conspirators against our Religion and Laws, contrived and resolved the death of that worthy Patriot, and found means to poyson him by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned and hired instruments. And for Sir <hi>Robert Brooks,</hi> tho' he had not been called to that service for the Crown, nor had the misfortune to suffer in that degree for the Monarchy, which the former noble Person had; yet he was never wanting in Loyalty to his Majesty, but always served him with faithfulness in his capacity, and upon all occasions expressed the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most readiness to maintain and promote the greatness of the King and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Throne; Nevertheless that worthy Gentleman had no sooner ravelled into the <hi>burning</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and traced that execrable deed to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, which as Chairman of the <hi>Committee</hi> that was appointed to inspect and search after the Authors of that dreadfull conflagration, he had both
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42060:10"/>
occasion and was justified by his place to do; but the Romish Faction who had perpetrated that horrid villany, took up a resolution to cut him off, partly in revenge of his zeal and service to the City and Kingdom in that matter, and partly to discourage others from medling in a point which so neerly touched some of the greatest, as well as to prevent the publication of the researches and discoveries he had made And whereas Sir <hi>Robert</hi> upon an entertainment of apprehensions and jealousies in himself, as well as upon the warnings and informations he had received from friends, of a design against his Person and Life, did on the Prorogation of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment withdraw the Kingdom to avoid their fury; yet these implacable and blood-thirsty men, who never pardon either those that actually have, or are in a capacity to injure them, hired assassinates to dog and pursue him whithersoever he went, who at last taking him at an advantage drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him in a river where he was about to wash and refresh himself. And for Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> all that are not wilfully and perversely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, are so fully instructed both of the barbarous murther committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Gentleman, and from what motives and inducements, and by whose countenance and authority he was assassinated, that I shall not trouble my self or the Reader by enlarging on that villanous fact, which we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto wanted the courage to make a person at St. <hi>James</hi>'s answer for. Upon the whole, it can be no surprise to thinking and observing persons, to hear that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was, by the Authority of a great Man, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and assassinated; seeing it is no more, than what he and our Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Popish Ministers, have practised upon several others, whose opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, power, wisdom and interest, they did not so dread and apprehend, as they did the zeal, courage, integrity, prudence, and figure as well esteem in the Kingdom, of that truly, great and honourable Peer.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Topicks</hi> which we have already insisted upon, administer suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to believe that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> did not murther himself, but was villanously assassinated by others; so it is rendred more plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the <hi>Reports</hi> which were spread abroad both of his death and the manner of it, before that barbarous Fact was committed, or at least before the Fame of it could reach the places where it was told and related.

Nor indeed can it be imagined how matters of Fact, should come to be told, before they are acted or committed, but by granting that such things were resolved upon and designed, and that they came to be vented and talk'd off by reason of the blabbing humour either of some Persons accesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the contrivance, or entrusted with the knowledge of what had been agreed unto and determined in more secret <hi>Cabal's.</hi> So that we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally hope, the ingenuous part of mankind will esteem themselves much enlightned in reference to the manner of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, and enabled to conclude who were the contrivers and perpetrators of the villanous assassination of that renowned person, if we represent unto them, with all the distinctness we can, the reports which went of it, both in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Countrey before the Commission of the abominable Fact, or at least before the tidings could reach the places where it was spoken and discoursed.

she related it to her Sister, that evening when she came home. And upon hearing the next day that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was murdered, and how it was reported. That he should have cut his own Throat; the poor Lady, thô strangely alarmed with the News, could not but immediately make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, That what she had look't upon overnight as a Parable and Mystery, was then deciphered and unriddled, and that the Earl must needs have come to that untimely end, by the Treachery and Villany of others. To this we shall subjoin what Mrs. <hi>Mewx,</hi> a Gentlewoman, who also lives in <hi>London,</hi> was ready to Depose upon Oath, relating to a previous report of this nature, at Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial. For being on <hi>Thursday</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> (which was the day before my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> death) travelling with her Daughter in a Coach from the City down to <hi>Berkshire;</hi> she is ready to swear that her Daughter then told her how she had heard it reported, That one of the <hi>Lords</hi> committed for the late Plot had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower.</hi> Which fully evidenceth, That there was a discourse not only of his death, but the manner of it, antecedently to his Fatal and Tragical end. But the Daughter being with Child, and near her time, and therefore not daring to venture abroad, much less into the Court at Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial; my Lord <hi>Chief Justice</hi> would not suffer the Mother (thô she was there and sworn) to be examined, alledging, That because she could not Depose on her own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but only on the report of her Daughter, it was no evidence, and therefore against all judicial forms to admit it. But as Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Braddox</hi>'s Trial p. 48.</note> 
               <hi>It was evidence there was such a talk,</hi> previous to my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, so I may add, That by consequence he did not murder himself, but was assassinated by others. Nor was it only in and about the Town that my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> was reported to have cut his Throat, at least a day if not more before he came to his untimely end; but the same was discoursed of at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable distance in the Country, and related after the same manner and with the same circumstances For one Mr. <hi>Fielder,</hi> a Shopkeeper, in <hi>Andover,</hi> a Town removed from <hi>London</hi> above fifty Miles; positively swears that it was talk't there the <hi>11th.</hi> and <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> That the Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l of <hi>Essex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower,</hi> whereas he was not killed till the <hi>13th.</hi> nor could the news arrive so far in the ordinary way of conveying Intelligence before the <hi>14th.</hi> And the said Mr. <hi>Fielder</hi> further avers, That this was to commonly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoursed of, from <hi>Wednesday</hi> night till <hi>Friday</hi> noon, that he fully expected the confirmation of it by the Post-Letters, which were to arrive that day. But finding no mention in those Letters of any such thing, tho they all agreed in the relation of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s commitment to the <hi>Tower,</hi> he concluded
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42060:12"/>
there could be no truth in the report, but withal wondred how such a thing came to be talk'd of. And therefore when the certain news of my Lord's death was brought to <hi>Andover</hi> about Saturday noon, by some Cloathiers that came out of <hi>London</hi> on Friday at twelve of the Clock, he could not but be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mased at the report which had been current among them two days before. But my Lord <hi>Chief Justice</hi> was pleased to ridicule all this when it was deposed at Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial, <note n="*" place="bottom">Bradd. Trial p. 38. 39.</note> 
               <hi>as a contrivance to deceive the King's Subjects, and to set us together by the ears, stiling it stuff, rak'd out of Dunghills, and pick'd up on purpose to kindle a fire, and set us all into a flame.</hi> But can his Lordship think that his blustering, his impudence, and the huffing the World with foaming wrathful speeches, are enough to take off the positive testimony of an honest and credible person, and who had spoken of this report long before he thought any improvement would be made of it? Nor is it sufficient to blast the reputation of the Man, or detract from the Truth of what he swore, that he could not particularly name the persons that had reported it; because as he never expected to be called into question about it, so he had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to recollect it, till he was served with a <hi>sub poena</hi> to appear at Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s Trial, which was above five Months after the time of the said talk and discourse. And besides how many things are there, which a publick Skopkeeper, as this person is, may hear his Customers speak of, which he would be nonplust to give an account of the Authors of at a weeks end? Nay by how much a Report is common, (as he says this was at <hi>Andover)</hi> by so much are we apt to neglect by whom it hath been particularly related. And the more our understandings are struck with the horror of a matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to us, the less do we advert by whom it is spoken, and the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared are our memories to treasure up the names of the reporters. Nor was it at <hi>Andover</hi> only, that it was reported the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had cut his Throat, the day before he was killed; but the same story and cloathed with the same circumstances, was discoursed of before his death in divers other places. For I am not only credibly informed, That the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s having cut his Throat, was reported on <hi>Thursday,</hi> being the day before his death, at <hi>Warmister</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> which is distant from <hi>London</hi> about eighty Miles; but there is one <hi>Thomas Cox,</hi> who lives near <hi>Bruningham,</hi> that did positively declare, That the same was told him in that Town the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> whereas my Lord was not killed in the <hi>Tower</hi> till the 13.

And the first is, That it ought to be reckoned as a wonder, and ascribed only to the over-ruling Providence of God, that will not suffer a Crime so hateful to Heaven, and so ruinous to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, to fall out without leaving some prints and footsteps by which it may be traced and detected, that a Crime so enormous in it self, so provoking and exasperating to Mankind, and which the Authors of, and Actors in, would be loth to bear the ignominy, and undergo the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that so horrid a guilt subjects them unto, should be communicated to so many and so commonly talkt of before the Fact. But by how much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is one of the sweetest passions, and most grateful to depraved nature, by so much hath it a power and vertue in it, to cause Men to open and unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some themselves, from the satisfaction which it yields, and the delightful gust that it affords them. And thô the <hi>Papists</hi> were at that time exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transported with joy, partly through their having shamm'd a Plot upon the Protestants which they supposed would extinguish the remembrance of their own, and partly from the hopes they had, of appeasing the Ghosts of their <hi>Tyburn</hi> Martyrs, with the Blood of <hi>English</hi> Hereticks; yet they could not but be uneasie in their minds, to think that the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> whom they so peculiarly hated, and whose ability to unma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it improbable but that the Contrivers of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Man's death, might have resolved the execution and commission of the Fact sooner, and that the reason of adjourning it, was to adjust it to the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my Lord <hi>Russels</hi>'s Trial, thereby to make the murder of the <hi>one</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient and useful to the death of the <hi>other;</hi> but that those acquainted with the first Resolution, had from a forwardness of obliging their friends, too hastily given them intelligence of the thing as already done, when it was not as yet perpetrated, nor committed, by reason of the later Resolution. The second observation I would make upon the forementioned reports, is, That tho' they were vented by several persons, yet they not only agreed in the matter of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, but they accorded also in the way and manner of it namely, that he had cut his Throat. Which plainly shows that it was not vulgar Tattle vented at random, but that it had its foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a previous and fixed resolution that he should undergo that unhappy fate. Nothing but a steddy and determinate cause, can produce a steddy and determinate effect. Had the report taken its rise in the jealousies of his friends, or owed its birth to the fearful apprehensions of the common people; they would have rather dream'd of his being poyson'd, as being more safe for the Actors to perpetrate, and requiring the accession of sewer hands, than have ever imagined that his throat should be cut. It is impossible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Reports of so many several persons, should not only agree in the matter of his death, but all harmonise and center in the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the manner of it; unless it had originally proceeded from such as had contrived and determined both the murder it self, and the way wherein it should be committed. For when reports have their foundation only in mens fancies, they will always vary according to the different tempers, passions and complexions of the Reporters. The third deduction which I would infer from the premised Reports, is, That they could not be fictions and forgeries of Lyers and People Romantickly disposed. For how could so many persons, and at such distances from one another, and betwixt whom there was never any correspondence, agree and combine together to impose upon the World and to abuse the Faith of Mankind? And as they all seem
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42060:13"/>
to be persons who abhor tricks, and who would not be guilty of spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much less of raising a false Report? so it is beyond the wit of man to declare, how it should come to be the interest of <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> and <hi>Country Tradesmen</hi> to be the Authors of such a Story that my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> had cut his throat before it was done. And for any to imagine that the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> were the framers of it, is to represent them not only wicked but foolish, and to suppose they would disserve themselves, as well as slander and reproach their noblest and best friend.</p>
            <p>And what clearer evidence, or greater confirmation can there be, of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s not having been <hi>Felo de se,</hi> but treacherously murdered by others, and that they who were the Authorisers of that horrid assassination, are persons of great power and interest at Court; than that there have been Letters sent and proposals made to some noble Lords near the King, that his Majesty will but grant a pardon to two or three men who shall be named when that grace is indulged, and that then the whole intrigue and mysterie of that hellish contrivance shall be discovered, and the contrivers as well as perpetrators of it particularly detected, with a full account of all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of its execution. 'Tis true I dare not affirm, that those Letters have been shown to his Majesty, or any intercession used with him in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of that overture and proposal; but this I may justly say, that if they have neglected it, they must needs either know or suspect, that there are persons of too great power as well as quality interested and concerned in that execrable villany. For we can suppose no other motive, upon which men of honour would decline a service so acceptable to God, and whereby they might avert wrath not only from the Throne and Kingdom, but from their own persons and families, through bringing enormous offenders and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable assassinates to punishment. But alass! that apprehension they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of deriving trouble and destruction upon themselves, instead of being able to expose the Malefactors to justice, frightens them from the discharge of that duty which they owe both to God and Men. The having heard what a Great Man should say in reference to Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> namely, <hi>that he was ravelling into such a business, but that he was resolved to ruine him if all the Law of</hi> England <hi>would do it;</hi> makes every man affraid as well as sensible what he may encounter if he have the boldness to interest himself in this affair. O degenerate off spring of brave and heroick ancestors! were it not much more eligible to run hazard by acquitting your selves as persons of honour in discharge of your duty, than to seek for safety by involving your persons and posterity under the guilt of that abominable and villanous Fact. And besides, can they otherwise hope, than that through conniving at so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42060:14"/>
a murder committed upon another person, and one who was of a rank and condition equal to themselves, they shall at last undergo the same or the like fate, whensoever they have the unhappiness and misfortune to fall under the wrath of a certain Gentleman at <hi>St. James</hi>'s. But over and above the two Letters that were sent to noble persons very near the King to be communicated to his Majesty, there was another Letter addressed to the <hi>Countess</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> and in order to the being conveyed to her Ladyship, directed to be left with one Mr. <hi>Cadman</hi> a Bookseller in the <hi>New Exchange</hi> in the <hi>Strand;</hi> the Tenor whereof was, <hi>that if her Honour would prevail with the King for a pardon, to one that would discover how my Lord came by his death, or obtain of his Majesty a proclamation, assuring forgiveness to any who should come in and detect by whom and after what manner my Lord was murder'd, that upon either of those securities, the way of the Earl of Essex</hi>'s <hi>assassination, should be revealed, and laid open with all its circumstances.</hi> This Letter was in August last brought by a young woman to Mr. <hi>Cadman's</hi> Shop, who finding him sleeping on the inside of his Counter, told him that she had brought him a Letter directed to my Lady <hi>Essex</hi> concerning my Lords death, which she desired he would read, being to that end left open and unsealed. But <hi>Cadman</hi> being drowsie and still inclined to sleep, instead of taking notice what she said, thrust her from the Counter as an officious and troublesome person, and commanded her to goabout her business. Yet having after his being throughly awake both perused the Letter, and considered the importance and consequence of it, he judged himself in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence obliged to carry it to a Magistrate, which accordingly he did to one <hi>Hinton</hi> a Justice of Peace in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> who as I have been credibly informed went with it to one of the <hi>Secretaries</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> This Letter as is most justly conceived was written by <hi>Bomeny;</hi> forasmuch as he not only seemed about that time to be under some Remorse in reference to the death of my Lord, but because some of <hi>Bomeny's</hi> handwriting being shewed to Mr. <hi>Cadman,</hi> it appeared to him according to the best of his remembrance and judgment, to be the same hand, or at least very much like unto that which the letter was written in. This much is plainly evident that it must have been written by one that was willing to be known, seeing it was both sent open and by a person that was able to declare of whom she had received it. For had the writing of this Letter been only a contrivance to avert the infamy of my Lord's death from himself, and deliver those Gentlemen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for the Plot, from the consequences unto which the Earls imagined murdering himself was improved against them; it would never have been left unsealed for Mr. <hi>Cadman</hi> to read, nor seat by a person that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42060:14"/>
with the contents of it, as it plainly appears the bearer was; but would both have been sealed, to prevent <hi>Cadman</hi>'s looking into it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by a porter or some such hand, that would have been less lyable to be questioned either about the contents or the Author of it. Nor does any thing more amaze and astonish thinking people, than that notwithstanding the many Reports, as well as Universal jealousies, of my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> being murder'd in the <hi>Tower.</hi> yet all this time his Majesty hath not published one word to encourage an inquisition into the manner of his death, or to secure a pardon to such as shall be able to discover whether he was assassinated, and by whom and after what manner he was brought to an untimely End. For considering the obligations which the King and the Royal Family lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the late Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> as well as to his Father my Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> and considering the many aspersions thrown upon the Court in relation to the death of the said Earl; it hath been expected that his Majesty as well in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to the Family of the <hi>Capels,</hi> as in vindication of his own honour from the infamy of having a person of my Lord <hi>Essex</hi>'s merit and figure assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in his Majesties prison and Palace, would have issued out a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ascertaining forgiveness to any that should be able to prove his being murdered by others, and that he did not destroy himself as some people have been industrious to give out. And that which encreaseth the surprise and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is the consideration of the forwardness which the King hath expressed in some other cases, for the detection of murders of this nature. For besides the tender of a pardon, there was the promise of 500. l. to any who should discover the murder of Sr. <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> and reveal the miscreants by whom he was assassinated. And I would be loth to think, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties proceeding so differently in that case, from what he hath done in this, was rather to be ascribed to his apprehensions of a <hi>ParlJament</hi> which was then in <hi>Being,</hi> than to his love of justice or the desire of delivering the Nation from the guilt of innocent blood. But I am willing to believe that the reason why the King doth not encourage the discovery of this late mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my L. of <hi>Essex,</hi> ariseth from the fear he is in of the persons that were accessory to it. For in case he would authorise the detection of the Assassinates of this Noble Earl, he will find himself obliged, not only to bring the <hi>Earl of S.—</hi>and my Lord <hi>F.—</hi>but his <hi>Royal</hi> and dearly beloved <hi>Brother I—D.—</hi>of <hi>Y.—</hi>to punishment. And who knows but that he dreads left in calling these Gentlemen to account for cutting the E. of <hi>Essex's</hi> throat, He too much hazard and expose his own? Nor is it at all surprizing, that the King who had not courage to resent the poysoning his own <hi>Sister</hi> by her husband the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> at a juncture when He might have made <hi>France</hi> feel the effects of his justice and displeasure; should not have the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42060:15"/>
boldness to question his <hi>Brother</hi> and other principal persons of the Popish Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the assassination of <hi>Essex,</hi> especially at a time that he hath dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted himself of all power to hurt them, and by seeming offended may only stir up their wrath against himself. For I remember, that when the late <hi>Sr. Thomas Armstrong</hi> had come post from <hi>Paris,</hi> to give his Majesty an account how <hi>Orleans</hi> had poisoned the Princess <hi>Henrietta,</hi> that he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Orleans</hi> is a Rascal, but pray thee <hi>Tom</hi> do not speak of what he hath done. Yet that his Majesty may not excuse himself hereafter from causing further inquisition to be made after my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death by saying he never heard otherwise but that he murder'd himself, I do therefore tell his Majesty, and publish to all the World, that if he will grant an <hi>indemnity</hi> and protection to <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> persons, we shall fully and evidently prove a Great Man, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>S.—</hi>my Lord <hi>F.—</hi>&amp;c. to have been the contrivers and Authorisers of it, and shall name the <hi>Ruffians</hi> in particular, who were employed to perpetrate the hellish and execrable Fact, with an account of the several sums of money which they had for the execution of it. Nor ought his Majesty to be displeased, that I arraign his <hi>Brother</hi> and principal <hi>Ministers</hi> of so enormous and bloody a crime; for as I write nothing but what I can fully justify, so I take the boldness further to tell both him and them, that if ever there come a <hi>ParlJament</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> this matter shall be laid fully open, and justice demanded against these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and enormous Offenders.</p>
            <p>And as if it were not enough to evidence the E. of <hi>Essex</hi> did not murder himself, but was barbarously assassinated by others, that no encouragement hath been given for the discovery of the Authors of that villanous Fact, notwithstanding all the rumours and Reports which have run to and fro, both of the Manner of his death and the Actors in it; it receives both a further and a very convincing accession of proof from this, that all means have been used to deterr men from enquiring into that matter, and to prevent their detecting what they may know of it. The passages to this purpose would fill a volume meerly to relate them, and therefore I shall confine my self to two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which I shall endeavour to deduce and represent, with all the brevity as well as clearness I can. Nor can it in the <hi>first</hi> place, but astonish the world, to find the <hi>Judges,</hi> with whom the administration of law and justice between the King and his people is trusted, I say to find them, contrary both to the nature and End of their office, and the Oaths they have taken of acting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, to <hi>brand</hi> the medling in the matter of the E. of <hi>Essex's</hi> death, as a Reflection upon his Majesty, an Affront to the Government, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to involve and embroil the Nation in trouble. For not only the <hi>Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General</hi> stigmatiseth the report and belief of the <hi>Earl's</hi> being murdered

Of this we have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous instance in <hi>Sr. Thomas Overbury,</hi> who being committed Prisoner to the <hi>Tower</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> and there <hi>poisoned</hi> by the contrivance and instigation of the Earl of <hi>Sommerset, &amp;c.</hi> (that was then chief Minister as well as principal Favourite) was brought in by the Coroners inquisition to have died a natural death. And yet it was thought no dishonour to the Government, to have the death of that Gentleman afterwards enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and to find it proved contrary to the <hi>Coroners Inquisition,</hi> that instead of dying a natural death, he was basely and treacherously murdered by Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous hands, through the accession and contrivance of him whom he had faithfully served, and with the consent of those to whose care, trust and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody he was committed. Nay, was it not a great Vindication of the honor of the Government, and an eminent Declaration of the Justice of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> meaner <hi>persons</hi> executed, and the Earl of <hi>Sommerset</hi> and his <hi>Countess</hi> convicted and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for that bloody and barbarous Fact, which the <hi>Coroners Inquest</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and absolved all the world from the suspition as well as the guilt of? And what an injury will the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and his Majesties <hi>Councel</hi> at <hi>Law,</hi> be found to have done the King and the Government, by their foolish as well as wicked expressions, if at any time hereafter it come to be proved (as certainly it will) that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> did not murder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42060:16"/>
but was assassinated by a company of hired <hi>Russians.</hi> We should be loath in that case to claim the right of their way of Argumentation, and to inferr that because my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> was murdered in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and at a time <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddons Tryal p. 4. 60.</note> 
               <hi>when the King was walking there,</hi> that therefore not only the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be charged with it, but that the King himself had a hand in, and had designed it.</hi> Tho I must say that according to their method of reasoning, it will be impossible in that case to avoid such a deduction. However it is a convincing proof, that the ignominy and guilt of this Noblemans death, ought to be ascribed to others than himself, that the Judges and the men of the long Robe, can find no other way to stifle the suspition, and silence the clamor of the People, but by interposing the Government as a Skreen to shelter Malefactors from Accusation, and abusing the Authority of the Kingdom, to deter men from the duty which they owe to God and his Majesty in discovering so execrable a murder. Nor is this the only way and method they have taken to frighten and discourage Persons from discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s being destroy'd by others, without any accession or contribution of his own to his death, but they have laid their commands and injunctions upon such as they have power and authority over, and whom they thought conscious either to the manner of that Noble <hi>Peers</hi> fatal End, or capable of detecting any circumstances which might let in light upon that affair. And therefore knowing that the <hi>Soldiers</hi> who were upon <hi>Duty</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that morning when the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was killed, had not only taken notice of several Persons, and made Observation of diverse things, from which both the murder of that vertuous Lord might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and concluded as well as by whose hands it was perpetrated, but <hi>that</hi> divers of them had talkt too freely and lavishly of it abroad as well as among themselves; accordingly on the <hi>Saturday</hi> morning (being that which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately succeeded to the day of the Earls death) did a Military Officer after <hi>They</hi> and other <hi>Soldiers</hi> were called together, charge them with the highest threats and menaces, that they should not dare to speak of what they had seen or heard the day before, adding that whosoever should be known to divulge what had passed in the <hi>Tower</hi> on the <hi>Friday</hi> in the forenoon should severely suffer for <hi>it.</hi> This divers of <hi>the Soldiers</hi> have confessed and related to their friends, who are willing to testifie it when occasion serves. And among others, one <hi>Robert Meak</hi> (of whom I shall afterwards have occasion to say somewhat more) declared the whole of this passage to <hi>two</hi> men that are ready to swear <hi>it,</hi> whensoever their Depositions may be of advantage <hi>to the</hi> publick, and can be made without exposing themselves to ruin. It will <hi>not</hi> be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42060:16"/>
denied by rational men, but that the <hi>Souldiers</hi> who were then upon Duty in the <hi>Tower,</hi> had advantages of knowing more in reference to the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> death, than most other persons can pretend unto; seeing that as some were so posted as both to see all that went into his Lodgings, and to hear the noise and bustle which was made in his Chamber upon his resistance, and the force and violence which the miscreants used towards him; so others were placed in that manner, as to observe whence and from whom they came, and whither and to whom they returned, that were employed to commit the Hellish and Tragical deed. Nor can any suspect, that men who march under the Ensigns of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> should forge a story so much tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dishonor of a <hi>great man,</hi> and the Kings <hi>Ministers,</hi> and so likely to displease persons <hi>that</hi> had power to cashier, and <hi>otherwise</hi> punish them as <hi>this</hi> of my Lord <hi>Essex</hi> not <hi>cutting</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Throat, but being Assassinated by others, was <hi>adapted unto,</hi> and would infallibly do.

And I shall take the <hi>liberty further</hi> to say, <hi>that</hi> it is not only the <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>those</hi> very <hi>Ministers</hi> who may not be directly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Guilt</hi> of my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> blood, to <hi>promote</hi> and <hi>second</hi> this <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>proposal,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> not only for <hi>the</hi> Honor of the <hi>Government,</hi> but for <hi>their</hi> own <hi>Vindication</hi> from being accessary to so enormous and <hi>detestable</hi> a Crime.

And whatsoever proves the ill treatment of those, who keeping themselves within the bonds of loyalty and modesty have ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to detect the Assassination of that honorable person, does by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence demonstrate that he was not <hi>Felo de se,</hi> but that he was <hi>Murdered</hi> by the malice and violence of other men. The first unexpected enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment which this Gentlemen Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> met with, was his being taken into Custody, and carried before the <hi>Council,</hi> on his having gone to <hi>White-hall</hi> to wait upon my Lord <hi>S.</hi> in order to inform his Lordship what a certain Boy (whom he took thither along with him) had reported concerning a <hi>Razor,</hi> which he saw thrown out of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, immediately before the noise and report of his Death And not to mention what other Treatment he met with there, which some of the Honorable Menbers of that Board themselves, have declared to have been very unbecoming his Majesties presence, and no way's agreeable to the gravity, wisdom and honor of such an assembly, he was required to give 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Bail to answer an <hi>Information,</hi> for having <hi>suborned</hi> the Boy; a thing very unsuitable to the service he had been performing for the Honor of his <hi>Majesty</hi> and the <hi>Government,</hi> and very surprising to all <hi>indifferent</hi> persons that heard of it. And tho this poor <hi>Gentleman</hi> was discharged at that <hi>time</hi> and, restored to his <hi>liberty,</hi> upon giving the forementioned 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Bail, to answer the said <hi>Information;</hi> yet his troubles did not <hi>end</hi> and <hi>terminate</hi> here; but this was rather only a commencement and beginning of the hardships and oppressions which he was to meet with, for having had the honesty and courage to appear in a business, which so neerly affected a great man, and so many of his <hi>Majesties</hi> principal <hi>Ministers of State.</hi> For though they had laid him under a necessity of making all the provisions he could, for <hi>Vindicating</hi> himself from being the Author and Forger of that <hi>Report,</hi> concerning a <hi>Razor's</hi> being thrown out of the E. of <hi>Essex</hi> window just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cry and noise of his <hi>death,</hi> being that which gave the <hi>suspition</hi> of my <hi>Lords</hi> being murdered by <hi>violent, treacherous</hi> and <hi>bloody hands,</hi> and that he did not <hi>destroy himself,</hi> as was endeavoured to be <hi>obtruded</hi> and <hi>imposed</hi> upon his <hi>Memory</hi> and the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Nation;</hi> yet <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi> was no sooner gone into the <hi>Country</hi> to enquire into the truth of an other <hi>Story,</hi> which very much <hi>strengthened</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> the suspition and jealousie that my
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42060:18"/>
               <hi>Lord</hi> was not <hi>Felo de Se;</hi> but this poor Gentleman fell into new troubles, and found persecution and oppression awaiting him whithersoever he went. For having received intelligence from a friend, <hi>that on the very day on which the Earl died, it was reported at</hi> Marleborough, <hi>that my Lord of</hi> Essex <hi>had cut his Throat in the</hi> Tower; he judged it very useful and subservient both to the acquitting himself from <hi>the</hi> Slander of being the first Author of the Report <hi>that my Lord was murdered by others,</hi> and also to the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and clearing up that he really was so, to search into the truth of that Information which his Friend had given him, and to learn out the persons to whom that News had been told, and know if possible the names of those who had related it. But while he was going in the search and pursuit of this, which his being obliged under the <hi>Penalty</hi> of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> to answer an Information of Subornation, had made an act of Justice to himself as well as a duty of God and his Country, behold the poor Gentleman was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and committed to <hi>Fisherton Goal</hi> in <hi>Wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For what could be more extravagant and illegal <hi>than</hi> to seise and commit a Gentleman <hi>travelleng</hi> peaceably on the road, without an <hi>Oath</hi> or deposition of any witness against him, meerly upon a groundless and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked suspition of being a dangerous and ill affected man to the Government, and for having two Informations about him, relating to a <hi>Razors</hi> being thrown out of my Lord <hi>Essex VVindow</hi> before the news of his death was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, and for carrying two Letters, whereof the contents of one he knew not, and the contents of the other could administer no just offence. But the <hi>Form of the VVarrant</hi> was more extravagant, arbitrary, and illegal than the <hi>matter,</hi> carrying in express words this order and command to the <hi>Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> namely, <hi>That he should</hi> Lawrence Braddon <hi>safely keep, till he should receive further Order from the King and Privy Councel.</hi> Which <hi>VVarrant</hi> had the <hi>Goaler</hi> been as mad and foolish to obey, as the officious and doating Justice was <hi>to write,</hi> the poor <hi>Gentleman</hi> for any foundation of relief <hi>that</hi> was left him in <hi>the Mittimus,</hi> might have lain in Prison all the days of his life, unless <hi>the</hi> King and Councel should have ordered his Release and Discharge.

Only it may not be amiss, to reminde my <hi>Lord K.</hi> of a Verse that he quoted out of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and to subjoin the Translation of it into English, as a certain author hath rendred it. For having upbraided the poor Gentleman as one that had a design to raise and advance himself by sinistrous courses (which God knows the endeavouring to detect the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> Murder, was not as the present posture of Affairs stands, a very likely method unto) he quoted that of the Poet to give an edg to his <hi>Irony</hi> and <hi>Sarcasm:</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris, &amp; careere dignum,</l>

               <l>Dare once but be a Rogue upon Record,</l>
               <l>And you may quickly hope to be a Lord.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But his bitter and contemptuous Language, with all his other ungentile as well as illegal Treatment, might have easily been dispensed with; had not his Lordship refused him the benefit of the <hi>Statute</hi> of being <hi>admitted</hi> to be <hi>Bayled,</hi> unless he would procure <hi>Sureties</hi> who together with himself might stand bound in 12000 <hi>l.</hi> for appearance. A thing so exorbitant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the quality of the Prisoner, as well as unjust considering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>that</hi> which they stiled his offence, that he had both acted unwise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly should he have engaged himself and Friends in Bonds so much above what he was able to discharge, and injuriously to others should he have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to so illegal a demand, and which might afterwards be improved into a <hi>president.</hi> Whereupon finding after diverse Applications, that this <hi>Lordship</hi> was not to be wrought to a mitigation of the 12000 <hi>l,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> he would not be prevailed on to take the 6000 <hi>l.</hi> Bail, which was offered; the Gentleman rather than be remitted again to Prison in the Countrey, was forced to comply to stand committed to the <hi>Messenger,</hi> Mr. <hi>Atterburys,</hi> where he continued for <hi>five Weeks</hi> at the charges and rate of 4 <hi>l. 1 s, 8 d.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42060:19"/>
per week.</hi> During which time he applied himself by way of petition to his <hi>Majesty in Council,</hi> but alas without that success which he hoped for, which most Men are apt to aseribe to the <hi>King's</hi> being prepossessed by my Lord <hi>K.</hi> concerning his case, so that despairing both of all <hi>Justice</hi> from my Lord <hi>K.</hi> and of all <hi>Favour</hi> from the <hi>Council Board,</hi> and groaning as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a close Confinement, as the excessive charges he was at in the <hi>Messenger's</hi> House; he judged it the best method he could take, to endeavour the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself turned over to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Prison in <hi>Southwark,</hi> reckoning that he should not only live there at a more moderate Expence (which the Narrowness of his Fortune obliged him to consult) than was extorted from him at Mr. <hi>Atterburies,</hi> but likewise expecting, that upon giving Security for his true Imprisonment, he should have the Liberty of the <hi>Rules,</hi> and thereby enjoy a more open and free Air, than he did in the place where he was before. But as it was with some Difficulty and after earnest Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well to my <hi>Lord K.</hi> as to my <hi>Lord Chief Justice,</hi> and the <hi>Attorney General,</hi> that this small Kindness was obtained; so after his removal to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> by vertue of a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> from my <hi>Lord Chief Justice,</hi> and after his having given 10000 <hi>l.</hi> Security for his faithful and true Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet he was by an order from my Lord <hi>Chief Justice</hi> to the <hi>Marshal</hi> of the said Prison for his close Consinement, denied the Freedom of the <hi>Rules,</hi> which he had not only promised himself as a thing that was in course al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, but what the Keeper of the Prison had consented unto, and without the granting whereof he could not according to Law demand Bayl and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for his true Imprisonment. Yea, so arbitrary and illegal were they in all their actings against this poor Gentleman Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Imprisonment, yet they refused to discharge him from the 2000 <hi>l. Bayl,</hi> which he had given at his first Appearance before the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> to answer an <hi>Information</hi> of pretended <hi>Subornation;</hi> and also notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his <hi>close Confinement,</hi> they withheld from him, and positively denied to give up the 10000 <hi>l. Bonds,</hi> which <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>Sureties</hi> had entred into for his being a <hi>true Prisoner,</hi> nor would they so much as restore him the <hi>Fees</hi> he had payd upon the sealing of them. And it being now the long <hi>Vacation,</hi> and there remaining no way of helping and relieving himself till the <hi>Term,</hi> he was forced both to continue a close Prisoner under no less Expence than two l.

From all which we may not only collect the Hardships and Oppressions which this honest and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman met wit, meerly for enquiring into the Truth of some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which if admitted, do clearly prove that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinated by others, and did not murder himself, but we may also observe and infer after what an arbitrary and illegal manner his Majesties Subjects are treated by some of his judicial Officers, as well as prime Ministers, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to discover a most execrable and barbarous Murder, wherein a great Man, and the chief Heads of the Popish Faction would have been found deeply concerned and involved. Nor did Mr. <hi>Braddons</hi> troubles upon this account issue here, all these things being only <hi>Praeludiuars</hi> to what he was further to encounter from the Rage and Malice of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and therefore the next <hi>Scene</hi> that opened, was the bringing him to a Trial for endeavouring in the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Death, to cast Aspersiens upon the Government and defame the King. And all I would desire of any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced and impartial Person, is only to read the said <hi>Trial,</hi> being fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that he will thereupon not only acquit the Gentleman from the Guilt of any such thing; but that he will find himself obliged in conscience
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42060:20"/>
to acknowledge that there was barbarous villany used in bringing my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> to that Fatal and untimely End. And the first thing remarkable as an Introduction to that Trial, is, that my Lord <hi>Chief Justice</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that morning for some time at <hi>Whitehall</hi> before he went to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> but was attended upon by Lord <hi>F.</hi> (whom we have reason to accuse of being one of the Contrivers and Authorisers of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> murder) at the lighting out of his Coach in <hi>Westminster,</hi> and discoursed with both as he was conducted through the Hall, and in a corner near unto the Court before his <hi>Lordship</hi> ascended to the <hi>Bench.</hi> Which hath given many men ground to suspect, that his business at the first place was to receive such Instructions as he was to follow and attend unto in the work of the day, and that the reason of the others according and discoursing him where he did, was to impress him with a fresh sense of the business that was to be before him, and to represent the dreadful consequences which would ensue to a <hi>great Man</hi> and His Majesties <hi>Ministers,</hi> in case Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> should come to be acquitted. And whosoever did either observe the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the <hi>Bench</hi> at that time, or hath since read the Trial, (where tho what was said on all sides may be related, yet the Gesture, Countenance, Passion, Heat and Air with which many things were spoken, cannot be represented) must be forced to acknowledge that my <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> were rather sworn parties against the Defendant, than equal Judges in a Cause betwixt the King and him. I should be obliged to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe most of the Trial, did I undertake to give an account of the ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, slanderous, and malicious language vented against himself; or the interrupting, menacing, and hectoring of his Counsel, or the imposing upon, prescribing unto as well as byassing the Jury against him; and therefore instead of that, I entreat and desire the world to do both themselves, and Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> that right as to peruse the <hi>Trial,</hi> and if in their hearts they subscribe not to what I say, I am contented to undergo the character both of a person that understands nothing of the Rules and Measures which ought to be observed in Courts of Judicature, and of one who is not sufficiently regardful of his Credit and Fame in the things which he delivers. And if I be not wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mistaken, there is nothing more needful, but an impartial reading and weighing of that <hi>Trial,</hi> for the vindication of Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reports which seem'd to imply that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had not killed himself, nor to justify his innocency as to the crime whereof he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, namely <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddons Trial, <hi>p.</hi> 2. 70.</note> 
               <hi>of maliciously conspiring and endeavouring to defame the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and, as Justice <hi>Withins</hi> was pleased to express it, <hi>of charging the King
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42060:21"/>
with taking away an innocent mans blood, and of murdering an innocent man,</hi> and as it was layd in the <hi>Indictment, of his procuring and suborning false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to prove that the Earl of</hi> Essex <hi>was not a Felon of himself, but was killed and murdered by unknown persons.</hi> For admit that all which was sworn concerning a <hi>bloody Razor's</hi> being thrown out of my Lord <hi>Essex</hi>'s window im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the news of his death, and that all which was deposed concerning a <hi>Report</hi> in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi> about <hi>his having cut his Throat before it was done,</hi> were false and only invented by the Informers; yet, as it is evident by the Oaths and Depositions of the Witnesses, that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was not the Forger of these things; so it is demonstrable that they were in their nature of that weight and importance, upon which a wise as well an honest man, might suspect that my Lord had not murdered himself, but was destroyed by others. Nor could the Gentleman have ever been found guilty, but by means of Mercinary <hi>Judges,</hi> and an overaw'd as well as a pick'd and prejudiced <hi>Jury,</hi> who will boggle at nothing tho never so unjust that may but gratisy a <hi>great Man,</hi> and oblige His Majesties <hi>Ministers</hi> of State. And the reason, as I have said before, upon which Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came to be convicted and found guilty, was plainly to skreen a <hi>great Man,</hi> and some other persons from coming to be involved in the guilt of that Noble Man's death, and to keep up the belief of a Protesiant Plot, <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddon's Trial, <hi>p.</hi> 2, 70.</note> 
               <hi>which</hi> (as Justice <hi>Withins</hi> phraseth it) was likely otherwise <hi>to lose its credit, and to be esteemed a Sham Plot for the taking away Innocent Protestants Lives.</hi> Nor was the whole <hi>Trial</hi> against this Worthy and Vertuous Person, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, arbitrary and illegal, than the <hi>Sentence</hi> against him, upon the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> finding him <hi>convict</hi> of the <hi>Indictment,</hi> was unjust and severe. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the condemning him in a Fine of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> which is more than his whole visible Estate amounts unto, and expressly contrary to the Law of the Land, which requires no man shall be <hi>fined</hi> but with a <hi>salvo contenemento.</hi> i. e. the leaving him as much as may support him in some degree answerable to his quality, they have over and above ordered his finding <hi>Sureties for good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour during life,</hi> which as I question whether it be lawful by the ancient and <hi>Common Law</hi> (tho it hath been sometimes practised) any more than it is to condemn a person to perpetual Imprisonment; so I am sure there is no <hi>President</hi> to be found for the like in a matter that was not of a more criminal and heynous Nature. But all serves to prove, that whosoever hath the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or honesty to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

they are affraid to have searched out and detected.</p>
            <p>And as if it were not enough in the judgment of all rational men, to acquit and vindicate the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> from the guilt and infamy of having destroyed himself, that those have been prosecuted with the utmost s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble modesty towards the Government were willing to inquire into the manner of his death, and to declare their just suspitions, with the grounds of them, to persons trusted with the administration of affairs, that he did not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself, but was assassinated by others: Behold, that as one Crime is not to be concealed but by the perpetration of more, so the Conspirators and Authorisors of that Noble Mans death, have proceeded to the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring several other men, who as they had a perfect knowledge and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension both of the manner of the Fact, the villanous bloody Agents who were immediately instrumental to commit it, and the Persons who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, rewarded, and encouraged them, so they had been guilty of what some will call indiscretion, to communicate to others what they had seen and observed, and too fully understood themselves. Among others who part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saw, heard, and observed themselves, and partly learned from others, several circumstances relating to the matter of my Lord's death, there was one <hi>Meak</hi> a common <hi>Sentinel,</hi> who had stood on duty all that morning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er unto the place and house where the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was confined. For whereas on other days the Sentinels used to stand but two hours at a time on duty, there was care taken that morning, that those who were on duty when the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> came into the Tower, which was about <hi>six</hi> of the clock, should not be changed till both after the time of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, which was about <hi>nine,</hi> and till after the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Dukes</hi> departure from thence, which was about half an hour after. And the reason of this is obvious, namely, that tho it was impossible to keep all persons from seeing who walk't to and fro, and what was transacting, yet they resolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it in as narrow a compass as they could, and to admit as few to an opportunity of observing persons and things as might be. Whence it came to pass, that those <hi>Souldiers</hi> who entred upon <hi>Duty</hi> at <hi>Four,</hi> and should according to course have been relieved at <hi>Six,</hi> were suffered and obliged to stay on till <hi>Ten.</hi> Now this <hi>Meak</hi> having an advantage from the post he was in, of observing the several persons that went that morning to my Lord <hi>Essex</hi>'s Lodgings, and having par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly himself seen, and partly learned from others, divers material particulars, relating to the manner of the Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that Noble Person, it will be easily acknowledged, that he was as capable as any to detect it, or at least of letting these, who should have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42060:22"/>
the honesty, courage, and zeal to enquire after my Lord's death, so far into it as to be able to unravel that whole villany, and to trace it not only to the Instruments, but the original Authors and Contrivers. This poor fellow both abhorring in himself what he had seen, and conceiving the greatest detestation imaginable against all the Villains who had been accessory to it, was neither able to conceal his knowledge of what he had seen, nor his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments of so horrid a Fact, but at the same time had not the prudence to distinguish betwixt persons, who without dammage to the Author, might be entrusted with so important a Secret, and those who at first would seem forward enough to hear it, but would withall make their advantage by revealing it to such as would reward them, and destroy him. Whence it unhappily came to pass that this poor foolish man, not only related it to such as were honest and faithful to him, and who will be ready in due time to testify the whole of what he acquainted them with, but to others who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it to St. <hi>James</hi>'s as a piece of important intelligence, and of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful consequence to his <hi>Royal Highness.</hi> And tho it be not yet seasonable to recount the several particulars relating to that barbarous Murder, which he declared upon his own knowledge, as well as the confirmation of others; yet I may take the liberty to digest and branch them into their several heads, and to let the World know that some of them were such as preceeded his death, others accompanied it, and one or two came after it. Wherefore that he might tell no more stories, nor rise up as a witness against the Assassinates, this poor unfortunate Fellow was secretly murdered and thrown into the Tower Ditch. And there are several particulars relating to his Death; which are not unworthy to be known to the World, but it were to advantage the Conspirators, and to prejudice our selves to mention them at present. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is remarkable, that as this <hi>Robert Meak</hi> was for some time before his death, very apprehensive of the danger he went in of being privately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed for what he had declared concerning the E. of <hi>Essex</hi> being murdered, so he had a greater dread of it the morning before he was killed, than he had been possessed with at any other time. And therefore from that allarm which his mind suggested to him of his impendent danger, he begged of an Acquuaintance and Friend that morning before he died, that he would have accompanied, and kept with him for that day. But such was the poor fellow's fate, that tho he told that person the apprehensions he was in of being mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and he from a sense and belief of it, had left his work with a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to attend him, yet whether from a jealousie he might have of his own safety, or upon what other motive I shall not enquire, he stole away from, and forsook him before <hi>Twelve</hi> of the Clock. But tho the Conspirators and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42060:22"/>
Assassionates had thus by a second murder delivered themselves from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions they were in of being detected for the first; yet there arose an other person, who as he had better opportunity of knowing the whole My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, than <hi>Meak</hi> the Sentinel had; so from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of Conscience for what he had been accessory unto, and from an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency of that bloody Fact, which he so well knew the Authors and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators of, he begun to discourse and communicate it with shame and loathing to others. The person whom I mean was Mr. <hi>Hawley,</hi> a Warder of the Tower, living in <hi>Winchester-street,</hi> being a Person both for Reputation and Estate far above that <hi>Hawley,</hi> in whose house the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was then Prisoner when his Throat was cut, and therefore one without whose knowledge, consent and contribution, it cannot be supposed to have been done. And by how much he was not only more capable than others to detect the whole vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany of the Noble Man's death, and lay open the enormous crime in all the parts and branches of it, but was of better credit than the Sentinel, and more likely to obtain belief from the World in what he should declare, by so much was he to be esteemed for a most dangerous person to the Conspirators, and to be treated as one from whom they might dread the most fatal mischief to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as well as their cause. Hence the intelligence was no sooner conveyed to a <hi>great Man</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Juncto,</hi> that <hi>Hawly</hi> had been talking such things concerning the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, which it concerned them no less than both their Lives and Honours to have concealed; but they resolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him, and thereby prevent his prating for the future, and being able to tell any tales. And being informed that he was inquiring where he might purchase an Estate, they employ one to tempt him out of Town, under pretence of his seeing a parcel of Land that was to be sold. For they thought, that should they cause him to be murdered in or about the City, it would fill all men with jealousies of their being guilty of his death, especially considering the Reports which went of them, and the suspicions that they lay under of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caused <hi>Meak</hi> to be killed. And therefore in order to the getting him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed with the more secrecy, and the administring the less apprehension a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Authors of his death, they prevailed on him by the baite and temptation which I have mentioned, to take a journey into the Countrey. Whence having resolved that he should never return, they employed some to dogg, and others to way-lay and murder him. And with that Secrecy as well as Obedience, were their Orders and Decrees executed, that it was a considerable while after his Death, before he could be heard of, or his Body found. But when after long search and enquiry after him; his <hi>Corps</hi> were at last found, there were all the marks and Symptoms of a most barbarous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassination
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42060:23"/>
prepared upon him, which malicious wit could invent, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged jealousie and revenge act or commit. For besides diverse <hi>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>usions</hi> in the head, face and breast from the blows he had received, it appeared plainly that he had been also strangled. And as he had never administred cause to any other persons save the Conspirators and Instruments of the Earl of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffex</hi>'s death, upon which we can with the least shadow of reason, fancy his being murdered upon a personal and private Revenge; so there are proofs ready to be produced, whensoever either a ParlJament comes, or a fair Trial can be obtained before upright and impartial Judges, not only by whom he was destroyed, but by whose Command and Authority. Nor was his Wife unsensible and without apprehension even before the Body was discovered, both that he might be murdered, and upon what motives and inducements it was done, so that she told some Friends how she dreaded the consequences and effects of his having so often discoursed about the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death. Yea there is one <hi>Glover,</hi> who is a Servant to His Majesty, being at present a <hi>Warder</hi> in the Tower, who being in conference with some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> was pleased with more than an ordinary emotion to say, <hi>Hawley also hath been prating, but he was fain to walk for it.</hi> But the same person being asked after it was known that he had been murdered, what he thought of Mr. <hi>Hawley</hi>'s walking, appeared exceedingly disturbed, and said he knew nothing of it, nor would he have the patience to hear any thing spoken about that matter. So that we have here an other evidence that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> did not, as he hath been defamed and slandered, cut his own Throat, but that this Person of incomparable Merit and Vertue was Massacred by wicked and suborned Ruffians; seeing to prevent the discovery of that heinous and execrable Fact, two other men who had advantages of knowing both the Actors in, and manner of his death, and had talked somewhat freely about it, and seemed inclinable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it, were barbarously killed.</p>
            <p>And as the destroying as well as oppressing those from whom the World might receive light about the murder of that Noble Peer, plainly shews by whose Councels, and by what means, he came to his faral End; so the countenancing, protecting and preferring those, who are justly suspected to have been deeply instrumental in it, and who long ere this would have been publickly indicted for it, (had it not been partly for the discouragement given by the Court, His Majesties Ministers of State and Officers of Justice, and partly not to expose men to that hazard which they must necessarily run by engaging in this affair) affords us a new proof of my Lord's innocency from being <hi>Felo de se,</hi> and that the infamy and guilt of his death ought to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42060:23"/>
be devolved upon others. There are cases wherein suspition of guilt may so wait on some men, that others tho never so well perswaded of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, cannot without forfeiture of discretion, and becoming Sharers in the reproach and dishonour which attends them, give them either the least countenance, or yield them any Testimonies of Favour and Kindness, till they have vindicated and acquitted themselves from that whereof they are suspected, and which common Fame accuseth them of. And as all persons pretending to wisdom, or who are regardful of their reputation, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themselves obliged to act under the conduct and guidance of this Rule and principle; so of all men, those in Authority are most concerned not to take upon them the sheltring of those that are aspersed with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes; nor to countenance and advance such, whom the cry of a Kingdom chargeth with a barbarous, enormous and execrable Fact. But to that impudence in Villany, as well as contempt of honour and credit are the Gentlemen of the Popish <hi>Juncto</hi> and <hi>Cabal</hi> arrived; that they not only cause <hi>secretly</hi> Murther, such as would discover a great and heinous offence against God and Mankind, but they dare <hi>openly</hi> and in the face of the Sun, both protect and prefer the chief Miscreant and Ruffian, whom all sober and impartial persons have in suspition for it. It must necessarily be acknowledged, that in case my Lord was assassinated by violent and and bloody hands, his <hi>Valet de Chamber Romeny</hi> the only Servant who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him in the Tower, save a Footman, must be acquainted with it, and accessory to it. And so many, as well as weighty, were the arguments of his being guilty of his Earl and Master's death, that he was justly suspected for it both by the rest of my Lord's Servants, and all the thinking impartial peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about the Town. And tho I shall have occasion hereafter to mention divers particulars and recount several circumstances, which not only serve to lay him under a suspition, but to convict him of being accessary to the death of his Lord; yet I care not if I relate one at present, namely the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension he was in, and the trouble he expressed to one of the Lady <hi>Essex</hi>'s Gentlewomen, upon a Report which he had heard that my Lord's Murder was to come under a second Examination, and that the Body was to be taken up in order to a review. Nor was the Countess her self, for all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which some great men had endeavoured to possess her with, of my Lord's cutting his own Throat, without strong apprehensions to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor void of jealousie of this <hi>French</hi> Fellow's being guilty of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's death, which made her discharge him her service, and dismiss him out of the Family. And as no Gentlemen in <hi>England</hi> would have after this done so foolish a thing, or so unworthy of himself, as to cherish and entertain
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42060:24"/>
such a Rascal; so it least of all became the honour of the Court, unless there were a further mystery in it than the world is aware of, to take him both into their protection, and to advance him to an employ and place. Let us therefore a little observe and recount what favours this Rascal under all the suspition and infamy of being accessary to his <hi>Lord's</hi> death, hath met with both from his Majesties Ministers of Justice, and from the principal persons at Court, and chiefest Officers of State. Can it be less than a reflexion both upon the honour of the Government, and an insinuation that great men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that horrid fact whereof <hi>Bomeny</hi> is so justly suspected, that my <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> at <hi>Mr. Braddon</hi>'s <hi>Trial,</hi> after he had been affronting, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting and hectoring all the Witnesses for the Defendant, steps in not only to assist and rectifie <hi>Bomeny</hi> in his Deposition, guiding him to say a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi> when the Rogue had said a <hi>Penknife,</hi> but durst represent the Villain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the character <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddons Trial, <hi>p.</hi> 55, 61.</note> 
               <hi>of one whose integrity and fidelity to my Lord, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by six years experience of his service, and that he was not an upstart and wandering fellow.</hi> Yea, the esteem that this Ruffian was in with our Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, and which by consequence proves that there is a Mystery in the manner of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, which is not yet fully discovered, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these who are deservedly suspected to have been accessary to it, are favoured and befriended by them, may be further enlightned and confirmed from the correspondence which <hi>Bomeny</hi> had with the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> when he lay concealed from others, and the readiness he expressed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with any that pretended to enquire for him in Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkin</hi>'s name, when he was denied to every body besides. For a certain person having occasion to call at his Lodging in order to <hi>Subpaena</hi> him to Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial, and being positively told that there was no such man there, took the boldness to say he came from Sir <hi>Lionel;</hi> upon which <hi>Bomeny</hi> immediately appeared, and he who was said not to be there before, stept forth with all imaginable readiness to receive the <hi>Secretaries</hi> Messenger, and to know what his Honour's pleasure was. And if these two passages which I have related, be not enough to evidence the kindness which his Majesties Ministers had for this little and Infamous creature, I shall subjoin a third importing the care which the greatest about the Court took of him, and the respect they shew him. For when he seemed to be abandoned by all others, and knew not where to be admitted into a service, by reason of the suspition he lay under of being either an instrument that murdered his Lord, or who had consented to the doing of it, behold a great man, and the <hi>Officers</hi> of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Forces, embrace him under all that ignominy and reproach, and list

him to ride in one of the <hi>Troops</hi> of <hi>Guards.</hi> Nor is it possible for any man without renouncing his Reason, to imagine, that that Great Man; as well as divers other persons of Figure and Quality, should expose themselves to the censure of the world in entertaining a Fellow judged guilty of so enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and abominable a crime, unless they themselves had been accessory some way or other to that execrable wickedness, and except they judged the Rascal to have merited by the Fact.</p>
            <p>But to put it beyond all possibility of any rational contradiction that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> did not <hi>cut</hi> his own <hi>Throat,</hi> but that he was massacred by others, I shall demonstrate the impossibility of it as the manner of his death is represented in the <hi>Coroners Inquisition,</hi> and declared in the <hi>Depositions</hi> of the <hi>Chyrurgions,</hi> who view'd the Body, and searched and examined the fatal wound. And where there is a Natural Impossibility that a thing should be so or so done, all the Informations of the world to the contrary serve to no other end but to declare the perjury of the informers. A matter that is naturally impracticable ought not to be credited, tho never so many should have the impudence to swear they saw it done. But as the rage of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators</hi> and <hi>Assassinates</hi> transported and hurried them to commit the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Fact in such a manner, that all who have not abjured common sense as well as Reason, must acknowledg that it was not practicable in that way and manner, or a thing that could be done by the Earl of <hi>Ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And how conspicuous is the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as well as Righteousness of God, in infatuating villanous men, so to accomplish and perpetrate their villanies, as that their folly shall detect their guilt, and the Marks and Characters of stupidity as well as rage left upon the Fact shall reveal the Authors of it, let them do all they can to transfer and abdicate it from themselves, and to charge and fassen it upon others. Now the <hi>Coroners Inquest</hi> in their <hi>Inquisition</hi> made the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1683 concerning the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> death, do upon their Oaths from the Depositions of such witnesses as they thought fit to examine, give us this account of the way and manner of it. That the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex being the</hi> 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42060:25"/>
Jugular to the other, and by the Aspera Arteria, and the Wind-pipe to the vertebres of the Neck, both the Jugulars being throughly divided, of which said mortal Wound, the said Earl of Essex instantly died.</hi> And to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count so far as relates to the Nature of the Wound, do the <hi>Informations</hi> upon Oath of <hi>Robert Sherwood</hi> and <hi>Robert Andrews,</hi> two <hi>Chyrurgions</hi> called to view the Body of the said <hi>Earl</hi> fully agree. For <hi>Robert Sherwood</hi> swears, <hi>That having viewed the Threat of the Earl of</hi> Essex, <hi>he finds that there is a large wound, and that the</hi> Aspera Arteria <hi>or Wind pipe, and the Gullet, with the Jugular Arteries are all divided.</hi> And <hi>Robert Andrews</hi> deposeth to the same purpose, namely, <hi>That having viewed the Throat of the Lord of</hi> Essex, <hi>he found that it was cut from one Jugular to the other, and through the Wind-pipe and Gullet into the Vertebres of the Neck, both Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Veins being also quite divided.</hi> And as the first thing observable in the <hi>Coroners Inquest</hi> about my Lords death, is that his Throat was cut with a <hi>Razor,</hi> so it is needful the world should know that the <hi>Razor</hi> which <hi>Bomeny</hi> in his <hi>Deposition</hi> before the said <hi>Inquest,</hi> swears to be the same wherewith he gave himself the fatal and mortal wound, was a small <hi>French Razor</hi> of about <hi>four Inches</hi> and <hi>half long</hi> at most, without any <hi>Spill</hi> or <hi>Tongue</hi> at the end of the <hi>Blade,</hi> as all <hi>Razors</hi> of the English Form and Fashion have: So that the <hi>Razor</hi> being of that make, proportion, and extent, it is as evident as any demonstrated <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem</hi> in <hi>Euclid,</hi> that it could not be used but upon holding it by the Blade; and that in order to the holding it with strength and steddiness requisite to the making such a wound, the Fingers and Hand must grasp and fasten upon no less than <hi>two Inches</hi> of it. The second thing remarkable from the <hi>Inquisition</hi> of the <hi>Coroner,</hi> and the <hi>Depositions</hi> of the <hi>Cbyrurgions</hi> refers to the <hi>extent</hi> and <hi>dimension</hi> of this deplorable and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>wound.</hi> Which as they all acknowledg to have reached from <hi>Jugular</hi> to <hi>Jugular</hi> in <hi>length,</hi> and to the <hi>vertebrae</hi> of the <hi>Neck</hi> in <hi>depth;</hi> so a certain Gentleman who saw the wound before ever the <hi>Jury</hi> did, affirms that it begun at the side of the <hi>Neck Bone</hi> behind the <hi>left jugular,</hi> and extended to the <hi>Bone</hi> of the <hi>Neck</hi> beyond the <hi>right,</hi> being betwixt eight and nine inches in dimension from one side to the other, and that it so nearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached unto, and pierced into the <hi>vertebrae</hi> that had it light on a <hi>joint</hi> it would have <hi>cut</hi> off his <hi>Head</hi> instead of merely <hi>cutting</hi> his <hi>Throat.</hi> And I may upon what is here confessed and sworn, confidently say, That no man could cut his own Throat after the rate and manner, and to that measure and extent, that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s was cut. Nor did I ever speak with <hi>Physician</hi> or <hi>Chyrurgeon,</hi> who was so far above the dread of the <hi>Court</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi>'s as to dare venture the giving his opinion, but he would
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42060:25"/>
readily acknowledg and confirm it with unanswerable reasons, that it was impossible the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> should have given himself that mortal wound, or cut his Throat in the manner it appears to have been done? For the <hi>Razor</hi> being in the whole length but <hi>four inches</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> and <hi>two inches</hi> of these being necessary at the least to be held and grasped in the hand in order to the using and managing of it; it is not imaginable how with the other two Inches and a half both the Jugulars could be divided at one stroke, and a gash made which extended no less than Eight Inches from one side to the other. There is no man that is versed in <hi>Chyrurgery</hi> or the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the humane Body, but will find himself obliged to own, that it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impossible that after the cutting the <hi>one Jugular,</hi> there should remain life and strength for carrying forward the wound to the dividing the <hi>other.</hi> Nor can there be any thing more certain in Nature, than that there would have been such an effusion of Spirits and Blood upon dividing the <hi>first Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> that all life and motion would have immediately ceased, and that there would have been no strength left to push forward the instrument to the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> so as to dissect it. Besides there being no more of the <hi>Razor</hi> beyond the hand which held the <hi>Razor,</hi> than about <hi>two inches</hi> and a <hi>half</hi> of the blade that could be used and applied to the making the incision in the Throat; How is it possible that a Gash or Wound of four Inches deep (for of that dimension it was from the outside of the <hi>Gullet,</hi> where the hand must lye, to the <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae</hi> of the Neck where the incision terminated) could be made by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of <hi>two inches</hi> and a <hi>half</hi> long? These being plain and direct impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities, it necessarily follows that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> did not destroy himself, but that this hellish Murder was committed upon him by the hands of bloody and hired Ruffians. Nor indeed was a <hi>Razor</hi> the Instrument which they made use of upon this villanous occasion, but it was done by one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind, as well as form and figure, and which as they had prepared and provided on purpose, so it was much more convenient for the perpetration of the Fact. But it would have too palpably betrayed the Actors, to have suffered that to have lain by the massacred Body, or to have let it be seen by any honest and indifferent persons who might throng in among others to view and look upon the bleeding Corps. And of all the Instruments which they could have thought upon, a <hi>Razor,</hi> especially of the fashion which that was, that they threw down by my Lord's Body after they had Murdered him, was the most unfit for an incision in the Throat of those dimensions, as the wound whereby they treacherously killed him evidently appears to have been. A certain Gunner in the Tower, who may be supposed not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a stranger to this affair, pitched upon a more convenient and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42060:26"/>
proper Instrument for the doing of it, when about Nine of the Clock that morning he reported the death of my Lord in a place not-far distant from thence, saying, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had cut his Throat with a <hi>Case Knife</hi> wherewith he had been carving a Pidgeon for his Breakfast. And had they not been infatuated, they would have rather ordered such an Instrument to have been laid by the Body in order to blind and deceive the World about the manner of his death, than the small <hi>French Raz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> which I have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and by which they have endeavoured to make men believe the gastful and fatal wound was made. But if a <hi>ParlJament</hi> come to sit again in <hi>England,</hi> or if His Majesty will grant a Pardon to such Witnesses, as we are ready to produce, and allow a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Melius Inquirendum</hi> concerning the death of this Noble <hi>Peer</hi> before equal and impar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>al Judges, we shall both describe the Instrument he was killed by, and prove the truth of what we say, by persons who saw the whole Bloody and Tragical transaction, and are as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessories too far concerned in that horrid Murder.</p>
            <p>Nor want there proofs of my Lords being treacherously Assassinated by others, and that he was not a <hi>Felon</hi> of himself, from the Testimonies of these very Witnesses which were produced both before the <hi>Coroners Inquest,</hi> and at Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi>'s Trial, to Swear that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had cut his own Throat. And tho it may be pardonable in the <hi>Coroner</hi> upon the <hi>Inquisition</hi> into the manner of my <hi>Lord</hi>'s death, to have admitted the <hi>Depositions</hi> of <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Russel,</hi> there being not then so just suspitions of their guilt in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as afterwards there were; yet for my <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> to allow them as competent Witnesses in that affair, when the presumptions of their being accessory to that Murder were so strong, as they plainly appeared from the whole scope and tendency of that which was sworn, said, and alledged in Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s behalf at the foresaid Trial, was the greatest affront imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Justice, and argued a most criminal partiality. For with what equity could <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Testimony be admitted to destroy either the Truth or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of my Lord's being assassinated by others, seeing it must be granted that in case the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was treacherously Murdered, <hi>Bomeny</hi> being the only Servant who then waited upon him, must be an Actor in, or at least an Accessory to it. And what is this, but to admit a fellow under the highest presumptions of guilt to be a witness in his own Cause, and to allow his Testimony as a sufficient vindication from the most perfidious, as well as barbarous Crime that could be committed; and which to have acknowledged, would have derived upon him the severest punishment? And the same may be said of my <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi>'s partiality and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness, in suffering <hi>Russel</hi>'s <hi>Testimony</hi> to pass for good and legal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42060:26"/>
in the matter and case that we are discoursing of. For <hi>Russel</hi> being the Person who, that morning my Lord was murdered, attended upon him as his <hi>Warder,</hi> must likewise have been either an Actor in, or Accessory to, the cruelty that was committed on him. Nor can it be otherwise thought than that he who contrary to the Duty of his Place, and the trust reposed in him instead of assisting and defending my <hi>Lord,</hi> when forcibly assaulted, would consent unto, or at least connive at the Violence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon him, should also for the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It hath always been admitted as a sufficient ground of disbelieving Winesses, and of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Swear falsely, when their Testimonies instead of being either harmonious and coherent in themselves, or consonant and agreeable one to another, do both interfere with, and contradict themselves and each other. For as Truth is always uniform and consistent, so Falshood is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious and various. Now that this may the better appear, and that all Men may see, I do neither impose upon the Witnesses, nor endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world, I shall transcribe the two <hi>Informations</hi> which were Sworn by <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Russel</hi> before the <hi>Coroner</hi> and the <hi>Inquest,</hi> when they sat on my <hi>Lords Body</hi> upon an <hi>Inquisition</hi> after the manner of his Death, and by what means he came to his fatal End. <hi>Paul Bomeny</hi> in his <hi>Deposition</hi> made upon Oath the 14 of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. saith, That <hi>when my Lord came to Captain</hi> Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley<hi>'s, which was the eleventh of that month, my Lord ask'd him for a Penknife to pare his Nails as he was wont to do; to which the Informant answered, being come in hast he had not brought it, but he will send for one; and accordingly sent the Footman with a No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42060:27"/>
Essex <hi>was up, the Informant sent the Footman home with a Note to the Steward, in which amongst other things he ask'd for a Penknife for my Lord, and when the Footman was gone, about a little after 8. of the Clock, my Lord sent one Mr.</hi> Russel <hi>his Warder to the Informant, who came and ask'd him if the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife was come; to which the Informant said no my Lord, but I shall have it by and by: to which my Lord said, that he should bring him one of his Razors, it would do as well; and then the Informant went and fetched one, and gave it my Lord, who went then to pare his Nails, and then the Informant went out of the Room into the Passage by the door on</hi> Friday <hi>the 13, and begun to talk with the Warder, and a little while after he went down Stairs, and soon after came the Footman with the Provisions, and brought also a Penknife, which the Informant put upon his Bed, and thought my Lord had no more need of it, because he thought he had paired his Nails, and then the Informant came up to my Lords Chamber about 8 or 9 in the Forenoon on</hi> Friday <hi>the 13 of</hi> July, <hi>with a little Note from the Steward, but not finding his Lord in the Chamber, went to the Close-Stool Closet-door and found it shut, and he thinking his Lord was busy there, went down and staid a little, and came up again, thinking his Lord had been come out of the Closet, and finding him not in the Chamber, he knock'd at the Door with his Finger thrice, and said, my Lord; but no body answering, he took up the Hanging, and looking through the chink, he saw Blood, and a part of the Razor, whereupon he called the Warder</hi> Russel, <hi>and went down to call for help, and the said</hi> Russel <hi>pushed the Door open, and there they saw my Lord of</hi> Essex <hi>all along on the Floor without a Periwig, and all full of Blood, and the Razor by him; and the Deponent further deposeth that the Razor now shewed to him at the time of his Examination, is the same Razor which he did bring to my Lord, and which did lye on the Ground in the Closet by my Lord.</hi> To this Information I shall subjoyn that of <hi>Thomas Russel</hi> one of the <hi>Warders</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> who being examined the 14. of <hi>July</hi> 1683. saith, <hi>That on the 13. of the said</hi> July, <hi>about 8 or 9 of the Clock in the Forenoon he was present, when he did hear the Lord of</hi> Essex <hi>call to his Man Mr.</hi> Bomeny <hi>for a Penknife to pare his Nails, and then for a Razor, which Mr.</hi> Bomeny <hi>brought him, and then my Lord went up and down the Room scraping his Nails with the Razor, and shut the outward Door; Mr.</hi> Bomeny <hi>half a quarter of an Hour afterwards not finding my Lord in his Bed-Chamber went down Stairs again believing that my Lord was then private in his Closet.</hi> Bomeny <hi>came up about a quarter of an hour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and knock'd at the door, and then called, My Lord, My Lord, but he not answering, peep'd through a chink of the door, and did see the Earl of</hi> Essex <hi>lying on the Ground in the Closet, whereupon he did cry out, that my Lord was fallen down Sick, and then the Informant went to the Closet-door, and opened it,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42060:27"/>
the key being on the outside, and then did see my Lord lye down on the ground in his blood, his Throat being cutt.</hi> These are all the informations which the <hi>Inquest</hi> charged and sworn to enquire when, by what means and how <hi>Arthur E.</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> came to his death, thought fit to take, and upon the Depositions of these two Fellows who in case any violence were offered to my Lord must have been accessory to it, they bring in and do say <hi>upon their oaths that the sayd Arthur Earl of Essex did voluntarily and feloniously cut his Throat.</hi> It may indeed seem strange that there being other persons at that time in the house besides <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Russel,</hi> particularly the <hi>Maid servant,</hi> that they should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be examined nor so much as called to know whether they could say any thing in that affair. But it is not improbable that the contradictions in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of the two Witnesses whom they had examined, to one an other, might discourage them from examining any more, least they in what they might swear should contradict what both the former had said. Now what I have to observe concerning the contradictions in the forego'ing <hi>Depositions,</hi> they are either such, wherein these <hi>Informations</hi> are directly contrary to the <hi>reports</hi> which themselves made to others about my Lords death; or they are such, wherein the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> contradicts that of the <hi>other,</hi> or <hi>lastly,</hi> wherein the <hi>Information</hi> of <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same person,</hi> gainsay's and overthrow's it self. For the <hi>first,</hi> whereas both <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Russel</hi> do positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely swear that it was not above a <hi>quarter of an houre and half, from the time that Bomeny left my Lord in his Chamber pareing his Nailes, to the time that they found him dead in the Closet;</hi> yet this very <hi>Bomeny</hi> being ask'd the Question by <hi>one</hi> of my <hi>Lords Family</hi> soon after his death, how long my <hi>Lord</hi> might have lyen dead before either <hi>he</hi> or the <hi>Warder</hi> discovered it, replyed that he believed he must have lyen so above <hi>two hours</hi> for that when they first found him the Body was cold and stiff. And whereas <hi>Russel</hi> deposeth that <hi>the Razor was given by Bomeny to my Lord after he was up and about eight or nine of the clock in the forenoon, and that both he and Bomeny inform how they saw his Lordship upon the delivery of the Razor to him apply to the pareing of his Nailes;</hi> yet this Rogue <hi>Bomeny</hi> having the property of lyars namely the want of a good memory, affirmed to a person of good credit and who is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to depose it upon Oath, that from the time of his sending away the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with a Note to the Steward (which was about or before <hi>six)</hi> that morning on which the <hi>Earl</hi> died, he did not see my <hi>Lord</hi> till the time that he found him killed and wallowing in his blood in the Closet. And whereas there is not one word in <hi>Bomenies Information</hi> concerning my Lords being used to be taken with sudden <hi>Frensical</hi> passions and fitts, or that he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly taken with one that morning before his death, but the contrary
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42060:28"/>
plainly insinuated in the whole <hi>Information</hi> and also acknowledged at Mr. <hi>Braddon's Trial,</hi> where tho he says, that <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddons Trial <hi>p.</hi> 45.</note> 
               <hi>my Lord was melancholy, yet he adds they took no notice of it, nor had reason to suspect any thing more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary;</hi> all which directly contradicts what the Villain told an Eminent Dr. of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> namely that his Lord <hi>was frequently taken with sudden Frensical passions, and in particular with one that morning just before his death.</hi> For said the perjured Rascal, <hi>when the Earl of</hi> Essex <hi>saw my Lord</hi> Russel <hi>carried out of the Tower to be Tryed, he struck his Breast, and said himself was the cause of my Lord</hi> Russel<hi>'s misery, seeing had it not been for him, my Lord</hi> Russel <hi>would never have admitted my Lord</hi> Howard <hi>into his company. And that thereupon seeing my Lord</hi> Russel <hi>like to be ruined by the Testimony of that person for whose integrity he had engaged his Honour, he fell destracted.</hi> Now as this is directly repugnant, to the Testimony which his own Lady and all other persons who had the advantage of being known to his Lordship do justly give him, affirming that he was the most sedate, best composed, and freest from passions of all men they ever knew, so there is not one word of it in his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> to the <hi>Coroners Inquest,</hi> tho' it would have been a stronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my <hi>Lords</hi> murdering himself, than all that he deposed or swore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. Truth being ever the same, whosoever is called to testifie a Truth that falls within his knowledg, can give the same account of it a thousand times over without the least variation from it, or from himself; but a <hi>Lie</hi> having no foundation save what it has in the invention of the Author, easily escapes the memory, and lay's the Reporter as often as he is called to repeat and declare it, under a continual liableness of inventing either some thing new that was not, or which is different to what was in his former report, so that by the last Fiction he both detects and discredits the first. But <hi>secondly,</hi> as the <hi>Informations</hi> of these two <hi>Witnesses,</hi> interfere with the Reports which themselves gave concerning my <hi>Lords</hi> Death to other persons, so the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the one does directly contradict and supplant the Testimony of the other. For whereas <hi>Bomeny</hi> positively swears, <hi>that on the 12. of</hi> July <hi>in the morning before my Lord of</hi> Essex <hi>was up, be sent the Footman home with a Note to the Steward, in which among other things he ask'd for a Penknife for my Lord, and that when the Footman was gone, about or a little after eight of the Clock, my Lord sent</hi> Russel <hi>the Warder to the said</hi> Bomeny, <hi>who came and ask'd him if the Penknife was come, to which</hi> Bomeny <hi>replyed, no my Lord, but I shall have it by and by, and that thereupon my Lord bid him bring him one of his Razors, which he went and fetched and gave to his Lordship, who applyed himself there
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42060:28"/>
with to pair his Nailes; Russel</hi> in a direct contradiction to this, swears, that <hi>on the 13. of July about 8 or 9 of the Clock in the Forenoon, he was present when he did hear the Lord of Essex call to his Man Bomeny for a Penknife to pare his Nailes, and then for a Razor which Bomeny brought him, and that thereupon my Lord went up and down the Room scraping his Nailes with the Razor.</hi> So that whil'st <hi>Bomeny</hi> deposed upon Oath that my <hi>Lord</hi> called for the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, and had it delivered to him on the 12 of July being <hi>Thursday</hi> and the day before my Lords death; <hi>Russel</hi> comes and swears, that it was on the 13 of July being <hi>Friday,</hi> and the day on which my Lord was killed, that he ask'd for the Razor and received it from his man. We may with the same ease bring the <hi>Time Past,</hi> to be the <hi>Time present</hi> or <hi>Future;</hi> as make the 12 of July, upon which <hi>Bomenie</hi> swears he gave my Lord the Razor, to be the 13 of July, on which <hi>Russel</hi> swears it was delivered to him. And tho this be such a dissagreement in their Testimonies, that no wise and unbiaz'd person can give credit to what either of them sayes, but is in justice obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that both of them swore falsely; yet it is not the only thing wherein their Depositions contradict one another, there being a second thing, and as important as the former, wherein the Information of the on lyes in a full contrariety to the Information of the other. For whereas <hi>Bomeny</hi> swears <hi>that Russel push'd the closet door open where my Lord lay,</hi> which implyes his using violence and force to get in; <hi>Russel</hi> comes and deposeth that <hi>being called by Bomenie, he went to the Closet door and opend it the Key being on the outside.</hi> Nor it is possibl' to reconcile what the one sayes in this particular, to what is declared by the other, unless we can make the unlocking the door with the key, to be the same with the bursting it open in a forcibl' way. Yea as if it were not sufficient to demonstrate the falsehood of both their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that they do expressly contradict one another in two important and weighty particulars; there is yet a third wherein their <hi>Informations</hi> do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cross and thwart each other. For whereas <hi>Bomeny</hi> swears <hi>that upon looking through the Chink of the Closet door, he saw blood and a part of the Razor,</hi> without making mention of his seeing <hi>my Lords Body or any part of it; Russel</hi> comes and deposeth <hi>that Bomenie upon peeping through a Chink of the door, saw the Earl of Essex lying on the ground in the Closet,</hi> without adding any thing of his <hi>having seen blood, and a part of the Razor.</hi> Now besides that <hi>Russel</hi> swears a thing positively, which at most he could only swear upon <hi>Bomenie's</hi> Info<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; here is also a dissagreement between the account of what <hi>Bomenie</hi> say's he saw, and that which <hi>Russel</hi> affirm's him to have seen. The two <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> who in the Apocryphal History are reported to have sworn falsely a gainst <hi>Susanna,</hi> did not more evidently, nor in so many particulars inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42060:29"/>
with and contradict one another, as these two Fellows <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Russel</hi> appear to have don'in their Testimonies concerning the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> death. But alaz! we have not been hitherto so happy as to have this pretended crime of my Lord <hi>Essex's</hi> cutting his Throat, to fall under the examination and cognisance of persons of that integrity and uprightness as well as wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which the calumnious accusation of uncleanness fastned upon <hi>Susan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> had the fortune to do. And as the Informations of these two Rascals do plainly contradict each other; so in the <hi>last</hi> place we shall observe how <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same Witness</hi> does in his <hi>Deposition</hi> thwart and gainsay himself. For whereas <hi>Bomenie</hi> swears <hi>that on Thursday the 12. of Iu'y he gave the Razor to my Lord, who thereupon went to pare his Nailes with it;</hi> he immediately adds without the least congrnity either to <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Grammer,</hi> that he the said <hi>Bomenie</hi> having given my Lord the Razor, <hi>went out of the room into the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage by the door on Fryday the</hi> 13. Nothing can be more aparent then that the for'go'ing part of the Information relates wholly to Thursday; but at last without any regard in himself to what he said, or relation in the next words to those which preceded, Friday is brought in contrary both to all Rules of Syntax, and the for'going words of his own Testimony. For what was antecedently deposed referring to what had fallen out and was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted on Thursday, his immediately subjoyning that <hi>Then he went out of the Room into the passage by the door,</hi> ought by all the Rules of Speech and the Measures of Sence to relate to Thursday also. But Friday being the day on which the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was killed, and which as both <hi>Bomenie</hi> and <hi>Russel</hi> swear was soon after his having received the Razor; it was therefore need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that in order to the giving some glose to that part of their Information wherein they swear my Lord cutt his own Throat, that Friday should be mentioned tho with never so much incongruity and absurdness. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous is the righteousness of God in suffering a villain who had first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the murdering his <hi>Master,</hi> if not assisted in it, and then undertaken to transferr' the crime and infamy from the Assassinates and charge it upon his innocent Lord, so evidently to contradict himself in what he swears, as thereby to affoord the world an uncontroulabl' demonstration both of the falshood of his own Deposition, and of his Masters being guiltless of what he accused him.</p>
            <p>And as the many contradictions of one kind and another, which occurr' in the informations of the Witnesses, do as so many prints and Footsteps lead and conduct us to other Authors and Instruments of my <hi>Lords</hi> death than himself, so the many <hi>irregularities</hi> which were committed about the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ody by those who had the oversight and custody of it, before the <hi>Coroner's
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42060:29"/>
Inquest</hi> had sat upon it, administer unto us new <hi>proofs</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was not <hi>Felo de se,</hi> but that he was treacherously and barbarously murdered by the hands of bloody and suborned <hi>Ruffians.</hi> By the <hi>custome</hi> of all Nations which is equivalent to a common and Universal Law, but most especially by the known and alwaise practiced <hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the Body of a person found dead and supposed to have come to an untimely End, ought (if it be possibl') to lye in the place and posture that it is found, till the <hi>Coroners Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> have sat upon the Body and inquired into the manner of the persons death. Nor can we think that those in the House, where my Lord was killed and found dead, could be ignorant of this custom', seeing it is so well and universally known to the meanest and most ignorant people of the Nation. Neither is there any thing more adapted and proper, as well as needful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a discovery whether a person have fallen by his own hands or the hands of others, than this received custome and practice is upon many frequent and repeated experiences found to have been. For how many circumstances not only may but do often occurr' from an observation of the Site and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture wherein the Body is found, from an inspection of the marks, tokens, and impressions left upon the Cloaths which the party destroyed wore, and from a view of the Footsteps, Symtom's, and Signes, which the place where the Fact was committed and the Body fell may yield and afford; all which may have their usefulness and tendency to give light unto the Jury that is to sit upon the Body, and whose Du'ty and Office it is to make inquiry into the manner of the persons death. But least the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> should have been found to have come to his End after an other manner, and by other way's and means, than was safe or convenient for some people to have known and believed, therefor' were all things otherwise carried, and the custom' of the Nation in cases of this Nature not only neglected and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but with the greatest impudence imaginabl' violated and acted contrary unto. For besides their taking my <hi>Lords Body</hi> out of the <hi>Closet</hi> where it was found and by consequence ought to have lyen, they did not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, stripp, and wash it; but also wash both the <hi>Closet</hi> where it was found, and the lodging chamber into and through which we must suppose the persons to have come, if any assassination was by the violent hands of others committed upon him. Yea and as if all this had not been too daring in it self, and enough to administer a just suspition to all mankind of some villany perpetrated upon the person of this Nobl' <hi>Lord;</hi> they proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even to the carrying away the very Cloaths which they would not so much as allow the <hi>Jury</hi> to see, tho some of the <hi>Coroners Inquest</hi> had the wit and seeming ingenuity as to call for them. I do not affirm nor would I have
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42060:30"/>
it thought, that all these irregularities were committed before the <hi>Coroner</hi> himself saw the Body, for I have been well informed and am fully satisfied to the contrary, and have reason to believe that he was prevailed upon to consent and give way to the do'ing of these absurd and illegal things. But that which I assert and which will be proved if occasion be, both by the several members of the <hi>Jury</hi> it self, and by diverse other persons who saw the Body before the time of the <hi>Coroners inquisition,</hi> is that these irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were committed and done, ere ever the <hi>Jury,</hi> who were to be the jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the manner of my Lord <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, were admitted or indeed could be to the sight of the <hi>Corps.</hi> For as the <hi>Coroners Inquest</hi> neither sat upon, nor saw the Body till the 14 of <hi>July</hi> in the forenoon; so all these irregular things had been don' the 13 being the same day on which my <hi>Lord</hi> was killed. Now besides many other circumstances which the <hi>Jury</hi> might have observed dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of and serving to discover the manner of my Lord <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, had all things been suffered to remain as they were at the moment when his Body was found, and as they ought according to the custome of the Kingdom and the practice in all cases of that Nature to have done, there would have appeared <hi>three</hi> remarkabl' things to them, which had served to convince all men who had a spark of Reason or degree of honesty, that this great and honorabl' <hi>Peer</hi> did not destroy himself, but was Massacred by hired and suborned Ruffians. The <hi>first</hi> whereof would have been the <hi>print of a bloody foot upon one of my Lords Stockins,</hi> which seeing it could not be an impression made by himself, must necessarily have been the effect of a most perfidious cruelty exercised upon him by others. Nor is this a fiction of mine raised to vindicate the memory of the E. of <hi>Essex</hi> from the guilt and infamy of so base and enormous a Crime, nor given out to baffle and discredit the belief of the late Plot, and deliver the Conspirators from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and danger which that pretended Combination had derived upon them, much less is it invented to defame the King, cast an aspersion upon the Government and enflame the Nation, but there are ey' Witnesses ready to swear it; and one as remote from all likelihood of being the Author of a groundless and <hi>Romantick</hi> Fabl' as any man, affirmed it before the <hi>Coroner</hi> and <hi>Jury</hi> when they sat upon an Inquisition into the manner of my <hi>Lords</hi> death. For <hi>Samuel Peck</hi> a Servant of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s, and who had just brought the provisions which <hi>Bomeny</hi> by my <hi>Lords</hi> Order had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the <hi>Steward</hi> for, as the perfidious Rascal was running down Stairs crying out that my Lord had killed himself, and that he had found his Body dead in the Closet, did thereupon being surprised by <hi>Bomenies</hi> report run up into the Chamber, where he saw <hi>his Master lying in the Closet with a great
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42060:30"/>
part of his Leggs reaching out of the Closet door, and the print of a bloody foot upon one of his Stockins,</hi> which so far convinced this honest and unbiaz'd man of violence committed upon the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s person, that he immediately cryed out <hi>they have murdered my Lord.</hi> Nor is <hi>Peck</hi> the only Witness whom we can produce to testifie this, but there are others also ready to confirm it upon Oath, whensoever his Majesty will be pleased to take them into his protection and indemnifie them from the accession they are guilty of to that horrid and bloody murder. But before I dimiss <hi>Peck,</hi> there is one thing further observabl', namely that having among other things brought wine for my Lords own drinking, <hi>Russel</hi> and others of that fellow's stamp and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion who stood by, fell a jeering the poor man, telling him the wine came too late for my Lord to drink, but that he had brought it very seasonably for his Funeral. Nor is this the only circumstance which would have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded the <hi>Coroners Jury</hi> matter of evidence and light as to the manner of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> death, had not the Body been medled with, but suffered to continue in the place and posture as it fell; but there would have appeared a <hi>second circumstance</hi> of as great importance and signification in it self, and as serviceabl' as the former to have discovered the barbarous violence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon this innocent and excellent person. For not only <hi>Mary Johnson</hi> the woman who was then Servant in the <hi>Warders</hi> house where my Lord was a prisoner, and who affirms that she saw my Lords Body as soon as either <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meny</hi> or <hi>Russel</hi> did, but several other persons besides her, have confessed <hi>that the Neck or midd'l of my Lords Cravat was cut in four pieces.</hi> Surely if my Lord (as <hi>Bomeny</hi> tells us) had taken off his periwig and hung it up, because as the Villain would have the world believe, he could not so conveniently have cut his Throat with the <hi>Periwig</hi> on, he would for the same reason have much rather laid aside his <hi>Cravat,</hi> being no less than three times about his Neck, and more apt to hinder the accomplishment of that unnatural Fact which the infidous and perjured Rascal hath endeavoured to father upon him, than the <hi>Periwig</hi> was. And therefor' as it is unreasonabl' to think other wise, but that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> would have lay'd by his <hi>Cravat,</hi> had he designed to commit that violence upon himself; so it gives just suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he was assassinated by others that his <hi>Cravat</hi> was about his Neck, and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> thorough in so many places. And whensoever this affair' of my Lord of <hi>Essex's</hi> death comes to be admitted to a fair and indifferent hearing, and a pardon vouchsaf'd to such as shall give evidence, it will be fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the bloody Miscreants came provided and furnished with an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was able to conquer the resistance, which a Cravat, tho thrice rolled about the Neck was abl' to give it. And whereas one <hi>Webster Bayliff</hi> of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42060:31"/>
the Tower liberty, being a person who assisted <hi>Mary Johnson</hi> in stripping my Lords Body, hath pretended to some that it was he who cutt the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat as not being abl' readily to untye it; this may be easily demonstrated to be a story purposely forged towards the avoiding the suspition, which the circumstance of the Cravats being cutt by the same Instrument and stroke that gave my Lord the fatal and deadly wound, would have both begotten and cherished in the Minds of unbiaz'd Men. For besides that <hi>Mary Johnson</hi> who in conjunction with <hi>Webster</hi> stripp'd the Body, hath often asserted the contrary to this which <hi>Webster</hi> reports and gives out, it was not possibl' that the Cravat should be thrice about my Lords Neck when the wound and Gash was made from the Neck Bone behind the one jugular to the Neck Bone behind the other jugular; and not at all cutt or touched by the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith that large and deadly wound was given. And as my Lords Cravat could not be tyed harder than he tyed it himself, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of some violent hand that had endeavoured to choak him with it to hinder and prevent his crying out; so we cannot suppose that my Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had tyed it so hard, but that it might have been easily loosed and untyed without cutting of it. And as it was impossibl' that my Lords Neck should swell after the Gullet and both the jugulars were cutt, which if it could have don' might have been a means and occasion of the Cravats being more strait' and closs about his Neck, so no rational man can apprehend, but that had it been never so strait', they would have taken pains and found a way to untye it, especially having a prospect of enjoying it themselves, it being usual in <hi>England</hi> that they who stripp a dead Body are recompenced with the gift and possession of all the Cloaths which they find about it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for' as <hi>Websters</hi> pretending to have cutt the Cravat when he assisted in stripp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body, is both a confirmation that it was about my Lords Neck when he was killed, and that it was cutt into so many pieces as I have declared; so the having made it evident that this pretence of <hi>Webster</hi> as to his cutting the Cravat at such a time is a forgery and fiction of his own, I may from the whole very justifiably conclude, that this Report was invented to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the evidence and light which this circumstance would have given into the manner of my Lord <hi>Essex's</hi> death, and to prevent the questioning such as might thereupon have been suspected and apprehended for assassinating and murdering that vertuous and Nobl' Peer. But besides the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go'ing circumstances which would have served to detect the manner of my Lords death, and the violence which had been used to bring him to his unti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely End, there was a Third of as great weight and moment as either of them, which had the Body been suffered to continue in the place, posture,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42060:31"/>
and condition as it fell, would have clearly discovered the perjury of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meny</hi> and <hi>Russel,</hi> and wonderfully contributed to the unvailing and laying open the whole Mystery of this barbarous murder. For whereas both <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Russel</hi> not only swear <hi>that the Closet door where my Lord fell, was lock'd when they came up to it, but that upon opening the door they found him lying all along on the Closet Floor; Peck</hi> the Servant that had brought the provisions to my <hi>Lord</hi> just as <hi>Bomeny</hi> pretended to have found him dead, and who upon <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s meeting him on the stairs and telling him that my <hi>Lord</hi> had killed himself, run immediately into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is ready to depose upon Oath that <hi>he saw the Earl of</hi> Essex<hi>'s Body lying in the Closset with a great part of his leggs without the Closet door.</hi> Which Testimony as it shews the falshood of those two Rascals <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in swearing that the Closet door was lock'd when they came first up to it; so it ought to have credit given thereunto, as proceeding from one that could hope for no advantage by telling a lie, nor fear any danger from declaring the Truth, while on the contrary <hi>Russel</hi> and <hi>Bomeny</hi> were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned and brib'd to attest a forged story, and knew themselves liable to be hanged for their accession to my Lord's murder, had they related the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it really was. Yea this posture wherein <hi>Peck</hi> declares he found my <hi>Lord</hi>'s Body, namely, three quarters of it lying in the Closet, and one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of it, must have awakened the Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y had they seen it in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to suspect and apprehend, that some preceding violence had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his person near the Closet door. But as the removing and stripping the Body, and washing both it and the two Rooms before ever the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner</hi>'s <hi>Inquest</hi> was admitted either to see it, or to view those places where the <hi>Tragedy</hi> had been acted, deprived them of the knowledge of the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That which we advance unto in the next place, as fresh matter of proof that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was not <hi>Felo de se,</hi> but that he perished by the violent hands of bloody Assassinates, ariseth <hi>partly</hi> from the carriage of the Jury it self, which was trusted with the Inquisition into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Death, and who as men of little Sense or Reason, and of less Justice and Honesty, gave in upon Oath, <hi>that he did voluntarily and feloniously

               </hi> thing that occurs in the carriage of the <hi>Jury,</hi> which makes it suspected that even they did judge the manner of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death a business of too much hazard to enquire narrowly into, was their <hi>partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in examining those few Witnesses which they called before them, and their giving too hasty and undeserved credit to two Fellows of whom they had reason to be jealous as interested in that murder, against the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an honest and unbiass'd person. With what not only coldness but apparent loathness to be truly informed, did they examine <hi>Peck,</hi> as if they had dreaded to hear any thing which might shake their belief of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s having killed himself, or which might oblige them to accuse and charge others with the guilt of his murder, while in the mean time they greedily hearkned to whatsoever <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Russel</hi> swore, tho' stuft with all the inconsistencies and contradictions imaginable? How little esteem and value did they set upon the information of poor <hi>Peck,</hi> tho' they could not but know that he was a man whom none could have endeavoured to prepossess, and who was neither under the influence of hope or fear to testifie any thing but what he saw; while in the <hi>interim</hi> they paid an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite faith to the self and one another contradicting depositions of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meny</hi> and <hi>Russel,</hi> whom they might easily have suspected not only to have been prompted and taught what they were to say, but to have been both deterred by the apprehension of punishment from declaring the Truth, and sway'd by Rewards to swear and publish a Falshood? But there is a <hi>Second</hi> thing wherein the <hi>Jury</hi> were partial and defective in their Enquiry into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, and which by consequence shews that if not all of them, yet some, and they such as conducted the rest, did either know or were jealous of a mystery in the way of that Noble Mans coming to his fatal end, which they were not willing, and judged it not for their interest to dive too far into. For albeit there were more persons than <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi> and <hi>Bomeny</hi> then in the house when my Lord's Throat was cut, yet I do not find that they did, or were willing to examine any others. Now amongst those that were in <hi>Hawley</hi>'s house at that season when that bloody Fact was committed upon this honourable <hi>Peer,</hi> there was one <hi>Mary Johnson,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:42060:32"/>
who amongst many other things which she declares, affirms particularly <hi>that being just entred my Lords Chamber as</hi> Russel <hi>and</hi> Bomeny <hi>were opening the Closet door, she saw the Body as soon as either of them did;</hi> and yet this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom the <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And we have the more reason to complain of the <hi>Juries</hi> neglect, and infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this particular, because she has often reported, and prosesseth her self ready to depose upon Oath, divers things, which are wholly inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with what <hi>Russel</hi> and <hi>Bomeny</hi> have informed. For while they depose <hi>that they found my Lord's Body lying along in the Closet, and the Razor lying by him on the Floor,</hi> this Woman, <hi>Mary Johnson,</hi> both hath and doth still report, that <hi>my Lord of</hi> Essex <hi>was found kneeling on both his knees with his Body leaning against the Wall, and that the Razor was in his hand, the blade being lying upon his Forefinger, and the handle hanging down between that Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and the Thumb.</hi> And while they swear <hi>that it was not above a quarter of an hour and a half, from</hi> Bomeny<hi>'s delivering the Razor to his Master, till the time of their finding him dead in the Closet;</hi> She positively avers and affirms, that <hi>the Body when at first found was cold and st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ff,</hi> which it could not be at that season of the year in a much longer time than their <hi>Informations</hi> do specifie and allow. I do not say that what she affirms was true, no more than I believe that what they inform was so; but I say the contrariety which (had she been examined) would have appeared in her Testimony to theirs, might have served to convince the <hi>Jury,</hi> and is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to satisfie all mankind, that things were not as they are declared by any of them, but that the manner of my Lord's death, and the posture wherein the Body was found, being otherwise than was safe for them to disclose and reveal, each of them in order to hide and conceal the Truth, and for the sheltering both themselves and others from Justice, fram'd a story of their own concerning that matter, whence it came to pass that they so widely differed one from another in their several and respective Reports. And as the carriage and behaviour of the <hi>Jury</hi> in their <hi>Inquisition</hi> after the manner of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, does plainly shew that there was a secret and hidden villany in that matter which some of them were either forbidden or afraid to ravel into; so it serves to depress and take off the credit of that Verdict which they gave in concerning his having mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himself. But let us in the next place observe and consider the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of other persons, and those acting by no meaner Authority than of great men, towards the <hi>Coroner</hi>'s <hi>Inquest</hi> when they were met
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42060:33"/>
and sat upon the Body; and we shall from thence also be furnished with new proofs and further evidence, that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> did not destroy himself, but was brought to his unfortunate and untimely end, by Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whom they would not have known, and by means which they durst not admit to have narrowly searched into. For whereas according to the saying of the <hi>Poet,</hi> which my <hi>Lord Chancellor Finch</hi> was pleased to quote at the Tryal of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Nulla unquam de morte hominis cunctatio longa est. <hi>Juven. Sat</hi> 6.</l>
               </q>
               <hi>That we can hardly proceed slowly, nor search diligently enough in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the life or death of a man;</hi> so there were many singular and weighty reasons, arising from the worth and quality of the person, the place and condition my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> was then in, the benefit or prejudice which were likely to ensue to others, as his death should be found to be compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by this or that means, which should have influenced the <hi>Jury</hi> to use all the utmost scrutiny and diligence imaginable in their Enquiry into the manner of that Noble Mans death. But instead of this, the <hi>Jury</hi> was little sooner met (which by the way was at a publick house in the <hi>Tower,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Coroner had adjourned them after they had seen the Body) than a Message was sent them <hi>to make haste in their Inquisition, because one waited to carry it to the King.</hi> Not that I would perswade the World they had any Authority from His <hi>Majesty</hi> to use such an Expression, or that the King was not willing they should take time to examine things throughly as well as with gravity and leisure, but that there were some great men and very near his person who gave order to make use of his name, in order to the preventing the reproach and publick guilt, which a due, calm, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and leisurely Enquiry of the <hi>Jury</hi> into that matter, would have subjected and made them obnoxious unto. Nor can I believe that <hi>Hawly</hi> the <hi>Warder,</hi> who was one of those that sent the forementioned Message to the <hi>Jury,</hi> either would or durst have done it, and much less have named the <hi>King,</hi> but that he had express Command and Warrant from some in power for the doing of it, and that there were some men of the first quality, who for reasons well known to themselves, were exceeding backward and averse to the having the manner of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death too critically searched into. But besides the method which I have mentioned that was used towards the <hi>Jury</hi> to hinder a due <hi>Inquisition</hi> into the matter they were met about, and to frighten and intimidate them from tracing things too far, there was a <hi>second</hi> passage, and much more astonishing than the former, in the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42060:33"/>
of some people towards the <hi>Coroner's Inquest</hi> while they were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and sitting about the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death. For one of the <hi>Jury</hi> having observed, that tho' they had been admitted to view the Body, yet they had not seen the <hi>Cloaths</hi> which my <hi>Lord</hi> wore when he was killed, but that they had been taken off, and were carried away, did thereupon ask to see the <hi>Cloaths</hi> which my <hi>Lord</hi> had on when that unfortunate thing fell out, and in which he was found dead. One would think that a more modest, just, and necessary demand could not have been made; and I take the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to say, the Jury ought not to have proceeded to a <hi>Verdict</hi> till they had been complied with in it, unless upon the denial of so righteous a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and the refusal of a matter that was so necessary as well as useful to inform them, they had proceeded as in duty and conscience they ought, to acquit my <hi>Lord</hi> from having committed any violence upon himself, and have cast this horrid Murder upon others. - For instead of being gratified in the demand of <hi>seeing the Cloaths,</hi> the <hi>Coroner</hi> was immediately called into the next Room, where some Gentlemen were attending (and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others the person I have just now mention'd) who having overheard what was ask'd for, severely check'd and rebuk'd him for suffering such Questions to be proposed. And this mercenary, or at least cowardly Soul, <hi>Farnham</hi> the <hi>Coroner</hi> (if I may so call him, being but the <hi>Coroner's Deputy)</hi> returning back to the <hi>Jury</hi> after he had receiv'd the reprimand and rebuke, told them, <hi>they were called to sit on my Lord's Body, and not on his Cloaths, and that it was sufficient they had seen the Body, and received an Account upon Oath how it was found.</hi> O faithless and nonsensical Man! as if because they were to sit upon the <hi>Body,</hi> they might not be allowed a view of the <hi>Cloaths</hi> in which it was arrayed, when this noble Person received his fatal and deadly Wound. But stupid Fool, whom if thy Place and Office had not made an <hi>Esquire,</hi> thy honesty and wit never would; didst thou think that it was meerly the <hi>Body</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> thou wast to sit upon, whilst thy business, man, was to enquire by what means, and after what manner my <hi>Lord himself</hi> came to that unnatural, violent, and untimely end. And therefore as thou sat upon the Body meerly in order to the receiving light and information into the manner how my <hi>Lord's Person</hi> came to be destroyed, so if thou hadst not renounced Conscience as well as Courage, thou wouldst have desired a sight of the <hi>Cloaths</hi> in subservency and order to the same end. Nor can any rational person otherwise judge, why the Body, was first stripp'd, and the <hi>Cloaths</hi> afterwards with held from the view of the <hi>Jury</hi> when demanded by one of them to be seen, but because something or other remarkable would have been found upon and about them, which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42060:34"/>
would have overthrown the <hi>Informations</hi> of <hi>Bomenie</hi> and <hi>Russel,</hi> and made appear my <hi>Lord</hi>'s being murthered by others, instead of perishing by his own hands.</p>
            <p>To all that we have hitherto said in vindication of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> from the guilt and infamy of having been a <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lon of himself,</hi> and in proof that he was most treacherously as well as barbarously murdered by others; we shall in the next place give an account of some remarkable passages which were observed in the <hi>Tower</hi> that Morning my <hi>Lord</hi> was kill'd, which will not only inform us there was something requiring great secrecy then trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting, but will conduct us home to the Authors and Authorizers of that villanous, and ever to be abhorred Assassination. The first thing then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable was, That the <hi>Gate</hi> at the lower end of those Apartments in the <hi>Tower</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and all the other Gentlemen committed for the late pretended Plot, were lodged and secured, and which always used to stand open from Morning to Evening, was all that <hi>Morning</hi> kept shut till after my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> was dead, except that it was once opened to let out my <hi>Lord Russel</hi> to his Trial, being immediately after he was gone, lock'd up again. And as this could not escape the sight of the persons who were then confin'd, so it gave that surprise to some of them, being a thing which had not fallen out before, that one Gentleman in particular called to his <hi>Warder</hi> and ask'd him the meaning of it, and receiv'd for answer, That there was special <hi>Order</hi> given for it. Nor is it difficult to guess the <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>Order,</hi> and upon what Motives, and in reference to what end, command was given for keeping the said <hi>Gate</hi> shut up all that Morning till after the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was kill'd. For the Stage and <hi>Theater</hi> upon which the bloody <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi> was to be acted, being within that Gate, it was needful to keep people out as much as they could, to prevent the discovery of the Actors, unless it were such as had their parts in some of the <hi>Scenes,</hi> or would be sure to give their <hi>Plaudite</hi> to the whole. A <hi>second</hi> passage very remarkable, which was observed in the <hi>Tower</hi> that Morning, and which speaks as loud to the matter we are upon as the former, was, that the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> having been at the <hi>Lieutenant</hi>'s house, which is about the middle of the <hi>Alley</hi> where my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> and the rest were imprisoned; and having stood in a <hi>Balcony</hi> with a few attending them to see my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> pass by to his Trial; the <hi>Duke</hi> did soon after, with several waiting upon him, withdraw from the <hi>King</hi> down into the <hi>Alley</hi> the Gate whereof was still kept shut. Surely it could not be the pleasure of the walk that made the <hi>Duke</hi> leave his <hi>Majesty</hi> at that season, but he had something to give Order about, and to see the managing of, which was of more moment than his Prince's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42060:34"/>
and which his heart was infinitely more set upon. The <hi>Third</hi> and last thing which fell under the observation of divers then in the <hi>Tower,</hi> was, That the <hi>Duke</hi> having withdrawn from the <hi>King,</hi> there were several persons immediately sent and dismissed from his very side towards the Earl of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi>'s lodgings, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> returned not till after the death of that Noble person, that they came and gave an account of the obedience they had paid to his <hi>Highness</hi>'s commands, and that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was kill'd, pretending he had cut his own Throat, thereby murdering his Memory after they had assassinated his Person. It may be expected that I should here mention the Names of those that were sent upon that barbarous errand, but there being some of them who may be improved and made serviceable to detect the villanous crime they were assisting to commit, it is but Justice to our selves as well as to them to conceal their Names: And to publish the Names of the rest, were but to set a mark upon the former, and expose them to the rage and power of St. <hi>James</hi>'s by not proclaiming them in conjunction with the others. But this offer I renew again both to his <hi>Majesty</hi> and his <hi>Ministers</hi> of Justice, that if a <hi>melius inquirendum</hi> into the manner of my Lord <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, may be ordered, and an <hi>Indemnity</hi> granted to such as shall be willing and able to detect by whom and how he was murdered, then shall the Names not only of the <hi>Russians</hi> who committed the bloody Fact, but the Names of the Conspirators who were the Contrivers, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and Encouragers of it, he both discovered to his <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>judicial Officers,</hi> and published to all the World.</p>
            <p>The only thing which remains to be discoursed of, in confirmation of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s being murdered by others, and that he was not <hi>Felo de se,</hi> is <hi>that of a bloody Razor's being thrown out of his chamber Window before any noise of his Death, or the least intimation that he was killed.</hi> And indeed this of a <hi>bloody Razors</hi> being thrown out of his Window, has already made a great <hi>clamor</hi> in the World, and was the first thing which raised a suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that my <hi>Lord</hi> had not destroyed himself, but that he was assassinated by others. For as it was impossible that after his Throat was cut he should throw it out himself, so it could not be cast forth by others before the body is pretended to be found, or any declaration made that he was killed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it was by such as were present in the Room when he was slain, and who were instrumental in his Murder. Nor can any account be given why they did it, but that God infatuated them, thereby to detect the villany they had committed. And it seems they had no sooner recollected themselves, but they were sensible it would not serve the end they had design'd it unto, namely of making the world believe he had cut his own Throat, and in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42060:35"/>
revenge upon the Instrument wherewith it was done, thrown it away after the deed was performed, and therefore they immediately both caused it to be taken up, and carried back into the Closet, and have had the impudence ever since to deny that ever such a thing was done. Nor can the Story which a certain Gentleman at <hi>Whitehal</hi> had formed for them, stand them in any stead, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Bomeny</hi> finding my Lord dead in the Closet, and the <hi>Razor</hi> which had been the Instrument of his Death, lying by him, and that thereupon being struck with Surprize and Astonishment at so unexpected and deplorable an Accident, he took up the Razor, being acted by Grief and Indignation, and not minding what he did, threw it out of the Window. For besides that the <hi>Razor</hi> was thrown out of the Window before there was the least noise of my <hi>Lord</hi>'s death; this Gloss and Qualification was invented too late to serve the end it was designed unto, seeing <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s and <hi>Russel</hi>'s Examinations with which it is inconsistent, were publick before. Now in proving that a <hi>Razor</hi> was thrown out of my Lord <hi>Essex</hi>'s Window before the news and tidings of his Death, I would not be thought to acknowledge that it was a <hi>Razor</hi> wherewith the mortal and deplorable Wound was given him, being well assured that it was with an Instrument much more proper for the purpose than that would have been; but that which I intend by the proof hereof is partly the overthrow and subversion of <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s and <hi>Russel</hi>'s <hi>Informations,</hi> upon which the <hi>inquisition</hi> and <hi>verdict</hi> of the <hi>Coroner's Inquest</hi> was built, and <hi>partly</hi> to establish and evidence that antecedently to the noise and report of my <hi>Lord</hi>'s death, there were some persons in the Chamber where he was kill'd: Which last if once obtained, it will, I suppose, be thence readily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were not there to be idle Spectators of my <hi>Lords</hi> cutting his own Throat, but that their business was to perpetrate themselves that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fact upon him, tho' for the concealing their guilt, and avoiding the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and severity of the Law, they have endeavoured to cast the reproach and infamy of it upon that innocent and injured person. The <hi>first</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and divulged the Story of a <hi>bloody Razor</hi>'s being thrown out of the E. of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Window before there was any news of my <hi>Lord</hi>'s death, was one <hi>William Edwards</hi> a Youth between <hi>thirteen</hi> and <hi>fourteen</hi> years of age, who having heard as he was going to <hi>School</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> were in the <hi>Tower,</hi> went in to see them, and continuing there sometimes in one place and sometimes in another all that morning, came home about ten of the Clock to his Mother, and told the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was killed; <hi>and that while he the said</hi> Edwards <hi>stood near the Earl's Lodgings looking up towards his Chamber-window, he saw a Hand cast out a bloody Razor, which being going
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42060:35"/>
to take up, there came a short Maid or Woman with a white hood on her head cut of Captain</hi> Hawley<hi>'s House where the Earl lay, and took up the Razor, which she immediately carried into the Captain's H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> himself did confess and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Court</hi> that he had said and reported it. 'Tis true, that after he had often affirmed it, he was at last by the flatteries of some, and the menaces of others, brought to say he saw no such thing as a <hi>bloody Razor</hi> thrown out of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s window, but that the whole which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported relating thereunto was seigned and invented by himself. For having been told by his <hi>Sister,</hi> that through persevering in his first Report he would not only ruine his Father and the Family, but that he would bring both himself and his Father to be hanged; he thereupon under the influence of dread and fear retracted what he had before affirmed. But whether there ought not more credit to be given to his Affirmation, than to his Denial, I dare refer it to the judgment of all impartial men, who have either heard of the Methods used towards the <hi>Boy</hi> at the <hi>Council Board,</hi> or who have read the carriage and behaviour of my <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Kings Bench</hi> in this matter at the <hi>Tryal</hi> of Mr. <hi>Braddon.</hi> And as I was amazed my self on the perusal of the <hi>Tryal,</hi> to observe with what impudence and barefacedness they not only discovered the means used by others to influence the <hi>Boy</hi> to forswear himself, but the arts and tricks in hussing on the one side, and cajoling on the other, whereby the very <hi>Bench</hi> drew him into and cherished him in perjury; to I never had the fortune to speak with a man that was wise or honest, but he was forced to acknowledge that the <hi>Boy</hi>'s first Report in saying he saw a <hi>bloody Razor</hi> thrown out of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s window, seem'd natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, plain, candid, and true, whilst his denying what he had so often affirmed to have seen, appeared evidently to be wheedled out of him, or by reason of the dread and fear wherewith they had possess'd him, wrested and extorted from him. How gross as well as unbecoming was it for my <hi>L. Chief Justice,</hi> when old Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had upon his Childs being sworn, <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddon's Tryal, p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>charged him in the presence of Almighty God to speak the Truth, and nothing but the Truth,</hi> I say for my <hi>L. C. Justice to bid the Child turn about, and say, Father, be sure you say nothing but the Truth.</hi> For as the <hi>Father</hi>'s command to his Son does plainly intimate the jealousie he was under concerning the <hi>Boy</hi>'s being
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42060:36"/>
wrought upon to perjure himself; so the Reply which my <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> advised the Child to make to his Father, did besides the irreverence towards a Parent whereof it savoured, directly insinuate the apprehensions he had lest the Father's Christian Counsel should fortifie the Child to assert the Truth. How palpably as well as shamefully did my Lord <hi>Chief Justice</hi> betray and reveal their entangling the Boy to swear a lie, by the rage as well as superciliousness wherewith he treated <hi>Mr. Wallop</hi> (a person not only to whose age honour is due, but who in all the qualifications of a Gentleman, and the accomplishments of a Scholar in all other Learning as well as the Law, infinitely transcends and exceeds his Lordship) and for no other reason but because <hi>Mr. Wallop</hi> would have ask'd young <hi>Mrs. Edwards</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddon's Tryal, p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>whether she had not told her Brother that the King would hang his Father if he did not deny what he had so often affirmed to have seen.</hi> And tho' it was a Question, the answering whereof would have unfolded and laid open the means by which the <hi>Boy</hi> was wrought to retract what he had formerly declared, and would have confirmed the truth of his first Report, yet my <hi>L. C. Justice</hi> instead of suffering any Answer to be given to it, not only upbraided that ancient, learned, and worthy Gentleman, as if he had intended to have charged the King with a design of hanging men, or else of making them deny the Truth (both which were far from his thoughts and the intention of the Question) but having huff'd and hectored him, did threaten him with the animadversion and <hi>correction of the Court</hi> for refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting upon and aspersing the Government. Nor is young <hi>Edwards</hi> the only one who hath declared that he saw a <hi>bloody Razor</hi> thrown out of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s window before any noise or rumor of his death; but there is also a <hi>Girl,</hi> one <hi>Jane Lodeman,</hi> of about <hi>thirteen</hi> years of age, who being in the Tower that Morning the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was killed, and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over against his Lodgings, came home and told both her <hi>Aunt</hi> and others about <hi>ten</hi> of the Clock, that it was reported the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had cutt his Throat, <hi>and that she had seen a hand cast a bloody Razor out of the window where the people said that my Lord lodged.</hi> And as this <hi>Girl</hi> had no acquaintance with or knowledge of the former <hi>Boy,</hi> and consequently they could not agree together to form and invent a Romantick and fabulous Story, nor to concert the particulars which they were to report; so it is observable that their Relations do harmonise and accord in all the main heads, and only seem to differ in one thing, which the <hi>Girls</hi> unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness with the several parts of the house where my Lord lodged led her into a mistake about.

out of the Chamber window before Murder cryed out, and that this Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor was <hi>bloody,</hi> and that immediately there came a short <hi>Maid</hi> or <hi>Woman</hi> out of the house with a white hood upon her head, who went towards the place where the Razor fell; which as they are all the material things requisite to the confirmation of the Fact, so being wholly strangers to one another, they could not before-hand concert them, nor agree the things they should report. Had one said it was a <hi>Knife</hi> that was thrown out of the window, while the other had affirmed that it was a <hi>Razor;</hi> or had one denyed it to be <hi>bloody,</hi> while the other had reported that it was <hi>so;</hi> or had the one mentioned a <hi>Man</hi> as having come out of the house towards it, while the other spake of a <hi>Woman,</hi> there would have been then some reason for the <hi>Ridiculing</hi> it as a Fiction, seeing the contradicting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the essential circumstances of the Report, would have detected the falshood of the Reporters. And it must argue great perverseness as well as strange prepossession of Mind, to pretend to disbelieve the Story because the Children seem to vary one from another in a little and minute thing, when in the mean time there is the greatest harmony imaginable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in all that is of moment for the establishment and assurance of he realty of the Fact. And therefore whereas towards invalidating the <hi>Girls</hi> Testimony, it was objected by my <hi>L. Chief Justice Jeffreys</hi> that <hi>she</hi> should say the <hi>Razor</hi> was thrown out of the <hi>Closet</hi> window, when the <hi>Boy</hi> had said <note n="†" place="bottom">Braddon's Tryal, p 69.</note> that it was thrown out at the <hi>Chamber</hi> window; this pretended inconsistency between the two may be easily removed to the satisfaction of all rational men, and the eternal reproach and infamy of <hi>Sir George Jeffreys.</hi> For indeed <hi>she</hi> said no such thing, nor did she know the <hi>Closet</hi> window from the <hi>Chamber</hi> window, nor so much as which was my Lord's <hi>Chamber</hi> but as she heard declared by the Standers by. All that the <hi>Girl</hi> did affirm was, that <note n="*" place="bottom">Bradd. Tryal, p. 47, 48.</note> she saw a hand throw a <hi>bloody Razor</hi> out of a <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> which as the people discoursed belonged to the house where the E. of <hi>Essex</hi> lodged. Nor did the objection arise from what the Child her self deposed in Court, but it was started from the Deposition of one <hi>Glasbrook,</hi> who infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the <hi>Girls</hi> having told her <hi>Aunt</hi> that the E. of <hi>Essex</hi> had cut his Throat, and that <hi>she</hi> was sure of it because <hi>she</hi> saw him throw the <hi>Razor</hi> out of the window, and that it was all <hi>bloody.</hi> Now because the <hi>Closet</hi> was the place where my Lord was found dead, they would infer that <hi>she</hi> meant the <hi>Closet</hi> window, and thereupon conclude the Story to be false, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the impossibility that himself should throw the <hi>Razor</hi> out, and the contrariety which they would have supposed to be in this expression
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42060:37"/>
to what the <hi>Boy</hi> had reported. Whereas the phrase does only shew the simplicity of the Child, but does no ways argue the falsity of the Report. And the account which <hi>She</hi> gave of the place where <hi>She stood,</hi> namely, <note n="*" place="bottom">Braddon's Tryal, p. 47.</note> in that part of the <hi>Tower</hi> called the <hi>Mount,</hi> plainly shews that she could not mean the <hi>Closet</hi> window, but the window of the <hi>Chamber.</hi> And had the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> had but the justice and integrity which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came men in their places, one Question of the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Childs</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to it, would have clearly decided whether she meant the <hi>Closet</hi> window, or that of the <hi>Chamber.</hi> For had they but ask'd her, whether the <hi>window</hi> out of which the <hi>Razor</hi> was thrown, stood towards the <hi>Forestreet</hi> or the <hi>Back yard,</hi> the Objection would have immediately va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; seeing considering the place where the Child was then standing, she must have answered, that it look'd towards the <hi>Fore-street;</hi> nor was it possible for her to see any thing thrown out of the <hi>Closet</hi> window, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less she had stood in the Back-yard, which she neither did, nor was so much as ever there. But by the asking such a question, <hi>Sir George Jeffreys</hi> would have lost the advantage not only of <hi>ridiculing</hi> the whole matter about the <hi>Razor,</hi> and of devolving the murder of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> upon himself, but of skreening the Malefactors from Justice, and possibly of ruining Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> which were things of too great concernment to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, to let an occasion and pretence of compassing them escape him, especially at the cost of a little Meekness, Patience, and Justice in his Lordship in receiving a Deposition, and examining a Witness. Now this Objection advanced by my <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> against the Truth of the Girls Testimony, being fully and to the satisfaction of all impartial men removed and taken off, all that absurd and nonsensical stuff, which through his having wrested the Childs words, he superstructs upon his own Dreams and Fictions, does of its own accord, and without its being needful for me to interpose any thing by way of remark upon it, fall to the ground. Nor will any man of common sense henceforth imagine that the <hi>Coach</hi> which the Child says she saw at the <hi>Door,</hi> must therefore have been in the <hi>Back-yard,</hi> and consequently been droven through the narrow <hi>Entry</hi> and <hi>Door</hi> of the House; seeing it is evident from what hath been here discoursed, that she meant the <hi>Fore-door</hi> and not the <hi>Back,</hi> and to that there was no difficulty of access. <note n="†" place="bottom">Bradd. Tryal, p. 58. 69.</note> And with the same ease may all that Captain <hi>Hawley</hi> and my <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> declare about the height of the <hi>Pales,</hi> and the impossibility of throwing any thing out of the <hi>Closet</hi> win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow over them, and especially of <hi>seeing</hi> it when thrown over and lying
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42060:37"/>
upon the ground, be dissipated and blown away, because it was not the <hi>Pales</hi> encompassing the <hi>Back-yard</hi> which the <hi>Girl</hi>'s Testimony referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but those to which her Deposition related, are the <hi>Pales</hi> which face and sence the forepart and front of the House. O the <hi>Chicanery</hi> and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulency of a mercenary Lawyer, instead of the uprightness and integrity of a just and impartial Judge! Nor could my L. C. Justice have taken a more expeditious and effectual course to proclaim his own Villany, than he hath done, by endeavouring to ridicule and expose this poor <hi>Child</hi>'s Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the foregoing particular.

               <hi>That the Girl said the Razor fell within the Pales, and the Boy said it fell without;</hi> my <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> will have it to lie in the <hi>Girl's saying the Razor was thrown on the outside, while the Boy had said it was thrown on the inside.</hi> I am sure one of these two <hi>Judges</hi> must be mistaken, seeing it is impossible that two accounts of the same thing so clearly contradictory the one to the other, can be true. And indeed the mistake lies with my <hi>Lord Chief Justice Jefferys</hi> (whom passion had transported to that degree, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duly minded what himself or others said) in affirming that the <hi>Girl</hi> should say, the <hi>Razor</hi> was thrown on the <hi>outside</hi> the <hi>Pales,</hi> when <hi>she</hi> had expressly sworn that it was <hi>thrown</hi> on the <hi>inside</hi> of them. But then, 2. as to the inconsistency between what the <hi>Boy</hi> informed, and that which the <hi>Girl</hi> deposed; I say that young <hi>Edwards</hi> had both in words, and by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the posture and motion of the hand out of which the Razor fell, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently declared that it was cast on the <hi>inside</hi> of the <hi>Pales.</hi> His Father, Mother, and several others are ready to depose, that when he first told the Story of the Razor, he expressed it by saying that it dropt out of a hand from the E. of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Window, which did plainly signifie that he meant it fell on the <hi>inside</hi> of the <hi>Pales.</hi> And whensoever he used to imitate the motion of the hand from which the Razor fell, he did put it into such a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right posture, as that all who observed his imitating what he saw done, concluded that the Razor fell on the <hi>inside</hi> the <hi>Pales.</hi> Nor was he ever heard
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42060:38"/>
to say that it fell on the <hi>outside</hi> of the <hi>Pales,</hi> save only that time that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> took his information in writing, when his Sister by endeavouring to threaten him into a denial of the whole matter he saw, had put him into such a fright, that either he could not remember, or did not mind every little circumstance of what he as well saw as had often reported before. And it is remarkable that neither himself at Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial, where he repeated and acknowledged what he had formerly reported, nor any other Witnesses who appeared at the said Trial to testifie what they had heard him say, did in the least mention his having at any time said that the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi> fell on the <hi>out-side</hi> of the <hi>Pales;</hi> but on the contrary his Mother does so word her Deposition, as serves to prove that she believed he always meant the <hi>in side</hi> of the <hi>Pales;</hi> for she sweares, <note n="*" place="bottom">Trial p. 40.</note> that <hi>he said he saw a hand out of a Window and a Razor fall down.</hi> And as the whole matter of a <hi>Razor</hi>'s being thrown or let fall out of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> his Window immediately before the noise of his death, will be attested by several other persons when there is occasion; so the Sentinel <hi>Meak,</hi> whom we have formerly mentioned, not only reported it to divers persons both that Morning my <hi>Lord</hi> was killed, and afterwards, but he added two or three remarkable Circumstances, some whereof the <hi>Boy</hi> had not taken notice of, nor the <hi>Girl</hi> observed others. That which <hi>Meak</hi> then declared to three persons the very day my <hi>Lord</hi> was killed, and which they are ready to swear when called thereunto, is, <hi>That just before the Earl's death was publickly known, there was a bloody Razor thrown out of his Chamber-window, which was seen by some of the Souldiers as well as by others; and whilst a little Boy who had seen the Razor thrown out, run towards it to take it up, a short Maid or Woman that came out of the house where the Earl of</hi> Essex <hi>lodged, was to quick for the Boy, and snatched up the Razor, and having run with it into the house, Murder was soon after cryed out.</hi> Thus we have not only a confirmation from a third person, that there was a <hi>Razor</hi> thrown out of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Window before any tidings of his death, and that a <hi>Boy</hi> went to take it up, but was prevented by a short <hi>Woman</hi> from Captain <hi>Hawley</hi>'s house, who took it up and run in with it, the last passage of which the <hi>Girl</hi> had not observed; but we have also a ratification of a passage the <hi>Girl</hi> swore, which the <hi>Boy</hi> gave no account of, namely, that there were divers other persons standing by who saw this <hi>bloody Razor</hi> thrown out of my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Chamber-window. Nor is it strange that every little thing should not be equally minded by all, but it is enough to set this business beyond the controul of all rational men, that it hath been declared by two besides the <hi>Boy,</hi> whereof as none of them can be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42060:38"/>
supposed under any prevalent temptation to feign such a Story, so it was impossible that three persons, altogether Strangers to one another, should at one and the same time, and in three different places conspire and agree to report the same thing. But to all these proofs drawn from the testimonies of several persons concerning a <hi>Razor</hi>'s being thrown out of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Window before the news of his death. There is another evidence as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing as any of them which may be derived from the <hi>Razor</hi> of it self. And that is the several <hi>Gaps</hi> or <hi>Notches</hi> which were sound in it when the <hi>Jury</hi> saw it, and had the account of its being found by my Lord's Body, and of its being the Instrument wherewith, as they said, he had cut his Throat. For besides one large <hi>Gap</hi> or <hi>Notch</hi> at the <hi>point,</hi> into which a man might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most lay the end of his little Finger, it was for about two inches towards the <hi>handle</hi> so <hi>gapp'd</hi> and <hi>notch'd,</hi> that the edge was wholly broken off, and yet all that part of the <hi>Razor</hi> which extended from the <hi>Notch</hi> at the <hi>point</hi> till within two inches of the <hi>handle,</hi> was so far from being <hi>gapp'd,</hi> that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained very keen and sharp. And this of the <hi>Notches</hi> in the <hi>Razor</hi> was so remarkable, that some of the <hi>Jury</hi> not only observed it, but asked one of the <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> who was by, Whether my <hi>Lord</hi> by cutting his Throat could have made these <hi>Notches</hi> in the <hi>Razor.</hi> To which the <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi> answered he might, but whether it was from his being Fool or Knave, or both, I leave others to judge. For I am sure the reason he assigned from the <hi>Tremefaction</hi> that was in the hand by that time the Razor reached the Neck-bone, is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in it self, and can satisfie no rational man. And had this ignorant or suborned fellow considered the position and <hi>site</hi> of the <hi>notches,</hi> he would have both understood the falsehood of his reply, and how absurd the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was which he endeavour'd to justifie and support it by. For admitting at the present that the <hi>gap</hi> at the <hi>point</hi> might have been so occasion'd, which yet was impossible for reasons assigned before; yet how was it possible that that part of the <hi>Razor</hi> which was towards the <hi>handle,</hi> and which must be grasp'd or held in the hand, otherwise the <hi>Razor</hi> could not be used, nor the wound given, should be most <hi>notch'd</hi> and <hi>gapp'd,</hi> seeing all must grant that it was so far from approaching the Neck-bone, that it could not pass beyond the skin and outward part of the <hi>Gullet.</hi> Surely I, the same part of the Razor could not at one and the same time be held fast within the hand, and be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also upon, and against the Neck-bone? This is so obvious to every child, that I know not how to ascribe the <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi>'s Answer to his ignorance, but must either impute it to the Consternation which so <hi>Tragical</hi> an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had put him into, that he remain'd not Master of common sense; or it must be resolved into a worse cause, namely, a fear of tracing the murder
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42060:39"/>
of that honourable person, to the true and real Actors of it. Nor can the Conspirators against the life of that Noble Peer avoid the strength and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this argument, but that the Razor must have fallen both from some considerable height, and upon some resisting sharp and hard substance, or that otherwise it could never have been <hi>gapp'd</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus I have finished what at least I judge fit and proper at this time and juncture to be said concerning the barbarous murder and unparallell'd <hi>mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre,</hi> as well as the violent and untimely end of that honourable and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent person, <hi>Arthur</hi> late E. of <hi>Essex:</hi> And do greatly rejoice that I have been able to do this piece of service to God and my Country, as well as to the memory and vertue of that excellent man. For tho' thy Friends, great <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex!</hi> were not so happy as to prevent thy being murdered by the hands of execrable <hi>Ruffians,</hi> yet it is some relief to them under all their sorrows for thy unfortunate and <hi>tragical</hi> end, to be in a condition to vindicate thy Name from the infamy cast upon thee of having destroy'd thy self. And tho' we have all the light into, &amp; assurance imaginable of divers other things, yet we do not here publish them because that were both to expose divers persons to the like fate &amp; destiny, &amp; to deprive our selves of the benefit of their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at a <hi>Bar</hi> against the Malefactors. We hope never theless that under all the disadvantages under which welie, there is that account given of matters, circumstances &amp; persons, that none can reasonably doubt of the truth of my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>'s being perfidiously assassinated. And to set this affair yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beyond all question and control, I do challenge those who do think themselves injured or agrieved, that for their own vindication, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that murder, they would put this matter concerning the manner of the E. of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death, into a fair, safe, and legal way of Trial, without danger to them who shall appear as Witnesses, or damage to such as shall have the vertue and courage to undertake to prosecute. But if instead of this they fall upon ruining men by Actions of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> or of assassinating such whom they shall suspect to have detected this bloody and enormous crime, I hope it will be lookt upon not as a vindication of their innocency, but as an Argument of their Guilt. Nor can any man be brought into trouble for having or reading this Book, but it will be a fresh proof, that there is both a villanous mystery in the manner of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s death which they would not have known, and that there are persons
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42060:39"/>
guilty of, and accessory to it, whom it concerns them to preserve from the Infamy and Punishment thereof. Great <hi>Essex!</hi> how ungratefully wert thou recompensed for the Loyalty of thy Family, as well as thy own Sufferings and Services in behalf of the Crown? Was this the Reward of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's laying down his Life on a Scaffold, and of all that thou thy self under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went and did for the King and the Government? Is it the <hi>Fate</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels</hi> either to die for the Royal Family, or to fall by the Treachery &amp; Cruely of some of the Regal Off-spring? Vertuous Soul! when thou had'st not Crimes for which they could destroy thee, thy Worth &amp; Integrity became thy capital Offences; When their infamous and perjured Witnesses could not administer ground to those at St. <hi>James</hi>'s to reach thy Life; thy Love to <hi>England,</hi> and zeal for the Protestant Religion, were sufficient Reasons with a <hi>great Man,</hi> and some others, to conspire and compass thy Death? And thy declining to join with the Papists to subvert the Laws of the Kingdom, and extirpate the <hi>Northern Heresy,</hi> was Motive enough, first to hate, and then to destroy thee. And what they despaired to effect by perjured Witnesses, and a pack'd Jury of <hi>Peers,</hi> they resolved to accomplish by suborned and hired Assassinates. When they wanted the shadow of Law to arraign thee before thy <hi>Peers</hi> in a publick way, they found Men wearing <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Coronets,</hi> who undertook to sit privately upon thee and sentence thee to die. Having lived the Patron as well as Darling of thy Country, thou fell at last, through the malice of the Nation's Enemies, a Victim and Sacrifice for its Rights and Liberties. Nor was there any way for thee to have escap'd their rage, but either to have been less dutiful to God and thy Country, or less tender to them, and more their open and avow'd Enemie. Had'st thou, when time was, unravell'd the <hi>Popish</hi> Conspiracy, as thou both might and should have done, thou could'st have prevented the misery that is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon the Nation, and the deplorable End thou hast been brought unto thy self? But thy Zeal for the greatness of the Monarchy, and thy Love as well as Compassion to a <hi>Great Man,</hi> have, through the injustice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness of that Man whom thou wast so industrious to save, proved an unhappy occasion of our Slavery, and thy own ruin. And tho none does more reverence thy memory than I do, yet I cannot but observe how conspicuous the Righteousness of God is, in the injustice of that ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man. Whil'st his <hi>Associates</hi> are reserved by Heaven to fall <hi>with</hi> him; they who knew his Designs, but out of pity to his Person as well as love lo his Majesty, thought sit to conceal them, are by an unsearcheable, but holy Providence, left and suffered to fall <hi>by</hi> him. Nor according to the measures of Wisdom, or in consistency with the Principles of true Reason, can any Man be a Friend to Religion and Natural Rights, without being
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42060:40"/>
an avowed Adversary to that <hi>great Man</hi> himself, as well as to his Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? But what do you think, O ye <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of <hi>England!</hi> are not all your Lives threatned in the destruction of this one Nobleman? The Laws that could not protect him, will be as unable to defend you. If the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> which is his Majesty's <hi>Royal Palace</hi> as well as the <hi>State Prison,</hi> could not secure the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> from the irruption and violence of Assassinates: Can you either hope for, or promise your selves safety in your <hi>Country</hi> Dwellings? For if they want Pretences of destroying you by Persons in <hi>Ermine</hi> and <hi>Scarlet,</hi> they have no more to do but commissionate and arm Russians and <hi>Banditti</hi> against you. And when it may not be found convenient to assault your Lives by Strangers and hired Rascals whom you do not know; they understand the Art of debauching your <hi>Valet's de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and the Servants into whose hands you commit the care of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to stab or poison you. Into what a deplorable condition are <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen reduced, being exposed, if they stay in the Nation, to be either sworn out of their Lives by false Witnesses, or murdered by bloody Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinates; or if they withdraw and retreat into Foreign Countries, made liable to be pursued to <hi>Outlawries.</hi> And which was never known in any Kingdom of the World, till Sir <hi>George Geffry</hi>'s had given us a <hi>President,</hi> an <hi>Outlawry</hi> does as certainly destroy a Man, if the <hi>outlaw'd</hi> Party once fall into their hands, as if he had drunk Poison, or were stab'd through the heart with a <hi>Stilleto.</hi> Of this the unfortunate Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> is an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the first <hi>impression,</hi> who albeit apprehended within the twelfth Month, which is the time the <hi>Statute</hi> allows for a Person to come in and have the benefit of a Trial notwithstanding an <hi>Outlawry,</hi> was yet executed by a <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>King's Bench,</hi> without being allowed a Trial, tho he most earnestly demanded it as a <hi>right</hi> of the Subject, and what the Law of the Land gave him a just claim unto. And which is worthy to be remarked, as shewing the different treatment which Protestants meet with, beyond what was measured out to the worst and most criminal Papists. The same <hi>Attorny General</hi> who opposed Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi>'s having the liberty and benefit of a Trial, and who required a <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Court</hi> for his Execution upon the bare <hi>Outlawry,</hi> did but a few Years before in the case of <hi>Levallian</hi> and <hi>Don O Carney,</hi> two of the <hi>Ruffians,</hi> who in the Popish Conspiracy were to have <hi>killed</hi> the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Windsor,</hi> not only plead for the <hi>Reverse</hi> of their <hi>Outlawry</hi> (tho they had been above two Years <hi>outlaw'd,</hi> and came not in till they knew there was but one <hi>Witness</hi> could swear against them, Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> the other Witness being dead) but he withal told my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton,</hi> that there being an Error in the Fact through their absence beyond Sea when the <hi>Outlawry</hi> was issued out against them, the Reverse of it was

a thing of course, which they had a Right to demand, and which the Court was bound by the Duty of their Office and Place to grant. Seeing therefore that those of you, O <hi>English</hi> Peers and Gentlemen, who remain either faithful to God in the matter of Religion, or true to your Country in the business of Civil Rights, can neither hope to escape the Malice and Rage of your Enemies by staying at home nor by going abroad, is it not time to be at last so far awakened out of your <hi>Lethargy,</hi> as to demand Justice upon those bold and enormous Malefactors that were the <hi>Contrivers</hi> and <hi>Perpetrators</hi> of this horrid Murder upon this Noble and Innocent Lord. Can you believe you have discharged your Duty either to your Maker, your Prince, your Country, your Selves, your Posterity, or to your murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Friend, till you have fill'd the Ears of his Majesty with a cry of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood barbarously shed? and till you have demanded <hi>melius inquiren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> into the manner of that Noble Man's Death, and have brought the Authors and Instruments of his Assassination to undergo the Justice and Severity of the Law? Let me tell you, O Peers and Gentlemen! that this is both what Heaven and Earth do expect from you. And if you continue to neglect it, you will, in the account of God, be reckon'd amongst Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sories to that Guilt, and in the Esteem of Men be held for a dastardly and degenerate People. But if all Men shall either prove so intimid, or so supine, as to be regardless of the Command and Authority of God, their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Safety, the Wrath that impends over the Nation upon the cry of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Blood: Awake then and stir up thy self thou All-seeing and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lord, <hi>who beholdest Mischief and Spite to requite with thy hand,</hi> and make thy Wisdom known in the Detection, and thy Justice in the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this horrid Crime. For thou hast not only devolved the Inquisition after Murder upon those who are trusted with Rule among Men, but hast charged thy self with it, and hast said, <hi>The Blood of your Lives will I require at the hand of Man, and at the hand of every Man's Brother, will I require the Life of Man: and whoso sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed.</hi> And we do the rather make this Appeal unto thee, O Lord, not only because they who are advanced unto the Seats of Judgment, are either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessable, or Patrons of what they should search out and punish; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they who take upon them to minister in thy holy Things, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned thy Name, made contemptible thy Ordinances, and deceived thy People whom they should have informed, both by vindicating the Authors of this bloody Murder from the Guilt and Suspition of it, and by defaming and wounding the Memory of an innocent and guiltless Person. While the Conspirators against our Religion and Laws, <hi>have been like Wolves ravening to shed Blood, and to get dishonest Gain; these Mercenary Men have daub'd them

with untempered Mortar, making the King glad with their Wickedness, and the Princes with their Lies.</hi> 'Tis to them that the Enemies of Protestancy and <hi>English</hi> Rights owe the success of all their Attempts; and it is they whom the Nation ought to accuse, of being the Instruments that have betray'd us to Popery and Slavery. For to omit their other Villanies by which they have fought as well to ruine the Nation, as oblige the Popish Faction; they have endeavoured to ingratiate themselves with that traiterous Party, by becoming Advocates for Assassinates, and Concealers of Massacres. The aspersing this Innocent and Noble Person (whose Spittle some years ago they were ambitious to lick up) with the Infamy of being <hi>Felo de se,</hi> and they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging that wicked Fiction to the involving others in the Guilt of a Plot, hath been a Year's employment for some of the Clergy to exercise their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent upon, hoping thereby to pave their way to rich Benefices. Nor is there any thing so base, which some of the <hi>Clergy</hi> will not prostitute themselves unto and glory in, if it may but serve the Designs of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the detection of the Crimes whereof a <hi>great Man</hi> is guilty. A Fresh example we have of this in an <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> turning <hi>Informer,</hi> and causing a Souldier to be made run the <hi>Gantlet,</hi> and to be cashier'd. For a certain high flown Tory being viewing the <hi>Tower,</hi> did with a kind of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, on the remembrance that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had there fatally ended his days, ask'd a common <hi>Sentinel</hi> where the Chamber was in which my L. of <hi>Essex</hi> had cut his Throat. To which the Souldier, who was neither a Stranger to the Reports that went concerning the Death of that Noble Person, nor to divers Circumstances importing by what means and hands he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len) reply'd, pointing at the same time to the Room, that is the Chamber where the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was killed. And because the honest Fellow would not own to that inquisitive Person that my L. of <hi>Essex</hi> had murder'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but persevered in saying he was kill'd in such a place, therefore did the <hi>Divine</hi> inform against him, and brought him to suffer what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Which as it represents unto us the Principles of the present <hi>Clergy,</hi> so it confirms the Assassination committed upon that Noble <hi>Peer.</hi> O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>thou holy One, to whom Justice belongeth, shew thy self, yea, lift up thy self thou Judg of the Earth, cause their Mischief to return upon their own Heads, and for the Violence of their Hands, and the Sin of their Mouth, let them be taken in their Pride, that all Men may know God hath not for saken the Earth, but that he ruleth in</hi> Jacob, <hi>even unto the Ends of it.</hi>
