            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was ſeldom my Fathers practice, (eſpecially of late years,) to Dedicate his Works to particular or great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; And did I attempt any euch thing now, I ſhould be afraid leſt I might diſturb his reſt in the Grave. All you therefore that had a

And however it happened to be bundled up with other old Writings (where I found it) yet I verily believe it was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Preſs by thoſ many alterations he had made, which had ſo blur'd the Original Copy, that I
<pb facs="tcp:41837:3"/>
was forced to get it Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed before it was fit for my ſelf or any body elſe to read: And having now peruſed it, I could not in conſcience conceal ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Truths as are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, in hopes that it may take the effect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſires in his Epiſtle to the Reader expreſt in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; believing, that that good Spirit which firſt dictated thoſe Petitionary words will accompany them to the Worlds end.

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IN that great Plague, which (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) was the moſt contagious <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> that euer afflicted this City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> it pleaſed God to encloſe me there, and to give me grace to make ſuch obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon his Juſtice and Mercy, as I hope (however others eſteem of them) ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of me be forgotten during life.</p>
            <p>A while before this laſt <hi>Viſitation,</hi> the ſame gracious God provided me a little place to eſcape unto, where I did but only
<pb facs="tcp:41837:5"/>
hear of that which my Brethren ſuffered, and therefore (as I may well fear) was not ſo ſenſible of their miſery as I ought to have been.</p>
            <p>Yet I was not altogether without Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as became the time, (but as the neceſſities wherewithal God hath yet exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed me would give leave) endeavoured to employ ſome hours in the conſideration of things pertinent to the Honour of my <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver,</hi> that I might not appear leſs thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for this deliverance, which was without Terror, than I ſeemed to be for that which I obtained with fear and danger.</p>
            <p>Part of my Muſings were upon the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> the neglect whereof (being the cauſe of all <hi>Plagues)</hi> is never impertinently thought upon, much leſs when the hand of God is extended to chaſtiſe us for infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame. And what I then medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
<pb facs="tcp:41837:5"/>
is now offered unto the publick view, that it might the oftner occaſion me and others to be mindful of our Duties.</p>
            <p>Neither my Eſtate, nor the place I lived in would afford me the uſe of Books, at that time, therefore inſtead of them I peruſed mine own Heart to to ſee what I could read there: For in the <hi>Heart of Man</hi> it was originally written. And though our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath now ſo defaced it that we need ſome helps to explain the eſſential meaning of the <hi>Holy</hi> Text long ſince written in <hi>Stone;</hi> Yet if we would but be ſo diligent as good Antiquaries in examining defective <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions</hi> upon decayed Monuments, we might ſometime find the Truth more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly than by truſting over-confidently to the ſearch of others, who many times deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their own <hi>Fancies</hi> inſtead of the right meaning of Gods <hi>Law.</hi>

            <p>

Others I confeſs (though not many in the <hi>Engliſh Tongue)</hi> have to this purpoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged large <hi>Commentaries</hi> But ſome want Money to purchaſe them, and ſome want leiſure to peruſe them: for they are ſo large that many Readers had rather venture to break all the <hi>Commandments</hi> than to ſcan over thoſe <hi>Tracts;</hi> and yet perhaps theſe brief Meditations have expreſſed ſomewhat which is not found in any of them.</p>
            <p>I profeſs not (as I have elſewhere ſaid) to teach the <hi>Learned,</hi> but to be unto them a <hi>Remembrancer</hi> only of what they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready know (which will otherwhile happen by this means even when they take up my Books to peruſe them with contempt rather than for any better end) yet they who are as Ingenious as Learned, have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with good reſpect as not unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41837:6"/>
The ſame Spiritual nouriſhment which others have tendred more artificially dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the publick <hi>Feaſts</hi> of the Soul; I have here and elſewhere indifferently fitted for their private refreſhments, who are beſt nouriſhed with plain <hi>Diet,</hi> and who have heretofore wanted either opportunities or due care to come to thoſe Repaſts. And if I can but find means to relieve the <hi>Blind</hi> and <hi>Lame</hi> in underſtanding, till a more powerful means ſhall fetch them from the <hi>Hedges</hi> and <hi>High-way-ſides</hi> to be Gueſts at the great Banquet, I ſhall hope to have done ſomewhat worth my pains.</p>
            <p>Ignorant perſons may be advantaged hereby mediately or immediately; by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Information</hi> or occaſion of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> yea the Compoſing thereof in <hi>Verſe</hi> will cauſe many to be the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted therewith; Some the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, others out of curioſity to take
<pb facs="tcp:41837:7"/>
notice of it, who may afterward give it more ſerious entertainment, and no doubt all good men will afford it a favourable cenſure ſo far as it ſhall deliver the Truth.</p>
            <p>So far only I deſire it ſhould be allowed, and in that deſire do humbly ſubmit the ſame to the Cenſure of <hi>Authority,</hi> and the Succeſs to Gods bleſſing. <hi>Which I beſeech Oh Glorious God ſo to manifeſt in this</hi> Mite <hi>vouchſafed out of the Infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of thy holy</hi> Spirit, <hi>that like a grain of Muſtard Seed it may be fruitful to the encreaſe of</hi> Piety <hi>beyond the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anſwerable to ſo deſpiſed a means: For ſome in theſe days have perverted the plain meaning of thy Law; yea ſome have lately ſtrived both by their words and works to make the ſame wholly void and of no uſe, that they ſeem either not to have known, or to have quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; That</hi> thy Truth remaineth from
<pb facs="tcp:41837:7"/>
one Generation to another, <hi>or That</hi> thy righteouſneſs is an everlaſting righteouſneſs, <hi>in ſo much that we may juſtly repeat unto thee this</hi> complaint <hi>of thy Prophet</hi> David; <hi>Lord</hi> it is time for thee to lay to thine hand, for they have deſtroyed thy Law. <hi>Hear my prayer O Lord, and though I am ſmall, and of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſince I would not forget thy Law, deliver me from mine Oppreſſors, and ſo teach me thy Statutes, that I may keep them unto the end; yea though the proud have me in deriſion, and almoſt made an end of me upon Earth, yet let my heart be made ſo upright in thy Statutes, that I may not be aſhmed to remember thy promiſe made to thy Servant, even that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou haſt cauſed me to truſt; Let it quicken me, and be my comfort in my troubles. For thou art all my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I have determined to keep</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41837:8"/>
               <hi>thy word; Before I was afflicted I went ſo much aſtray that it was good for me to have ſome troubles. O let me hereafter be always exerciſed in thy Law; Let it be a Lanthorn unto my feet, and a Light unto my path. Look upon me, and be merciful unto me as thou uſeſt to be unto thoſe who love thy name. Let the proud be aſhamed that they have dealt falſly with me. Let ſuch as fear thee be turned unto me, and comfort thou me according to the years wherein I have been afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they who ſee it may glorifie thy name, for mine eyes have almoſt failed with waiting for thy aſſurance. Though I have gone aſtray like a Sheep, yet ſeek thy Servant, and deal with me according to thy mercy. Let all theſe my Supplications come before thee, that my Soul may live, that my Lips may praiſe thee, and that my</hi>

            <p>Sir, among other kindneſſes vouchſafed in your Neighbourhood, I received from you the Copper Plates, which are now made uſe of in this Book. The words which I have added unto thoſe dumb Figures will make them (I hope) much more profitable, and cauſe them to be a means of publiſhing thoſe Caveats and Univerſal Duties which are pertinent, as well to the General well-being of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as to the Glory of God; which two things were the proper ends of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ought alſo to be the chief care of our life.</p>
            <p>To thoſe ends therefore, and that your coſt might not be unprofitably beſtowed, I have returned the Coppies of thoſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures which you gave me, illuſtrated with

ſuch Meditations as my leiſure and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity could afford.

            </l>
            <l>In God, who (without Helper or Partaker)</l>
            <l>Was of himſelf the Worlds <hi>Almighty Maker,</hi>
            </l>

(The ſecond perſon of that Three in one)</l>
            <l>The Father's equal, and <hi>his only Son;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That ever-bleſſed, and incarnate Word,</l>
            <l>Which our Redeemer is, our life, <hi>Our Lord</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For when by Sathans guile we were deceived,</l>
            <l>Chriſt was that means of help, <hi>which was conceived;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yea, (when we were in danger to be loſt)</l>
            <l>Conceived for us, <hi>by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And that we might not ever be forlorn,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Born as a Man (that Man might not miſcarry)</l>
            <l>Even of the ſubſtance <hi>of the Uirgin Mary,</hi>
            </l>

            </l>
            <l>In him do I believe, who was envied,</l>
            <l>Who with extreameſt hate <hi>was Crucified:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who being life it ſelf (to make aſſured</l>
            <l>Our ſouls of ſafety) was both <hi>dead, and buried:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And that no ſervile fear in us might dwell,</l>
            <l>To conquer, <hi>He deſcended into Hell:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Where no infernal Power had power to lay</l>
            <l>Command upon him; but on <hi>the third day</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:41837:65"/>
The force of Death and Hell he did conſtrain,</l>

            <l>Yea, the Almighty power advanc'd his head,</l>
            <l>Aſwel above all things, as <hi>from the dead.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then, that from thence gifts might o men be given,</l>
            <l>With glory, <hi>He aſcended into Heaven:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Where, that ſupream and everlaſting throne,</l>
            <l>Which was prepar'd, he clim'd; <hi>aid ſitteth on</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That bleſſed feat, where he ſhall make abode</l>
            <l>To plead for us, at <hi>the right hand of God</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And no where ſhould he be enthroned rather,</l>
            <l>Than there: for he is God, as is <hi>the Father</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And therefore, with an equal love delight I</l>
            <l>To praiſe and ſerve them both, as one <hi>Almighty:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yet in their office there's a <hi>difference.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And I believe, that Jeſus <hi>Chriſt, from thence,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Shall in the great and univerſal doom,</l>
            <l>Return, and that with Angels <hi>He ſhall come,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To queſtion ſuch as at his Empire grudge;</l>
            <l>Even thoſe who have preſumed him <hi>to judge</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And that black day ſhall be ſo Catholick,</l>
            <l>As I believe not only that <hi>the quick</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To that aſſiſe ſhall all be ſummoned,</l>

            </l>
            <l>Though damned be Mans natural condition,</l>

            <l>Deaths end, which is the puniſhment of <hi>ſins.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Moreover, I the Sadduces infection</l>
            <l>Abhor, and do believe <hi>the Reſurrection:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yea, though I turn to duſt, yet through God, I</l>
            <l>Expect a glorious riſing <hi>of the body,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And that, exempted from the cares here rife,</l>
            <l>I ſhall enjoy perfection <hi>and the life</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That is not ſubject unto change or waſting,</l>
            <l>But ever-bleſſed, and for <hi>ever-laſting.</hi>
