         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAVING often Obſerved, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Travels, Voyages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
are generally very Acceptable to the
Genius of the Engliſh Nation, I
judged that it might not be altogether Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to give a brief Account of ſome remarkable
Obſervations made during my Abode in Foreign
Countries, eſpecially having Travelled for the
ſpace of Sixteen Years through <hi>Holland, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
Sweden, Denmark,</hi> and other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I eaſily foreſee, that it will be ſoon Objected,
that after ſo great a Man as Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi>
who hath already Publiſhed a full and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Deſcription of the Policy and Government of
the States of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> it would
be a vain Preſumption to attempt any farther on
that Subject. However, without derogating from
his Honour, I have here inſerted divers particular
Remarks, not mention'd by him, but ſuch as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
may make Uſe of to very good purpoſe,
for whoſe Information this ſmall Eſſay is chiefly
<pb facs="tcp:57758:3"/>
deſign'd. And it will be the more eminently
Uſeful at this time, in reſpect of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Engliſh Gentlemen, that now Travel that
way. Wherefore I doubt not, but this will be a
ſufficient Plea to cover me from the Imputation of
Vanity, and to make it appear, that what I have
here perform'd, is only intended for the publick
Service in general, and the particular Aſſiſtance
of thoſe Gentlemen, who ſhall hereafter Travel
through theſe Countries. The Liſts of the Paſſage
Boats and Wagons in <hi>Holland,</hi> with the Hours of
their going off, which I have inſerted, the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
will find extreamly Uſeful.</p>
            <p>As for the Relation of the Kings Voyage to
<hi>Holland,</hi> annexed at the end. I Confeſs indeed,
That it deſerves to be Written by an abler Hand;
but being at that time at the <hi>Hague,</hi> I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by Curioſity, to take an exact Account of
this ſo extraordinary a Solemnity, which I did at
firſt for my own private Uſe, but have now Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
it through the importunity of ſome Friends.
The Proſpects of the Triumphal Arches, Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are exactly Copied from the Original
Draughts taken at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and are the true
Repreſentations of them.</p>

HOLLAND:
With ſome Neceſſary
DIRECTIONS
FOR
Such as intend to Travel through
the Province of HOLLAND,
GERMANY, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>AS they that confine themſelves to
their own Country, have not the
opportunity to ſee and obſerve
Rarities in other Parts of the
World; ſo, ſuch as go into Foreign Places,
rather Wander at Random, than Travel, who
have not the Curioſity to commit to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
or Writing ſuch Things they meet
with, both for their own and others Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57758:4"/>
as may demonſtrate the Fruits of their
Travels.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, all Travellers are not of alike
Temper; ſome delight themſelves in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the Curioſities of Arts; ſome
are taken with the Varieties of the Works of
Nature; others ſpeculate, with a kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
the Decays and Ruins of Antiquity;
others ſtudiouſly inform themſelves with the
Tranſactions of Modern Times; others with
the Government and Polity; others ſpeculate
the ſtrange Cuſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap> and Faſhions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they paſs through; to be ſhort, every one
labours to entertain the Reader with thoſe
Objects and Rarities of Foreign Parts his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
and Inclination is moſt affected with.</p>
                  <p>As to my ſelf, although during the ſpace of
16 Years Travel, I might have enlarged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Curioſity and Opportunity I
have had in the rehearſal of many rare and
exquiſite Things very obſervable; yet my
chief Aim was, to make ſuch Remarks as
might moſt contribute to the common Good
of Human Society and Civil Life, in taking
notice of the Government and Polity of the
ſeveral States and Dominions where I have
been, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>United Provinces, Germany,
Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and other Countries, whoſe
natural Temper and Diſpoſition ſeemed to
me moſt to ſympathize with our Engliſh
Nation, and thereby have an occaſion to do
ſome good to my own Country. Expect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57758:4"/>
not, Reader, a like punctualneſs, as to all the
forementioned places, becauſe very many
things, which I might have obſerved, are
much agreeing, and ſo may be referred to
what ſhall be ſpoken of the Polity and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Holland,</hi> which, for Reaſons I
ſhall by and by hint at, is the chief End I
aimed at in this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>We will begin then in the firſt place with
the Commonwealth of <hi>Holland,</hi> and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the States General, which thô for
ſome years were in a declining condition, and
their Forces exceedingly weakened, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that fatal War it managed againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> unto
which, if we add the inteſtine Diviſions of
thoſe two Factions, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and
<hi>Loveſtein,</hi> that Politick Body, was ſo totter'd
and torn, as did threaten its utter and total
Ruine.</p>
                  <p>But as Bodies, whether Natural or Politick,
after that a violent Fit hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ore ſhaken, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
and exhauſted their Spirits, may reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
vigor, and look lively again, if ſo be the
Radical Conſtitution and Natural Temper
be not wholly changed and depraved; even
ſo this Commonwealth of <hi>Holland</hi> hath viſibly
recovered Strength again, and attained its
former Force and Luſtre.</p>
                  <p>We will therefore make ſome Remarks,
as to the Defects and Failings (obſerved not
only by me, but alſo by others) which that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57758:5"/>
famous Commonwealth hath of late years
been guilty of; which I ſhall do not out of
any Malice, or deſign of Reflection, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of writing this Treatiſe being ſimply
to inſert thoſe Defaults which the wiſeſt of
Authors have always judged neceſſary, not
only for the Reformation of this, but of all
States whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>This Commonwealth of <hi>Holland</hi> hath wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
been the Wonder of all <hi>Europe</hi> during
this laſt Age, and perhaps not to be parallell'd
in the Records of former Times; for if we
conſider how many years it was aſſaulted by
the then moſt Potent Prince of <hi>Europe,</hi> who
aſpired to no leſs than the Univerſal Empire;
and that how formidable ſoever he were, yet
they not only maintained their Pretenſions,
but with uninterrupted Proſperity and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cefsfulneſs
adva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed their Trade, and ſpread
their Conqueſts in all the four Parts of the
World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, though moſt famous and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
yet could not, as is be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ieved, in ſo
ſhort a time do what by this Commonwealth
hath been effected. In <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> they
ſoon forced the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Portugueſes</hi> to
yield to them moſt of their Trade and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions:
And thô <hi>England</hi> put in for a ſhare,
yet they were a long while vigorouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to this hour have
enough to do to keep what they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
ſo that in leſs than 100 years this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57758:5"/>
by their Induſtry, and Art in
Trading, are become ſo exceſſive Rich and
Potent, that they began to Inſult, and would
needs be Arbitrators to their Neighbouring
Princes and States, and encroach upon their
Territories and Dominions.</p>
                  <p>This drew upon them that fatal War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned,
by which they were ſorely
weaken'd and brought ſo low, that except
GOD by a more than ordinary Providence
had protected and appeared for them, they
had certainly been ruinated, and never able
to recover themſelves again; however, their
Pride hereby was much abated: And as
Luxury and Laſciviouſneſs are the ſad Effects
of Proſperity, as well as Pride; ſo ſuch Vices
in a Body Politick and Commonwealth as do
corrupt the Radical Humours, by abating the
Vigour of the Vital Parts, do inſenſibly tend
to the Conſumption and Decay of the whole.</p>
                  <p>That this Commonwealth hath much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
its Strength, may clearly appear, if
we conſider what great Things they have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
ſince the little time they have enjoyed
Peace: They have in leſs than 7 Years built
about 40 gallant Ships of War; They have
laid out vaſt Sums of Treaſure in refortifying
<hi>Narden, Maeſtricht, Breda,</hi> the <hi>Grave,</hi> and many
other Places; They have paid vaſt Sums of
Money to their Allies for their Auxiliary
Troops, as alſo 200000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling to the King
of <hi>England</hi> to Enjoy their Peace with him. And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57758:6"/>
beſides all this, their Encreaſe in Riches and
Power may be gueſſed at, by the many ſtately
Houſes built within theſe 5 Years in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
Rotterdam,</hi> and other Places; to all which
we may add, to what exceſſive height the
Actions of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company
are riſen, and the Obligations from the States
are ſo eſteemed as to Security, that they can
get as much Mony as they pleaſe at 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
Not to ſpeak of the exceeding Encreaſe of
their Subjects, occaſioned by the <hi>French</hi> King's
Tyranny againſt the diſtreſſed Proteſtants in
<hi>France, Alſace,</hi> and other parts of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts;
neither will we ſpeak of other Signs
of the Encreaſe of this Commonwealth, as
not judging it convenient to commit them
to Paper, but will now proceed to ſhew the
Method of Living and Travelling in the
Dominions and Places of the States, which,
if you do well conſider, you may ſee how
happy and eaſy the Government of <hi>England</hi>
is, above that of other Nations.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Briell</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> is the uſual place where
the Pacquet and King's Pleaſure-boats bring
on ſuch as come to ſee the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but of late <hi>Helvoet-Sluys</hi> is the place the
Pacquet comes to, as being the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Port: Here be ſure to furniſh your ſelf
well with Money. From hence you take a
Boat to <hi>Maeſland-Sluys</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> which,
if you go in Company with others, will only
coſt you 5 Stivers; but if you take one for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57758:6"/>
your ſelf, will coſt 25 Stivers for <hi>Maeſeland-Sluce,</hi>
and a Ducatoon to <hi>Rotterdam:</hi> The
fifth part of which goes to the States for a
Tax, they call <hi>Paſſagie Gelt;</hi> and the other
four parts are for the Boat-Men or Schippers,
who alſo out of their Gains muſt pay a Tax
to the States, ſo that by Computation you
pay a fifth Penny to the States for your Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
either in Boats by Water, or in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
by Land.</p>
                  <p>As you paſs by <hi>Maſeland-Sluce</hi> you will ſee
a very fair Fiſhing Village, to which belong
near Two hundred Herring Buſſes, but if
you go by the way of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> you Sail by
two old Towns, called <hi>Flardin</hi> and <hi>Schiedam:</hi>
Yet let me adviſe you before you depart from
the <hi>Briell,</hi> to take a ſerious view of it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the City which in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time
was one of the Cautionary Towns Pawned
to <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Briell</hi> had a Voice among
the States, but by reaſon <hi>Rotterdam</hi> hath got
away their Trade, by which having loſt its
former Luſtre, is now become a Fiſhing Town
only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rotterdam</hi> is the Second City for Trade in
<hi>Holland,</hi> and by ſome is called, <hi>Little London,</hi>
as having vaſt Traffick with <hi>England,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that many of the Citizens Speak good
Engliſh. There are in this City two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Churches of Engliſh and Scotch:
And how great a Trade they drive with the
King of <hi>England</hi>'s Subjects is evident, for in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57758:7"/>
the year 1674, at the opening of the Waters,
after a great Froſt, there departed out of
<hi>Rotterdam</hi> 300. Sail of Engliſh, Scotch, and
Iriſh Ships at once with an Eaſterly Wind:
And if a Reaſon ſhould be demanded, how
it comes to paſs that ſo many Engliſh Ships
ſhould frequently come to that Haven, It is
eaſily anſwered, becauſe they can ordinarily
Load and Unload, and make returns to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
from <hi>Rotterdam</hi> before a Ship can get
clear from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and the <hi>Texel:</hi> And
therefore your Engliſh Merchants find it
Cheaper, and more Commodious for Trade,
that after their Goods are arrived at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
to ſend their Goods in Boats Landward
into <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City is Famous, as being the place
where great <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was Born, whoſe Statue
of Braſs ſtands erected in the Market-place:
And although the Buildings here are not ſo
ſuperb as thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam, Leyden,</hi> or
<hi>Haerlem,</hi> yet the places worth the ſeeing, are,
firſt, the great Church, where ſeveral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
lie ſtately Entombed; here you ſee
their Admiralty, Eaſt-India, and Stadt-Houſes,
together with that called, <hi>Het Gemeen Lands
Huis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Rotterdam</hi> you may for five Stivers
have a Boat to bring you to <hi>Delft,</hi> but before
you come thither you paſs through a fair
Village called <hi>Overſchie,</hi> where the French
and Engliſh Youths are trained up in Litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57758:7"/>
as to the Latin and Dutch Tongue,
Book-keeping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From thence in the ſame
Boat you come to <hi>Delft</hi> which is Famous for
making of Porceline to that degree, that it
much reſembles the <hi>China,</hi> but only it is not
Tranſparent.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Delft</hi> is the great Magazin of Arms for
the whole Province of <hi>Holland:</hi> Their
Churches are very large, in one of which
are Tombs of the Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Tromp,</hi> and General <hi>Morgans</hi> Lady, and
in the Cloiſter over againſt the Church, you
have an Inſcription in a Pillar of Braſs, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after what manner <hi>William</hi> the Firſt, that
Famous Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was ſhot to Death
by a Miſcreant Jeſuit, with his deſerved
Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Delft</hi> hath the third Voice in the States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> and ſends its Deputies unto the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of the States General, and to all other
Colleges of the Commonwealth. They
have alſo a Chamber in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
as ſhall be more largely ſpoken to,
when we ſhall come to Treat of the State
of the ſaid Company.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Delft</hi> you may by Boat be brought
to the <hi>Hague</hi> for two Stivers and an half;
which is accounted the faireſt Village in the
World, both for pompous Buildings, and
the largeneſs thereof; here the Princes of
<hi>Orange</hi> hold their Reſidence, as alſo the States
General, and the Council of State; here you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57758:8"/>
have the Courts of Juſtice, Chancery, and
other Courts of Law. Here you ſee that
great Hall, in which many Hundreds of
Colours are hung up in Trophy, taken
from the Emperor, Spaniard, and other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
with whom they have waged War.
Their Council Chambers are admired by all
that ſee them. Many fair Libraries they
have belonging to particular Men. The
Princes Palace is a moſt ſuperb Building,
and there are many coſtly Gardens adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Hague,</hi> together with that to the
Princes Houſe in the Wood, in which Houſe
are in a large Hall the moſt rare and coſtly
Pictures of <hi>Europe;</hi> there alſo are thoſe Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
and Unparalell'd Gardens of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eer
<hi>Bentham</hi> of <hi>Ameſland</hi> and others. I might
here ſpeak of the ſplendor of His Majeſties
Court in <hi>Holland,</hi> of his Noble Virtues and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
of the moſt Virtuous and Beautiful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
his Royal Conſort, but I dare not, leaſt
I ſhould infinitely fall ſhort of what ought to
be, and which others have already done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me: And therefore leaving the <hi>Hague,</hi>
I ſhall only tell you that from thence you
may for ſeven Stivers have a Boat to bring
you to <hi>Leyden. Leyden</hi> is a fair and great
City, and the Univerſity is very Famous,
there being continually in it 1000 Students
from all parts, as <hi>Hungary, Poland, Germany,</hi>
yea from the Ottomans Empire it ſelf, who
pretend to be Grecians, beſides the Engliſh,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57758:8"/>
Scots, and Iriſh, who this year were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
to be above 80.</p>
                  <p>The moſt remarkable Things here to be
ſeen, I ſhall ſummarily ſet down: As the place
called the <hi>Bergh,</hi> formerly a Caſtle belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Prince of <hi>Liege</hi> in <hi>Flanders:</hi> The
Stadt-houſe, the Univerſity Schools, eſpecially
that of the Anatomy, which excels all the
Anatomy Schools in the World, a Book of
the Rarities whereof you may have for ſix
Stivers; their Phyſick Garden, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
Cloſet are all Raviſhing in rare Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities.
But as to their Colleges, they are
but two, and very ſmall, not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the ſmalleſt Halls in <hi>Oxford,</hi> neither
have they any Endowments, their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
being only from the Charitable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
of the Miniſters of <hi>Holland;</hi> neither
are any Students to remain longer there than
till they attain the Degree of Batchelors of
Art: One of the Curators being demanded
by me, Why ſo Rich a Commonwealth as
<hi>Holland</hi> is, did not Build and Endow Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
after the manner of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi>
anſwered, They had not ſo many
able and publick ſpirited Men as are in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and to deal plainly with you, ſaid he,
had we ſuch Colleges, our Burghermaſters and
Magiſtrates would fill them with their own
and their Friends Sons, who by leading a
lazie and idle Life, would never become
capable to ſerve the Commonwealth, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57758:9"/>
therefore he judged it much better to put
them to Penſion in Burghers-Houſes, leaving
them to the care of the Profeſſors, who are
very diligent in keeping the Students at their
Exerciſes, both at publick Lectures, and in
their private Houſes alſo, where they cauſe
them punctually at their appointed Hours to
come to their Examinations and Lectures,
beſides thoſe they have in publick. Their
Churches are rare, ſo are their Walks round
the City, and the Fortifications very pleaſing
to behold. Here you have the River <hi>Rhine</hi>
running through the City, and falling into
it from <hi>Catwyck op Zee. Leyden</hi> is very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in Hiſtory for the long Siege it held
out againſt the Spaniard. From hence for
12 Stivers and an half you are brought to
<hi>Haerlem</hi> by Water, being 12 Engliſh Miles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Harlem</hi> is Famous, in that <hi>Coſtor</hi> one of
their Burghers, firſt Invented the Art of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>
This <hi>Coſtor</hi> being ſuſpected to be a
Conjurer, was fain to flee from <hi>Haerlem</hi> to
<hi>Cologne</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and there perfected his
Invention, having in <hi>Haerlem</hi> only found out
the way of Printing on one ſide of the Paper.
The firſt Book he ever Printed is kept in the
Stadt-houſe, for thoſe that are curious to ſee
it. Here is one of the faireſt and largeſt
Churches of the Seventeen Provinces, in the
Walls whereof there remain to this day ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Cannon Bullets, ſhot by the Spaniards
during the Siege thereof. In this Church
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57758:9"/>
are three Organs, as alſo the model of the
three Ships that Sailed from <hi>Haerlem</hi> to <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater,</hi>
ſeizing the Caſtle in which the Earl of
<hi>Holland</hi> was kept a Priſoner, and brought
him away to <hi>Holland:</hi> In the Tower of this
Church hang two Silver Bells, which they
alſo brought from thence, and now Ring
them every Night at nine a Clock.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Haerlem</hi> is Renowned for making the fineſt
Linnen Cloth, Tyffinies, Damasks, and
Silk Stuffs; alſo Ribands and Tapes: They
have Mills by which they can Weave 40 or
50 pieces at a time; they make the fineſt
white Thread and Tapes for Lace in the
whole World; their Bleacheries ſurpaſs all
other whatſoever, their Waters whitening
Cloth better than any in the Seventeen
Provinces: They have a moſt pleaſant Grove
like a little Wood, divided into Walks, where
on Sundays and Holy-days the Citizens of
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> and other places come to take
their pleaſure. <hi>Haerlem</hi> is the Second City
of <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſends in Deputies unto all the
Colleges of the Government. From hence
you have a paſſage by Boat to <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
for ſix Stivers, but when you are come half
way, you muſt ſtep out of one Boat to go
into another, where you ſee a ſtately Palace,
where the Lords, called <hi>Dykgraves</hi> ſit; every
one of theſe Lords hath his Apartment when
he comes for the Concerns of the Sea-dykes
and Banks: Here are alſo two large Sluces,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57758:10"/>
having Gates to let in or out Water from the
<hi>Haerlemmer Meer.</hi> Near this place about
<hi>Anno</hi> 1672, a part of the Sea-Bank was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by a ſtrong North-Weſt Wind, drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Land betwixt <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and
<hi>Haerlem,</hi> which coſt an incredible vaſt Sum
to have it repaired. They ſunk in this
Breach 400 ſmall Veſſels fil'd with Earth and
Stones, for a Foundation to rebuild the Wall
upon, and by unſpeakable Induſtry and
Charges at laſt repaired the Bank.</p>
                  <p>I come now to ſpeak of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which
having been the place of my abode for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years, I ſhall give a more large and
punctual account thereof then I do of other
Places: It is eſteemed by Intelligent Men,
the Second City in the World for Trade,
and not inferiour to any in Wealth. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> is one of the Beautifulleſt
Cities in the World, their Buildings are
large, their Streets for the moſt part plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
Planted with Trees, and Paved ſo
neatly, as is to be found no where elſe in any
Country, ſave in ſome of the Seventeen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
And although, as I have already
ſaid, <hi>Amſterdam</hi> may juſtly be taken for the
Second or Third City after <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi>
yet it hath neither Court nor Univerſity as
they have. And now in treating of all the
Excellences and Virtues of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I
ſhall not hyperbolize or flatter; for before
I have done, you ſhall ſee, I ſhall alſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57758:10"/>
declaim againſt the Evils, Miſtakes, and
Vices in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſtands upon 1000 Morgans of
Land, encompaſſed with a very ſtrong Wall
and Baſtions moſt pleaſant to behold, with
a very large Gracht or Ditch for the defence
of three parts of the City, the fourth being
ſecured by an Arm of the Sea called the
River <hi>Y,</hi> or (as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men corruptly
call it) the <hi>Ty.</hi> There are 13 Churches in
this City for thoſe of the Reformed Religion
(called <hi>Dutch Presbyterians)</hi> to meet and
worſhip in, with two <hi>French,</hi> one <hi>High-Dutch,</hi>
and one <hi>Engliſh,</hi> all Presbyterian Churches,
who only are allowed Bells, and whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
are maintained by the Magiſtrate.
All theſe Churches or Congregations make
up only a third part of the Inhabitants of the
City. The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who have 85 Houſes or
Chapels to meet in for their Worſhip, make
another third part, and have a long Square
of Houſes for their Nuns to live in, who are
not ſhut up in Cloiſters, as in Papiſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
they are wont to do, but may go in and
out at their pleaſure, yea and Marry alſo, if
they grow weary of a Nunniſh Life. Theſe
Churches of the Papiſts have no Bells allow'd
them, being look'd upon as Conventicles, and
are many times ſhut up, and again opened at
the <hi>Scout</hi>'s pleaſure. The other third part
of the City is made up by <hi>Jews, Lutherans,
Armenians, Browniſts</hi> or <hi>Engliſh Independants,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57758:11"/>
Anabaptiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Quakers:</hi> None of which,
as was alſo ſaid of the Papiſts, have Bells al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, but are accounted Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
and all that Marry amongſt them muſt
firſt be married by the Magiſtrate, and then
(if they pleaſe) among themſelves in their
own Aſſemblies; neither are any of them
admitted unto any Office in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but ſuch only as are of the Reformed
or Presbiterian Profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Jews, who are very conſiderable in
the Trade of this City, have two Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
one whereof is the largeſt in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,
and as ſome ſay, in the World;
ſure I am, it far exceeds thoſe in <hi>Rome, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and all other places where I have been.
Within the Court-yard where their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
ſtands, they have ſeveral Rooms or
Schools, where their Children are taught
Hebrew, and very carefully (to the ſhame of
Chriſtians negligence) brought up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the Jewiſh Principles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for the wiſe Stateſmen it hath
produced, is ſaid to be a ſecond <hi>Athens;</hi>
others make it the Storehouſe or Magazine
of <hi>Europe,</hi> for that it hath ſuch great ſtore of
Corn, wherewith it furniſhes many other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And ſecondly, for the exceeding great
Magazine of Spices, which in ancient times
the <hi>Venetians</hi> brought by Land, furniſhing all
Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> but now is done by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company, which not only ſupplies
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57758:11"/>
                     <hi>Europe</hi> therewith, but many places in the
<hi>Indies</hi> alſo. Thirdly, It hath inconceivable
Store of all manner of Proviſions for War,
inſomuch, that <hi>England</hi> and divers other
Nations ſend to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to buy Arms,
Buff-Coats, Belts, Match, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, here
are ſeveral Shop-keepers who can deliver
Arms for four or five Thouſand Men, and
at a cheaper rate than can be got any where
elſe; and this they can do by reaſon of their
great Induſtry in the Ingroſſing moſt of the
Iron Works on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and other Rivers,
which run into <hi>Holland.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
hath more ſtore of ſawed and prepared
Timber for Shipping than can be found in
any one Nation in the World; and this is
the Reaſon why her Neighbor Town <hi>Sardam</hi>
is made capable of Building Ships 20 <hi>per
Cent.</hi> cheaper than they can do in <hi>England</hi>
or <hi>France:</hi> So that both <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>
do many times buy them in <hi>Holland:</hi> As
lately the King of <hi>Spain</hi> bought Ten Capital
Ships of the two Brothers the <hi>Melts</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in this City. Fifthly, <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is
the Staple where the Emperor ſells his Quick-ſilver,
not only to the Spaniard, to uſe in
his Mines in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but for the making
of <hi>Cinoprium</hi> or <hi>Vermillion,</hi> with which <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi>
furniſheth not only <hi>Europe,</hi> but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is the Market where
the French King bought his Marble for <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>

                  <p>The Stadthouſe, or Guild-hall of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> little in its Deſcription. This Noble Town-Houſe
then, is Built all of Free-Stone, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Modern Architecture of the
Corinthian Order, Adorned with Statues in
Braſs, and Carving in Marble by the beſt
Maſters of the Age. A Proſpect whereof
ſee in the following Figure. It is 282 Foot
wide, 232 Foot deep, and 116 Foot high,
beſides the Tower. The Foundation is laid
upon 13659 Piles of Wood driven into the
Ground; the firſt Stone of it was laid <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
28. 1648. In the middle over the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and juſt before the Tower, is a very
handſome piece of Carving in Marble of 82
Foot long, and 18 Foot high, wherein the
City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is repreſented by a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57758:14"/>
on whoſe Right Hand ſits the God
<hi>Neptune,</hi> with his Trident, and two Sea-Goddeſſes
bring her the Fruits of the Earth.
On her Left, two <hi>Naïdes</hi> preſent her with
Laurels and Palms; and before her two Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
Dance and Sound their Horns. On the
top of this ſtands an Image of Braſs, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Peace, and one on each ſide repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Providence and Juſtice, each Figure
being 12 Foot high. And on the back part
of the Building to anſwer, is ſuch another
piece of Carving, in Marble alſo, ſhewing
the Grandeur and Commerce of the City;
in the middle ſits a Woman, having on her
Head the Hat with Wings of <hi>Mercury;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
her is ſeen the Maſts and Sails of a Ship,
and round about her lies all ſorts of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Inſtruments uſed in Sailing; at her
Feet lie the two Rivers <hi>Y</hi> and <hi>Amſtel,</hi> and
on each ſide, the Inhabitants of the Four
Parts of the World bring her their Fruits.
Here likewiſe are placed three Images of
Braſs of the ſame bigneſs with the other;
that on the top is an <hi>Atlas,</hi> bearing a very
large Globe of Copper, on the right Hand,
one repreſenting Temperance, and on the
left Juſtice. On each of the four Corners of
the Building, over the Corniſh, ſtand four
Eagles of Braſs ſupporting an Imperial Crown,
all finely Gilt. In the middle is erected a
very handſom round Tower, advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
50 Foot above the reſt of the Building,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57758:14"/>
the Roof ſupported by Pillars, and adorned
with Images; in it hang a very curious
Chime of Bells, which at certain times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
played on by a Perſon maintained for
that purpoſe, afford a very agreeable Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.
So much for the out ſide. And now
let us enter, which you may by Seven little
Arched Doors, which let you into the Porch,
from whence you enter the Houſe by two
large Gates, between which opening by
Windows, (with Bars of Caſt-Braſs) to the
Street, ſtands the Juſtice-Hall for Trial of
Criminals, which is Adorned with many
curious Carvings in Marble of Ingenious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
which would be too long to deſcribe
particularly. Below Stairs, within ſide, is
kept the Office of the Bank, where the
Merchants write off their Money, the
Priſons both for Debtors and Criminals,
the Guard Chamber where the Citizens
keep the Head-Watch, and where the
Keys of the City Gates are kept lockt up in
a Cheſt every Night, and ſome other Offices.
From hence you aſcend by a handſome
broad pair of Stairs, though not very light,
into the Burghers-Hall, which is 120 Foot
long, 57 Foot broad, and 98 Foot high,
in the Floor whereof are inlaid in Marble
the two Faces of the Terreſtrial Globe, and
that of the Coeleſtial, which ingeniouſly
ſhews, as in a Map, the Situation of the
Countries of the Earth, and the Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57758:15"/>
in the Heavens: Each of which Maps
is 22 Foot Diameter. At the end of this
Hall is the Scheepens Chamber, where are
Tryed all Civil Cauſes between Man and
Man, and in the Galleries (which go round
two ſquare Courts on each ſide the Hall, for
convenience of Light) are the ſeveral Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
or Offices, belonging to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as the Council Chamber, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Common Council of the City, who
make Laws, chooſe the Burghermaſters, and
Scheepens, Deputies for the States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
Burghermaſters Chamber, who ſit there daily
to Adminiſter the Government: The Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghermaſters
withdrawing Room: The Schee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
Extraordinary Chamber: The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
Chambers, Ordinary and Extraordinary:
The Chamber of Accounts: That of the
Commiſſioners for Bankrupts: Another for
the Commiſſioners for Tryal of ſmall Cauſes,
like our Court of Conſcience: And one for
the Commiſſioners of the Hoſpitals; with
two or three more belonging to the ſeveral
Secretaries, all which are beautified with fine
Paintings, and ingenious Devices carved in
Marble over the Door of each Chamber; to
give a particular Deſcription of which would
take up a Volume, which is not agreeable to
what I here pretend, theſe being only ſhort
Remarks to put young Travallers in mind
of what is moſt worthy their Obſervation.
I ſhall only therefore ſay in general, that it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57758:15"/>
is already a very noble, beautiful, and coſtly
Building, and is a ſufficient intimation of the
Richneſs of the City, but ſhould they finiſh
it within ſide as they pretend, by Painting
the Ceilings, and Facing the Walls with
Marble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it would make it incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the fineſt and coſtlieſt in the World.
Over theſe Chambers, in the ſecond Story,
is kept a large Magazine of Arms, which
takes up one Angle of the Building, and is
very compleatly Furniſhed; the Arms are
all kept in Preſſes ſhut up, to avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
of the Weather; the reſt of the Houſe
above is not uſed, or Furniſhed at all. One
thing I muſt not omit, and that is, That
there are Eight Ciſterns of Water kept always
full at the top of the Houſe, which by Pipes
may be let down into every Room, to quench
any accidental Fire; and the Chimneys are
all lined with Copper, the former Stadthouſe
having been Burnt down by Accident.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed, and ſpeak of their
Alms-houſes, and of the Government of the
Poor, of their Priſons, and Houſes of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
This City is ſaid to have 20000
Poor every day at Bed and Board. The
Alms-houſes are many, and look more like
Princes Palaces than Lodgings for Poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
Firſt, there are Houſes for Poor old
Men and Women, then a large ſquare Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
for 300 Widows, then there are Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
for Boys and Girls, for Burghers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57758:16"/>
and for Strangers Children, or thoſe
called Foundlings; all theſe Boys and Girls
have every Sunday, and other days of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
two Doites given them by the Fathers
of theſe Houſes, the which the Children put
into the Deacons Bag when they gather for
the Poor in the Churches: Then there is an
Hoſpital for Fools, and a Bedlam: There
are Houſes where common Beggers, and
Gameſters, and frequenters of Tap-houſes
are kept hard at Work: There is alſo a Houſe
called, the Raſp-houſe, where petty Thieves,
and ſuch as flaſh one another with Knives,
ſuch as beg with cheating Devices, Women
with fained great Bellies, Men pretending to
have been taken by the Turks, others that
pretend Wreck at Sea, and ſuch as Beg with
a Clapper, or a Bell, as if they could not
Speak or Hear, ſuch as theſe are kept hard
at Work, Raſping every day 50 pounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two of them, or elſe are beaten with
a Bulls Piſſel, and if yet they Rebel, and
wont Work, they are ſet in a Tub, where
if they do not Pump, the Water will ſwell
over their Heads: Then there is a Houſe
where Whores are kept to Work, as alſo
diſ-Obedient Children, who live Idle, and
take no Courſe to maintain themſelves; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Women commonly drinking themſelves
Drunk, and Scolds; all theſe ſorts of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and Alms-houſes are ſtately Buildings,
richly Adorned with Pictures, and their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57758:16"/>
Lodgings very neat and clean. In ſome, of
the Boys and Girls Hoſpitals there are 1500,
in ſome 800, and in ſome 500 in a Houſe;
then they have Houſes where a Man or a
Woman may have their Diet, Waſhing, and
Lodging for his Life, giving a ſmall Sum of
Money; theſe are called <hi>Brouders</hi> Houſes.
The Alms Children of this City are held in
ſuch Veneration and Reſpect, that a Man had
as good ſtrike a Burghermaſters Child as one
of them. Theſe Children are permitted to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
in any of the Treckſcuts, or Paſſage-Boats,
freely without Money: Theſe Hoſpitals are
Governed by Men and Women, as are of an
unſpotted Life, and reputed to be Rich, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout,
and Pious: It is very obſervable, that
the Women govern their Women Hoſpitals,
better than the Men do theirs; yea, it is a
general Obſervation in this Country, that
where the Women have the direction of the
Purſe and Trade, the Husband ſeldom prove
Bankrupts, it being the property of a true
Born Holland-Wife preſently after Marriage,
to apply her ſelf wholly to her Buſineſs; but
I forbear to ſay any more of the Dutch-houſewives,
for fear of diſpleaſing our Engliſh
Dames, not ſo much addicted, at leaſt not ſo
generally bred up to Induſtry; But to return
to the Acts of Charity of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the
which is ſo extraordinary, that they ſurpaſs
all other Cities in the World, for they are
daily and hourly giving to the Poor, every

Houſe in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> hath a Box hanging in
a Chain, on which is Written, <hi>Think on the
Poor,</hi> ſo that when any Merchant ſells Goods,
they commonly conclude no Bargain, but
more or leſs is put in the Poors Box; theſe
Boxes are lockt up by the Deacons, who
once a quarter go round the City, and take
the Money out of the Boxes. Then twice a
Week there are Men belonging to the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
that go round the City, and ring a Bell
at every Houſe, to know what the Maſter
or Miſtriſs of the Houſe will give to the
Box, who generally give not leſs than two
Stivers. Then every firſt Wedneſday of the
Month, the Deacons in their turn, go round
the City, from Houſe to Houſe, to receive
what every Houſe-keeper will give to the
Poor, then on the Week before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is given, a Miniſter, with an Elder,
goes round the City to every Houſe where
any Members of the Presbiterian Religion
live, and there ask if any differences be in
the Family, offering their Service to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them; alſo to inſtruct and prepare ſuch
as are to receive the Sacrament: At this time
a Miniſter may be ſeen to go into a Tap-houſe
or Tavern, for which at another time
he would be counted a Wine-Bibber, and the
worſt of Reprobates: At this time while
theſe Miniſters and Elders go about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on their Viſitations, the People take an
occaſion to give to the Poor. And here I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57758:18"/>
ought not to omit telling you of their great
Charity to the diſtreſſed French Proteſtants,
who are here in great Numbers. They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
no leſs than 60 French Miniſters, and
unto many Handicraft Tradeſmen, and
makers of Stuffs, and Cloth, they lend Sums
of Money, without Intereſt, to buy Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tools, and Materials for their Work;
but this is no other then they formerly did to
the Poor diſtreſſed Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> and
<hi>Piemont;</hi> and their Charity was not a little
that they gave to <hi>Geneva</hi> towards the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their Fortifications; and here give me
leave to tell you, what King <hi>Charles</hi> II.
ſaid of the Charity of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> when the
Duke of <hi>Lotherdal,</hi> hearing that the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi>'s Army was not able to oppoſe the
French from advancing ſo near to <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
the Duke jearingly ſaid, <hi>That Oranges
would be very ſcarce in</hi> Holland, <hi>after</hi> Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>ſhould fall into the French Hands to plunder.</hi>
To which His Majeſty ſaid, <hi>That he was of
Opinion, that God would preſerve</hi> Amſterdam
<hi>from being deſtroyed, if it were only for the great
Charity they have for the Poor,</hi> the which put
the Duke out of Countenance; I will ſay no
more of their Charity, only this, that they
leave no Stone unturned to bring Monies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Poors Stock; they make the Stage-players
pay 80000 Gilders a year to the Poor;
there is not a Rope-Dancer, Poppet-Player, or
any of that ſort of unneceſſary Vermin which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57758:19"/>
frequent Fairs, but pay the third Penny to
the Poor, which is carefully looked after, by
placing an Alms-man at the Door of the
Booths, to ſee that they cheat not the Poor
of their ſhare. I ſhall now in the next place
ſay ſomething of the Clergy, I mean thoſe
called, <hi>The States Clergy,</hi> for the States are
abſolutely Head of their Church; and when
any Synod of Divines meet, two of the States
are always preſent to hear that they debate
nothing relating, or reflecting on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or Governors; if they do, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
the States cry, <hi>Ho la mij<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Heeren Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicanten,</hi>
and if their Miniſters meddle with
any thing relating to the Government in
their Pulpits, they ſend them a Brief, (which
ſome call a pair of Shooes) to quit the City,
and ſometimes Impriſon them to Boot; but
if they behave themſelves quietly and well,
as they ought to do, they then are reſpected
by the People as Gods upon Earth: They
have a Form of Prayer ſent them how they
ſhall Pray for the States, and Stadholder,
nor muſt they meddle with any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in the Country, becauſe all ſorts are
Tollerated, at leaſt Connived at by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.
All thoſe called the Presbiterian
Miniſters, or States Clergy, are obliged
under a Forfeiture to have done Preaching
and Praying by Eleven of the Clock in the
Forenoon on Sundays, becauſe then the
Scheepens go to the Stadthouſe, to Marry
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57758:19"/>
the Jews, Papiſts, and Lutherans, and others
that may not marry after the Calviniſtical
Form; and the reaſon why the States thus
marry them firſt according to Law, is to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Children Legitimate, but they may
marry again afterwards as they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
None may marry until they have
made their appearance at the Stadthouſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lords; where, if the Parties be
agreed, the Preachers marry the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi>
and the Scheepens marry all the reſt, who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from the Religion eſtabliſhed by Law.</p>
                  <p>When one dies, the Friends dare not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Corps until it hath lain three days
open in the Coffin, that the Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of the deceaſed may be ſatisfied that
the Party hath not been murdered, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to be dead when alive; after three
days, the Corps muſt be brought to the
Church before the Bell ceaſeth tolling, which
is at two, for if you keep the Body untill half
three, then the Church Doors are lock'd,
and for the firſt half hour muſt be paid 25
Gilders, and for the ſecond 50, and ſo until
ſix, then they may amerſe you as much as
they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>There are many rich people who make
that default on purpoſe, that they may have
ſolemn occaſion of giving to the Poor, as I
knew once an Engliſh Merchant did.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I ſhall ſpeak of, is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
which the States obſerve in ordering
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57758:20"/>
their Maritime Affairs, one of the greateſt
Myſteries in their Government: The States
General divide their Admiralty into Five
Courts, which they call Chambers. The
Firſt is <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> (which is the Chamber
call'd the <hi>Maeſe,)</hi> and hath the Admirals
Flag.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which hath the Vice-Admiral's
Flag; and <hi>Zealand</hi> hath the Rear-Admiral's
Flag; the other Two Chambers
are thoſe in <hi>North-Holland</hi> and <hi>Fricſland.</hi> Each
of theſe Five Chambers have their Admirals,
Vice-Admirals, and Rear-Admirals, apart
from the States-Generals Flags; ſo that when
the States have occaſion to ſet out a Fleet
of an Hundred Ships, more or leſs, every
Chamber knows the number they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for their proportion, though in regard
of its Opulency, <hi>Amſterdam</hi> frequently helps
her Neighbours, and adds two, or more, Ships
than their ſhare comes to. Theſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
have lately built 36 Men of War, and
now are building of 7 more; and all this is
done without noiſe, every one building their
proportion: And they have admirable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
in preſerving their Ships when built,
and their Magazines are in good order, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ship having an Apartment to lay up all
its Equipage in; and at the top of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines
are vaſt Ciſterns, which are kept
conſtantly full of Water, having Pipes into
every Apartment to let it down upon any
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57758:20"/>
accident of Fire. And there is in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines
a Nurſery Room, where a Woman
keeps an Office, to feed at certain hours of
the day a great number of Cats, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
hunt among the Stores for Mice and
Rats. This great Magazine in <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
was built in the time of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> in the
ſpace of 9 months and 14 days, in which
time the Lords of the Admiralty gave the
Workmen <hi>drinkgelt</hi> as they call it, to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them to work more than at an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rate. At this time, the biggeſt Man of
War the States had was the <hi>Amelia,</hi> in which
the famous Admiral <hi>Trump</hi> was kill'd; ſhe
was a Ship of no more than 56 Guns, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
made a Fire-ſhip. But the States quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcovered their want of great Ships, and
therefore built, the ſame year 20 Men of
War, from 50 to 80 Guns: But the great
Ships built at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> had like to have
proved of no uſe, had not the ingenious
Penſionary <hi>de Wit</hi> found out a device to carry
them over the <hi>Pampus,</hi> betwixt thoſe they
call Water Ships.</p>
                  <p>The Admiralty have an excellent method
in ſetting out their Fleets, they neither preſs
Soldiers nor Seamen, all go voluntary at the
beating of a Drum, each Captain providing
Men and Proviſions for his Ship, who, after
they have received Orders from the Lords
to the Equipage-Maſter to equip out their
Ships, and receive the Proviſions of War,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57758:21"/>
then the States ſend aboard each Ship a
Chaplain, and Check-maſter, who take care
of the proviſion of War, and ſee that the
Seamen have the States Allowance, and
wholeſom Food: And great care is taken by
the Lords, that both Captains and Seamen
receive their Pay punctually for the time
they are in the States Service: And for the
incouraging their Seamen, there is plaiſtred
on a Board, hanging by the Foremaſt, the
ſeveral Rewards to ſuch as either take or fire
a Flag-ſhip, or take or ſink any other Ship of
the Enemies: Alſo what Penſions a wounded
Seaman ſhall have, if maim'd or diſabled in
the States Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords of the Admiralty follow the
ſame methods which the States-General ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
as to their Land Obligations, and go
through this great Charge by the good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of their Credit; for though it be
true, that they are indebted great Sums of
Money, yet they never want a Supply, nay,
Moneys are often forced upon them by rich
Merchants, who ſend in their Moneys, and
only take the Admiralties Obligations, with
which they afterward pay their Cuſtoms,
when their Ships arrive, at which time the
Admiralty allows them Intereſt for the time
they have had their Money: And this is it
that makes the Admiralties Obligations more
valued than ready Money, for it ſaves the
trouble of telling: And ſuch is the Credit
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57758:21"/>
of the Admiralty, that when they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for any Goods, the People ſtrive to
furniſh them, and rather take their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
than Money, becauſe they get Intereſt;
and all other Aſſignments upon the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
are very punctually paid, and without
Exchequer Fees; no they are Sworn Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
who are forbid to receive any Monies
for Fees, being contented with the Sallery
they have of the States. And their methods
uſed at the Cuſtom-houſe for loading or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading
Ships are very eaſie, inſomuch, that
the Women generally have the charging and
diſcharging the Ships at the Cuſtom-houſe,
which is a great Policy in the States to make
Trade eaſie for the Encouragement of the
Merchants: And the Admiralty are very
grateful and generous unto their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
if any of their Admirals, or Captains
are kill'd at Sea, and have done any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Service, they then Eternize their
Memories with laſting Trophies of Honour,
as you may ſee by thoſe Stately Monuments
of <hi>Trump, Updam, de Ruiter,</hi> the <hi>Everſons,</hi>
and others; nor are they ſparing in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
large Gifts and Penſions on the Widows,
and Children of thoſe as have ſerved them
Faithfully and Valiantly in the Wars, whilſt
the Treacherous and Cowards meet with the
ſeverity they deſerve; I might here in the
next place, inlarge and tell you of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
methods they have in Building, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57758:22"/>
preſerving their Ships when Built, but I ſhall
refer you to that excellent Peice written by
the <hi>Heer Witſen</hi> on that Subject. And ſhall
now in the next place ſay ſomething of their
Famous Company, called the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company of the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> this Company
is ſaid to be a Commonwealth within a
Commonwealth, and it is true, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Soveraign Power and Privileges they
have granted them by the States General,
and likewiſe conſider their Riches, and vaſt
number of Subjects, and the many Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Colonies they poſſeſs in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
they are ſaid to have 30000 Men in
conſtant Pay, and above 200 Capital Ships,
beſides Sloops, Ketches, and Yachts. This
Company hath by their Politick Contrivances,
and Sedulous Induſtry poſſeſſed themſelves
of many Colonies formerly belonging unto
the Spaniards, Portuguiſes, and divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Princes, and as good Chriſtians have
been at great Charge in Planting the Goſpel
of Chriſt in many parts there, Printing in
the Indian Language Bibles, and Prayer
Books, and Catechiſms, for the Inſtruction
of the Indians, maintaining Miniſters and
School-maſters, to inform thoſe that are
Converted to the Chriſtian Faith: And now,
becauſe I have ſaid that this Company is ſo
conſiderable, and as it were a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
apart, I will demonſtrate it to be ſo;
firſt by their Power, Riches, and Strength
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57758:22"/>
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſecondly, what Figure they
make in <hi>Europe,</hi> and this very briefly, for if
I ſhould ſpeak of every particular, as to
their Poſſeſſions in the <hi>Indies,</hi> it would ſwell
into many Volumes, but I will only begin
with them at the <hi>Cape de bonne Eſperance,</hi>
where they have built a Royal Fort, in which
they maintain a Gariſon of Soldiers to defend
their Ships which come there to take in freſh
Water: From thence let us take a view of
them in the Iſland of <hi>Java;</hi> where they have
built a fair City called <hi>Battavia,</hi> and Fortified
it with Baſtions, after the mode of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
This City is the place of Reſidence of
their grand Miniſter of State, called the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> he hath allowed him Six
Privy Counſellors in Ordinary, and Two
Extraordinary, theſe govern the Concerns
of the Company throughout the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
they make Peace and War, ſend their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
to all parts thereof, as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.
This General hath his Guards of
Horſe and Foot, and all ſorts of Officers and
Servants, as if he were a Soveraign Prince,
the whole Expence whereof is defrayed out
of the Companies Stock. This General hath
much of the direction of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and other
parts of the Iſland of <hi>Java:</hi> From whence
let us take a view of them in their great
Poſſeſſions in the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands, and thoſe
of <hi>Banda,</hi> where they are become ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
that they look as if they aimed at the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57758:23"/>
Soveraignty of the South Seas: They have
alſo a great Trade in <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> from
whence let us return to the Iſlands of <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
and on the Coaſt of <hi>Bengale,</hi> where
they have ſeveral Lodges: In <hi>Perſia</hi> they have
likewiſe great Commerce, and are ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
that they wage War with that
mighty Monarch if he wrongs them in their
Trade. They alſo have ſeveral Colonies and
Lodges on the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel,</hi>
and in the Country of the Great
<hi>Mogul,</hi> and King of <hi>Galcanda,</hi> but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
let us behold them in the rich Iſland of
<hi>Zeylon,</hi> where they are Maſters of the plain
Country, ſo that the Emperor, or King of that
Iſland, is forced to live in the Mountains,
whilſt this Company poſſeſs the City of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomba,</hi>
and other the moſt conſiderable Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
of that Iſland: It is ſaid, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
hath there in their pay 3600 Soldiers,
and at leaſt 300 Guns Planted in their Forts
and Gariſons; in a word, they are not only
Maſters of the Cinnamon, but of all other
Spices except Pepper, and that they would
alſo have, had it been for their Intereſt to
Ingroſs, but they wiſely foreſaw that the
Engliſh would be a block in their way, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they contented themſelves to be Maſters
of the Mace, Cinnamon, Cloves, and Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs,
with which they not only ſerve <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
but many places in the <hi>Indies;</hi> I will
ſay no more of them in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but let us
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57758:23"/>
ſee what Figure they make in <hi>Europe.</hi> And
firſt to begin with them in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
where they have two large ſtately Palaces,
one being in the old part of the City, and
the other in the new; in that of the old part
of the City they keep their Court, and there
ſits the Reſident Committee of the Company,
where alſo they make the Sales of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
Goods. There for ſix years the grand
Council, or Aſſembly of the Seventeen, do
meet, and after ſix years are expired, the
grand Council of the Seventeen do aſſemble
at <hi>Middelburg</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> for two years, and
then again return to <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> the other
leſſer Chambers of <hi>Delft, Rotterdam, Horne,</hi> and
<hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>chuyſen</hi> never having the Aſſembly of the
Seventeen in their Chambers, ſo that only
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> have the Honour of
that grand Council. I will therefore crave
leave to deſcribe unto you the Chamber of
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> it being the moſt conſiderable
of the Chambers belonging to this Famous
Company: In their Houſe or Palace, within
the old City, are many large Offices or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments;
as firſt, on the lower Floor is
their Parliament Chamber, where the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
do ſit; next to this Chamber are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
fair Chambers for the Committees to ſit
in. They have alſo a Chamber of Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
where they do receive Princes or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
or other great Men as have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſpeak with them. In one of theſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57758:24"/>
Chambers are the Arms of ſeveral Indian
Princes they have Conquered. On the ſame
Floor is their Treaſury Office, where their
Receivers ſit and receive Money, and Pay
out the Orders or Aſſignments of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
near to that Chamber ſits their grand
Miniſter, the Heer <hi>Peter van Dam,</hi> who is
ſaid to be a ſecond <hi>John de Wit</hi> for Parts, tho'
not ſo in Principle: This great Miniſter is a
Man of indefatagable Induſtry, and labours
Night and Day in the Companies Service;
he Reads over twice the great Journal Books
which come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and out of them
makes Minutes to prepare matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
neceſſary to be conſidered by the grand
Council of Seventeen, and by the inferiour
Committees of the Company, and prepares
Inſtructions and Orders to be ſent to their
Chief Miniſters in the <hi>Indies;</hi> I could ſay
many more things of his great Worth and
Virtues, but ſhall forbear leſt I ſhould be
judged a Flatterer: Over-againſt this great
Miniſters Office ſit in a Chamber many
Clarks, or under Secretaries, who receive
from this Miniſter their Orders of Diſpatches
in the Affairs of the Company; and next to
this Chamber is a Regiſter Office, where are
kept the Journal Books of the <hi>Indies,</hi> where
you may ſee the Names of all the Men and
Women that have ever ſerved the Company
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> with the time of their Death,
or departing the Companies Service: Then
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57758:24"/>
next to that is a Council Chamber, where
the Reſiding Chamber, or Committee of the
Company always ſits; then aſſending up
Stairs, there ſit their Book-holders, who keep
the Accounts of all the Tranſactions of thoſe
that buy or ſell Actions of the Company, and
over againſt this Office ſits the <hi>Heer Gerbrand
Elias,</hi> who is the ſecond Advocate of the
Company: On this Floor are ſeveral large
Rooms, in which are great Stores of Pack'd
Goods, and alſo a Room with all ſorts of
Drugs, Tea, Wax, Ambergreace, and Musk;
and on the ſame Floor is a Chamber where
the Commiſſioners ſit, who govern the Pack-houſes;
and next to them ſit their Clerks,
who keep the Regiſters of the Sales of the
Companies Goods: And on the ſame Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
or Floor, is a Chamber where are kept
the ſeveral Books of Divinity, Printed in the
Indian Language, that are ſent to the ſeveral
Colonies of the Company: And at the end
of this Gallery is a Magazine full of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments
and Inſtruments for Barber Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
Cheſts, to furniſh the Companies Ships
and Gariſons in the <hi>Indies:</hi> Then aſſending
up another pair of Stairs, there are ſeveral
large Magazines of Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace,
and Cinnamon; and in a long Gallery are
many Men at Work ſorting of Spices fit for
Sale: Then aſcending up another pair of
Stairs there are many Rooms full of Spices;
then deſcending into the Court-yard, there
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57758:25"/>
is Guard Chamber, where every Night the
Houſe-keeper hath a Watch, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of the Gate there is a Chymiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
with his Men prepares Medicaments for the
<hi>Indies;</hi> adjoyning to this Court-yard is their
Ware-houſe and Pack-houſe for Pepper and
Groſs Goods; but before I leave this Houſe
in the old part of the City, I muſt ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the manner or method uſed in the
Tranſactions of the Jews and others, who
make a Trade of Buying and Selling the
Actions of the Company, the which is a great
Myſtory of Iniquity, and where it inricheth
one Man, it ruins an hundred. The Jews
are the chief in that Trade, and are ſaid to
Negotiate 17 parts of 20 in the Company;
Theſe Actions are bought and ſold four times
a day, at 8 in the Morning in the Jews-ſtreet,
at a 11 on the Dam, at 12 and at one a
Clock upon the Exchange, and at ſix in the
Evening on the Dam, and in the Colleges or
Clubs of the Jews until 12 at midnight,
where many times the crafty Jews, and others
have contrived to coin bad News to make
the Actions fall, and good News to raiſe
them, the which Craft of doing at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
is not taken notice of, which is much
to be wondred at, in ſuch a Wiſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is; for it is a certain
Truth, they many times ſpread Scandalous
Reports touching the Affairs of State, which
paſs amongſt the Ignorant for Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57758:25"/>
I ſhall now in the next place ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their Palace, or Magazine, in the
new part of the City, the which may more
properly be called an Arſenal: It is a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo ſuperb, that it looks more like a Kings
Palace, than a Magazine for Merchants: I
have meaſured the Ground on which this
Arſenal ſtands, which I find to be 2000
Foot, and ſquare every way, reckoning the
Motes, or Burgals, about it. I remember
the Ingenious Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> meaſured
the two Rope-Alleys, by telling the Stone-Figures
in the Wall, and found them to be
1800 Foot long, the like whereof is not to
be ſeen in the World. On the backſide
of this Rope-Alley lies a ſtore of Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
large Anchors, beſides ſmall ones; in
this Arſenal they build the Ships belonging
to this Chamber: And here are all ſorts of
Work-houſes for the Artificers that ſerve the
Company. And in a Chamber next to
the Joyners Office, is a model of a Ship,
they now build their Ships by, which coſt
6000 Gilders. When a Man beholds the
great Stores of Timber, Cordage, and the
Proviſions of War in their Magazine, a Man
would think there were enough to furniſh
a whole Nation: In this Arſenal the Ships
unload their Goods, laid up in ſeveral Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the grand Magazine, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is removed to the Houſe in the old
part of the City, as there is occaſion for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57758:26"/>
Sale. In the upper part of this large Palace
ſit the Sail-makers at work; but on the lower
part of this Houſe is an Apartment where
the Committee aſſemble upon occaſion
of Buſineſs: This Arſenal is not to be ſeen
by Strangers without a Ticket from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winthebbers.
Now all what I have ſpoken
of theſe two Houſes, or Magazines, doth
only belong unto the Chamber of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
There are yet other Chambers of
the Company, who, according to their Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
or ſtock in the Company, have the like
Houſes and Magazines, as the Chambers of
<hi>Zealand, Delft, Rotterdam, Horne,</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuſen.</hi>
And now I have named the Six
Chambers, of which the Company is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
I ſhall ſay ſomething of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
which is from an Octroy, or Act
of the States-General; by which they have
Sovereign Power over their Servants in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> yea, their Authority reacheth their
Servants in all Territories of the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
Dominions: It is Death for any of the
States Subjects to be Interlopers againſt this
Company; nor may any, of what Nation
ſoever, that lives in any of the Companies
Territories, as Burghers or Servants, return
into <hi>Europe</hi> without leave from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
only thoſe called Freemen may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
without asking leave to remove: The
Grand Councel of this Company is the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of the Seventeen, which are elected
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57758:26"/>
out of the ſeveral Chambers before named,
that is, Eight from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and four
from <hi>Zealand; Delft, Rotterdam, Horne,</hi> and
<hi>Enkuſen,</hi> ſend one a piece, which makes Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
and the five leſſer Chambers by turns
choſe the Seventeenth. In the Chamber of
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> there are 20 Bewinthebbers, or
Committee for Management of the Stock, in
ordinary, who are for Life, and have 1000
Ducatoons a Year, and Spices at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi>
and their Travelling Charges, when they go
upon the Companies Service. The next
Chamber is <hi>Zealand,</hi> which hath twelve Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winthebbers,
who have about 250 <hi>l.</hi> a Year,
and travelling Charges, and Spices at <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
The next is <hi>Delft,</hi> which hath Seven
Bewinthebbers, who have only 120 <hi>l.</hi> a Year,
and Travelling Charges and Spices at <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
The other Chambers of <hi>Rotterdam,
Horne</hi> and <hi>Enkuſen,</hi> have ſeven Bewintheb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
a piece, and the like Salary, with Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
Charges and Spices at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> as
the Chamber of <hi>Delft</hi> hath. Theſe Bewin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thebbers
are elected or choſen out of thoſe
<hi>Adventurers</hi> called the High <hi>Participanten</hi> of
the Company: They generally chuſe ſuch
as are Rich, and Men of Parts and Wiſdom,
moſt of them being of the Magiſtracy of the
Country. No Man is capable of being Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a Bewinthebber who hath not 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
Stock in the Company. In a word, this
Grand Council of the Seventeen make Laws
for the Governing the Company, both in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57758:27"/>
                     <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> It is they that appoint the
Days of Sale, and what Number of Ships
each Chamber muſt ſend to the <hi>Indies;</hi> and
likewiſe order the Building of Ships, and all
other grand Concerns. This Company is
worthily eſteemed a Wiſe, Politique, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
Company, ſparing no coſt to get
good Intelligence of Affairs, ſending Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
and Expreſſes over-Land to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
They have their <hi>Spies</hi> and <hi>Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
in all the conſiderable Trading Parts of
the World: They have been ſo induſtrious
as to gain the Spice Trade, not only from
the Venetians, Spaniards, Portuguiſes, French,
Danes, and other European Nations, but
have alſo Ingroſſed all the Spices; ſo that,
as I told you before, they ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Spices to the
Indians themſelves: But this I muſt ſay for
them, that they are a Generous Company,
and gratefully paying Reſpects where it is
due, as lately they have Complemented his
Royal Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Sum out of the Profits of their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to make him their Friend and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
Neither are they backward in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Preſents upon Strangers that have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them, as I could inſtance in ſome of our
own Nation. They are alſo very charitable
to the Poor, giving them the Thouſandth
Gilder of all the Goods they ſell. And to
all the Reformed Miniſters in <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57758:27"/>
they ſend Spices at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> to pray every
<hi>Sunday</hi> for the Welfare and Proſperity of the
Company. To conclude, this Company is
a Buckler and Defence for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
upon all urgent Occaſions: And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our Engliſh <hi>Eaſt-India-Company</hi> might be
the ſame to our King, if the Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Two Companies were compoſed;
eſpecially now they have ſuch a great King
to protect them, and that the Interlopers
are deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>And now it is high time I ſhould tell you
the Methods a Stranger muſt take if he hath
occaſion to keep Houſe in <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> If a
Man will hire an Houſe, he muſt take a
Leaſe upon Seal'd Paper, for which you
muſt pay a Tax to the States, and pay the
Broaker that makes the Bargain: But before
you can buy a Houſe, you muſt be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to be made a Burgher. To this purpoſe it
is uſual to take with you to the Stadthouſe
your Broaker, or any two Securities, and
there before the Burghermaſters take the
Oath of Burgherſchap, which is to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the City, to the Magiſtrates and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if you buy either Land
or Houſes, and lodge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> privately, you will find
your caſe much worſe; then you muſt pay
a Legion of Taxes to the Mills that drain
your Lands, and for maintaining the Banks
and Sluces; and if the States have occaſion
to build a Fortification on your Lands, or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57758:28"/>
to drown them in time of War, you muſt
be contented with the States Terms: And
if your Houſe or Houſes ſtand empty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Tenants, yet you muſt pay the States
Taxes on that Houſe or Houſes. Thus much
for the Method how you are to be advanced
to be a Burgher of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and to give
you a taſte what you are to pay for Houſes
or Land, if you ſettle there; and if you have
either purchaſed or hired an Houſe, then
comes an Officer from the Stadthouſe, with
a Printed Sealed Paper, who tells you, you
muſt pay as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A Pole-Tax for every Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Servant in the Houſe above eight Years
old, ſix Gilders a Year.</p>
                  <p>For a Coach, if you keep one, 75 Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
a Year.</p>
                  <p>For a Coach without Wheels, 50 Gilders
a Year.</p>
                  <p>For Soap, as the Number of the Family
is.</p>
                  <p>The like for Salt.</p>
                  <p>For Wine, as your Quality is.</p>
                  <p>To the Watch, as your Houſe is in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>To the Lanthorns, as the largeneſs of the
Houſe is.</p>
                  <p>For Butter, every 20 Pound ſeven Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                  <p>For Beans, half as much as you pay for
the Beans.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:57758:28"/>
For Turff, every Tun five Stivers.</p>
                  <p>For every 20 Gilders in Wood, ſix Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>For Fleſh the Tax often changeth.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a Tax on the Bread.</p>
                  <p>Then there is a Tax called the 200th
Penny, and a Tax called the 8th: Then
there are many Taxes in Trade, as that no
Man can weigh or meaſure out his own
Goods if ſold in groſs, but the States Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
muſt do it. Then the States have a Tax
called the <hi>Verpounding</hi> on all Lands and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in their Dominions. Then they have a
Tax on Seal'd Paper, and a Tax for Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering
Land <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Houſes; likewiſe a Tax on
Cows, Horſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Calves, and on all ſort of
Fruit. There are many other Taxes I could
name, as a Stiver for every Man that goes
out or into any City after the Hour of ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Gates. Alſo you pay for going
over ſome Bridges, and paſſing through
Gates called <hi>Tolhek,</hi> a Stiver for every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but Coaches, Wagons or Horſes pay
more. Theſe I have already named, you
will ſay, are too many; yet I may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
to tell you, that Milk firſt pays as Milk;
and again if it be made Butter; yea, the
Buttermilk and Whay pays a Tax likewiſe,
for all which a Man would think that a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that ſtand ſo much upon maintaining of
their Liberty ſhould Mutiny, and refuſe pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But this ſeldom happens; and if it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57758:29"/>
doth, the States puniſh them very ſeverely.
I remember that in my time there was a
Mutiny at <hi>Sardam</hi> about paying a new Tax,
whereupon the States ſent a Regiment of
their Souldiers, and ſeized the Heads of the
Mutineers, and hanged up five or ſix of them
at the Towns end, and ſeverely whipt eight
under the Gallows. And in the rich City
of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> if any refuſe to pay their Tax,
the Magiſtrates ſend their Officer to pull off
their Doors; and if they remain long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate,
they ſend and fetch away the lower
Windows of their Houſe, and they dare not
put up others, until they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>id the Taxes.
However, this is obſervable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> if any Man

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> he is taxed
at, then he is free: But there are many ſo
proud, that they will not let the World
know their Condition. I knew a Merchant
named <hi>Ornia,</hi> who paid during the War for
his 200th Penny, and other Taxes for his
and his Wives Children, (having had two
Rich Wives) 14000 Pounds Sterling. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
knew an Engliſh Anabaptiſt Merchant,
who told the Engliſh Envoy in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
That he had paid near 4000 <hi>l.</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to the War, and yet the ſame Man did
Grumble to pay his Majeſties Conſul a pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Fee or Conſulat-Money on his Ships:
The reaſon whereof I once asked him, who
anſwered me, That the King could not raiſe
a Penny in <hi>England</hi> without his Parliament,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57758:29"/>
and therefore much leſs could he do it in the
States Country. Thus theſe Phanaticks had
rather make Bricks without Straw, than pay
the leaſt Tribute to their Natural Prince's
Officer. Should we in <hi>England</hi> be obliged
to pay the Taxes that are here impoſed,
there would be Rebellion upon Rebellion:
And yet after all that is here paid, no Man
may bake his own Bread, or grind his own
Corn, or brew his Beer, nor dare any Man
keep in his Houſe a Hand-Mill, although it
be but to grind Muſtard or Coffee. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
one Mrs. <hi>Guyn</hi> a Coffee-Woman at
<hi>Rotterdam,</hi> had like to have been ruined for
grinding her own Coffee, had not Sir <hi>Lyonel
Jenkins</hi> employed his Secretary Doctor <hi>Wyn</hi>
to intreat the States on her behalf; and it
was reckoned a grand favour that ſhe was
only fined, and not baniſhed the City, and
forfeiture made of all her Goods. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
alſo a Landlord of mine in <hi>Leyden</hi> bought
a live Pig in the Market, and innocently
brought it home, and kill'd it, for which he
had like to have been ruined, becauſe he did
not firſt ſend to the Exciſemen to exciſe it,
and alſo let the Viſitors ſee that the Pig was
free from Diſeaſes. At another time a Wine-Merchant
coming to give me a Viſit, told me
that he had the rareſt Rheniſh in the City,
and that if I would ſend my Maid to his Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
with ſix Bottles, they ſhould be fill'd:
Whereupon I ſent the Maid only with two
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57758:30"/>
Bottles, and charged her to hide them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her Apron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch was her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that the Scouts Dienaers met her, and
ſeized her and her Bottles, and carried her
to Priſon, which coſt the Wine-Merchant
1500 Gilders; and had it not been for the
ſtrongeſt Sollicitations made by us, he had
been ruined: So ſacred are Taxes here, and
muſt ſo exactly be paid. And were they
not here ſo preciſe, it were impoſſible for
ſo ſmall a Country to ſubſiſt: And therefore
you may hear the Inhabitants generally ſay,
that what they ſuffer is for their <hi>Vaderland:</hi>
Hence the meaneſt among them are content
to pay what is laid on them, for they ſay all
what is the <hi>Vaderlands</hi> is ours, the Men of
War are theirs, the ſumptuous Magazins,
Bridges, and every thing what is the <hi>Vader<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi>
And indeed in a ſenſe it is ſo, for
they have this to comfort them, that if it
pleaſe God to viſit them with Poverty, they
and their Children have the Publick Purſe
to maintain them; and this is one main Reaſon
why they ſo willingly pay their Taxes as they
do; for there's not a Soul born in the States
Dominions that wants warm Cloaths and
Dyet, and good Lodging, if they make their
caſe known to the Magiſtrates. And for the
Vagabonds that rove up and down the
Streets, they are either Walloons, or other
Strangers as pretend to have been ruined by
the late Wars.</p>

I ſhall now in the next place let you
know how excellently the Laws are here
executed againſt Fraud and Perjury, and
the Intention of Murders; which Laws were
once much uſed in <hi>England,</hi> as you ſhall
hear hereafter when I ſpeak of the Duke of
<hi>Brandenburgh</hi>'s Court.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here inſtance a few particulars that
happened in my time: There was a Spark
that made falſe Aſſignments on the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,
who tho' related to many of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> had his Head cut off;
and another who was a Clerk in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Bank, who made falſe Poſts in their
Books, and had his Head alſo cut off; and all
the Portions he had given with his Daughters,
the Husbands were forced to pay back, and
all his Houſes and Goods were ſold at his
Door in the open Streets: I knew a French
Marquis, who ſwore his Regiment was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
and when the States knew that he had
not half his Regiment, he likewiſe had his
Head cut off in the Priſon in the <hi>Hague:</hi> I
alſo knew a French Pedagogue, a Runagado
Monk, who deſigned to have Murdered his
Maſter Major <hi>Cavellio,</hi> and his two Pupils,
young Children of the Majors, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to ſet the Houſe a Fire to colour the
Murder, he had his Head cut off and ſet
upon a Poſt, with his Body on a Wheel near
the <hi>Hague.</hi> I could Name you two other
Cheaters, who were ſeverely whipt under
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57758:31"/>
the Gallows; and two under Farmers who
deſigned to run away with the States Money.</p>
                  <p>The Cheat of breaking with a full Hand
is not ſo frequent in <hi>Holland</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi>
(where ſome uſe it as a way to ſlip out of
Buſineſs, and then to live conveniently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
upon the Eſtates of other Men) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in <hi>Holland</hi> they are more ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
when diſcovered than in <hi>England:</hi>
As on the contrary, thoſe that fall to decay
through Loſſes, and unavoidable Accidents
which they could not prevent, find a more
ſpeedy and eaſie way of Compounding and
Finiſhing Matters with their Creditors if they
be over-ſtrict, than the Cuſtom or Law
of <hi>England</hi> doth afford, for the ſuing out of
Statutes of Bankrupts in <hi>England</hi> doth prove
many times ſo pernicious both to Creditor
and Debtor through the tediouſneſs of the
Proceedings, and the expenſiveneſs of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the Commiſſions, that what by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
Fees, Treats, and other incident
Charges, the Creditors are put to ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
as to be utterly diſappointed of their
Debt, and the Poor Debtors for ever ruined
and undone; I ſhall therefore in this place
give a ſhort Relation of the method uſed in
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> in the caſe of Bankrupts, which
perhaps may be taken notice of by our King
and Parliament, for the preventing Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and ſad Abuſes that daily happen in
Executing the Statutes of Bankrupts: The
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57758:31"/>
Magiſtrates of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> every year Name
Commiſſioners for Bankrupts, out of thoſe
that make up a Judicature, like to our Courts
of Aldermen in <hi>London;</hi> Theſe meet certain
days in the Week in a diſtinct Chamber in
the Stadthouſe, over whoſe Door is cut in
Marble the Emblem of Fortune flying away
with Wings, and round Cheſts turn'd upſide
down, with Mice and Rats Eating the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Bags,
Pens, Inkhorns, and Paper-Books.
There they receive Petitions from Debtors
and Creditors, and as occaſion requireth,
ſummon the Parties to appear before them,
and to lay open the true State of the matter;
this done, they either by Authority ſeize the
Bankrupts Books and Effects, or elſe without
any ſtir and noiſe leave all remaining in the
Debtors Houſes, and ſend thither two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees
to examine the Books, and make an
Inventory of the Eſtate, with power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the matter, without giving much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Parties. If the Commiſſioners
find that the Debtor is come to decay by
unexpected Loſſes, and unavoidable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
to which he did not at all contribute,
it is their uſual way to propoſe to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
ſuch amicable and eaſie Terms, as the
Poor Man may be able to perform, alotting
ſometimes the half of the Eſtate left to the
Debtor, ſometimes a third part, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
perſwading the Creditors to advance
to the Poor Man a Sum of Money to help
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57758:32"/>
him up again in Trade, upon Condition that
he do oblige himſelf to pay the Creditors all
he oweth them, when God ſhall be pleaſed
to make him able; but on the contrary, if
the Commiſſioners find that a Trader hath
dealt Knaviſhly, and broken with a deſign to
Defraud and Cheat his Creditors, as if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that a Bankrupt hath kept falſe Books,
and counterfeited Bills of Exchange, Bills of
Loading, or pretended Commiſſions from
Foreign Parts; in ſuch a caſe they are very
ſevere, and not only ſeize all the Books and
Effects of the Bankrupt, but alſo Impriſon
him, and alſo puniſh him Corporally; and
if the cheat be of an heinous Nature, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
him ſometime to Death; whereas, if
the Debtor be only Unfortunate, and no ways
Knaviſh, then the Commiſſaries uſe all the
Power they have to force the Creditors to
accept the Poor Mans Terms, the which is
better for the Creditors than to uſe the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of the Law, in committing the Poor
Man to Priſon, ſeeing in that caſe the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
muſt maintain him in Priſon according
to his Quality, where if he lies a certain time,
and the Creditors be not able to prove the
Priſoner hath an Eſtate, then the Debtor is
admitted to his Oath to Swear he is not worth
40 Gilders, beſides his wearing Cloths and
working Tools, and then he is ſet at liberty;
but in the mean time let the Priſoner have a
care not to make a falſe Oath, for then he is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57758:32"/>
puniſhed without Mercy, an inſtance of
which happened in my time.</p>
                  <p>The States having admitted a certain Jew
to come and make ſuch an Oath before them,
were at the ſame time informed by the Goaler,
that this Jew had been ſeen through the
chinks of the Door, quilting Ducats of Gold,
and ſome Diamonds in his Cloaths, to the
value of 5000 Gilders. The States hereupon
admoniſhed the Jew to take heed to what
he was about to Swear, becauſe the Law was
very ſtrict againſt ſuch as made falſe Oaths
before them, and at the ſame time cauſed
the Oath, and the Law to be Read unto
him; nevertheleſs the Jew offered to take
the Oath, but the Lords not ſuffering him to
Swear, becauſe then he muſt die by Law,
cauſed him to be taken out into another
Room and ſearched, where they found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him the Ducats and Diamonds: This
being told the Lords, they ſent for him in,
and then Sentenced him to have 60 Laſhes
under the Gallows, and to be Baniſhed the
Country; yet, becauſe the Jew had many
Children, they gave the third part of what
was taken about him to his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and a third to the Poor, and the other
third to the Creditors, which was enough
to pay them their Debt: Theſe Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are paid by the States, and have not a
Doit from Debtors or Creditors, for all what
they do: Theſe Commiſſioners are alſo
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57758:33"/>
much to be commended for their readineſs
to do good Offices to thoſe Poor Merchants,
who having lived honeſtly, are brought to
decay by Loſſes and Croſſes in their Trade;
who when they find any ſuch ſo Poor that
they can neither pay their Creditors, nor
maintain the charge of their Families, it is
their conſtant Cuſtom, to take their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
from them, and maintain and bring
them up in their Hoſpitals; yea, often alſo
ſolliciting the Burghermaſters on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
to beſtow ſome ſmall Office upon them
for their Relief and Subſiſtance. And here
I muſt not omit to acquaint you, that as the
Compounding of Matters in <hi>Holland</hi> betwixt
Debtor and Creditor, ſo as hath been ſaid, is
very eaſie and equitable, ſo is alſo their way
or method of ſuing for Debts very favorable,
which is after this manner; In the firſt place,
a Note or Summons is left at the Debtors
Houſe, and if he neglect to appear, a ſecond
Summons is ſent, but then if he neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
himſelf, or ſend his Proctor, the Sheriffs
order an Arreſt againſt him; and at laſt,
when he is brought before them, if the matter
be difficult, it is referred to two or three
good Men of the City, and time given him;
but if the Plaintiff make Oath, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the Debtor hath a deſign to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
then muſt the Priſoner either give Bail,
or return to Priſon. It is a Remark that I
have made in my Travels, that excepting
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57758:33"/>
                     <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> I never ſaw in any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
above forty Priſoners for Debt at one
time, and in ſome great Towns, as in <hi>Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
and others, ſometimes not one; and the
Reaſon hereof is plain, for you cannot lay a
Man in Priſon for an Action or Debt, ſmall
or great, but you muſt maintain the Priſoner,
ſo that many times the Charges exceed the
principal Debt, and after all, the Priſoner
can free himſelf; whereas the Cuſtom in
<hi>England,</hi> encouraged by thoſe Varlets the
Pettyfoggers and Catchpoles, of turning a
Man into a Priſon for a Crown, or it may
be for nothing at all, if he cannot find Bail,
he may lie and Starve there, is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
abuſe; as alſo that of Suborning falſe
Witneſſes, which is extreamly cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
beyond Sea.</p>
                  <p>And now becauſe I am Speaking of Petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foggers,
give me leave to tell you a Story I
met with when I lived in <hi>Rome,</hi> going with
a Roman to ſee ſome Antiquities, he ſhewed
me a Chapel, Dedicated to one St. <hi>Evona,</hi> a
Lawyer of <hi>Britain,</hi> who he ſaid came to <hi>Rome</hi>
to intreat the Pope to give the Lawyers of
<hi>Britain</hi> a Patron, to which the Pope replied,
That he knew of no Saint but what was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of to other Profeſſions; at which <hi>Evona</hi>
was very ſad, and earneſtly beg'd of the Pope
to think of one for them: At laſt, the Pope
propoſed to St. <hi>Evona,</hi> that he ſhould go
round the Church of St. <hi>John de Latera</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:57758:34"/>
Blindfold, and after he had ſaid ſo many <hi>Ave
Maria</hi>'s, that the firſt Saint he laid hold of
ſhould be his Patron, which the good old
Lawyer willingly undertook; and at the end
of his <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s, he ſtopt at St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s
Altar, where he laid hold of the Devil under
St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Feet, and cry'd out, This is our
Saint, let him be our Patron; ſo being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blindfolded,
and ſeeing what a Patron he had
choſen, he went to his Lodgings ſo dejected,
that in few Months after he Died, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Heavens Gates, knockt hard; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
St. <hi>Peter</hi> asked, Who it was that knockt
ſo boldly, he replied, That he was St. <hi>Evona</hi>
the Advocate: Away, away, ſaid St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
here is but one Advocate in Heaven, here
is no room for you Lawyers. O but, ſaid St.
<hi>Evona,</hi> I am that honeſt Lawyer who never
took Fees on both ſides, or ever pleaded in
a bad Cauſe; nor did I ever ſet my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
together by the Ears, or lived by the
Sins of the People. Well then, ſaid St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
come in: This news coming down to <hi>Rome,</hi>
a witty Poet writ upon St. <hi>Evona</hi>'s Tomb
theſe words; St. <hi>Evona un Briton, Advocat
non Larron, Hallelujah.</hi> This Story put me
in mind of <hi>Ben. Johnſon</hi>'s going through a
Chruch in <hi>Surrey,</hi> ſeeing Poor People weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over a Grave, asked one of the Women,
Why they wept? O ſaid ſhe, we have loſt
our precious Lawyer, Juſtice <hi>Randal,</hi> he kept
us all in Peace, and always was ſo good as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57758:34"/>
to keep us from going to Law, the beſt Man
that ever lived, Well, ſaid <hi>Ben. Johnſon,</hi> I will
ſend you an Epitaph to write upon his Tomb,
which was,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>God works Wonders now and than,</l>
                     <l>Here lies a Lawyer an honeſt Men.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And truly old <hi>Ben.</hi> was in the right, for in
my time I have obſerved ſome Gentlemen of
that Profeſſion, that have not acted like
St. <hi>Evona,</hi> or Juſtice <hi>Randal,</hi> I will ſay no
more of them, but wiſh them as great Fees,
and as much encouragement as the Lawyers
have in <hi>Switzerland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now come to Speak ſomething of the
three Taxes I mentioned in the former part
of my Remarks on Taxes, of which the firſt
ought rather to be called an uſeful and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Invention, like to that of the Inſurance
Office in <hi>London,</hi> then a publick Tax, ſeeing
no Man needs contribute to it unleſs they
pleaſe, and find his profit by it; but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be called Taxes, becauſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are obliged to ſubmit to them, but then
they are ſo eaſie, that what the publick gets
thereby, not only leſſons extraordinary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies,
which many times occaſions clamour,
when becauſe of their Rarity, and the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of Occaſions, they muſt needs be
great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57758:35"/>
Yet it is ſufficiently Compenſated by the
advantage and ſecurity in the Eſtates, which
private Perſons, who are obliged to pay it,
reap thereby daily: I am confident, that if
the King and Parliament thought fit to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſome, or all three of theſe Taxes into
<hi>England,</hi> the publick charge of Government
might be defrayed with more eaſe, and with
leſs repining and clamour, than when it muſt
be done by new and high Impoſitions; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
our Governors are the proper Judges of
that.</p>
                  <p>The firſt then is an Houſe called the
Merchants Bank, which is governed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Commiſſioners, Clerks, and Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers,
likewiſe an Eſſay-Maſter, who judgeth
of the Gold and Silver, that at any time is
brought into the Bank uncoined: The ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
given for preſervation thereof, are the
States and Magiſtrates of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Now
if you have a mind to put Money into the
Bank, ſuppoſe 1000 <hi>l.</hi> leſs or more, you
muſt go to the Clerks, and ask a Folio for
your Name, and then pay in your Money
at three or four <hi>per Cent.</hi> according as the rate
of the Bank-Money is high or low, or you
may buy it of thoſe called Caſhiers or Brokers;
then get the Clerks to ſet down in the Folio
what you bring in; having done ſo, you may
draw this Sum, or ſell it in what parcels you
pleaſe; but then if you let your Money lie
ſeven years in the Bank, you receive no Intereſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57758:35"/>
for the ſame. If you ask, Where then is the
Advantage for the Merchants? I anſwer, firſt,
you have your Money ready at all times for
anſwering Bills of Exchange, and making other
Payments: You are at no charge for Bags or
Portage, at no loſs by falſe tale, or bad Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
in no danger of Thieves, or unfaithful
Servants, or Fire; and above all, you have
the Accounts of your Caſh moſt punctually
and juſtly kept without any trouble, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the risk of Goldſmith or Caſhierers
breaking in your Debt; for ſuch is their
care; that twice a Year, or ſometimes oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
they ſhut up the Bank for 14 Days, and
then all that have Concerns therein, muſt
bring in their Accounts to the Clerks, who
a few Days after, having viewed the Books,
acquaint ſuch as have brought in wrong Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
with their Miſtakes, deſiring them
to return to their Books, and rectifie their
Error, not telling them wherein the miſtake
lies: So that I have known Merchants, in
my time, ſent back three or four times with
their wrong Accounts: But if they begin to
grow impatient, and ſay that they will ſtand
to their Accounts, then they pay a Mulct to
the Clerks upon their convincing them of
their Miſtakes, either by charging too much
upon the Bank, or forgetting or omitting
what was their due. I knew two Merchants,
who having forgot, the one 750 <hi>l.</hi> and the
other 220 <hi>l.</hi> in their Accounts, were honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57758:36"/>
rectified by the Clerks, ſo that they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
no Loſs. Beſides this care of the
Clerks in keeping and ſtating the Accounts,
the Bank is obliged for 5 <hi>l.</hi> a Year to ſend
to every Merchant that deſires it, their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
every Morning before Exchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
of the Moneys written of by them in
in the Bank the Day before upon any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Account, and what Sums are written
of by others upon their Accounts: So that
the Merchants may compare the Banks.
Notes with their Books, and ſo ſave much
of the Charges of Book-keeping.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be objected, That though this
be an Advantage to the Merchants, yet what
can the Publick gain thereby, ſeeing the
Charges of paying Officers, Clerks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
muſt needs be very conſiderable?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That indeed it is a Myſtery to
thoſe who underſtand not the thing; but if
it were once known and practiſed, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it would appear: For among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which might be ſaid, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
of the City take out of the Merchants
Bank a ſufficient Stock of Money to ſupply
the Lumbert, a Bank that lends out Money,
and is Governed by four Commiſſioners cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of the Magiſtrates, who ſit in Court
every Day in the Lumbert, which is a large
Pile of Building 300 Foot long, containing
ſeveral Chambers and Magazines under one
Roof; in theſe ſeveral Chambers the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57758:36"/>
have Officers ſitting to lend Money
upon all ſorts of Goods, even from a pair of
Shooes to the richeſt Jewel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a
great convenience for Poor People; yea,
for Merchants alſo, who ſome times may
want Money to pay a Bill of Exchange, and
prevents the Cheating, and extraordinary
Extortion uſed by the Pawn-brokers in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France,</hi> and other Countries. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the Poor have their Pawns ſafely and
well preſerved, neither are they punctually
ſold when the Year is out, or denied under the
pretext of being miſlaid, as the Poor are often
times ſerved by the wicked Pawn-brokers.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo another convenience in this
Lumbert, <hi>viz.</hi> an excellent way they have of
diſcovering Thieves, and the ſtolen Goods;
they publiſh two general open Sales of Goods
pawn'd, twice a year, that ſuch as will may
redeem their Goods, and paying the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
may have them, although the time be
relapſed. Thus much as to the <hi>Lumbert.</hi> I
was once, according to my Duty, to wait
upon the D. of <hi>York,</hi> at the Bank of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
where ſhewing his Highneſs the way
of keeping the Journal-Book of the Bank,
which is of a prodigious bigneſs, his Highneſs
was extreamly pleaſed with the contrivance of
preſerving it from Fire; ſaying, that the
courſe they took might be of great uſe for
the preſerving Patents, and the Deeds of
Noblemens Eſtates: This contrivance, which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57758:37"/>
perhaps may be thought uſeful or imitable, I
ſhall therefore deſcribe it: It is a large Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
ſhaped like a Cheſt, and ſet upright in
a Stone-Wall, having a large Braſs Door of
a vaſt thickneſs, with Flaps to fall over and
cover the Lock and Hinges; into this Cheſt
the Book is drawn upon Rolls, it being of
ſuch a bulk and weight as cannot be handed
in by a Man, and there it is ſo ſecurely
preſerved, that although the Houſe ſhould
be burnt, the Book in all probability would
be ſafe. Should I here give an account of
the vaſt Sums of Money that daily are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of in this Bank, I might probably be
thought to ſpeak at random, but this I may
boldly affirm, that it far exceeds all the Banks
in <hi>Europe,</hi> both for Riches and Buſineſs, and
their Credit is ſuch, that the Italians, French,
Germans, and Engliſh have great Sums in
the ſame; neither was ever any Man refuſed
his Money in the worſt of times.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Tax is what ariſeth from the juſt
and laudable Eſtabliſhment of a Regiſter, a
Tax which I think moſt Men will be willing
to ſubmit to, except ſuch as deſign to cheat
and defraud their Neighbours, and live by
ſuch like Sins and Confuſion, and for the
moſt part die with the Curſe of the People:
This Regiſter in <hi>Holland</hi> begets ſuch aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and ſafety in Dealing, that in purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Houſes or Land, a Child, though
over-reached in the Value, yet cannot be
cheated as to the Title.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:57758:37"/>
The Third and laſt Tax is that of Sealed
Paper, as it is practiſed in <hi>Holland.</hi> There
are many other things might be ſpoken, as
to the Government of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but I muſt
not tire your patience. However, one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
thing I would not paſs by, touching
the Militia: There are in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Sixty
Companies of Foot, the leaſt of them having
200 Men, ſome 300, which in a modeſt
account, amounts at leaſt to 15000 Men, in
which number neither Jews nor Anabaptiſts
who carry no Arms are reckoned, only they
are obliged to contribute to the maintenance
of the 1400 Soldiers, who are kept in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
pay, as a Guard for the City, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Night-Watch or Rattel-Watch,
who walk the Streets the whole Night to
keep good Orders, and tell us every half
hour what a Clock it is. There are alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every Church Tower, Trumpeters, who
Sound every half hour; and if any Fire
breaks out in the City, they give a Signal on
which ſide of the City the Fire is, and Ring
the Fire-Bell; and they have excellent ways
on a ſudden in ſuch ſad Accidents to quench
Fire: But I may not inlarge any longer, but
haſten out of <hi>Holland.</hi> Though before I leave it
it will not be amiſs if I give the Reader a Liſt
of the Paſſage-Boats, which for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of thoſe that Travel that way, I have here
Collected, with the times of their going off,
which they are punctual in obſerving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57758:38"/>
Beginning at <hi>Helvoet-Sluys,</hi> where the
Pacquet-Boat from <hi>England</hi> lies. From whence
to the <hi>Briell</hi> there goes a Wagon every Day
at 8 in the Morning; the Paſſage coſts 7
Stivers; and the ſame from the <hi>Briell</hi> to
<hi>Helvoet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Briell</hi> to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and from
<hi>Rotterdam</hi> to the <hi>Briell,</hi> there Sails a Boat
every Day as the Tide ſerves.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to <hi>Delft,</hi> and from <hi>Delft</hi>

                  <p>And now having ſaid ſo much of the States

it will not be amiſs to take notice of ſome
bad Cuſtoms and Practices now in vogue in
<hi>Holland,</hi> and leave it to the Reader to judge
what they may portend: There are Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the City of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> amongſt
other abuſes, at leaſt 50 Muſick-houſes, where
lewd Perſons of both Sexes meet and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
their Villanies: There is alſo a place
called the Long-Seller, a Tollerated Exchange,
or publick Meeting Houſe for Whores and
Rogues to Rendezvous in, and make their
filthy Bargains. This Exchange is open from
ſix a Clock in the Evening until nine at Night;
every Whore muſt pay three Stivers at the
Door for her Entrance or Admiſſion. I
confeſs the Miniſters Preach and exclaim
from the Pulpit againſt this horrible Abuſe,
but who they be that protect them I know
not; yet, I have heard ſome plead for the
Tolleration of theſe wicked Meetings, upon
pretext, that when the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Fleets
come home, the Seamen are ſo mad for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57758:40"/>
Women, that if they had not ſuch Houſes
to bait in, they would force the very Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
Wives and Daughters; but it is well
known, that as Money does countenance, ſo
Diſcipline might ſuppreſs that abuſe. The
old ſevere, and frugal way of living is now
almoſt quite out of date in <hi>Holland,</hi> there is
very little to be ſeen of that ſober Modeſty
in Apparel, Diet, and Habitations as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly:
In ſtead of convenient Dwellings,
the Hollanders now build ſtately Palaces,
have their delightful Gardens, and Houſes of
Pleaſure, keep Coaches, Wagons and Sleas,
have very rich Furniture for their Horſes,
with Trappings adorned with Silver Bells. I
have ſeen the Vanity of a Vintners Son, who
had the Boſſes of the Bit, and Trapping of
his Horſe of pure Silver; his Toot-Man and
Coach-Man having Silver Fring'd Gloves;
yea, ſo much is the humour of the Women
altered, and of their Children alſo, that no
Apparel can now ſerve them but the beſt and
richeſt that <hi>France</hi> and other Countries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords;
and their Sons are ſo much addicted
to Play, that many Families in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> are
ruined by it; not that <hi>England</hi> is leſs extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
then the Dutch; who as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
got ſuch great Eſtates by their Frugality,
whilſt they were not addicted to ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality
and Wantonneſs as the Engliſh are,
whoſe exceſs I cannot excuſe; nevertheleſs,
the grave and ſober People of <hi>Holland</hi> are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57758:41"/>
very ſenſible of the great alteration that now
is in their Country, and as they ſay, <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi>
uſed to Cure his Patients of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
with a full Belly; ſo a good Burgher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
deſirous to convince his Amſterdam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of their diſſolute kind of Life, invited
the 36 Magiſtrates and their Wives to a Feaſt;
who being come, and the Ladies big with
Expectation of ſome rare and extraordinary
Entertainment, ſat down at Table, where
the firſt Courſe was Buttermilk boil'd with
Apples, Stock-fiſh, Butter'd Turnips and
Carrots, Lettice, Sallat, and Red Herrings,
and only ſmall Bear, without any Wine;
at this the Ladies ſtartled, and began to
whiſper to their Husbands, that they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
no ſuch Entertainment, but upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of the Diſhes and Plates, they found
underneath Printed Verſes, importing, That
after that manner of living they began to
thrive, and had inlarged their City.</p>
                  <p>The Second Courſe conſiſted of Bocke de
kooks, Quarters of Lamb, Roaſted Rabbits,
and a ſort of Pudding they call a <hi>Brother;</hi>
here they had <hi>Dort</hi> and Engliſh Beer, with
French Wine, yet all this did not pleaſe the
Dainty Dames: But upon removing away
the Plates another Diſh of Poetry appeared,
which acquainted them, That after that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and ſober way of living they might keep
what they had got, and lay up ſomething for
their Children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57758:41"/>
Then comes in the Third Courſe made
up of all the Rarities of the Seaſon, as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges,
Pheaſants, and all ſorts of Fowl,
and Engliſh Paſties, with plenty of Rheniſh,
and other ſorts of Wine, to moiſten them;
this put the Ladies in a Frolick, and jolly
Humour, but under their Plates was found
the Uſe and Application in Verſes, telling
them, That to feed after that manner was
Voluptuous and Luxurious, and would impair
their Health, and waſte their Eſtates, make
them neglect their Trade, and ſo in time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
their ſtately and new built flouriſhing
City to their old Fiſhing Town again. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this was brought in a Banquet of all ſorts
of Sweat Meats piled up in Pyramids, and
delicate Fruit, with plenty of delicious Wines;
and to conclude all, a ſet of Muſick and
Maskers, who Danced with the young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
but at parting, like the hand writing
to <hi>Belteſhazzar</hi> upon the Wall, every one had
a Printed Paper of Moralities put into their
Hand, ſhewing them the Cauſes of the Ruin
of the Roman Commonwealth, according
to that of the Poet,
<q>
                        <l>Nullum crimen abeſt, facinuſque libidinis
ex quo,</l>
                        <l>Paupertas Romana perit.</l>
                     </q>
with an excellent Advice to them, That if
they did not quit the Buffoonries, and Apiſh
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57758:42"/>
Modes of the French, and return to the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
Plainneſs and Modeſty of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
and Founders, their Commonwealth
could not long laſt; but all the Thanks the
good old Burghermaſter had for his kind and
chargeable Entertainment in thus Feaſting
his Country-Men, was to be Floutted at, and
Pasquild, the Sparks of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſaying in
all places, That the old Man being now paſt
the years of Pleaſure himſelf, would have
none others to take theirs: And here I ſhall
put a period to what I thought fit to obſerve
of the States of the United Provinces, only I
will beg leave to ſay ſomething to the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander
by way of Advice, <hi>viz.</hi> That now
they are in a proſperous Condition, Rich,
and at Eaſe, they would look back and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what God in his infinite Goodneſs and
Mercy did for them in the days of their
greateſt Calamities: For my own part I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but admire the great Providence of God
in preſerving them from being devoured by
their many Enemies they had in the laſt War,
beſides their Enemies at home, ſome of which
particulars as they then happened give me
leave to relate. At the time when the French
came to Invade the Territories of the States
General, it then looked as if God had mark'd
out the way for the French to March, by
ſending ſuch a wonderful dry Seaſon, that
the Rivers of the <hi>Rhine, Beta, Wall,</hi> and
other Rivers were Fordable, ſo that the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57758:42"/>
French only waded throw, and became ſo
Victorious, that in a little ſpace of time
(what by the Treaſons of ſome, and the
Ignorance and Cowardiſe of others intruſted
with the Militia and Gariſons) the French
became Maſters of above Forty Cities and
Gariſons, at which time there was nothing
to be heard of in the States Dominions but
Confuſion and Miſery, even in the ſtrong
and rich City of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf, who at
this time beheld the French Army like a mighty
Torrent coming within ſight of the City,
and at the ſame time wanting Water in their
Canals, and Burghwalls to ply their Sluces,
and ſuch was the ſcarcity of Rain, that a
Pail of freſh Water was worth Six Pence:
Thus Heaven ſeemed to frown on them, as
well as the French Army, by the ſhutting
up as it were the Conduits of Heaven, and
yet a worſe thing had like to have fallen
out, for at the ſame time the Diviſions
grew ſo high amongſt the Magiſtrates
in the Stadthouſe, that it was putting to
the Queſtion, Whether or no they ſhould
not go and meet the French King with
the Keys of their City, to ſave it from Fire
and Plunder; now nothing, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
could ſave this rich City from falling
into the hands of the French, but an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
hand from Heaven, and it had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
come to paſs, had not Providence
cauſed the French to make a ſtand at <hi>Muy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57758:43"/>
two hours from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> at what
time the valiant Roman of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
Scout <hi>Haſſelaer,</hi> like a true Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
oppoſed the French Party in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
calling out to the Burghers from the
Stadthouſe, to take Courage, and rather
chuſe to die, like old Battavians, with their
Swords in their hands, than tamely and
treacherouſly to yield up their City to the
Mercy of the French, as ſome of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
were about to do; this ſo incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Burghers, that with great Courage
they mann'd the Walls, and Heaven then
aſſiſting them with a ſudden and plentiful
Rain, that they ply'd their Sluces, and
dround the Lands round the City three or
four Foot high, in ſome places, which caus'd
the victorious French Army to make a quick
retreat, as far as <hi>Utrecht,</hi> elſe they had paid
dear for ſeeing of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> thus was
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> delivered by the hand of
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>A Second was, when that bloody Duke
of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who gloried and thanked
GOD that he was born without pity or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
of Conſcience, took the opportunity
of an exceeding hard Froſt, to march his
Army over the Ice as it had been dry ground,
burning in his way the three fair Villages of
<hi>Bodygrave, Swammerdam,</hi> and <hi>Goudſe-ſluys;</hi>
acting there a more cruel Tragedy, and
worſe, than ever did Turk, for they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57758:43"/>
ſave the Country People for Ranſom,
but this cruel Prince cauſed ſtrong Guards
to ſurround the Villages, and burnt Men,
Women, and Children together: Thus he
began his march, with a deſign to burn <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
Hague, Rotterdam, Delft,</hi> and all the rich
Country of <hi>Rhineland:</hi> And this he might
have done in all probability, for, firſt, the
Governor of <hi>New-ſluce,</hi> who commanded
the Poſt that ſhould have ſtopt the French,
treacherouſly delivered up the Fort without
firing a Gun; and the handful of Troops
then under General <hi>Koningſmark</hi> were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
that they, joyned to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
under <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Vin,</hi> the Governor of
<hi>New-ſluce,</hi> were not able to make head as
could oppoſe <hi>Laxemburg</hi>'s Army; and at the
ſame time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was with
the States Army at <hi>Charleroy:</hi> Now was <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
ready to meet the French with the Keys
of their City, and other Cities too, for they
had neither Fortifications nor Soldiers to
man their Walls: Thus the whole Country
and Cities of <hi>Rhineland</hi> were like to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cruelties and Tyrany of the French,
but GOD a ſecond time ſent theſe People
Relief from Heaven, firſt by giving ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
Courage to that Great States-man
Penſionary <hi>Fagel,</hi> that he forced <hi>Coningſmark</hi>
to rally his Troops together, and to make
a ſtand near <hi>Leyden,</hi> offering himſelf to die
at the head of them if there were occaſion,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57758:44"/>
but GOD reſerved him for a further Good
to the Commonwealth, by ſending ſuch a
ſudden Thaw as was never ſeen before, for
in leſs than ten hours, the Ice ſo ſunk, and
ſuch Floods of Snow came down from the
Highlands, that the French were fain to
make a very diſorderly retreat, marching up
to the middle for haſte, becauſe on the Banks
there could not march above four Men
a-breaſt, ſo they were conſtrained to leave
behind them the greateſt part of the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they had robb'd from the Innocent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
People, and the nimble Dutch-men, on
their Scates, ſo long as the Ice would bear
them, did ſhoot down the French like Ducks
diving under Water, ſo that it coſt <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>'s
Army dear, though they had the
pleaſure to burn the poor People, of which
the French afterward wickedly made their
boaſt.</p>
                  <p>The third was as wonderful as the two
others; and although I do not believe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
as do the Papiſts, yet I ſay nothing I
ever obſerved looked more like a Miracle
than this; to wit, when the Engliſh and
French Fleet lay before <hi>Scheveling</hi> with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to land, and the French ready on their
March to joyn with the Engliſh and other
French as ſoon as they ſhould land, at the
ſame time the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> lying before
<hi>Groeningen,</hi> and the French before <hi>Gorcom,</hi> ſo
that now all things looked with a dreadful
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57758:44"/>
face for the States, yet at this very time God
ſent a third relief, by ſending ſuch Miſts,
and wonderful ſorts of Tydes, as ſo ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the two Fleets, that the Engliſh were
forced to quit <hi>Scheveling</hi> Shore, and were
driven on the ſide of the <hi>Texel</hi> Road; from
whence they were conſtrained by the ſeaſon
of the Year to retire home: And ſuch were
the ſudden and great Showers of Rain, that
the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> was forced in diſorder
to raiſe his Siege at <hi>Groeningen,</hi> and the French
to quit <hi>Gorcom.</hi> I could add many more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of the Providences of God to theſe
People, as the preſerving the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
His preſent Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi>
from the many treacherous Deſigns contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
againſt him from his Cradle; but <hi>Moſes</hi>
muſt be preſerved, to go in and out before
his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> People. Certainly never young Prince
endured ſo many Fatigues as did his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in his tender Years, of which I was an
Eye-witneſs; and had his Highneſs had the
Years and Experience, and ſuch a good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined
Army (as now he hath) in the Year
1671. when the French entred the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
his Highneſs had given them as good a
Welcom as he did at <hi>Bergen.</hi> I will ſay no
more of this Subject, only this, That the
Peace at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> was alſo a very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
thing, for that not above eight Days
before the Peace was ſigned, moſt of the
Plenipotentiaries did believe the War would
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57758:45"/>
have continued another Year; firſt, becauſe
the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Duke of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
proſpered exceedingly againſt <hi>Sweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and totally refuſed the Propoſitions of
<hi>France;</hi> and ſecondly, becauſe the French
King writ ſuch bitter Letters againſt the
States-General: Yet eight Days after dreſt a
Letter unto the States, in which he calls
them his <hi>Good Friends, and Old Alleys,</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them not only <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> but every Foot
of Ground they could lay claim to in the
World; alſo giving them new Terms and
Conditions as to their Privileges in <hi>France,</hi>
by way of Trade. Neither can I forget how
ſpeedily and as ſtrangely the French King
did quit his Conquered Towns after the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> took <hi>Naerden,</hi> which
was the firſt ſtep to the French's Ruine in
the States Dominions. I come now, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to promiſe in the beginning of this Book,
to give the Reader ſome Remarks I made
in other Countries where I have been, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my Sixteen Years Travels. To give
a full account of all that might be obſerved
in ſo many Countries, is not a Task for one
Man, nor a Subject for ſo ſmall a Book; I
ſhall only therefore briefly take notice of
ſome remarkable Matters which may in ſome
meaſure ſatisfie the Curioſity of my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who have not been in the ſaid places,
and convince, if poſſible, all of them, that
no Country that ever I was in, affords ſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57758:45"/>
great Conveniencies for the generality of
People to live in, as the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
doth. Though I have twice made the
<hi>grand tour</hi> of <hi>Germany, Hungary, Italy</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and after my return back to <hi>England,</hi>
travelling a third time through <hi>Holland</hi> as far
as <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and ſo back by <hi>Francfort</hi> to
<hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sueden;</hi> yet the Reader is not
to expect I ſhould follow a Geographical
Method and Order in ſpeaking of the Places
I have been in; that is to be lookt for in the
Map, and not in Travels; but only that I
mention Places as I found them on my Road,
according as Buſineſs or Curioſity led me to
Travel.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt conſiderable Place I then met
with, after I was out of the Dominions
of the States-General, was <hi>Cleave,</hi> the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
City of the Province ſo called; a fair and
lovely City ſtanding upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and
the Rivers <hi>Wall</hi> and <hi>Leck.</hi> This Province
much reſembles <hi>England</hi> in rich Soil, and
pleaſantneſs of its Rivers. The Inhabitants
of the Country would have me believe that
they were Originally deſcended of thoſe <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
who made a deſcent into <hi>England,</hi> and
conquered it; and to convince the truth of
this, they ſhew'd me a Cloyſter ſtanding on
a Hill, called <hi>Eltham,</hi> from which they ſay
our <hi>Eltham</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> had its Name. I was
made to obſerve alſo two places ſtanding
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57758:46"/>
upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> near <hi>Emmerick,</hi> called <hi>Doad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and <hi>Gronewich,</hi> which according to
them, gave the Names to <hi>Dedford</hi> and <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
in <hi>England:</hi> But many ſuch Analogies
and Similitudes of Names are to be found in
other places of <hi>Germany,</hi> but eſpecially in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi> The greateſt part
of this Province of <hi>Cleave,</hi> and part of the
Dutchies of <hi>Juliers</hi> and <hi>Berg,</hi> and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Ravensbourg,</hi> belongs to
the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> the reſt belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> now Elector
<hi>Palatine,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Cologne.</hi> The
Inhabitants are partly Roman Catholicks,
partly Lutherans, and partly Calviniſts, who
all live promiſcuouſly and peaceably toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
both in City and Country. The City
of <hi>Cleave</hi> is the utmoſt Limit of the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> on this
ſide of <hi>Germany;</hi> from whence his Electoral
Highneſs can Travel Two Hundred Dutch
Miles out-right in his own Dominions, and
never ſleep out of his own Country but one
Night in the Territories of the Biſhop of
<hi>Oſnabrug.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FRom <hi>Cleave</hi> I went to a ſmall Town
called <hi>Rhinberg,</hi> but a very ſtrong For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
belonging to the Elector of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne;</hi>
which lies at two Miles diſtance from
the City of <hi>Weſel,</hi> that belongs to the Elector
of <hi>Brandenbourg.</hi> Through <hi>Duſſeldorpe,</hi> ſituated
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57758:46"/>
on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the Reſidence of the Duke
of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> I went next to <hi>Cologne,</hi> a very
large City, called by the Romans <hi>Colonia A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina,</hi>
and the French <hi>Rome d'Allemagne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cologne</hi> is an Imperial City, and a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
though for ſome things it does Homage
to the Elector of that Name, and receives
an Oath from him. It is much decayed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
theſe Hundred Years, having been much
Prieſt-ridden; a Misfortune that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
many other great Cities. The Jeſuits
have had ſo great Influence upon the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
that they prevailed with them to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
all Proteſtants, who removed to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
and <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> ſo that <hi>Cologne</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo diſpeopled, that the Houſes daily
fall to ruine for want of Inhabitants, and a
great deal of Corn and Wine now grows
within the Walls, upon Ground where Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
formerly ſtood. I dare be bold to affirm,
that there is twice the Number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Martins in the Fields,</hi>
as there is in <hi>Cologne;</hi> and yet it contains
as many Pariſh-Churches, Monaſteries and
Chappels, as there are days in the Year. The
Streets are very large, and ſo are the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
alſo, in many of which one may drive a
Coach or Wagon into the firſt Room from
the Streets: But the Streets are ſo thin of
People, that one may paſs ſome of them and
not meet Ten Men or Women, unleſs it be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57758:47"/>
Church-Men, or Religious Siſters. The
moſt conſiderable Inhabitants of the City are
Proteſtant Merchants, though but few in
Number, and they not allowed a Church
neither, but at a place called <hi>Woullin,</hi> a Mile
without the City; the reſt of the Inhabitants,
who are Lay-men, are miſerably poor. There
are no leſs than 3000 Students in <hi>Cologne</hi>
taught by the Jeſuits <hi>gratis,</hi> who have the
privilege to beg in Muſical Notes in the Day-time,
and take to themſelves the liberty of
borrowing Hats and Cloaks in the Night.
But if in the Jeſuits Schools there be any Rich
Burghermaſters Sons who have Parts, they
are ſure to be ſnapt up, and adopted into
the Society. Formerly, before the Matter
was otherwiſe adjuſted in the Dyet of <hi>Ratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi>
there have been Deſigns of Voting
Proteſtant Magiſtrates into the Government
again; but ſo ſoon as the Jeſuits came to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
who of the Magiſtrates were for that,
they immediately preferred their Sons or
Daughters, and made them Canons, Abbots,
or Canoneſſes, and ſo diverted them by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
It's pity to ſee a City ſo famous for
Traffick in former times, now brought to ſo
great a decay, that were it not for the Trade of
Rheniſh-Wine, it would be utterly forſaken,
and left wholly to the Church-Men. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Alarms the Magiſtrates have had by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Deſigns upon their Liberty, and the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
fomented among themſelves, as it is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57758:47"/>
thought, by the Agents and Favourers of
<hi>France,</hi> and eſpecially the Biſhop of <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
have, for ſeveral years, kept them in
continual diſquiet, and neceſſitated them to
raiſe great Taxes, which hath not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the impoveriſhing of the People,
eſpecially the Boars round about; who, tho'
the Country they live in be one of the moſt
pleaſant and fertile Plains of <hi>Germany,</hi> yet
are ſo wretchedly poor, that Canvas Cloaths,
Wooden Shoes, and Straw to ſleep on in
the ſame room with their Beaſts, is the
greateſt worldly Happineſs that moſt of them
can attain unto. The Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> is
Biſhop of four great Biſhopricks, <hi>viz. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi>
Prince of <hi>Liege, Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhime.</hi>
To ſpeak of all the Miracles of the
three Kings of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and the vaſt number
of Saints, who were removed out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and interred there, would be but tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and perhaps incredible, to the Reader,
as well as wide of my deſign: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proceed.</p>
                  <p>FRom <hi>Cologne</hi> I took Water on the <hi>Rhine,</hi>
and advanced to the City of <hi>Bon,</hi> and
ſo forward to <hi>Coblentz,</hi> the Reſidence of the
Elector of <hi>Trier:</hi> Over-againſt this City, on
the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſtands that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
Fort called <hi>Herminſhine,</hi> built on a
high rocky Hill, as high again as <hi>Windſor</hi>-Caſtle;
and on the North-ſide of it, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57758:48"/>
                     <hi>Moſelle</hi> falls into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> over which
there is a ſtately Stone-Bridge. This Prince
governs his Subjects as the other Spiritual
Electors do, that is, both by Temporal and
Spiritual Authority, which in that Country
is pretty abſolute. The chief Trade of this
Country is in Wine, Corn, Wood and
Iron.</p>
                  <p>THE next Country I came to was that of
the Elector of <hi>Mayence</hi> or <hi>Mentz,</hi> who is
likewiſe both a Secular and Eccleſiaſtical
Prince, and governs his Subjects accordingly.
He is reckoned to be wholly for the Intereſts
of the French King; who, notwithſtanding of
that, pretends a Title to the Cittadel of
<hi>Mayence.</hi> As I was upon my Journey to
<hi>Mayence</hi> by Land, I made a turn down the
<hi>Rhine</hi> to viſit the famous little City of <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack,</hi>
and ſome Towns belonging to the
Landtgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Backrack,</hi>
becauſe Travellers ſay, it much reſembles
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in its Situation and manner of
Buildings. The Burghermaſter of this City
told me, that the whole Country about <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack</hi>
does not yield above 200 Fouders of
Wine a year; and yet the Merchants of <hi>Dort,</hi>
by an Art of Multiplication, which they
have uſed ſome years, furniſh <hi>England</hi> with
ſeveral thouſand of Fouders. Here I ſhall
take the Liberty to relate a ſtrange Story,
which, I found recorded in this Country, tho'
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57758:48"/>
I know it to be mentioned in Hiſtory:
There was a certain cruel and inhuman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Mayence,</hi> who, in a year of great
ſcarcity and Famine, when a great number
of poor People came to his Gates begging
for Bread, cauſed the poor Wretches, Men,
Women, and Children, to be put into a
Barn, under pretext of relieving their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
but ſo ſoon as they were got in, cauſed
the Barn Doors to be ſhut, Fire ſet to it,
and ſo burnt them all alive: And whil'ſt the
poor Wretches cried and ſhrieked out for
Horror and Pain, the barbarous Miſcreant
ſaid to thoſe that were about him, Hark,
how the Rats and Mice do cry. But the juſt
Judgment of GOD ſuffered not the Fact to
paſs unpuniſhed; for not long after the cruel
Biſhop was ſo haunted with Rats and Mice,
that all the Guards he kept about him could
not ſecure him from them, neither at Table
nor in Bed; at length he reſolved to flee for
Safety into a Tower that ſtood in the middle
of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> but the Rats purſued him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
got into his Chamber, and devoured him
alive; ſo that the Juſtice of the Almighty
made him a Prey to Vermin, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly
reckoned his Fellow-Chriſtians to
be ſuch. The Tower, which I ſaw, to this
day is call'd the Rats-Tower, and the Story
is upon Record in the City of <hi>Mayence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On my Journey from thence I came to
the little Village of <hi>Hockom,</hi> not far diſtant,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57758:49"/>
famous for our Hockomore-Wine, of which,
though the place does not produce above 150
Fouders a year, yet the ingenious Hollanders
of <hi>Dort</hi> make ſome thouſand Fouders of it
go off in <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FRom <hi>Hockom</hi> I proceeded to <hi>Francfort,</hi> a
pleaſant City upon the River of <hi>Maine,</hi>
called formerly <hi>Teutoburgum</hi> and <hi>Helenop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lis,</hi>
and ſince <hi>Francfort,</hi> becauſe here the Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
who came out of the Province of
<hi>Franconia,</hi> foarded over, when they went
upon their Expedition into <hi>Gallia,</hi> which
they conquered, and named it <hi>France:</hi> And
I thought it might very well deſerve the
Name of <hi>Petty-London,</hi> becauſe of its Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
and the Humour of the Citizens. It
is a Hanſiatick and Imperial Town, and
Commonwealth, the Magiſtrates being Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,
which is the publick eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
though the Cathedral Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Roman Catholicks, who alſo
have ſeveral Monaſteries there. The City
is populous, and frequented by all ſorts of
Merchants, from moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and
part of <hi>Aſia</hi> alſo, becauſe of the two great Fairs
that are yearly kept there: Many Jews live
in this City, and the richeſt Merchants are
Calviniſts, who are not ſuffered to have a
Church in the Town, but half an hours
Journey out of it, at a place called <hi>Bucknam,</hi>
where <hi>I</hi> have told Seventy four Coaches at a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57758:49"/>
time, all belonging to Merchants of the
City. It was in ancient times much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
by <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and hath been ſince
by the Conſtitution of the <hi>Golden-Bull:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other Honours and Privileges, it's
appointed to be the place of the Emperor's
Election, where many of the Ornaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that Auguſt Ceremony, are to
be ſeen. It is ſtrongly fortified, having a
ſtately Stone-bridge over the <hi>Mayne,</hi> that
joyns it to <hi>Saxe-houſen,</hi> the Quarter of the
Great Maſter of the Teutonick-Order. The
Government is eaſie to the People, they not
being taxed as other Cities are; and had it
not been for the Alarms the French gave
them, during the laſt War, they had not
been much troubled, but being forced to
keep 3 or 4000 Men in conſtant Pay to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Fortifications, the Magiſtrates
were conſtrained to raiſe Money by a Tax.
Beſides that of the Emperor, they are under
the Protection of ſome Neighbouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as of the Landtgrave of <hi>Heſſe-Caſſel,</hi>
Landtgrave of <hi>Armſtadt,</hi> the Count of <hi>Solmes,</hi>
and the Count of <hi>Hanau,</hi> who are either
Lutherans or Calviniſts, amongſt whom the
late Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> was alſo one; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the preſent, who is a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
be ſo or not, I cannot tell. This
City takes great care of their Poor, and in
their Charity to poor Travellers exceed <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
I have ſeen a Liſt of Seven thouſand
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57758:50"/>
whom they relieved in one year. Their
great Hoſpital is a large Court or Palace, where
the Engliſh Merchants formerly lived, in the
time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Perſecution of the
Proteſtants, who, when they were recalled by
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were ſo generous as to give
the whole Court, with all their Pack-houſes
and Lands to the Poor of the City. It was
my fortune to be there in that cold Winter
in the year 1683, and ſaw a Ceremony
performed by the Wine-Coopers of the City,
who are obliged by Law, that when ever
the <hi>Maine</hi> lies faſt frozen over for 8 days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to make a great Fouder Fat, Hoops and
Staves, and ſet it up compleat upon the Ice.
It was very good diverſion to ſee ſo many
Hands at Work, and to obſerve the jollity
and mirth of the many Thouſands of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators,
who wanted not plenty of Rheniſh
Wine to Carouſe in.</p>
                  <p>I had the curioſity afterward to go to the
Court of the Landtgrave of <hi>Armeſtadt,</hi> a
Lutheran Prince, who lives in part of the
richeſt Soil in <hi>Germany.</hi> His Highneſs is a
very courteous and obliging Prince to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and his Subjects are in a pretty good
Condition again, though they have been great
Sufferers by the laſt War between the Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
of <hi>Heſſe</hi> and this Family.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:57758:50"/>
FRom thence I went to <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> a City
I had been formerly in, in the Life time
of that Wiſe, though unfortunate Prince
Elector, Elder Brother to Prince <hi>Rupert.</hi>
Here I had the Honour to pay my Dutiful
Reſpects to the Elector, the Son of that great
Prince, whoſe Commiſſary I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be for two years together in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
This Prince, ſince my being there, is
Dead, and left behind him the Reputation
of having been a zealous thorough paced
Calviniſt, and ſo conſtant a frequenter of the
Church, that ſome Sundays he went thrice
a day to Sermon; but never failed, if in
Health, to be once a day at leaſt at the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
Church, where he took particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of ſuch Officers as were abſent. He was
Married to a moſt Virtuous Lady, the Royal
Siſter of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prince <hi>George.</hi> During his Life time the
Univerſity of <hi>Heidleberg</hi> flouriſhed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
ſo that the number of Students was
ſo great, that Chambers and Lodgings in the
City were ſcarce, and <hi>Spanhemius</hi> was about
quitting <hi>Leyden</hi> to return to his Profeſſors
place in <hi>Heidleberg;</hi> but how matters ſtand
ſince his Death, I am as yet ignorant. This
Country is called, the Paradiſe of <hi>Germany,</hi>
for its fruitfulneſs in Wine, Corn, and all
ſorts of Fruit. I my ſelf have ſeen growing
in one Plain, at the ſame time, Vines, Corn,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57758:51"/>
Cheſtnuts, Almonds, Dates, Figs, Cherries,
beſides ſeveral other ſorts of Fruit. And as
the Country is fertile in yielding the Fruits
of the Earth, ſo the People are careful in
providing Store Room for them. This I
take notice of, becauſe of the prodigious
Rheniſh Wine Fats which are to be ſeen there,
amongſt which there are Seven, the leaſt
whereof holds the quantity of 250 Barils of
Beer, as I calculated; but the large and moſt
celebrated Fat is that which goes by the name
of the great Tun of <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> and holds 204
<note n="*" place="margin">A Fouder contains 4 Hogſheads.</note>Fouders of Wine, and coſt 705 <hi>l.</hi>
Sterling in Building, for which
one may have a very good Houſe
built. This Fat I have ſeen twice,
and the firſt time was, when the Elector
Treated the French Ambaſſadors that came
to conclude the Match betwixt his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and Monſieur the French Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who Married her after the Death of
<hi>Henrietta</hi> his firſt Wife; at which Treat there
happened an adventure, that I ſhall here
pleaſe the Reader with. In a Gallery that
is over this Fat, the Elector cauſed a Table
to be placed in the middle, exactly above the
Bunghole of this Monſtrous Veſſel, and to be
covered with a coſtly Banquet of all ſorts of
Sweat-Meats: The day before, all the Wine
being emptied out of this Tun into other
Fats, a little before the Ambaſſadors, with
other Foreign Miniſters and Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
mounted the Stairs to come to the place
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57758:51"/>
of Entertainment, the Elector cauſed twelve
Drummers, with as many Trumpeters, ſome
Kettle-Drums, and other Muſick, to be lodged
in the Belly of the Tun, with orders to ſtrike
up, upon a ſignal given, when the Elector
drank the French Kings Health. All being
ſat down at Table, and merrily Feeding,
the Elector drank the Health, and the Signal
was given; whereupon the Muſick began
to play its part, with ſuch a roaring and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
Noiſe out of that vaſt Cavity below,
that the French and other Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
who were unacquainted with the deſign,
looking upon it to be an infernal and omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Sound, in great aſtoniſhment began to
cry out, <hi>Jeſu Maria, The Worlds at an end,</hi>
and to ſhift every one for himſelf in ſo great
Diſorder and Confuſion, that for haſte to be
gone they tumbled down Stairs one over
another. All that the Elector could ſay to
compoſe them, was either not heard, or not
valued, nor could any thing ſatisfie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſure
them, till they ſaw the Actors come
marching out of their Den. Had not many
Perſons of Quality and Travellers ſeen this
Fat as well as my ſelf, who know that what
I ſay of its incredible bigneſs to be true, I
ſhould be afraid the Reader might think I
impoſed upon his Credulity.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Heidleberg</hi> I went to ſee that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
Fort or Cittadel of <hi>Manheim allas
Fredericksberg,</hi> built by the Elector <hi>Frederick,</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:57758:52"/>
Brother to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> a Prince of as
good a Head as any <hi>Germany</hi> afforded; who
though ſome have too partially judged of
him by his Misfortunes, yet by the wiſeſt of
the Age was accounted the <hi>Cato</hi> of <hi>Germany.</hi>
The Wiſeſt and beſt Men of the World have
been unfortunate, which makes ſome to be
of the Opinion, That God in his Wiſdom
thinks fit it ſhould be ſo, leſt otherwiſe they
might attribute their Proſperity rather to the
wiſe direction of their own Conduct, than
his All-ſeeing Providence: And indeed, daily
Experience ſeems to evince the Truth of this,
ſince we ſee Knaves and Fools advanced to
Preferment and Riches, when Men of Virtue
and Parts die neglected, and poor in the
Eyes of the World, though rich in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of a contented Mind. But this is a
digreſſion which the Honour I have for the
memory of that great Man hath led me into,
and therefore I hope will be pardoned by
the Reader. In the Cittadel of <hi>Manheim</hi> I
ſaw ſome of the Records of that Illuſtrious
Family, which without diſpute is the moſt
ancient of all the Secular Electors, being El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which ſprung from
one and the ſame Stock; to wit, two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
of <hi>Germany.</hi> Many Writers derive
them originally from <hi>Charlemain,</hi> by the
Line of <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> There have
been ſeveral Emperors of that Race, one
King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and four Kings of <hi>Sueden,</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57758:52"/>
one of which was King of <hi>Norway</hi> alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
many great Generals of Armies in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
Hungary, France,</hi> and other Countrys.
Since I can remember there were five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Princes Heirs to that Electoral Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
alive; which now by their Death is
fallen to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> the preſent
Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> a Roman Catholick,
whoſe Daughter is Empreſs of <hi>Germany,</hi> and
another of his Daughters Married to the
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> a third to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and a fourth to Prince <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BEing ſo near <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> I had the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
to go ſee what figure that Famous
City now made, ſince it had changed its
Maſter; for I had been thrice there before,
when it flouriſhed under the Emperors Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
with the liberty of a Hanſiatick
Town: And indeed, I found it ſo disfigured,
that had it not been for the ſtately Cathedral
Church, and fair Streets, and Buildings, I
could ſcarcely have known it. In the Streets
and Exchange, which formerly were throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſober, rich, and peaceable Merchants,
you meet with none hardly now but Men
in Buff-Coats and Scarffs, with rabbles of
Soldiers their Attendants. The Churches I
confeſs are gayer, but not ſo much frequented
by the Inhabitants as heretofore, ſeeing the
Lutherans are thruſt into the meaneſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57758:53"/>
Churches, and moſt of the chief Merchants,
both Lutherans and Calviniſts, removed to
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hambourg.</hi> Within a few years,
I beleive it will be juſt ſuch another City for
Trade and Riches as <hi>Briſac</hi> is. It was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
a rich City, and well ſtockt with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and wealthy Inhabitants, who lived
under a gentle and eaſie Government; but
now the Magiſtrates have little elſe to do in
the Government, but only to take their
Rules and Meaſures from a Cittadel and
great Guns, which are Edicts that Merchants
leaſt underſtand. I confeſs, <hi>Strasbourg</hi> is the
leſs to be pittied that it ſo tamely became a
Slave, and put on its Chains without any
ſtrugling. Thoſe Magiſtrates who were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
in it, are now ſenſible of their own
Folly, and bite their Nails for Anger, finding
themſelves no better, but rather worſe hated
than the other Magiſtrates, who did what
they could to hinder the Reception of their
new Maſters the French. I quickly grew
weary of being here, meeting with nothing
but complaints of Poverty, and paying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
Taxes.</p>
                  <p>I therefore ſoon returned to my <hi>Petty-London,
Francfort,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi>
the chief Reſidence of the Landtgrave
of <hi>Heſſe.</hi> This Prince is a Calviniſt, as moſt
of his Subjects are, very grave and zealous
in his Religion: He Married a Princeſs of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57758:53"/>
                     <hi>Courland,</hi> by whom he hath an hopeful Iſſue;
to wit, three Sons, and two Daughters.
King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was God-Father to one of
his Sons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was Chriſtened by the Name
of <hi>Charles;</hi> Captain <hi>William Legg,</hi> Brother to
the Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> repreſenting his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
as his Envoy. The Court of this Prince
does indeed reſemble a well-governed Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
or Religious Cloiſter, in regard of its
Modeſty and Regularity in all Things, and
eſpecially in the Hours of Devotion. He is
Rich in Money, and entertains about Nine
Thouſand Men in conſtant Pay, under the
Command of Count <hi>Vanderlip,</hi> a brave and
expert Soldier, his Lieutenant General, but
can bring many more upon occaſion into
Field. This Family hath been very happy
both in its Progeny and Alliances, many
Wiſe Princes of both Sexes having ſprung
from it; and the Mother of this preſent
Landtgrave may be reckoned amongſt the
Illuſtrious Women of the preſent and paſt
Ages. After the Death of <hi>William</hi> V. Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
of <hi>Heſſe</hi> her Husband, ſhe not only
ſupported, but advanced the War wherein
he was engaged, did many ſignal Actions,
enlarged her Territories, and at the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Peace, kept under her Pay 56
Cornets of Horſe in five Regiments, 166
Companies of Foot, beſides 13 Companies
of Dragoons, and 14 Independent Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
in all 249 Companies of Horſe and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57758:54"/>
Foot: She was a Princeſs extreamly obliging
to Strangers, eſpecially virtuous and learned
Divines. I had the Honour a good many
years ago to kiſs her Highneſſes Hand, at
which time ſhe was mighty Zealous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
an Accommodation amongſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Religions, as the Roman Catholick,
Lutheran and Calviniſt, but eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two latter; and therefore enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Doctor <hi>Duris,</hi> at her Court in <hi>Caſſels,</hi>
who wrote ſeveral pieces upon that Subject
of Reconciliation, and with ſome of his Friends
had a Conference with a Learned Prieſt,
that came from <hi>Rome</hi> to forward the Project;
whereupon the Doctor Publiſhed his Book of
the <hi>Harmony of Conſent,</hi> which is highly
eſteemed in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FRom this Princes Court I directed my
Journey to <hi>Hanouer,</hi> taking <hi>Lambſpring</hi>
in my way, a place where there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of Engliſh Monks; and there I met
with a very aged, worthy, and harmleſs
Gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigne,</hi> a Perſon of
ſeeming great Integrity and Piety; the Lord
Abbot and ſeveral of the Monks I had ſeen
there formerly. This Monaſtery is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
to all Strangers that Travel that way,
as well as to their own Country-men, and is
highly reſpected by the Neighbouring Princes
of all Perſwaſions, as the Princes of the Houſe
of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> the Landtgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57758:54"/>
Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> who as Biſhop of <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſheim</hi>
is their Ordinary. The Town of
<hi>Lambſpring</hi> is Lutheran, though under the
Government of the Lord Abbot and his
Chapter, who conſtantly chuſe Lutheran
Magiſtrates and Officers for the Civil Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
and live together in that Love
and Unity, that as yet there hath never the
leaſt debate happened amongſt them; and
indeed, this Harmony is now to be obſerved
in moſt parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> where different
Religions are profeſſed. When I conſidered
ſo many goodly Faces, both of Monks and
Students in that Abbey, I could not forbear
to make a ſerious Reflection on the number
of the Engliſh whom I had ſeen in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
and Cloiſters abroad, as at <hi>Rome, Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,
Wirtzburg</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> at <hi>Liege, Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain,
Bruſſels, Dunkirk, Ghent, Paris,</hi> and
other places, beſides the Nunneries; and
withall, on the loſs that both King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſuffered thereby, when ſo many of our
Natives, both Men and Women ſhould be
conſtrained to ſpend their own Eſtates, and
the Benevolence of others in a ſtrange Land,
which amounts to more Money than at firſt
one may imagine; and this thought, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
made me wiſh it were otherwiſe. I
would not have the Reader to miſtake me
here, as if I Eſpouſed, or Pleaded for any
particular Party; no, I plead only for the
Sentiments of Humanity, without which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57758:55"/>
our Nature degenerates into that of Brutes,
and for the love that every honeſt Man
ought to have for his Country. I am as
much a Friend to the Spaniſh Inquiſition,
as to the perſecuting of tender Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Proteſtants, provided there be no more
but Conſcience in the Caſe: And I could
heartily wiſh that Papiſts and Proteſtants
could live as lovingly together in <hi>England,</hi>
as they do in <hi>Holland, Germany,</hi> and other
Countries; for give me leave to ſay it, I
love not that Religion, which in ſtead of
Exalting, deſtroys the Principles of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and human Society. I have met with
honeſt Men of all Perſwaſions, even Turks
and Jews, who in their Lives and Manners
have far exceeded many of our Enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Profeſſors at home; and when ever
this happened, I could not forbear to love
the Men without embracing their Religion,
for which they themſelves are to account to
their great Maſter and Judge.</p>
                  <p>In my progreſs towards <hi>Hanouer</hi> I
touched at <hi>Hilderſheim,</hi> a City whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
are Lutheran, though Roman
Catholicks have the Cathedral Church,
and ſeveral Monaſteries there. The Court
of <hi>Hanouer</hi> makes another kind of Figure
than that of <hi>Caſſels,</hi> it being the Court of
a great Prince, who is Biſhop of <hi>Oſnaburg,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Brunſwick, Lunenburg, Hanouer,
&amp;c.</hi> Here I had the Honour to Kiſs the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57758:55"/>
Hands of the Princeſs Royal <hi>Sophia,</hi> young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Siſter to the late Prince <hi>Rupert.</hi> Her
Highneſs has the Character of the <hi>Merry
Debonnaire</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Germany,</hi> a Lady of
Extraordinary Virtue and Accompliſhments,
and Miſtreſs of the Italian, French, High and
Low Dutch, and Engliſh Languages,
which ſhe ſpeaks to Perfection. Her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
has the Title of the Gentleman of
<hi>Germany,</hi> a graceful and comely Prince
both a Foot, and on Horſeback, Civil to
Strangers beyond compare, infinitely Kind
and Beneficent to People in Diſtreſs, and
known in the World for a Valiant and
Experienced Soldier. I had the Honour
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> his Troops, which, without Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="5 letters">

                     </gap>
are as good Men, and Commanded
by as expert Officers as any are in <hi>Europe:</hi>
Amongſt his Officers I found brave <hi>Steel-Hand
Gordon,</hi> Colonel of an excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Horſe, <hi>Grimes, Hamilton, Talbot,</hi>
and others of our Kings Subjects. God hath
bleſt the Prince with a numerous Off-ſpring,
having ſix Sons, all gallant Princes; of
whom the two Eldeſt ſignalized themſelves
ſo bravely at the raiſing of the Siege of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> that as undoubted proof of their
Valour, they brought three Turks home to
this Court Priſoners. His eldeſt Son is
Married to a moſt beautiful Princeſs, ſole
Heireſs of the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg</hi> and <hi>Zell</hi>'s
Elder Brother; as the lovely Princeſs his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57758:56"/>
Daughter is Married to the Duke of
<hi>Brandenburg.</hi> He is a gracious Prince to
his People, and keeps a very ſplendid Court,
having in his Stables for the uſe of himſelf
and Children, no leſs than Fifty two ſets of
Coach-Horſes: He himſelf is a Lutheran,
but as his Subjects are Chriſtians of different
Perſwaſions, and ſome of them Jews too, ſo
both in his Court and Army he entertains
Gentlemen of various Opinions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
as Italian Abbots, and Gentlemen that
ſerve him, and many Calviniſt French
Officers: Neither is he ſo Bigotted in his
Religion, but that he and his Children go
many times to Church with the Princeſs,
who is a Calviniſt, and join with her in her
Devotion. His Country is good, having
Gold and Silver Mines in it, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
live well under him; as do thoſe alſo
of his Brother the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> and
their Cozen the Duke of <hi>Wolfembuttel,</hi> which
are the three Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg;</hi>
of whom it may be ſaid, that they
have always ſtuck honeſtly to the right ſide,
and befriended the Intereſts of the Empire;
ſo that no by-Reſpect, neither Honour nor
Profit, could ever prevail with them, as it
has with others, to make them abandon the
publick Concern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:57758:56"/>
FRom this Princes Court I went to <hi>Zell,</hi> the
Reſidence of the Duke the elder Brother
of the Family. This Prince is called the
Mighty <hi>Nimrod,</hi> becauſe of the great delight
he takes in Horſes, Dogs, and Hunting. He
did me the honour to let me ſee his Stables,
wherein he keeps 370 Horſes, moſt of them
Engliſh, or of Engliſh Breed. His Dogs,
which are alſo Engliſh, are ſo many, that
with great care they are quartered in ſeveral
Apartments according to their Kind and
Qualities, there being a large Office like a
Brewhouſe employed for boyling of Malt
and Corn for them. It is this valiant Prince
who took <hi>Trieves</hi> from the French, and made
the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> Priſoner: He is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
obliging to Strangers, and hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
brave Scotiſh Officers under his Pay, as
Major-General <hi>Erskin, Graham, Coleman, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,
Melvin,</hi> and others. His Lieutenant-General
is one <hi>Chavot</hi> a Proteſtant of <hi>Alſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
an excellent and experienced Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
I ſhall add no more concerning this
Prince, his Officers, or Country; but that
he, with the other two Princes of the Houſe
of <hi>Lunenbourg, Hanouer,</hi> and <hi>Wolfembuttel,</hi>
can upon occaſion bring into the Field 36000
Soldiers, whom they keep in conſtant Pay,
and ſuch Men as I never ſaw better in my
life.</p>

AFter ſome ſtay at the Court of the Duke
of <hi>Zell,</hi> I went to <hi>Hambourg,</hi> a famous
Hanſiatick Town. It is a Republick, and City
of great Trade, occaſioned partly by the
Engliſh Company of <hi>Merchant Adventurers,</hi>
but much more by the Dutch Proteſtants,
who in the time of the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
the Low-Countries and ſettled here, and
the Proteſtants alſo who were turned out of
<hi>Cologne,</hi> and other Places in <hi>Germany;</hi> who
nevertheleſs are not now allowed Publick
Churches within the City, but at a place called
<hi>Altena,</hi> a Village belonging to the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
a quarter of an hours walk diſtant from
<hi>Hambourg.</hi> This Commonwealth is <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
and governed by 4 Burghermaſters, 24
Radts-heers, and a Common-Council of all
the Burghers who have above 40 Shillings
<hi>per Annum</hi> Freehold. The Symbol or Motto
under their Arms, is, <hi>Da Pacem Domine in
Diebus noſtris;</hi> and in their Standards are
theſe Letters <hi>S. P. Q. H.</hi> The People here
groan under heavy Taxes and Impoſitions;
The State, becauſe of continual Alarms they
have from the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> or other
Neighbours; and the Inteſtine Broils that
frequently happen here, as well as at <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gne,</hi>
where the Burghermaſters are often in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of their Lives from the mutinous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile;
being forced to maintain 6 or 7000
Men in Pay, beſides 2 or 3 Men of War to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57758:57"/>
guard their Havens from Pirats. I ſhall not
name all the ways of impoſing Taxes which
this Commonwealth uſes, becauſe in moſt
they imitate the Methods of the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
as to that, which have been mentioned
before: I ſhall only take notice of ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Cuſtoms they have, wherein they
differ from <hi>Holland.</hi> When a Barber, Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
or any other Artizan dies, leaving
a Widow and Children, another of the
ſame Trade is not admitted to ſet up for
himſelf as a Maſter, unleſs he compound
with the Widow for a piece of Money, or

                  <p>If any Man cauſe another to be Arreſted
for Debt, or upon any other Suit, the
Plaintiff muſt go along with the Officer who
Arreſts the Party, and ſtay by him until
the Priſoner be examined by the Sheriff;
ſo that if the Sheriff be not to be ſpoken
with that night, the Plaintiff muſt tarry
with the Priſoner all night, until the Sheriff
examin the matter, and ſee cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
or committing the Party; but
this a Plaintiff may do by a Procuration
Notarial.</p>
                  <p>If a Priſoner be committed for Debt, the
Plaintiff muſt maintain him in Priſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Quality; and if the Party
lie in Priſon during the ſpace of 6 Years, at
the expiration of that time the Priſoner is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57758:58"/>
diſcharged; and if during the time of his

Months end, the Priſoner is ſet at liberty,
and nevertheleſs the Plaintiff muſt pay the
Gaoler the laſt Month's Allowance.</p>
                  <p>This State is ſevere in the execution of
Juſtice againſt Thieves, Murderers, and
Cheats. There is no Pardon to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
for Murder, and a Burghermaſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
if Guilty, cannot eſcape. The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for Murder is here as in <hi>Sweden,</hi>
breaking Malefactors on the Wheel, pinching
their Breaſts and Arms with hot Pincers,
ſpitting them in at the Fundament, and out
at the Shoulder: They have alſo cruel ways
of Torturing to make Priſoners confeſs;
and are very careful not to be cheated in
their Publick Revenue, their Exciſe-men
and Collectors being Puniſhed as in <hi>Holland.</hi>
They take a very good courſe not to be
cheated in their Exciſe, for all the Mills of
the Country are in the hands of the State;
ſo that no Baker nor Brewer can grind his
own Corn, but muſt have it ground at the
States Mills, where they pay the Exciſe.
There is a General Tax upon all Houſes,
and that is the Eighth Penny, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
does not excuſe them from Chimney-money.
The States here, as at <hi>Genoua</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> are the Publick Vintners, of whom
all People muſt buy their Wine, which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57758:58"/>
they buy from the Merchant, or otherwiſe
import it in their own Ships. In their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of Burying and Chriſtening, they
are ridiculouſly Prodigal; as for Inſtance: If
one invite a Burghermaſter, he muſt give
him a Ducat in Gold; if a Radts-heer, that
is, an Alderman, a Rixdollar; to every
Preacher, Doctor of Phyſick, Advocate or
Secretary, half a Rixdollar; and to every
Schoolmaſter, the third part of a Rixdollar.
The Women are the Inviters to Burials,
Weddings, and Chriſtenings, who wear an
Antick kind of a Dreſs, having Mitred Caps
as high again as the Mitre of a Biſhop.
The Churches here are rich in Revenues
and Ornaments, as Images and ſtately Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
wherein they much delight. They
are great Lovers of <hi>Muſick,</hi> inſomuch that I
have told 75 Maſters of ſeveral ſorts of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
in one Church, beſides thoſe who were
in the Organ-Gallery. Their Organs are
extraordinary large: I meaſured the great
Pipes in the Organs of St. <hi>Catherine</hi>'s and
St. <hi>James</hi>'s Churches, and found them to be
3 Foot and 3 quarters in circumference, and
32 Foot long; in each of which Organs
there are two Pipes 5 Foot and 8 Inches
round. The Wealth and Trade of this
City encreaſes daily; they ſend one Year
with another 70 Ships to <hi>Greenland,</hi> and
have wonderfully Engroſſed that Trade
from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and it's believed,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57758:59"/>
that ſmall and great there are belonging to
this Commonwealth five thouſand Sail of
Ships. After <hi>Amſterdam, Genoua</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi>
their Bank is reckoned the chief in Credit;
but in Trade they are accounted the third in
<hi>Europe,</hi> and come next to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.
Hambourg</hi> is now become the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
of <hi>Germany,</hi> and of the Baltick and
Northern Seas. They give great Privileges
to the Jews, and to all Strangers whatſoever,
eſpecially the Engliſh Company of Merchant
Adventurers, whom they allow a large Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where they have a Church, and where
the Deputy-Governour, Secretary, Miniſter,
and the other Officers of the Company live,
to whom they yearly make Preſents of Wine,
Beer, Sheep, Salmond and Sturgeon in their
ſeaſons. And ſo much of <hi>Hambourg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FRom <hi>Hambourg</hi> I went to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> which
is alſo a Commonwealth and Imperial
Town. It is a large well-built City, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ten Pariſh-Churches; the Cathedral
dedicated to St. <hi>Peter</hi> being in length 500
Foot, with two high Spires all covered with
Braſs, as the reſt of the Churches of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are. In former times this City was the
place where the Deputies of all the Hanſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Towns aſſembled, and was once ſo
powerful as to make War againſt <hi>Denmark</hi>
and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and to conquer ſeveral places
and Iſlands belonging to thoſe two Crowns,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57758:59"/>
nay and to lend Ships to <hi>England</hi> and other
Potentates, without any prejudice to their
own Trade, wherein they vyed in all parts
with their Neighbours; but it is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
run into decay, not only in Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
but in Wealth and Trade alſo. And
the reaſon of that was chiefly the Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Zeal of their Lutheran Miniſters, who
perſwaded the Magiſtrates to baniſh all Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks, Calviniſts, Jews, and all
that diſſented from them in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
even the Engliſh Company too, who
all went and ſetled in <hi>Hambourg,</hi> to the great
Advantage of that City, and almoſt ruine of
<hi>Lubeck,</hi> which hath not now above 200 Ships
belonging to it, nor more Territories to the
State than the City it ſelf, and a ſmall part
called <hi>Termond,</hi> about eight Miles diſtant from
it. The reſt of their Territories are now in
the poſſeſſion of the Danes and Swedes, by
whom the Burghers are ſo continually alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they are quite tired out with keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Guard, and paying of Taxes. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is indeed well fortified; but the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not being able to maintain above 1500
Soldiers in pay, 400 Burghers in two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
are obliged to watch every Day. They
have a large well-built Stadthouſe, and an
Exchange covered, on the top whereof the
Globes of the World are painted. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
is about 50 Yards in the length, and
but 15 in breadth: Over it there is a Room
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57758:60"/>
where the Skins of five Lyons which the
Burghers killed at the City-Gates in the Year
1252. are kept ſtuft. The great Market-place
is very large, where a Monumental-Stone
is to be ſeen, on which one of their
Burghermaſters was beheaded for running
away without fighting in a Sea-Engagement.
The People here ſpend much time in their
Churches at Devotion, which conſiſts chiefly
in Singing. The Women are beautiful, but
disfigured with a kind of Antick Dreſs, they
wearing Cloaks like Men. It is cheap living
in this Town: For one may hire a Palace
for a matter of 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, and have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
at very reaſonable Rates; beſides the
Air and Water is very good, the City being
ſupplied with Fountains of Excellent Freſh
Water, which <hi>Hambourg</hi> wants; and good
Ground for Celleridge, there being Cellars
here 40 or 50 Foot deep.</p>
                  <p>I Had the Curioſity to go from <hi>Lubeck</hi> to
ſee the Ancient City of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> but
found it ſo ruined and decayed by the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
War, that I had no Encouragement to
ſtay there. I therefore haſtened to <hi>Berlin,</hi>
the chief Reſidence of the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg;</hi>
at whoſe Court I met with a very
Ingenuous French Merchant, who told me,
that he, and divers other Merchants, were
deſigned to have lived in <hi>England,</hi> but were
diſcouraged by a Letter ſent from <hi>London,</hi> by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57758:60"/>
a French-Man that was removing from thence
to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for theſe following Reaſons,
which I Copied out of his Letter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Reformed Religion is
perſecuted in <hi>England</hi> as it is <hi>France;</hi> the
which I told him was a great Untruth, for
it is apparent that they have been all along
graciouſly admitted, and received into his
Majeſties Dominions, without interruption,
and allowed the free Exerciſe of their own
Form of Worſhip, according to the Doctrine
and Diſcipline of the Churches of <hi>France.</hi>
Nor can they who converſe with the French
Miniſters either in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that the chiefeſt part, if not all thoſe
Miniſters, are willing to comply with the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> and it is evident that
moſt of the Dutch and French Proteſtants
(ſo called) in <hi>Holland</hi> make uſe of Organs in
their Churches.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond thing was, that both the Bank
at <hi>London</hi> and the Bankers Goldſmiths were
all broak; the which I told this Frenchman
was not true altogether, for there are many
able Bankers whom I named: Neither was
the Bank (as he called the Chamber of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)</hi>
broak, only it had been under the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of a bad Perſon, whoſe deſign was
to bring it into diſgrace. Beſides, there is
the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company</hi> an unqueſtionable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for thoſe as have Money to diſpoſe of,
together with another undeniable Security
which is Land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57758:61"/>
Thirdly, he ſaith, That in <hi>England</hi> there
is no Regiſter, and therefore many Frauds
in Purchaſes and Morgages, which beget
tedious Suits, and renders both dangerous
to truſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That if a Man would purchaſe
Land he cannot, being an Alien, until Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That in <hi>England</hi> there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Plots and Confuſions in Government,
that the Kingdom is hardly quiet 20 Years
together.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, that falſe Witneſſes were ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in <hi>England,</hi> and the Crime of Perjury
ſo ſlightly puniſhed, that no Man could be
ſafe in Life or Eſtate, if he chanced to be
in Trouble.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly he ſaid, that the Engliſh are ſo reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and quarelſom, that they not only fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and cheriſh Animoſities amongſt one
another, but are every foot contriving and
plotting againſt their Lawful Sovereign, and
the Government. By ſuch Surmiſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations
as theſe, the French and Germans
are ſcared from truſting themſelves and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore ſettle in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,
Hamburgh,</hi> and other Cities, where
there are Banks and Regiſters: This I ſay is
one cauſe, why there are now to be ſeen at
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſuch vaſt numbers of French and
Germans, who have much enrich'd that
City, and raiſed the Rents of the Houſes 20
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57758:61"/>
                     <hi>per Cent.</hi> And the Silk-weavers grow alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rich, keeping ſo many Alms-Children to
do their Work, and having all their Labour
without any Charge, only for the teaching
them their Trades; which hath leſſened the
Revenues of the French Crown, and will,
in time, greatly increaſe the number of the
States Subjects, and advance their publick
Incomes.</p>
                  <p>Having made this Digreſſion, I return to
<hi>Berlin;</hi> It is a City enlarged with fair Streets
and Palaces: The Magiſtrates of the place
are Lutherans, which is the publick eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion in all the Electors Dominions;
though he himſelf and his Children be Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts:
He is look'd upon to be ſo true to
that Perſuaſion, that he is reckoned the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of the Calviniſts; and indeed he ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
the Emperor very hard for a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Proteſtants in <hi>Hungary.</hi> His
Chaplains, as moſt of the Lutheran Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
alſo, endeavour to imitate the Engliſh
in their way of Preaching: And his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is ſo much taken with Engliſh Divinity,
that he entertains Divines for tranſlating En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Books into the German Tongue, as
<hi>The Whole Duty of Man,</hi> and ſeveral others.
He has a large and ſtately Palace at <hi>Berlin,</hi>
and therein a copious Library, enriched with
many Manuſcripts, Medals, and Rarities of
Antiquity. He may compare with moſt
Princes for handſom Guards, being all of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57758:62"/>
them proper well-bodied Men, and moſt
part Officers who ride in his Guards of
Horſe. As he is known in the World to be
a Valiant and Warlike Prince, ſo he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in Pay an Army of 36000 Men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
five or ſix thouſand Horſemen, who in
time of War are modelled into Troops;
with which Body during the late War with
<hi>Sweden,</hi> his Highneſs's Father in Perſon beat
the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of his Country. He keeps
his Forces in ſtrict Diſcipline, obliging all
the Officers, if Proteſtants, on <hi>Sundays</hi> and
Holy-days to march their ſeveral Companies
in order to Church; but if a Superiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
be of a contrary Perſwaſion, then the
next in Commiſſion ſupplies his place. This
cuſtom is Religiouſly obſerved by all his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
Gariſons, whilſt he himſelf goes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
to the Calviniſt Church adjoyning
to the Court, with his Children, being five
Sons, two Daughters, and two Daughters-in-Law.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other Acts of Publick Piety and
Charity, this Prince hath eſtabliſhed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
ſome Religious Houſes or Nunneries
for Proteſtant young Ladies, where they
may live virtuouſly, and ſpend their time in
Devotion as long as they pleaſe, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Marry, if they think fit, but then they
loſe the benefit of the Monaſtery. There is
one of theſe at <hi>Hertford</hi> in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> where

was Married to the Daughter of the

WHen I parted from <hi>Berlin,</hi> I made
a turn back to <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> in my
way to <hi>Swedeland,</hi> where I found ſeveral of
my Countrymen Officers in the Gariſon,
who ſhewed me what was moſt remarkable
in the City, as the Saltworks, (which bring
in conſiderable Sums of Money to the
Duke of <hi>Lunenbourg)</hi> the Stadthouſe, and
Churches, in one of which I ſaw a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table
of pure Ducat-Gold. From
thence I went into the Province of <hi>Holſtein</hi>

HE that hath read in the Hiſtories of this

a fancy that it muſt be an excellent Country
which hath bred ſuch Warriors; but if he
approach it, he will ſoon find himſelf unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Entering into <hi>Swedeland,</hi> at a place
called <hi>Landſort,</hi> we ſail'd forward amongſt high
Rocks, having no other proſpect from Land
but Mountains till we came to <hi>Dollers,</hi> which
is about four Swediſh, that is, twenty four
Engliſh Miles from <hi>Stockholm,</hi> the Capital
City of the Kingdom. Upon my coming
aſhore, I confeſs I was a little ſurprized to
ſee the Poverty of the People; and the little
Wooden Houſes they lived in, not unlike
Soldiers Huts in a Leaguer; but much more,
when I diſcovered little elſe in the Country
but Mountainous Rocks, and ſtanding Lakes
of Water. The Reader will excuſe me, I
hope, if I remark not all that I may have

upon that Road the City of <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm</hi>
looks great, becauſe of the King's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
the Houſes of Noblemen, and ſome
Churches which are ſeated upon Rocks: And
indeed, the whole City and Suburbs ſtand
upon Rocks, unleſs it be ſome few Houſes
built upon Ground gained from the Rivers
that run through the Town. <hi>Stockholm</hi> has
its Name from a Stock or Log of Wood,
which three Brothers threw into the Water
five Miles above the City, making a Vow,
that where-ever that Stock ſhould ſtop, they
would build a Caſtle to dwell in. The Stock
ſtopt at the Holm, or Rock where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of the King now ſtands: And the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to be as good as their word, there
built their Caſtle, which invited others to do
the like; ſo that in proceſs of time the other
Rocks or Holms were covered with Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which at length became the Capital
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57758:64"/>
City of the Kingdom. It is now embeliſhed
with a great many ſtately Houſes, and much
improved from what it was 400 Years ago,
as indeed moſt Cities are; for the Stadthouſe
then built, is ſo contemptible and low, that in
<hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>England</hi> it would not be ſuffered
to ſtand to diſgrace the Nation. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Chamber
where the Burghmaſters and
Raedt ſit, is two Rooms caſt into one, not
above nine Foot high; and the two Rooms
where the Sheriffs and the Erve College
(which is a Judicature like to the Doctors
Commons in <hi>England)</hi> ſit, are not above
eight Foot and a half high. The King's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
is a large Square of Stone-building, in
ſome places very high, but an old and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Fabrick, without a ſufficient quantity
of Ground about it for Gardens and Walks.
It was anciently ſurrounded with Water; but
ſome Years ſince part of it was filled up to
make a Way from the Caſtle-Gate down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the old Town. In this Palace there are
large Rooms; but the Lodgings of the King,
Queen, and Royal Family, are three Pair of
Stairs high, the Rooms in the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Stories being deſtin'd for the Senate-Chamber,
and other Courts of Judicature.
The King's Library is four Pair of Stairs
high, being a Room about forty ſix Foot
ſquare, with a Cloſet adjoyning to it not
half the Dimenſions. When I conſidered
the Apartments and Furniture of this Court,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57758:65"/>
I began to think that the French Author
wrote Truth, who in his Remarks upon
<hi>Swedeland</hi> ſays, That when Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi>
reſigned the Crown to <hi>Carolus Guſtavus,</hi> the
Father of this preſent King, ſhe diſpoſed of
the beſt of the Furniture of the Court, and
gave away a large ſhare of the Crown-Lands
to her Favorites; in ſo much that the King,
conſidering the poor Condition ſhe had left
the Kingdom in, and ſeeing the Court ſo
meanly furniſhed, ſaid, That had he known
before he accepted the Crown, what then
he did, he would have taken other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
                  <p>There are many other ſtately Palaces in
<hi>Stockholm</hi> belonging to the Nobility; but
many of them for want of Repairs, and not
being inhabited, run to ruine; ſeveral of the
Nobles who lived in them formerly, having
loſt the Eſtates that maintained their ancient
Splendor, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, being
retired unto a Country Life. There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſome other Magnificent Structures begun,
but not finiſhed, as that ſtately Building in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for a Parliament-Houſe for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and two or three Churches: But what
I moſt wonder at, is the Vault wherein the
late King lies buried, is not as yet covered
but with Boards, for it is to be obſerved that
the Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> have no Tombs and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
as in <hi>England</hi> and other Countries;
but are put into Copper Coffins, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57758:65"/>
on them, and placed one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Vaults, adjoyning to the Gray-Friers
Church. Theſe Vaults are about eight in
Number, having Turrets over them, with
Veins of Copper gilt, carved into the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of the ſeveral Kings who give them
their Names by being the firſt that are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in them. The Vault of the late King is
not yet finiſhed, no more than the Fabricks
above-mentioned, which perhaps may be
imputed to the late Troubles of <hi>Swedeland.</hi>
The Number of the Inhabitants of <hi>Stockholm</hi>
are alſo much decreaſed within theſe few
Years, partly by reaſon of the removal of
the Court of Admiralty and the Kings Ships
from that City to <hi>Charles-Crown,</hi> a new Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
lately made about 200 Engliſh Miles
from thence, which hath drawn many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
belonging to the Fleet and Admiralty
from <hi>Stockholm</hi> to live there: And partly,
becauſe many of the Nobility, Gentry, and
thoſe that depended on them, are, as I ſaid
before, withdrawn from <hi>Stockholm</hi> to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
Life in the Country. Nevertheleſs the
ordinary ſort of Burghers, who ſtill remain,
are extreamly poor; ſeeing the Women are
fain to work like Horſes, drawing Carts, and
as Labourers in <hi>England,</hi> ſerving Maſons and
Bricklayers with Stone, Bricks and Mortar,
and unloading Veſſels that bring thoſe Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials;
ſome of the poor Creatures in the
Summer-time toiling in their Smocks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57758:66"/>
either Shooes or Stockings. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
alſo the part of Watermen, and for a
ſmall matter will Row Paſſengers 40 Miles
or more if they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>The Court here is very thin and ſilent,
the King living frugally, and ſeldom Dining
in publick. He Eats commonly with the
two Queens, his Mother and Conſort, who
is a Virtuous Princeſs, Siſter to the King of
<hi>Denmark.</hi> She is the Mother of five Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
three Sons and two Daughters, with
whom ſhe ſpends moſt of her time in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement.
The King is a goodly Prince,
whom God hath Bleſſed and Endowed with
Accompliſhments far beyond what might
have been expected from his Education,
wherein he was extreamly abuſed, being
Taught little more than his Mother Tongue.
He is Gracious, Juſt and Valiant, conſtant
at his Devotion, and utterly averſe from all
kind of Debauchery, and the unfaſhionable
Vanities of other Courts, in Plays and
Dancing.</p>
                  <p>His ſports are Hunting and Exerciſing of
his Guards, and he rarely appears publickly,
or gives Audience to Strangers, which is
imputed to his Senſe of the neglect of his
Education. He is a Prince that hath had a
very hard beginning in the World, which
hath many times proved fortunate to great
Men; and indeed, if we conſider all the
circumſtances of his early Misfortunes, how
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57758:66"/>
he was ſlighted and neglected by his Nobles,
who would hardly vouchſafe to pay him a
viſit when he was among them in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
or to do him Homage for the Lands
they held of the Crown; and how by the
pernicious Counſels of the French, and the
weakneſs or treachery of his Governors, he
was miſled into a War that almoſt coſt him
his Crown, having loſt the beſt of his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Schonen,</hi> and moſt of
his Forces both by Sea and Land: If, I ſay,
theſe things be conſidered, it will probably
appear, that hardly any Prince before him
hath in a ſhorter time, or more fully ſetled
the Authority and Prerogative of the Crown,
than he hath done in <hi>Sweden;</hi> for which he
ſtands no ways obliged to <hi>France,</hi> as he was
for the Reſtauration of what he loſt during
the War. He is now as abſolute as the French
King, and makes Edicts, which have the
Force of Laws, without the concurrence of
the Eſtates of the Kingdom. He hath erected
two Judicatures, the one called the College
of Reduction, and the other of Inſpections;
the firſt of which hath put his Majeſty in
Poſſeſſion again of all Lands alienated from
the Crown, and the other called to account
all Perſons, even the Heirs and Executors of
thoſe who had cheated the Crown, and
made them refund what they or their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
had appropriated to their own uſe of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57758:67"/>
the publick Revenue. Theſe two neceſſary
Conſtitutions, as they have reduced many
great Families to a pinch, who formerly
lived ſplendidly upon the Crown Lands and
Revenues, and obliged them to live at home
upon their ancient and private Patrimony in
the Country, which is one great cauſe that
the Court of <hi>Sweden</hi> is at preſent ſo unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented;
ſo have they enabled his Majeſty;
without burdening of his Subjects, to ſupport
the Charges of the Government, and to
maintain 64000 Men in pay. The Truth is,
his other Revenues are but ſmall, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
from the Copper and Iron Mines, one
Silver Mine, the Pitch and Tar, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
and Exciſe amounts to no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Sum of Money, and the Land Tax in
ſo barren a Country ſcarcely deſerving to be
named. The Cuſtomes and Exciſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
are very high, and the rigorous manner
of exacting them pernicious to Trade: As for
inſtance; If a Ship come to <hi>Stockholme</hi> from
<hi>London,</hi> with a hundred ſeveral ſorts of Goods,
and thoſe Goods aſſigned to fifty ſeveral
Men more or leſs, if any of thoſe fifty do
not pay the Cuſtom of what belongs to him,
though it be for a Barrel of Beer, the Ship
ſhall not be unladen, nor no Man have his
Goods out, though he hath fully pay'd the
Cuſtoms for them, till this laſt Man hath
pay'd his. There are ſeveral other ſilly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57758:67"/>
Cuſtoms in <hi>Swedeland</hi> that diſcourages Men
from Trading there; as if any Stranger Die
there, a third of his Eſtate muſt go to the
City or Town where he Traded. No Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Merchant in <hi>Stockholme</hi> can Travel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any Country where there is a Fair with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Paſſport: And at preſent, ſeeing there
is no Treaty of Trade betwixt <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Sweden,</hi> though the Engliſh bring as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Trade to that Kingdom as any other
Country whatſoever, yet they are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly
uſed by the Officers of the Cuſtom-Houſe;
whereas the Dutch in <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and
other Cities, have new and greater Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
allowed them. Nor would I Counſel
an Engliſh-man to go to Law with a Swediſh
Burgher in <hi>Sweden,</hi> eſpecially if he be a
Whiggiſh Scot, who hath got his Freedom
in <hi>Stockholme,</hi> for thoſe are a kind of Scrapers,
whom I have obſerved to be more inveterate
againſt the Engliſh than the Native Swedes.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Swediſh Army of 64000 Men,
the King keeps but 12 Companies of 200
Men a-peice, with ſome few Horſe Guards
in <hi>Stockholme,</hi> who are not upon Duty as
Sentinels at the Court Gates, as at the Courts
of other Princes. The reſt are diſperſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Quarters and Gariſons upon the Frontiers,
which are ſo far diſtant in that large compaſs
of Land which his Territories take up, that
it would require a hard and tedious work to
bring them together to a general Muſter.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57758:68"/>
They are however kept under very ſtrict
Diſcipline, and thoſe that lie near, often
viewed by the King. They have odd ſort,
of Puniſhments for the Soldiers and Officers
of all Degrees: For Example, if a Serjeant
or Corporal be Drunk, or negligent on Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they are put into Armour, and with three
Muskets tied under each Arm, made to walk
two Hours before the Court of Guard; yet,
for all the ſeverity of Diſcipline uſed againſt
the Soldiers, they commit many Abuſes in
the Night time, Robbing, and ſometimes
killing Men upon the Streets in <hi>Stockholme,</hi>
where they have no Lights nor Guards as in
<hi>Copenhagen.</hi> In former times there have
been at one time 35 Colonels, beſides Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Officers in the Swediſh Army, all the
Subjects of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> but
at preſent there are few or none, unleſs it
be the Sons of ſome Scotiſh Officers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed;
nor did I ever ſee an Engliſh-Man
in the Kings Guards, Horſe or Foot, but
one, and the Son of Sir <hi>Edward Wood,</hi> who
hath ſince quitted the Service. The King
hath exceedingly won the Hearts of the
common People, not only by exempting
them from the Tyrannical juriſdiction of the
Nobility and Gentry, who formerly would
by their own private Authority, puniſh and
put to Death the Peaſants at their pleaſure,
which makes the Countries very willing to
Quarter the Kings Soldiers, but by his exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57758:68"/>
in puniſhing Duels, Murder, and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries.
Perjury is Death here alſo, as in
<hi>Holland,</hi> which makes the Magiſtrates in ſome
parts of this Kings Territories, enjoyn ſtrange
kinds of Oaths to deter Men from being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn:
As for inſtance, in ſome places the
Witneſs is ſet with a Staff in his Hand upon
ſome Peeble Stones and Charcoal, where he
is to imprecate and pray, that if what he
Sweareth be not true, his Land may become
as barren as thoſe Stones, and his Subſtance
be Conſumed to Aſhes like the Coals he ſtands
on, which as ſoon as he ſteps down are ſet
on Fire. This manner of Swearing ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies
the People, that they commonly trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
when they come to take their Oath.</p>
                  <p>The Religion of the Dominions of the
King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as of thoſe of the King of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> and of other Princes and States
whom we have named, is Lutheran, who are
more rigid to Roman Catholicks and Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
than the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany.</hi> There
is no Toleration allowed here to Calviniſt
Miniſters; and they take an effectual courſe
to keep the Country clear of Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
by Guelding them, whether they be
young or old. In Commemoration of the
great Loſſes and Deſolation ſuſtained in the
late War, the Suedes ſtrictly keep four Faſting
Days in the Months of <hi>April, May, June,</hi>
and <hi>July;</hi> on which days all Men are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
by Authority to kindle Fire in their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57758:69"/>
Houſes, or to Eat till after Evening Service
is done, which in the Winter time could not
be endured. They delight much in Singing
in their Churches, which they conſtantly
perform twice every day, Morning and
Evening. In their Marryings, Chriſtenings,
and Buryings they are ſo prodigally extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
that if all three happen in one year to
a Man of a competent Eſtate, it is enough
to break him. The Clergy of <hi>Sweden</hi> are
neither ſo Rich nor Learned as thoſe of
<hi>Germany,</hi> wanting both the opportunities of
Study, and of converſing with Learned Men,
that thoſe of other Countrys enjoy, though
there be ſome Learned Men amongſt them.
A Biſhoprick in <hi>Sweden</hi> is no great Benefice,
if compared with ſome Parſonages in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
for the Arch-biſhop, and Metropolitan
hath not above 400 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and ſome
of the reſt are not worth above 150 or 200 <hi>l.</hi>
a year. The inferiour Clergy are not ſo
regular in their Lives and Converſation in the
Countries diſtant from <hi>Stockholme,</hi> as they are
near the Court; and the Reaſon is, partly
becauſe they entertain Travellers that paſs the
Country, there being no Inns in moſt places
for the Accommodation of Perſons of any
Quality, and ſo are obliged to drink with
their Gueſts; and partly, becauſe at Buryings
and Chriſtenings, where there is commonly
high Drinking, the Pape or Parſon is Maſter
of the Ceremonies: And here give me leave
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57758:69"/>
to tell a ſhort Story of one of them. A Pape
coming to Chriſten a Child in a Church,
and finding a Scotch Man to be Godfather,
was ſo tranſported either with Zeal, or his
Cups, that when he came to exorciſe the
Child, which is a Rite uſed in their Office of
Adminiſtring this Sacrament; he neglected
the Form preſcribed by the Liturgy, and in
an extemporary Prayer begg'd, that the Devil
might depart out of the Child, and enter
into that Scottiſh Heretick, for ſo they call
the Presbyterians of that Nation. The Prayer
of the Pape ſo incenſed the Scot, that he
vowed Revenge, and watched the Pape with
a good Cudgel next day as he croſſed the
Church-yard, where he beat him, and left
him all in Blood lying on the Ground, and
crying out Murder. For this Fact the Scot
was had before the Juſtice, who asking him,
How he durſt be ſo bold as to lay his profane
Hands upon the Man of God? He, who
knew very well what uſe to make of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
he had got, Foaming at the Mouth, and
cunningly acting the Demoniack, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That the Pape might thank himſelf
for what he had met with; for ſince he had
Conjured the Devil into him he ſpared no
Body, neither Wife nor Children, nor would
he ſpare the Juſtice himſelf, and with that
fell a mangling and tearing the Magiſtrate,
that he was fain to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> take himſelf to his
Heels, crying out <hi>O! the Devil, ſave me;</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57758:70"/>
and ſo the Scot marched home, no Man da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to lay hold on him, for fear of being
torn to pieces by the Devil. But the Juſtice
recollecting himſelf, ſent for the Pape, told
him, That the Scot was a cunning Rogue,
and bid him go home, get a Plaiſter for his
Head, and be ſilent, leſt if the matter came
to the Biſhops Ears he might be Cenſured for
going againſt the Rubrick of the Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>The Famous Univerſity where their Clergy
are bred, is <hi>Upſal,</hi> 8 Swediſh Miles from
<hi>Stockholme.</hi> There are commonly 150, or
200 Students there, but no Endowed Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
as in other Countries. The Library
is ſo mean and contemptible, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries
of many Grammar Schools, and of
private Men in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> are far
better ſtored with Books than it is. Upon
viewing of it, and that of the Kings Palace,
I called to mind the ſaying of a French Man,
upon the like occaſion; That <hi>Swedeland</hi>
came behind <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Men and Things at leaſt 800 years;
yet ſome Swedes have been ſo conceited of
the Antiquity of their Country, as to brag,
that Paradice was ſeated in <hi>Sweden;</hi> that the
Country was turned into ſuch heaps of Rocks
for the Rebellion of our firſt Parents, and that
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
three Swediſh Miles diſtant from <hi>Upſall.</hi>
A French Man ſtanding by, and hearing this
Romantick Story, as I was told, fitted him
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57758:70"/>
with the like, telling him, that when the
World was made in ſix days, at the end of
the Creation all the Rubbiſh that remained
was thrown together into a Corner, which
made up <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi> And indeed,
the French ſeem to have no great liking to
the Country, whatever kindneſs they may
have for the People; for a French Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
as an Author of that Country relates,
being by order of Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> Treated
in a Country Houſe four Swediſh Miles from
<hi>Stockholme,</hi> and upon the rode going and
coming, with all the Varieties and Pleaſures
that the Country could afford, on purpoſe
to make him have a good Opinion of the
ſame; made anſwer to the Queen, (who
asked him upon his return, What he thought
of <hi>Sweden)</hi> That were he Maſter of the
whole Country, he would preſently Sell it,
and Buy a Farm in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England;</hi> which,
under Favour, I think was a little Tart and
Sawcy.</p>
                  <p>Having ſtayed a conſiderable time in
<hi>Swedeland,</hi> and moſt part at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> I ſet
out from thence to go to <hi>Elſenbourg</hi> by Land,
and went a little out of my way to ſee a
ſmall City called <hi>Eubrone,</hi> Famous for a Coat
of Arms which it got in this manner. A
certain Maſculine Queen of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who
had Conquered a great part of <hi>Sweden,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this City, asked the Magiſtrates, What
was the Arms of their City? Who having
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57758:71"/>
her, that they had none, ſhe plucked up her
Coats, and ſquatting upon the Snow, bid
them take the mark ſhe left there for their
Arms; its pity ſhe did not give them a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Motto to it alſo: What that Figure is
called in Blazonery I know not, but to this
Day the City uſes it in their Arms, and for
marking their Commodities. This Queen
came purpoſely into <hi>Sweden,</hi> to pay a viſit
to a brave Woman, that oppoſed a King of
<hi>Swedeland,</hi> who in a time of Famine would
have put to Death all the Men and Women
in his Country above 60 years of Age. The
Country all the way I travelled in <hi>Swedeland</hi>
is much of the ſame quality of the Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Stockholme,</hi> until I came near the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Schonen,</hi> which is called the Store-houſe,
and Kitchin of <hi>Sweden,</hi> where the
Country is far better. It was formerly very
dangerous to Travel in this Province of
<hi>Schonen,</hi> becauſe of the Snaphances, who
were a kind of Bloody Robbers, now utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtroyed by the King; ſo that it is ſafe
enough Travelling there. Entering into
<hi>Schonen</hi> I ſaw 29 of theſe Rogues upon
Wheels, and elſewhere in the Country, ten
and twenty at ſeveral places. The King uſed
great ſeverity in deſtroying of them; ſome
he cauſed to be broken upon the Wheel, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Spitted in at the Fundament, and out
at the Shoulders, many had the Fleſh pinched
off of their Breaſts, and ſo were faſtened to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57758:71"/>
Stakes till they Died; and others again had
their Noſes and both Hands cut off, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeared with a hot Iron, were let go to
acquaint their Comrades how they had been
ſerved. The King is very ſevere againſt High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-Men
and Duellers. In above a 100 Miles
Travelling, we found not a Houſe where there
was either French Wine or Brandy, which made
me tell a Swede of our Company, who was
Travelling to <hi>Denmark,</hi> that I would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to ſhew any Man 500 Houſes, wherein
a Traveller might have Wine, and other good
Accommodation in the ſpace of an Hundred
Miles upon any rode from <hi>London.</hi> There
are ſeveral ſmall Towns and fertile Land in
this Country of <hi>Schonen,</hi> lying upon the

<hi>Elſenbourg</hi> burnt down by the Danes in the
laſt War: Here I croſt over to <hi>Elſenore,</hi> the
paſſage being but a League broad.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> has a Caſtle at <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenore,</hi>
which commands the narrow paſſage
of the <hi>Soundt,</hi> where all Ships that enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
or come out of the Baltick Sea muſt pay
Toll. Having viſited this Caſtle, and ſtaid
about a Fortnight with the Engliſh Conſul,
and Sir <hi>John Paul,</hi> late Reſident at the Court
of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> I went to the Daniſh Court
at <hi>Copenhagen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>COpenhagen</hi> is the Capital City of <hi>Zec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Jutland,</hi> or <hi>Denmark,</hi> and place
of Reſidence of the King: It ſtands on a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57758:72"/>
Flat, encompaſſed with a pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Country, much reſembling <hi>England.</hi>
The Streets of the City are kept very neat and
clean, with Lights in the Night time for the
convenience and ſafety of thoſe who are then
abroad; a Cuſtom not as yet introduced
into <hi>Stockholme,</hi> where it is dangerous
to be abroad when it is dark. The Kings
Men of War lie hear very conveniently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
orderly ranged betwixt Booms, after the
manner of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and near the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
Houſe, which is a large pile of Building,
well furniſhed with Stores and Magazins, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by a Cittadel, that not only commands
the City, but alſo the Haven, and entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. The Court of <hi>Denmark</hi> is ſplendid,
and makes a far greater figure in the World
than that of <hi>Sweden,</hi> though not many years
ago, in the time of <hi>Carolus Guſtavus</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the preſent King of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> it was
almoſt reduced to its laſt, when the Walls of
<hi>Copenhagen</hi> ſaved that Crown and Kingdom.
That Siege was Famous, carried on with great
vigour by the Swede, and as bravely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Danes: The Monuments
whereof are to be ſeen in the Cannon Bullets
gilt that ſtill remain in the Walls of ſome
Houſes, and in the Steeple of the great Church
of the Town. The Royal Palace in <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen</hi>
is but ſmall, and a very ancient Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but his Majeſties Houſe <hi>Fredenburg</hi> is a
ſtately Fabrick of Modern Architecture, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57758:72"/>
very richly Furniſhed. <hi>Denmark</hi> is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
a flouriſhing Kingdom, and the King,
who hath now made it Hereditary, ſurpaſſes
moſt of his Predeceſſors in Power and
Wealth: He hath much enlarged his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
as well as Authority; and by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
and Royal Virtues, no leſs than the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
qualities of a great many able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of State, he hath gained the Univerſal
Love of his Subjects, and the eſteem of all
Foreign Princes and States. The Court is
much frequented every day, but eſpecially
on Sundays, where about Eleven of the Clock
in the Morning, the Nobility, Foreign Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and Officers of the Army aſſemble,
and make a glorious Appearance. There
one may ſee many Knights of the Order of
the Elephant of <hi>Malto;</hi> but I never ſaw any
Order of the like Nature as that of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
that King rarely appearing in his George and
Garter; but on days of publick Audience I
have obſerved at one time above 150 Coaches
attending at the Court of <hi>Denmark,</hi> which
are ten times more than ever I ſaw together
at that of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The King is affable, and
of eaſie acceſs to Strangers, ſeen often abroad
by his Subjects in his Gardens and Stables,
which are very large, and well furniſhed
with all ſorts of Horſes. He is a great lover
of Engliſh Horſes and Dogs, and delights
much in Hunting, as his Eldeſt Son the Prince,
with his Brothers do in Cock-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57758:73"/>
much, that the Engliſh Merchants cannot
make a more acceptable preſent to thoſe
Princes, than of Engliſh Game-Cocks. The
ſtanding Forces of <hi>Denmark</hi> are well diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined
Men, and Commanded by good
Officers, both Natives and Strangers, both
French and Scots, as Major General <hi>Duncan,</hi>
and Major General <hi>Veldun,</hi> both Scottiſh-Men,
whom I ſaw at <hi>Copenhagen.</hi> The Soldiers as
well as Courtiers are quartered upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
a Cuſtom which is likewiſe practiſed
in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and tho' ſomewhat uneaſie, yet
not repined at by the People, who by the
care and good Government of the King,
find Trade much advanced. For his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
by encouraging Strangers of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
to live in his Dominions, and allowing
the French and Dutch Calviniſts, to have
publick Churches, hath brought many Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Families to <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and by the
meaſure he hath taken for ſetling Trade in
prohibiting the Importation of Foreign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
and Reforming and new Model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>India</hi> Companies, hath
much encreaſed Commerce, and thereby
the Wealth of his Subjects; ſo that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the new Taxes impoſed upon all
Coaches, Wagons, Ploughs, and all real and
perſonal Eſtates, which amount to conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sums of Money; the People live very
well and contented. There are commonly
about 8000 Men in Gariſon in <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57758:73"/>
his Majeſties Regiment of Foot Guards, who
are all Cloathed in Red, with Cloaks to keep
them warm in the Winter time, is a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Body of Men; and with the Horſe
Guards, who are bravely mounted, and have
their Granadeers and Hautboys, make a very
fine ſhew. His Majeſty hath cauſed ſeveral
new Fortifications to be built upon the <hi>Elb,</hi>
and other Rivers, and hath now in his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
that ſtrong Caſtle called <hi>Hilgueland,</hi>
at preſent commanded by a Scottiſh-man. The
Queen of <hi>Denmark</hi> is a moſt virtuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
Siſter to the preſent Landtgrave of <hi>Heſſe
Caſſel,</hi> and in Perſwaſion a Calviniſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Chapel allowed her within the Court,
though the publick Religion of the King and
Kingdom be Lutheran. The Clergy here are
Learned, many of them having ſtudied at
<hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where they learnt the
Engliſh Language; and amongſt the Biſhops
there is one Doctor <hi>King</hi> the Son of a Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh-man.
But ſeeing it is my deſign rather
to obſerve the condition of the People, than
to be punctual in deſcribing all the Rarities that
are remarkable in the Countries I have been
in, I ſhall conclude what I have to ſay of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
by acquainted the Reader that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of that Country live far better than the
Swedes, and as well as moſt of their adjoyning
Neighbours; and that there are ſeveral places,
both there, and in <hi>Norway,</hi> which have the
Names of Engliſh Towns, as <hi>Arundale, Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

When I firſt began to write this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
I had ſome thoughts of making Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
upon the ſeveral Governments of
other States and Dominions, where I had
travelled ſome years before I was in the
Countries I have been ſpeaking of, as of the
reſt of <hi>Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy,</hi>
and <hi>France;</hi> but that was a Subject ſo large,
and the uſefulneſs of it to my preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
ſo inconſiderable, that by doing ſo, I
found I could neither ſatisfie the Curious, by
adding any thing material to thoſe many
who have already obliged the Publick by
the Remarks of their Travels in thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
or make my diſcontented Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
more averſe than they are already from
removing into thoſe Countries, where I
think few of them will chuſe to tranſport
themſelves for the ſake of Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
though <hi>England</hi> were even worſe than
they themſelves fancy it can be. All that
remains to be done then, is to conclude this
Treatiſe with an obvious and popular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that thoſe Countries, where Cities
are greateſt and moſt frequented by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Inhabitants, are always the beſt to live
in; and by comparing the City of <hi>London</hi>
with all other Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
by the Surveys I have made, (which
I think will hardly be contradicted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed)
that of all the Capital Cities of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
it is the biggeſt and moſt populous, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57758:74"/>
ſo prove conſequentially that <hi>England,</hi> for
the generality of People, is the beſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in the World, eſpecially for its Natives,
to live in. Now this being an Obſervation
(for what I know) not hitherto made good
by Induction and Inſtance, (as I intend to
do it) I hope it will pleaſe the Reader as
much, as if I gave him a particular account
of other Countries and Governments, and
leave it to his own Reflection to ſtate the
Compariſon.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>London</hi> within the Walls cannot
vye for bigneſs with many Cities of <hi>Europe;</hi>
yet take the City and Suburbs together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it hath been ſurvey'd by Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
in breadth from St. <hi>George</hi>'s Church in
<hi>Southwark</hi> to <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> and in length from
<hi>Limehouſe</hi> to <hi>Petty-France</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and
it is in a vaſt proportion larger in compaſs
of Ground, and number of Houſes, than
any City in <hi>Europe</hi> whatſoever. This I ſhall
demonſtrate firſt, by comparing it with
ſome Cities of <hi>Holland,</hi> and then with the
moſt conſiderable Cities of the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of <hi>Europe,</hi> which I ſhall ſet down in an
Alphabetical Order, with the number of the
Houſes they ſeverally contain.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>London</hi> and Suburbs was ſurveyed
ſome years ago by Mr. <hi>Morgan,</hi> there were
reckoned to be in it 84000 Houſes, beſides
Hoſpitals, Alms-houſes, and other Buildings,
that paid no Chimney-money to the King:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57758:75"/>
Now if thoſe were added, and the vaſt
number of new Houſes that have been built
ſince that Survey, upon modeſt computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>London</hi> may be reckoned to contain
100000 Houſes; nay, 'tis believed 120000,
which truly conſidering the extraordinary
Additions that have been made lately, is not
improbable; I know the <hi>French</hi> vapour, and
would perſwade the World, that <hi>Paris</hi> is
much bigger than <hi>London.</hi> And the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
will ſcarce believe, that <hi>London</hi> hath
more Houſes than the 18 Cities in <hi>Holland</hi>
that have Voices in the States, for (ſay they)
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſtands upon 1000 Morgans of
Land, and <hi>London</hi> ſtands but upon 1800.
To both which I anſwer, That it is very
true that <hi>Paris</hi> takes up a great ſpot of
Ground, but then you muſt conſider, that in
<hi>Paris</hi> there are ſeveral hundreds of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
Churches, Colleges, and Cloiſters,
ſome of them having large Gardens, and
that in <hi>Paris</hi> there are 7500 Palaces and
Ports for Coaches, which have likewiſe great
Gardens; whereas <hi>London</hi> is very thick built,
and in the City the Houſes have ſcarce a
Yard big enough to ſet a Pump or Houſe of
Conveniency in; but the Weekly Bills of
Mortality will decide this Queſtion, and
plainly give it to <hi>London,</hi> and ſo doth Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>la Cour,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> in his laſt
Eſſays dedicated to the King, making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that <hi>London</hi> is bigger than <hi>Paris, Roan,</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:57758:75"/>
and <hi>Rochel</hi> altogether; and as for <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
I do appeal to all knowing Men that
have ſeen it, that although it be true, that
it ſtands upon 1000 Morgans of Land, yet
there is not above 400 Morgans built; and
this I prove thus, that the large Gardens,
on the <hi>Heeregraft, Kyſersgraft,</hi> and <hi>Princegraft,</hi>
and the Burghwalls of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> take up more
than a third part of the City; then reckon the
Baſtions, and the ſpace of Ground between
the Wall and the Houſes, and all the Ground
unbuilt from the <hi>Utricks-Port</hi> to the <hi>Weſoper-Port,
Muyer-Port,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Seaſide, and
you will find it to be near <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Morgans</hi> of Land:
There are two Pariſhes in the Suburbs of
<hi>London,</hi> viz. <hi>Stepney,</hi> and <hi>St. Martins in the
Fields,</hi> (the latter being ſo big, that the
Parliament divided it into four Pariſhes) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them have more Houſes than <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
or <hi>Haerlem;</hi> and there are ſeveral other
great Pariſhes, as St. <hi>Margarets Weſtminſter,
St. Giles in the Fields, St. Olaves,</hi> and <hi>St. Mary
Saviours,</hi> the which if they ſtood apart in the
Country would make great Cities; we reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>London,</hi> and the Suburbs thereof to be
at leaſt 130 Pariſhes, which contains 100000
Houſes; now if you reckon 8 Perſons to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Houſe, then there are near 800000
Souls in <hi>London,</hi> but there are ſome that ſay,
there is a Million of Souls in it: I ſhall now
ſet down the Cities Alphabetically, and their
number of Houſes, as they were given to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57758:76"/>
me not only from the Surveyors and City
Carpenters, but from the Books of the Hearth-Money,
and Collectors of the ſeveral Taxes
in the reſpective Cities: And firſt I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the 18 Cities that have Voices in
the States of <hi>Holland.</hi>

                  <p>HIS Majeſty being earneſtly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
by the States of <hi>Holland,</hi>
and the Confederate Princes in
<hi>Germany, &amp;c.</hi> to meet at a General Congreſs,
to be held at the <hi>Hague,</hi> in order to Concert
matters for the next Campaign, was pleaſed
to Condeſcend to their Requeſt, and hazard
His Royal Perſon by Sea, (though in the
depth of Winter) His Noble Zeal for the
Good of us in particular, and <hi>Europe</hi> in
general, ſurmounting all thoſe Difficulties:
Whereupon he accordingly took Shipping
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57758:81"/>
on the Sixteenth of <hi>January 1690-91.</hi> in a
Yacht, then lying at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and ſet Sail
that Afternoon, being attended by divers
Yatchts and Men of War, and a Noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
of Perſons of the beſt Quality; but by
Reaſon of the very thick Miſts, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
little Wind, was four days before he
could make the Coaſt of <hi>Holland;</hi> yet, at laſt,
when he arrived within two or three
Leagues of <hi>Goree,</hi> His Majeſty ventured to
go a Shoar in the Boat, attended by the
Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and
my Lord <hi>Overkirke, &amp;c.</hi> and another Boat, but
moſt unfortunately there fell ſo thick a Fog,
and the Ice ſurrounded them ſo cloſely, that
neither could they make the Shoar, nor get
back to the Ship, but were forc'd to lie ſtill
for two and twenty Hours, enduring the
moſt bitter Cold, and without (almoſt)
hopes of ever getting alive on Shoar: All
which, His Majeſty bore with His wanted
Magnanimity and Courage, and when one
of the Boat-men too freely expreſſed his Fear
of Death, he reproved him with this Noble
ſaying, <hi>What are you afraid to Die in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>
But it pleaſed the Almighty Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
at length to diſſipate the Miſt, and
Conduct His Royal Majeſty ſafely to the
Shoar, and on the 21ſt of <hi>January,</hi> about
half an hour after Ten, landed at the <hi>Orange
Polder,</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> a little
below <hi>Maſeland-Sluyce,</hi> but by the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance

in the Cold, was ſo Benummed,
that he could hardly either ſtand or Speak.
From hence His Majeſty went immediately
to the Houſe of the Heer Van <hi>Rynenbergh,</hi>
where having refreſhed Himſelf, and Dined,
He haſted to <hi>Hounſlaerdyke,</hi> where He was
met, and Congratulated with all Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of Reſpects and Joy, by the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the States; as alſo by Prince <hi>Caſimir</hi>
of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Stadtholder of <hi>Friezeland,</hi> whom
His Majeſty received with all the Marks of
the moſt tender Affection imaginable, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
and Kiſſing them with great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
Prince <hi>Naſſau Sarbruggen,</hi> the Count
Van <hi>Hoorn,</hi> and divers other Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
here likewiſe Congratulated His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
happy arrival, who were all moſt
kindly received by His Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>'Twas expected that the King would have
lain here this Night, and ſo have entred the
<hi>Hague</hi> by day light; but on the contrary,
His extraordinary Deſire of entring imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon Buſineſs, would not let Him
give Himſelf ſo much as one Nights eaſe;
And His Majeſty, after a very ſhort Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
here, departed for the <hi>Hague,</hi> attended
with five or ſix Coaches with ſix Horſes:
In His own Coach accompanied Him the
Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Overkirk,</hi>
arriving at the <hi>Hague</hi> about half an hour after
five in the Evening; where (though he was
not that Night expected) there wanted not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57758:84"/>
the general Acclamations of the People of all
ſorts, who run by His Coach, crying out,
<hi>Long Live King</hi> William, <hi>Welcom, Welcom,
&amp;c.</hi> His Majeſty Rode through the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Arches, Erected by the Lords of the
<hi>Hague,</hi> and the Honourable the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of the Council of <hi>Holland,</hi> (of which
we ſhall give an exact Deſcription in their
proper Places) directly to the Court, where
being arrived, and the Gates ſhut to keep
out the extraordinary preſs of People, thirty
peices of Cannon, which were planted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Vyverberg,</hi> were thrice diſcharged,
Publick Thankſgivings were made in all the
Churches, and the Bells rung with great
Joy; and throughout the Town almoſt all
the Houſes were Illuminated with great
numbers of Candles in their Windows,
whilſt all the People, Rich and Poor, Old
and Young, made all Demonſtrations of
their inexpreſſible Joy for His Majeſties
moſt happy Arrival.</p>
                  <p>That Evening the Earl of <hi>Berka,</hi> Envoy
Extraordinary from the Emperor, waited
upon His Majeſty, and was a long time in
private with Him; and the next day ſeveral
Members of the States, and divers Perſons
of Quality came to Compliment His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and Congratulate His Arrival.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſters of the ſeveral Confederate
Princes, who upon the Kings arrival had
ſent Expreſſes to their reſpective Maſters,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57758:84"/>
aſſembling themſelves in Congreſs; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after their breaking up, the Imperial,
Spaniſh, and Brandenburgh Envoys, came
to wait upon His Majeſty; as alſo the
Council of State, and the Lords of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Accounts, with all their Members, to
Congratulate and Complement Him.</p>
                  <p>The King immediately applied Himſelf
to the Affairs of State, and taking firſt into
His Conſideration the Sea Affairs, gave the
Command of the Dutch Fleet to the Heer
<hi>Cornelius</hi> Van <hi>Tromp,</hi> with the Title of Vice-Admiral
of <hi>Holland,</hi> who gratefully accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſame, and immediately beat up his
Drums for Seamen, who flocked to him in
great abundance. His Majeſty gave alſo out
Commiſſions for two Regiments of <hi>Mariners</hi>
to be raiſed.</p>
                  <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who had
waited ſome time at <hi>Cleave,</hi> as ſoon as he
received advice of His Majeſties arrival, ſet
forward for the <hi>Hague.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time it was Deſired, and
Agreed to by His Majeſty, That His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
would Pleaſe to Honour the <hi>Hague</hi>
with a Publick Entry, on <hi>Monday, January</hi>
the 26th: Whereupon the Trained Bands,
and the Guards were ordered to be ready;
And accordingly on <hi>Monday,</hi> at two of the
Clock in the Afternoon, His Majeſty went
out of the Town by the way of the <hi>Vyver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
to the North-end, and from thence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57758:85"/>
round the Wall to the Weſt-end, and ſo to
the <hi>Hounſlaerdyke,</hi> or <hi>Looſduyn</hi>'s-bridge, where
began the Triumph. Over this Bridge was
Erected, by the Burghermaſters of the
<hi>Hague,</hi> a Triumphant Arch, the Figure
whereof we have here Repreſented. Over
the Arch in the Front, is a Man and a
Woman ſtanding at an Altar Sacrificing,
with the Words, <hi>Io Triumphe.</hi> On the top
of all ſtands the Statue of His Majeſty, with
a Staff in His right Hand, at the top of
which is a Cypher of His Name, with a
Crown. On the two Columns of the Arch,
on one ſide are theſe Words,
<q>
                        <p>Ob Cives Servatos: For having preſerved
his Country-men.</p>
                        <p>Ob Hoſtes Fugatos: For having deſtroyed
his Enemies.</p>
                     </q>
and on the other ſide,
<q>
                        <p>Reſtitutis Provinciis: The Provinces being
Reſtored.</p>
                        <p>Libertatis Regnis: The Kingdoms being
Delivered.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behind each Column is a ſmall Oval, in
one a Lawrel with this Word,
<q>Victoria, Victory,</q>
on the other a Palm, with the Word,
<q>Clementia, Mercy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here His Majeſty was received by the

Him, and Congratulated His Arrival,
the Penſionary <hi>Vander Hoeck</hi> being their
Speaker, who humbly Thanked the King
in the Name of the Magiſtrates and Burg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers,
for the Honour His Majeſty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to do them by His Preſence, in a moſt
Eloquent Oration.</p>
                  <p>From hence was a Lane made on each
ſide by the Burghers in Arms, who appeared
in very great Splendour, being moſt of them
very richly clad, many having been at great
Expence for their Equipage.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Trained Bands conſiſt of ſix Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
of about two and three Hundred
Men in each Company; they make in all
about Fifteen Hundred Men: Theſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Order, reached all along the
Weſt-end, the great Market, the High Street,
and ſo to the Court-yard.</p>
                  <p>All along this way, quite up to the Court,
before the Houſes and Stalls, were built
Scaffolds, which were filled by a vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Spectators, who ſcrupled not to give
an 100 Guilders in ſome places for the uſe
of a Chamber during the Shew. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Spectators being the greateſt that has
ever been ſeen in the <hi>Hague;</hi> inſomuch, that
one would have judged all the Inhabitants
of <hi>Holland</hi> to have been in this Town.</p>
                  <p>After the Penſionary had ended his Speech,
and His Majeſty kindly Thanked them, the
Cavalcade proceeded. Firſt went two very
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57758:88"/>
rich Coaches with ſix Horſes, in which were
divers Perſons of Quality, next the Kings
Life Guard, the Officers in extraordinary
rich Equipage: After them a great number
of Lacquees and Footmen all in the Kings
Livery, and black Velvet Caps; after them
came the Kings Pages, Gentlemen, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
on Horſeback, in extraordinary rich
Liveries. Then came His Majeſty riding in
a large, and very richly Gilt Coach, drawn
by Six White Stone Horſes, accompanied by
the Lord <hi>Overkirk</hi> on the left Hand, and the
Earls of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Scarborough</hi> over-againſt
him. On each ſide of the Coach the
Switzers with their Halbards, in rich Livery
Coats alſo, walked on Foot. The Provoſt
General <hi>Urck,</hi> and the Heer <hi>Roulas</hi> Captain
of the Switzers rid on Horſeback immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before the Kings Coach, and after it came
about Twelve Coaches with Six Horſes,
wherein Rid the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Earls
of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Portland,</hi> the Biſhop of
<hi>London,</hi> and ſeveral other Engliſh Noblemen;
as alſo the chief Miniſters of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Magiſtrates of the <hi>Hague,</hi>
beſides theſe, were many Coaches with
Four Horſes.</p>
                  <p>The King as he paſſed along, was Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and Complimented by divers Perſons
of Quality, which His Majeſty returned
with great Kindneſs, often looking out of
the Coach, with great Satisfaction upon the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57758:88"/>
People, who ſhouted with extraordinary
Chearfulneſs, crying out, <hi>Long Live the King
our Stadtholder, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Stadthouſe, by which the King was
to Ride, was Beautified with Seven very
Noble Tranſparent Pictures; behind which
they put Lights in the Evening, which were
ſet off with Garlands of made Flowers:
Above in the middle, was the King and
Queen, and on each ſide of them another
Picture; One of a Lion with this Motto,
<q>
                        <l>Placidum venerantur, &amp; horrent infeſtum:</l>
                        <l>They Worſhip him when he is Calm, and Dread
him when he is Angry;</l>
                     </q>
the other of an Unicorn, with this Motto,
<q>
                        <l>Nihil paſſa Veneni: She can endure no Poiſon.</l>
                        <l>Underneath there are three other Pictures,</l>
                     </q>
one of a Crane ſitting upon his Neſt, clapping
his Wings upon break of a Day, and Sun
Riſing, with this Motto,
<q>Recreatur ab Ortu: He is refreſhed by the
Riſing.</q>
the other of an Atlas bearing the World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his bending Shoulders, reſting with his
Breaſt upon a ſmall Hill, with this Motto,
<q>In te Domus inclinata recumbit: The leaning
Houſe reſts on Thee.</q>
The Third, a Crane ſtanding on his Neſt,
and chattering upon the Riſing of the Sun,
with this Motto,
<q>Vidit &amp; Exaltavit: He ſaw it and was
glad.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57758:89"/>
In the Court of Juſtice by the ſide of the
Stadthouſe, a Pillar was Erected four Rows
high, garniſhed with Coats of Arms; upon
which towards Night they ſet great numbers
of Flambeaux.</p>
                  <p>The Lords of the <hi>Hague</hi> raiſed alſo a Rich
and a Glorious Triumphal Arch in Honour
of this great Monarch, in the Market Place:
This was done upon the Account of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been Born there; which as they look
upon to be one of the greateſt Glories of the
Place, and whereof hereafter they will have
the greateſt Reaſon to Boaſt, ſo they were
deſirous to ſhew what Sence they had of it,
upon ſo very Glorious an occaſion.</p>
                  <p>This is much the higheſt Arch of them all;
without any Pillars, and on both ſides are
many Pictures done in light Colour; and
juſt over the paſſage there are two others
done upon Silk, and Tranſparent, ſo as that
by Lights, which were ſet behind them in
the Evening, they appeared very Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly.</p>
                  <p>At the top of all was placed a Sphear, and
above that, <hi>Fame</hi> Sounding a Trumpet in a
flying poſture, and leading a <hi>Pegaſus;</hi> with
Trophies at each Corner.</p>
                  <p>Behind this Arch, towards the High-ſtreet,
the Arms of the Emperor <hi>Adolphus,</hi> (who
was Deſcended of the Houſe of <hi>Naſſau)</hi> were
ſet up; and over them the Sixteen Quarters
of His Majeſties Arms: But thoſe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged

                     <p>IN the Canal behind the Court, upon a
large Scaffold, there were very fine
Fireworks prepared, which were Lighted
the Evening after His Majeſty entred the
<hi>Hague.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the middle was the Kings Cypher,
with a Crown over it: On the ſides ſtood
two high Pyramids, a Lyon, a <hi>Hercules,</hi>
and a Sun: On each Corner of the Scaffold
there were four Caſes of Rockets, four of
which were much larger then the reſt, which
repreſented the four Kingdoms of <hi>England,
Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the Arms
of thoſe Kingdoms: Round about there was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57758:98"/>
Palliſſado ſtuck with Rockets, ſome Orange
colour, ſome white, ſome blew, placed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately
to the number of Three Hundered
and Fifty.</p>
                     <p>They placed Fifteen Bulwarks round the
Scaffold, on which they had mounted
Cannon and Mortar pieces: Between which
they had large Mortars made like Beehives
and Pumps, which were charged with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſorts of Fireworks.</p>
                     <p>About half an hour after Six in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the Fireworks were Lighted: Juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Thirty pieces of Cannon that were
planted upon the Wall of the Viver were
diſcharged; then follow'd Twenty five
Mortar ſhot on both ſides of the Scaffold,
and afterwards the Crown and Cypher,
<hi>WR.</hi> which appeared like 350 Pearls ſhining
in the Air.</p>
                     <p>About the Palliſſadoes they had planted
ſeveral Devices: Towards the States Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was one with theſe Words, <hi>Triumphat
ſemper Auguſtus: He Triumphs always Auguſt.</hi>
On each ſide of this there was one planted;
One was, <hi>Offenſum metuunt Hoſtes: His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Dread him when he is Offended.</hi> The
other, <hi>Carum venerantur Amici: His Friends
Worſhip Him who is ſo dear to them.</hi> Theſe
ſhining very bright in the Air, made a very
pleaſant ſhow.</p>
                     <p>Over the Cipher and Crown was a Ship
toſs'd about as in a Storm, with this Motto,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57758:99"/>
                        <hi>Ne metuas, Caeſarem vebis: Fear not, thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt</hi>
Caeſar. This alſo was viſible in the
Air.</p>
                     <p>When the Pyramids were Fired, they
gave a lowd buzzing Noiſe, which was now
and then Anſwered by the Mortars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then the Belgick Lyon, and the</hi> Hercules,
<hi>play'd very wonderfully.</hi> Hercules'<hi>s Arms
were Expanded, firing with Eight ſeveral
Pauſes, to denote his Labours, which were.</hi>
1. The Eſtabliſhment of Religion and Liberty.
2. The ſecuring the Tranquillity of <hi>Europe.</hi>
3. The Settlement of the Government upon a right
Bottom. 4. The Preſervation of the Common
Intereſts of the People. 5. The Preſervation of
Unity amongſt the Neighbouring Princes. 6. The
clearing of the Sea, and the increaſing of Trade.
7. The Advancement of the Glory of this State.
8. The concluding of a firm and laſting Peace.</p>
                     <p>While the Fire play'd ſo finely, the Air
was full of the crackling Noiſe, and the
Buzzes of the ſeveral ſorts of Fireworks, and
they continued ſo very thick, that it did in
a good meaſure diſpel the Fog, which was
then very thick. At times they lighted
Water-Balls, Water-Candles, Water-Bullets,
Water-Boats, Water-Morters, Rats and Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins
in a Veſſel upon the Canal, which
ſputtering and crackling upon the Water,
gave an Entertainment ſo great, that ſeveral
Ingenious Men, who underſtood theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
owned, that they had never ſeen any
Thing like it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57758:99"/>
They kindled alſo ſome Hundreds of pitch
Barrels ſet round the Scaffold, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
the light, whereby the other Works
which play'd all the while, were diſcerned
the better. It laſted till about Eight, and
was ended with Twenty five Mortar-ſhot;
after which the Cannon were ſeveral times
diſcharged: The whole was done without
any Miſchance, ſave only the loſs of one
Gunner, who ſweeping a Cannon, loſt both
his Hands, and died of his Wounds. When
His Majeſty came to Court, the Militia. ſtood
in order in the outer Court, before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Arch, <hi>viz.</hi> Baron <hi>Frieſem</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Foot, Baron <hi>Heyde</hi>'s Regiment of
Horſe, who having diſcharged all together,
went to the <hi>Viverbergh</hi> to give way to the
Train Bands in Arms. Several of the Lords
of the States were in the Council Chamber,
to Countenance this publick Joy.</p>
                     <p>The Count <hi>de Berka,</hi> and the Heer <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomma,</hi>
the Imperial and Spaniſh Miniſters
teſtified their Satisfaction by Illuminations

time after. Others alſo gave other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their Satisfaction, every Man after
his own Fancy.</p>
                     <p>This was alſo graced with ſo vaſt a reſort
of People, as had never before been ſeen at
the <hi>Hague:</hi> Some coming to ſee the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
others to ſee the King once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again, and Crowned with ſo much
Honour.</p>
                     <p>The King well ſatisfied with all theſe their
Demonſtrations of Eſteem and Reverence,
immediately applied himſelf to Buſineſs;
having firſt given Audiences of Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all the Colleges and Deputies of the
Cities, and to ſome great Lords and publick
Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and two
Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Anſpach,</hi> (who came
two days before the publick Entry) were often
with the King, and ſometimes the Miniſters
of the other Allies joyned with them: It was
ſaid, That three Ruffians were ſent from the
French Court to cut off the King, and that
there were particular Informations given in
of their Perſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>February</hi> the 7th in the Afternoon the King
went into the Aſſembly of the States General,
and took his place as Stadtholder and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
General; and made an Oration to them,
to this purpoſe.</p>

                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57758:100"/>
That when His Majeſty was laſt in Council,
he acquainted their High and Mightyneſſes with
His Intention to go over into <hi>England</hi> with the
Aſſiſtance which they were pleaſed to give Him,
to deliver that Nation from their Impending
Dangers, and which in part had befallen them:
And that God Almighty had ſo far Bleſſed Him,
as that He had brought His Affairs to a Happier
Iſſue then at firſt He could poſſibly Wiſh for; for
which Reaſon they offered Him the Crowns of
<hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which He accepted
of, not out of any Ambition, (for He was not
to be Corrupted with that, or Money) but only
to preſerve Religion and Liberty in thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
and to be able to give the Allies a vigorous
Aſſiſtance againſt the Power of <hi>France,</hi> which
he had given before in a more particular manner,
if the Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi> had not diverted Him;
which being now better ſettled than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
He was now come over, not only to take
ſuch Meaſures with their High and Mighty
Lordſhips, as ſhould be moſt for the advantage of
the Confederates, but alſo to perform the Duty of
Captain General; And that from His tendereſt
Years He had always a High Regard for that
State, and ſhould always be ready to give greater
Proofs, if it were poſſible, how ready He
ſhould be to promote their Welfare, for which he
would joyfully hazard His Life, if it might be a
means to preſerve the Liberty of <hi>Europe,</hi> and
to encreaſe the Felicity of the <hi>United Provinces:
And finally,</hi> He Recommended Himſelf to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57758:101"/>
good Wiſhes of their High and Mighty Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Lord Preſident Thanked
His Majeſty in their Lordſhips Name, for
the Honour which was done unto them by
his appearing once more in Perſon amongſt
them: And he aſſured him, that they were
highly ſenſible of thoſe Obligations which he
had Conferred upon them from time to time,
by engaging in ſo great dangers ſo readily
for their Sakes: And further, that they ſhould
always Thankfully Acknowledge how much
He had done for them; wiſhing Him all
Happineſs in all His Undertakings, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their Concurrence with His Majeſty to
the utmoſt, and that they ſhould contribute
whatever they were able, to advance the
common Intereſt, and His Majeſties Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>He afterwards made a Speech to the State
of <hi>Holland,</hi> and was anſwered much to the
ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Evening before the King viſited the

The next day the King Treated

Evening again to the <hi>Hague.</hi>
                     </p>

The Ninth in the Morning the Heer

was Conducted from his Lodgings about

with ſome Coaches and Six Horſes,
and was received at the Stair-foot by the
Swiſs Guards placed in Order, and received
by their Officer at the end of the Guard
Room, and thence conducted through the
Anti-Chamber into the Preſence; where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had paid the accouſtomed Reverences;
he made a Harangue in French to this
purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>That he was ſent by the Elector his Maſter to
Congratulate His Majeſties happy Succeſſes, and
that his Maſter had begun his Journey as ſoon as
ever he had heard that His Majeſty had begun
His; ſo that he expected him every Hour; to be
ready upon the ſpot to aſſure His Majeſty of his
Readineſs to ſerve the common Cauſe, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to ſecond thoſe Glorious Undertakings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which His Majeſty had ſo happily begun: And
for his part, he only farther begg'd, That his
Perſon might not be unacceptable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To this the King replied,</hi> That he Thank'd
his Electoral Highneſs. That he ſhould always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to promote the common Intereſt; and
therefore would joyn with the Elector, and that
He was Oblig'd to his Highneſs for this Trouble;
<hi>and laſtly,</hi> that his Perſon was very acceptable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57758:102"/>
Then the Envoy preſented his Gentlemen

His Majeſty always Honouring them
with His Preſence, when at laſt, the matters
being fully Concerted, and all Things agreed
upon to the mutual Satisfaction of all the
Princes, this great Council broke up, and the
Princes returned to their reſpective Homes,
to put in execution the Deſigns here agreed
upon, the good Effects whereof we doubt

Monarch.</p>
                     <p>But His Majeſty had not been long there

and after a ſhort Conference with Prince
<hi>Waldeck,</hi> went Poſt to <hi>Loo,</hi> to give His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
an account of the State of the Affair.
Who being reſolved Himſelf to Head the
Army, in order to raiſe the Siege, returned
to the <hi>Hague;</hi> from whence having diſpatched
Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> with neceſſary Orders for
<hi>Flanders,</hi> ſet forward Himſelf the 26th for

with a Train of Artillery of 71 pieces of
Cannon and 14 Mortars. But the Carriages
not being all come up, was obliged to defer
His March for two or three days.</p>
                     <p>The French had all this time very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gourouſly
attacked the Outworks of the
Town, but were as vigourouſly repulſed by
the Beſieged, to the great loſs of the Enemy,
who paid dearly for what he gained; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that it was not doubted, but the Town
would have been able to have held out till the
Army came up to its Relief, but the French
King (who was himſelf all the while at St.
<hi>Giſlain,</hi> near the Camp, the Dauphin Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
in Chief) according to his old Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
had found means of gaining a Party
among the Burghers and Clergy in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57758:106"/>
Town, who prevailing upon the reſt, by the
terrifying Deſtruction the Bombs and Cannon
made in their Houſes, and perſuading them
that by a timely Surrender of the Town they
might obtain Honourable Conditions, made
them baſely deſert the publick Good, and
altogether unexpectedly, even to the French

and ſent out three Officers, as Hoſtages for
three French Offices, who immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Town, to Treat upon Articles of
Surrender; the Governor the Prince <hi>de Bergue</hi>
oppos'd the Surrender, and refus'd to deliver
the Gate to the French as the Burghers had
agreed, endeavouring to diſſwade them from
this their Reſolution, alledging he could ſtill
hold out till the Relief came; but all would
not do, the Burghers wre reſolved, and they
being ſtronger than the Gariſon, who were
all employed in the Outworks, the Honourable
Governor was forced to ſubmit, and about
Midnight the Capitulation was Signed on
both ſides; and the next day <hi>April</hi> the 9th,
a Gate of the Town was deliver'd up to the
French Guards; and on the 10th, the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
marched out, being about 4000, Foot
and 400 Horſe, with Arms, Baggage, Drums
beating, Colours flying, ſix pieces of Cannon,

News juſt as he was ready to march to their

Relief, was forced to alter his Meaſures; and
underſtanding that the French King had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
his Troops, and diſpos'd 'em into
Gariſons; and that he with the Dauphin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
were return'd to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> broke up the Camp,
