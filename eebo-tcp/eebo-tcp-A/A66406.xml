            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PAPIST REPRESENTED,
And not
Misrepresented, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I observe the late Proceedings
of some of the Controvertists in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the design
they have in hand of setting forth
their Doctrines and Practices in a
way less offensive to others, and
more defensible to themselves, than
in former Ages; I cannot better
resemble it, than to a Carver, that being employed to
form an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> or other Saint,
concerns not himself to make it like to the Person
thereby to be represented, but so as shall best serve to
allure and excite the people to a devout Adoration of
it. If the Image was strictly to be examined, and we
had an Original to compare it with, it's likely there
might not be one true Line in the whole Composure,
and that it might as well suit any other Person in the
World, as him or her whom it pretends to resemble.
And thus it will fare in many points now introduced
upon the Stage by <hi>Veron</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi>
abroad, and a late flourishing Pen and others amongst
us, which carry in them so little Conformity to the
Ancient Doctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that Face can hardly be more unlike to Face, than one
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62581:3"/>
would be unlike to the other, if impartially compared;
and which, if in another Age they had appeared as they
do in this, would have been suspected of Heresy, if not
condemned for it. For did they in former times Formally
pray to the Saints, and frequently beg those things of
them, which are only in the power of God to grant? The
Papist after the new Mode of Representation, is said to
believe <hi>all good, whether Spiritual or Temporal, comes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God through the Merits of Christ;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pap. Misr. par. 2. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note> and that
they no otherwise desire the <hi>Just in Heaven</hi> to pray for
them, than they do the <hi>Just on Earth, to be Joint-Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with themselves to the Seat of the Divine Majesty.</hi>
Did they heretofore use, without Scruple, to Worship
and to pray to Images, as if the persons thereby repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
were before them?<note place="margin">Ibid c. 2.</note> We are now told, they give
no other <hi>Respect, Honour</hi> and <hi>Veneration</hi> to them, than
we do to the Bible; and that <hi>they can as well pray to the
Monument,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as to the Image of the greatest Saint in
Heaven.</hi> Did they formerly adore the Cross, and direct
their Prayers to it in the solemn Offices of the Church?
It's now only a <hi>Rapture,</hi> an <hi>innocent Wish,</hi> a <hi>Rhetorical
Flight.</hi> By which Palliations and Glosses it may well
be supposed, they are ashamed or grow weary of their
Religion as formely practised and defended; and
were they as sincere as liberal in their Concessions,
that they are hastning apace to a Reformation of it. But
now as we are not to judg of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> and other
Saints by the Images and Pictures of them extant in the
World (in which the Carvers and Painters do indulge
their fancy) for then they would be Black and Fair,
little and great, and what not? So we must not Judg
of the Doctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
by the design of these late Officious Artists; for then we
should find contradictions in their Infallible Church,
building and pulling down, saying and unsaying, age
against age, principles and practices against principles
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62581:3"/>
and practices; but we must have recourse to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals,
and see what their Authentick Authors and
Offices do teach, and what is yet practised in those
places where their Religion has no Enemy near, to
contend with, or to make too curious observations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. Which course, as I have already observed in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
upon the Worship given by them to Images,
so I shall proceed in this present Argument of the Cross;
and shew what reason there was for that charge in the
Catechism that they <hi>Pray directly to it.</hi> But here our
Author takes up the point betimes, and a strain of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
Insincerity, Defamation</hi> charged upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> runs through the whole Chapter. And
why? Is it because it has produced any false Citations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or such as are insufficient? No, but the
Catechism takes that <hi>literally</hi> which is to be understood
<hi>figuratively; and from two words in one of their hymns which
literally imply a Prayer to the Cross,</hi> takes the occasion
of charging them with <hi>directly praying to it;</hi> whereas
the Papists <hi>are never any where directed to pray to the
Cross, and have no prayers to it.</hi> Upon the Reading of
this, I was for the present at a stand, how a person of
that Communion, and that Undertakes the defence of
its publick Offices, should be so Ignorant as to profess
there are but <hi>two words in one of their Hymns</hi> to this
purpose, and that they have <hi>no prayers to the Cross, nor
direction about it;</hi> or if he did know otherwise, how he
should be as confident to assert it, as if no one had ever
read their Offices, but themselves. But being now a
little wonted to his way, I began to think there must
be some reserved meaning in these positive assertions;
and by looking back a page or two, I find that he and
the Catechism are not agreed about the chief Term
in Dispute, and that is the <hi>Cross.</hi> For whereas the charge
in the Catechism is, that they <hi>pray directly to the Cross,</hi>
he, with much sincerity, alters the terms, and saith, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62581:4"/>
               <hi>the Faithful Catechist produces an argument to prove the
Papists so stupid, as to pray directly to a piece of wood,
and a mere material Cross.</hi> But if that is a <hi>meer piece of
Wood,</hi> which in the Consecration of, the Bishop prays
may be <hi>made the stability of Faith, and increase of good
works, and the Redemption of Souls.</hi> If that be a <hi>meer
piece of wood,</hi> which they use all expressions of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Adoration to, by kissings, prostrations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If
that <hi>be a meer piece of wood,</hi> to which they give <hi>Latria,</hi>
or the sovereign Worship which is peculiar to God;
Then indeed they Pray also directly to a <hi>meer piece of
wood, to increase Grace in the Godly,</hi> &amp;c. But if the Cross
they thus Consecrate and Bless, and is thus effectual
after Consecration; if the Cross they Adore, kiss and
prostrate themselves before; if, lastly, the Cross they give
Divine and Sovereign Worship to, is not a <hi>mere piece of
wood,</hi> so then neither is that a <hi>mere piece of wood,</hi> they
are said in the Catechism to pray <hi>directly to.</hi> For it's the
same Cross that the one and the other, nay that all of
the things here recited of, are in the Catechism appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to. But becaufe I am willing to clear the point, and
as much as I can, leave it without exception,</p>
            <p>1. I shall shew what they mean by a Cross.</p>
            <p>2. I shall prove that they do Adore and Worship the
Cross.</p>
            <p>3. That they do pray directly to the Cross they adore.</p>
            <p>The Cross we are now concerned about, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Representation of our Saviour Crucified upon
it: And so is as distinct from <hi>a bare material Cross, a
meer Cross of Wood,</hi> &amp;c. as what is an Object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
is from that which is none. For by being thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative,
it's no longer what it was before, a <hi>mere
piece of Wood;</hi> but being in the stead of him whom
it Represents,<note place="margin">De Cruce. l. 1. c. 49.</note> and sustaining his person, it hath by that
means an excellency communicated to it, and which
<hi>formally</hi> alters the Nature of it, as <hi>Gretser</hi> the Jesuit, a
copious writer upon this Argument, doth shew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62581:4"/>
For the further explication of which, and to add some
authority to the abovesaid character of the Cross, I
shall transcribe the sum of what he writes of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<note place="margin">Chap. 51.</note> It having, it seems, been objected, That if all the
Crosses are to be Worshipped because Christ hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cross; by the same reason all Thorns, Reeds,
Nails, Spears, Sepulchres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to have the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
because Christ was crown'd with Thorns, Nail'd
to the Cross, had his side Pierc'd, and at last was buried
in a Sepulchre.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Gretser</hi> Answers, <q>That all Crosses are made in
Imitation of the Cross upon which Christ suffered, and
of him suffering upon it, and that they may both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
That and Him. Wherefore we do deservedly
honour all Crosses, as they are Images, and an Image is
for Representation; but we do not thus honour all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres,
Nails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because they are not Images or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of the Sepulchre of Christ, nor of the nails
that fastened his Body to the Cross. But if any one doth
build a Sepulchre, or erect a Manger, or make Nails,
or choose out Thorns in imitation, and for a Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the first Sepulchre, Manger, Nails and Thorns,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is no doubt but they may be Worshipped. For
then they are indued with, and have in them the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an Image, which is Representation.</q> So that
as there is a distinction betwixt Sepulchre and Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
Manger and Manger; and which distinction is
such, that the one is an object of worship, and another
is not; so there is betwixt Cross and Cross, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Cross, either Natural, Accidental, and Artificial
when made for other uses, and a Cross that is Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
(as the same Author there shews.)</p>
            <p>So that our Author might safely enough declare,<note place="margin">Misrepr. p. 2. c. 2. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 10.</note>
that if <hi>his Religion did either teach or practice such
stupid Idolatry, as praying to a piece of Wood, he
could no more be any longer of her Communion than
he could Sacrifice to</hi> Molech. For as it's <hi>a piece of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62581:5"/>
Wood,</hi> it's not the Cross we are here concerned in, not
the Cross by Representation, not the Cross by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
which alone, and under that consideration
is the object of their Worship. So that tho he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that Communion, and make this Protestation
against <hi>a piece of Wood;</hi> yet he cannot be of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
and enter the like Protestation against a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
and Consecrated Cross, and call such applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to it, <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For this Cross we are speaking of, is
not only representative, but is also consecrated for that
purpose; and there is an Office accordingly, with such
Prayers, Rites and Ceremonies as make it as well a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
<note place="margin">Pontifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. <hi>Nov. Crucis.</hi>
               </note> as a Representing Object. As for instance, in the
consecration of a new Cross of Wood, the Bishop prays
in these words; <hi>We pray thee, O Holy Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That
thou wouldest vouchsase to bless this Wood of thy Cross, that
it may be a wholsom</hi> [saving] <hi>remedy to mankind;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Salutare.</note> 
               <hi>a stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Faith, an increase of good works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Redemption of
Souls, a comfort, protection and defence against the evil
darts of the Enemies, through our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And as if
this were not sufficient, after the consecration of the
Incense, the Bishop sprinkles the Cross with Holy-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and Incenses it; Saying,</p>
            <p>Let this Wood be sanctified in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:cross">✚</g>ther,
and of the S<g ref="char:cross">✚</g>on, and of the Holy<g ref="char:cross">✚</g>Ghost. Let the blessing
of that Wood upon which the Holy Members of our Saviour
hung, be in this Wood; that all that pray and bow down
themselves for God, before this Cross, may find health both
of Soul and Body, through the same Jesus Christ. <hi>But if
the Cross be of Metal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then he is to pray to Christ
in these Words,</hi> Do thou take this Cross <hi>[now consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted]</hi>
in those hands with which thou hast embraced <hi>That
[on which he hung]</hi> and with the holiness of <hi>That,</hi> do thou
Sanctisy <hi>This:</hi> And as the World by <hi>That</hi> was cleansed from
guilt, so the devout Souls of thy Servants who offer it,
may by the Merit of <hi>This Cross</hi> be delivered from every

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62581:5"/>
So that it's very evident, that as the Cross by
virtue of its Representation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is quite another thing than
a meer piece of <hi>Wood;</hi> so upon its Consecration, it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with another Nature; for then it has <hi>Merits</hi> of its
own; it's <hi>healthful both for Soul and Body,</hi> and is <hi>for the
stability of Faith, the increase of Good Works, the comfort of
Souls</hi> to all them that bow down before it. And here it's
sit to be remembred against we come to need it, that there
can be no <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> no <hi>Rhetorical Flight,</hi> when we not
only consider it's a Prayer, and not a <hi>Poetical Composure;</hi>
but that also the Cross here spoken of, is as much distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from Christ, as from that Cross he suffered upon.</p>
            <p>By this time, I hope, it's sufficiently prov'd, that the
Cross in dispute, is another thing than <hi>a meer piece of wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho the right stating of a Case goes a great way
toward the resolving of it, yet this is not all I intend in
it: To proceed therefore,</p>
            <p>2. I shall prove that they do adore and worship the
Cross. It has been of late pretended by some, that the
Cross is only a <hi>Memorative Sign:</hi> but this was accounted
in the last Age, little better than Heresy: And therefore
<hi>Gretser</hi> saith of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Cruce l. 1. c. 50.</note> who retain'd Crosses in
their Churches for Remembrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not for Worship,
that they are <hi>Enemies to the Cross, and not better than those
that wholly reject them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For indeed, this is so embodied
into the Offices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that no one can
be truly of that Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but must thus conceive as
they do. Thus we find after the Consecration of the
Cross, the Bishop first kneels before it, and doth <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
adore and kiss it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pontific. ibid.</note> as do also all that are present, if they
so please. But tho it be left to the pleasure of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in that Solemnity, yet it shows what the Church
doth intend; and accordingly it doth call upon them in
the publick Office, to joyn with her in the Adoration of
it;<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 49. Missal. Rom. in Para<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </note> as <hi>Gretser</hi> doth acknowledg. For the Missal saith, at
the uncovering of the Cross, <hi>Behold the wood of the Cross,
Come, let us adore;</hi> upon which all the People fall
to the ground. And when the Priest hath wholly unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Cross, and repeated, as before he places it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Altar, and first himself draws <hi>near to adore the
Cross; bowing his knees thrice before he kisses it.</hi> And then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62581:6"/>
the Attendants at the Altars, and the Clergy and Laity,
two and two, as he did, <hi>Adore the Cross;</hi> the Quire in
the mean while singing, <hi>We adore thy Cross, O Lord.</hi> This
I take to be past Controversy in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
where it is not disputed, whether the Cross is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
but with what Worship it is to be worshipped.
And which indeed is also determined to their hands by
the <hi>Pontificale</hi> in the place quoted in that Catechism
which our Author wrote this Chapter against.<note place="margin">Lud. de Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo de Orig. S. Inquis. l. 2. tit. 3. c. 8. n. 5.</note> And
therefore when <hi>Joh. Aegidius,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Sevil,</hi> had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that God was to be worshipped with <hi>Latria</hi> [So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Worship] and the Cross with <hi>Dulia</hi> [an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
sort of Worship (as they call it) which they
give to the Saints] he was injoyned a publick Recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as denying the Adoration of the Cross, <hi>contrary to the
practice of the Church, which saith, O Crux ave spes union,
Hail, O Cross, our only Hope.</hi> And in another place. <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem

                  </gap>
               </hi> relates it.</p>
            <p>And this puts me in mind of bringing this Matter to
a Conclusion, which I shall do, by shewing,</p>
            <p>3. That they do directly pray to the Cross.
This was asserted in the <hi>Catechism,</hi> but I must not say
prov'd, till I have clear'd the Point. But however if it
was not prov'd, there was somewhat fairly offer'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it; when it produced the express words of
the <hi>Breviary</hi> in justification of it; which before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
I shall recite. The words are these; <hi>Hail O Cross,
our only Hope! do thou increase Grace in the Godly, and blot
out the Sins in the Guilty.</hi> In exception to what the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism</hi>
hath produc'd this for, our Author hath said as
much as the Cause will bear, and to give him his due,
with Art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Smartness enough: And to give what he
hath said its full sense, I shall, without taking notice of
the extravagant Censures, and inveterate Expressions
scattered through the whole, sum up what he hath said:
And it comes all to this; <q>That this Hymn is of ancient
composure; that it's an Hymn and not a Prayer, and
so being Poetical, it's but a Rhetorical Flight and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe,
frequent in Scripture, and the Fathers; that
there are but two (that is, I suppose, a few) words in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62581:6"/>
one Hymn to this purpose; that the Church hath no
Prayer to the Cross, nor are They ever directed any
where to pray to it.</q> In fine, he saith, the meaning of
their Church in saying that Hymn, is, <hi>Hail, O Christ, our
only Hope,</hi> &amp;c. I am apt to think that he will grant, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the perusal of the whole, that I have done no injury
to what he hath said, by this short and close account of it.</p>
            <p>But now if I shall be able to prove that this is a Prayer
as well as an Hymn, and that there are parts of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to corroborate the sense I have given of it; if I prove
that their Church hath Prayers to the Cross, and directs
the People to pray to it, I think there will need little
more to vindicate the <hi>Catechism</hi> from all that Defamation
he hath so plentifully cast upon it.</p>
            <p>In the first place,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Scriptor. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. An. 300.</note> he tells us that this Hymn is found in
St. <hi>Ambrose</hi>'s Works. So <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed saith it was in
the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition 1540, which he used; and yet there
are other Editions in which it is not. So that I may as
well say, it is not in St. <hi>Ambrose</hi>'s Works, as he may say
that it is, and both alike true. But is this any credit to
it? Then it would be so to the Hymns, <hi>Optatus votis om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,
&amp; Christe, qui lux es &amp; dies,</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
saith are <hi>unworthy of so great a Name, and not to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to him.</hi> But however if St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> be not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, he has found out a <hi>Learned Bishop</hi> to father it
upon, one <hi>Vincentius Fortunatus,</hi> who, he saith, <hi>composed it to
be sung by his Church on Passion Sunday.</hi> But tho he hath not
favoured us with the See this Bishop had, yet I easily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
whom it is that he means, and that is <hi>Venantius For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus,</hi>
which Mistake I shall be so candid as not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to his ignorance in these Matters, but to the haste,
which he that intends to write a <hi>Weekly Packet</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
must be more or less liable to.<note place="margin">Ibid. de Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Fortun.</note> But yet I am not
satisfied in the Point; for tho he has the learned <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
before him, that seems to say, or is willing to have it
believed, that this Bishop was the Author of this Hymn;
yet I find others doubting of it; and amongst them is
<hi>Gretser,</hi> who tho a diligent Reader, and one as willing
and ready to lay hold of what might serve for his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or any Man whatsoever, yet speaks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
doubtfully of it,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, c. 53.</note> and saith, <hi>some do attribute it to</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62581:7"/>
[Bishop of <hi>Orleance], others to</hi> Fortunatus; the
former of which lived 265 Years after the latter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> So that the truth is, there is no
certainty at all in this Matter, which our Author hath
yet so positively asserted.</p>
            <p>But be that as it will, it's no great matter who is the
Author of it, nor indeed what the sense of that Author
was, for as long as we know what Church doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
use it, and in what sense that Church doth take it,
we have enough for our purpose: And that is the thing
to be now enquired into. I grant that the words here
quoted, are part of an Hymn, and that there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things to be Indulged to a Poetical Fancy, that are
not otherwise to be Indulged: and therefore if there
was nothing in their Church, to induce and oblige us to
take it in a sense quite different from what he imposes
on it, it would not be fair or ingenuous to force a proper
sense upon it, when the nature and reason of the thing,
as well as their own declaration, require it to be taken
in an improper. But when we know that the Cross is
among them, a Representation of our Saviour's Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and has for that reason a Worship given and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to be given to it as a Representing Obiect. When
we know that it's also consecrated, and upon its Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
is supposed to have altered its Nature, and to
have Divine Vertues communicated to it, or to have a
power of communicating such Vertues to those that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
it. When, further, the Passage quoted from this
Hymn is conformable to the other Offices of the Church,
we have no reason in the World to take it in his sense,
when we have thus the current sense of their own Church
against it.</p>
            <p>I think I have made it evident before, in what I have
said of the Consecration of the Cross, that the Cross is
considered as a distinct thing from our Saviour, because
they pray to him to bless the Cross, and to have such
and such Vertues communicated to it and by it. I
think also it has been made evident, that the Cross it
self is to be considered and proposed as an Object of
Adoration. And then, why is it more absurd to pray to
the Cross, than it is thus to adore it? Or, why is it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62581:7"/>
to pray to the Cross for That, which they have
pray'd before may be communicated to the Cross? But
because this is but reasoning (though such reasoning
as is natural and plain) therefore I shall appeal to the
Hymn it self, which I shall transcribe.</p>

than all the Stars, which alone hast been thought worthy to

Nails and sweet Burdens; save the present Company, gathered
together this day for thy praise.</p>
            <p>From whence I observe, 1. That the word Cross
in this Hymn, cannot be applied to Christ, but to
the Cross distinct from him: For else, the Cross which
is <hi>the Banner of the King,</hi> would be the King himself;
the Cross on which the <hi>Maker of Flesh</hi> hung in his
<hi>Flesh,</hi> would be the same with the Maker of Flesh; The
Tree which <hi>touched his sacred Members,</hi> be the same with
the Members touched by that Tree. 2. I observe that
the Cross which is saluted with <hi>Hail, O Cross, our daily
Hope,</hi> is the same with the Cross upon which Christ
hung; and therefore must be the Cross this Salutation is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62581:8"/>
directed to. 3. That the same, or what is equivalent
to it, which our Author supposeth here to be said poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
is prayed for; <hi>Sweet Wood, save the present Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>
But because all the Contradictions in the World will
not open some Men Eyes, I shall give our Author the sence
of Persons as considerable in his own Church for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Authority, as himself may be presumed to be.
And first of all, let us hear <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> a Divine (as
I remember) in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who, it seems had
not learned our Author's sence of this matter;<note place="margin">Dom. Soto de Instit. &amp; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. l. 2. q. 3. art. 2. in fin.</note> for he
saith, <hi>We ought to worship the Images themselves; for the
Church doth not say, we worship Thee, O Christ, but thy Cross,
O Crux ave, spes unica,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Catharinus</hi> leads us a little
further,<note place="margin">Cathar. de cultu &amp; ador. Imag. p. 133, &amp; 137.</note> for he saith, <hi>We direct our words and signs of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
to the Images, to which likewise we burn Incense: As
when we say to the Cross, O Crux ave spes unica,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And so</hi> Aquinas <hi>and others tell us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. Simon. Majolus pro desens. sacr. Imag. centur. 13. c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> Latria <hi>is to be
given to Images,</hi> because the Church in praying to the Cross,
speaks to it as if it were Christ himself.</p>
            <p>From which Authorities, we may perceive how little
heed is to be given to our Author (though he writes as
if he held the sense of their whole Church in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of his hand) when he affirms,<note place="margin">Page 12.</note> 
               <hi>That the meaning of
Catholicks in saying that Hymn, is, Hail, O Christ, our only
Hope! And that in the holy time of the Passion, in which
that Hymn is sung, their whole Devotion and Prayers are
directed to Him.</hi> By which words one would at first
think,<note place="margin">See the defence of the Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. p. 121.</note> our Author was much of <hi>Imbert</hi>'s mind, a Disciple
(as he himself thought) of the Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> who
when the Cross was shewn to the People on <hi>Good-friday,</hi>
franckly and openly declared, <hi>We adore not any thing of
what we see, but Jesus Christ crucified;</hi> and that he might
expect the same Censure for it, as that poor Man met
with from his Diocesan. But our Author has prudently
provided for his own Security; for by adding a word or
two, he has rendred his Exposition harmless, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himself from the fate of <hi>Imbert:</hi> For a line or two
before, he saith, <hi>The Catholicks do not understand the words
of this Hymn Barely of the material Cross, but of Christ
crucified.</hi> And indeed our Author is not alone, nor the
first in this Exposition, for thus it's also expounded in a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62581:8"/>
French Office,<note place="margin">L'Office de la Semaine San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte, Francois &amp; Latin. 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi> à Lyon, p. 1667. Remarques, p. 317.</note> 
               <hi>viz. This Adoration is not terminated only
on the Wood, but on Jesus Christ who was nailed thereon:
[Cette Adoration ne se termine pas au Seul Bois, mais à J. C.
qui y a esté attaché].</hi> So that for the future, when we
meet with such Expositions, that do seemingly translate
the Worship from the Cross <hi>wholly</hi> to our Saviour, we
are to understand that there is some reserved Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to moderate it, such as <hi>merely, barely, only,</hi> that is
implied, or express'd perhaps a line or two before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
And having now this Key, we may pretend
to understand the meaning of our Author's Exposition,
and, if you will take his word, the meaning of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
which is this, <hi>Hail, O Cross, our only Hope,</hi>
And, <hi>Hail, O Christ, our only Hope;</hi> that is, Christ is
their <hi>only Hope,</hi> but so as the Cross is their <hi>Hope</hi> too;
and the Cross is their <hi>only Hope,</hi> but so as Christ is their
<hi>Hope</hi> also. So that whilst our Author charges the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism
with <hi>pointing to a false and mistaken sense,</hi> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
has, much to the advantage of the Hymn, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it into Non-sense. A word, I must confess, I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
from him, and which puts me in mind of the last
Tire, that he discharges upon the Catechism; but though
in managing of this he hath spent the greatest part of
his Sheet,<note place="margin">Page 11.</note> I shall dispatch it in few words. <hi>If,</hi> saith he,
<hi>for these words</hi> in this Anthem, <hi>their Church must be black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Infamy of Idolatry, and praying directly to the
Cross; then stand clear</hi> Paul, <hi>have a care</hi> Chrysostom, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
O Creed, and you Common-prayer Book, look to your
self. For if you have but a grave Catechist that will faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
represent you; you'l be infallibly set out for nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Professors of Folly and Non-sence, bundles of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
and Prophaneness,</hi> &amp;c. One would think that
this Author, from a certain pique he has taken against
what he so often calls a <hi>Grave Catechism,</hi> had forgotten
all Gravity, and Respect to the most serious matters.
<hi>Stand clear, have a care, beware.</hi> Who and what are
these addressed to? No other than a holy St. <hi>Paul,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and the chief Sum of the Articles
of our Faith. For God's sake are there no more decent
Forms of Speech to describe these things by? And are
we to discourse of them as if we were at some light and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62581:9"/>
rustical Pastimes? But what can be strange in this kind,
when it shall be suggested that there is as much reason to
say St. <hi>Paul reverenced the material Cross above all things in
Heaven and Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 11.</note> 
               <hi>because he saith, God forbid that I should
glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> As much
reason to say, <hi>he looked upon the Wood of the Cross, as that
which had purchased Man's Reconciliation to God, because
he saith, Man was reconciled to God in one Body, by the Cross;</hi>
as there is for saying the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> prays directly to
the Cross, because she salutes it with <hi>Hail, O Cross, our only
Hope:</hi> and as if there was no more reason to apply this to
a material Cross, than there is these and the like Texts
of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He doth indeed intimate, and would have
it understood, that the material Cross is herein concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For thus he saith, <hi>To do right to St.</hi> Paul, <hi>St.</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,
<note place="margin">Page 12.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. besides giving a bare Narrative of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
it ought to be explicated to the People that in these
high Encomiums they do not understand the meer material
Cross.</hi> But when he can prove there was any <hi>material
Cross</hi> then used, and that those Encomiums do in any
sense belong to it, then it will be time enough to answer
further to his Exceptions; but till that time, what I have
already said about the Notion of a Cross, the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Adoration of it, and I will venture to say their
Prayer to it, is sufficient to shew, that though there be
good reason to understand St. <hi>Paul</hi> in a figurative sense,
there is none to understand the Phrase, before recited
and used in the Romish Church in that sense. If our
Author expects an Answer to his <hi>Heathenish Catechism,</hi>
(as he calls it) which is a Name very proper for it; I
shall, instead of that, only put a few Questions, and
conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether the Crosses used in the Religious Service of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
be mere pieces of Wood, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether they may not, and are not to adore the Cross, tho they may not
adore a meer piece of Wood?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How the Cross which they pray to Christ to bless, is made the stability
of Faith, and increase of good Works?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How the Cross upon which Christ hung, may be Christ who hung upon the
Cross?</p>
