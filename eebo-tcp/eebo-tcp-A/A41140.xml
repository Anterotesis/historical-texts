            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author of theſe Sermons, having ſerved his time, and being fallen aſleep, The lot is fallen upon me to appear in their behalfe, and to ſeale unto their worth and uſefulneſſe for publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as farre as thou pleaſeſt to ſeal unto my judgement and faithfulneſſe in ſuch a caſe, with thine opinion and approbation. For the truth is, that the ſtrength and value of my teſtimony concerning them, is like to extend no further, than thine doth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me: So that if I adde any thing to their credit and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the world, by my recommendation, it is by the mediation of thine ingenuity and fairneſſe towards me. But if thou ſhalt pleaſe to be at any reaſonable coſt in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, and lay thy judgement and conſcience as cloſe to the ſpirit, as thou muſt thine eyes to the letter of what thou readeſt, I make no queſtion but I ſhall be the gainer, and not they, by this engagement of my ſelfe for them. True worth, eſpecially when it overcomes and breaks out of the cloude of obſcurity, alwayes returnes more than what it receives from any mans teſtimony: neither is there any method or trade ſo proper or certain, whereby to raiſe an eſtate of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation to a mans ſelfe, as the beſtowing or
<pb facs="tcp:44191:3"/>
caſting honour and reputation upon other, ſo he be carefull and dexterous in the choyce of his ſubject. John Baptiſt by giving teſtimony only to one, Jeſus Chriſt, out-grew the common ſtature of thoſe that are borne of women; in true greatneſſe, Matth. 11. 11. And yet there was little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (in effect) added to Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe by his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, John. 5. 34. It is an ingenuous and inoffenſive way to ſerve our ſelves out of other mens excellencies, by advancing them: neither doe the generality of men in their practice, more generally conſent upon any principle of reaſon and equity, than this, To recompence ſuch men with terms of honour, who are unpartiall and free in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing and acknowledging the worth and eminencie of others. And as many that are but of meane condition in the world otherwiſe, yet maintaine themſelves comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, by trimming and dreſſing the Gardens and Orchards, and Vineyards of rich and wealthy men; ſo many men that want other perſonall abilities and excellencies of their own, ſubſiſt upon termes of a convenient reputation, only by vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating, adorning, and ſetting forth the endowments and gracefull parts of other men.</p>
            <p>The ſubject or argument of diverſe of theſe Sermons, is partly that Noble and high importing ſtraine of Chriſtian devotion; Preparation for that ſolemne enterview of Jeſus Chriſt in his death, at his Table; The great ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Gods proceedings againſt deſpiſers of admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reproofe. Both theames of ſavoury conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for all thoſe that love not death; and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for thoſe, who deſire not onely to bee ſaved, but to bee ſaved upon ſweeter, and more comfortable terms than as by fire, 1 Corinthians 3. 15. Thoſe that were chaſtened with weakeneſſe, and ſickeneſſe, and death amongſt the Corinthians, 1 Corinthians 11. 30. were yet ſaved, verſe 32. but this was as by or through fire; though they did not periſh, were not conſumed by the flames of Gods diſpleaſure againſt them, yet they were ſorely ſcorched with them, the ſmell of this fire was
<pb facs="tcp:44191:4"/>
ſtrong upon the garments of their fleſh; They diſcerned not the body of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, in his Ordinances; but in ſtead of that holy, reverend, and deepe-dyed beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which was due unto it, both from their inner and outward man, as being a creature of the higheſt and deepeſt ſanctification that ever God ſanctified; Sanctified not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a more excellent and glorious condition, but alſo to many ends and purpoſes of farre higher and dearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernement, both for the glory of God, and benefit of Men themſelves, than all other creatures whatſoever, whether in Heaven or in Farth; They handled and dealt by it in both kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, as if it had been but a common or unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified thing; thus they diſerned not the Lords body. And as they diſcerned not his body, ſo neither did God (in ſome ſenſe) diſcern theirs; but in thoſe ſore ſtrokes and heavy judgements which he inflicted on them, had them in no other rgard or conſideration, than a if they been the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his enemies, the bodies of wicked and ſinfull men; thus drawing the model and platforme of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as uſually he doth) from the ſtructure and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſinne. And if the morall or ſpirituall ſeeds and originals of our outward and bodily afflictions, as ſickneſſes, and weakneſſes, either upon our ſelves o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ours, declining eſtates, loſſes, &amp;c (which ſtill lye deeper than the naturall) were but carefully and narrowly ſought out, it is much to be feared we ſhould finde a great part of them (at leaſt) in the bowels of the ſame Sinne, ſo frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, I meane, of Not diſcerning the LORDS Body. The juſt and righteous God builds up the breaches that we make upon the honour belonging to the body of his Sonne, with the runies of that Honour, which he had given unto ours in health, ſtrength, life, and many other outward comforts and ſupports. But thou wilt heare more of theſe things in the Sermons themſelves; the wholeſome Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and Reproofes wherein contained, with the reſt of that heavenly proviſion for thy Soule, which ſhalt finde here gathered together, and laid into thine hand, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He cauſe of that little Heavenlineſſe which is in the profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the want of Meditation. Many can meditate curſorily, but that is not enough: it muſt be a ſticking meditation that muſt affect the heart That place in a Pet. 2. 8. is marvellous pregnant, it was the meanes why Lot was ſo touched with the abominations of Sodom, That righteous man dwelling amongſt them, in ſeeing and hearing their ungodly deeds, vexed his righteous ſoul from day to day. Many heard and ſaw too beſides Lot, and were not vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Why? Other matters ſtuck in their thoughts, they ne're throughly meditated on it; but he vexed himſelf, that is, the meditation of thoſe evils, and bringing them home to his Soul, vexed him.</p>
            <p>The word is a fit word, implying two things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſearching and examining of a thing, his meditating heart examined their ſins: how many they were, how grievous, how damnable, how likely to pul down ſome vengeance or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44191:6"/>Secondly, the wracking or vexing upon tryall; ſo it was with Lot, he obſerved all their evills, and weighed them in his ſoule, and then he wrack'd his ſpirit with the conſidertaion of them. The Evangeliſt uſeth this very word for toſſing; this word that is here put for vexing, he puts for toſſing a ſhip on the ſeas, Matthew 14. 24. The ſhip was toſsed with the waves: ſo meditation did toſſe his ſoule with vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes down to the deep; O miſerable wretches that we are! or, How brutiſh, hoſt beaſtly, and how helliſh are our ſins? Sometimes up; O that the Lord would humble us and ſpare us! Sometimes over head and ears in the ſtorm; O fool that I was to chuſe my dwelling amongſt ſuch men.</p>
            <p>Theſe meditations vexed his ſoul: Many have ſtudied me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and yet yet are not acquainted with this cordiall meditation: many Miniſters that ſtudy Divinity all the day, that ſtudy the Word all the week, that ſtudy their Sermons all the yeare, may yet for all this, be carnall Miniſters: why? Becauſe their meditation is but inventing and mentall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; this meditation is a practicall meditation, the thing meditated feeds the heart: that meditation is like a flutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Pheaſant, that flutters before their eyes, it feeds their eyes indeed, but never feeds the ſtomack, as long as they neither catch or eat it. The ſaving myſtereis of God flutter before their eyes, and before their underſtandings, they feed their eyes with knowledge, but never feed their ſoules unto everlaſting life, unleſſe they fowl for it, dreſſe and digeſt it in their hearts.</p>
            <p>There is an apt word, Geneſis 24. 63. Iſaac went out to meditate in the field: the originall hath it, to ſignifie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>nall conference, his minde conferred with the truth, and the truth with him, a mutuall working he wrought upon the truth, by meditating of it, and it wrought upon him by leaving an impreſſion upon his ſoule: this is a rare pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the world, and yet as neceſſary as moſt, it is the art of the ſoule in being heavenly, it is the inuring of thee to every good duty; for by meditation a man comes to have
<pb facs="tcp:44191:6"/>
his minde and heart fixed upon every thing that he would; would he pray? he that hath inured his heart to meditate, his minde is fixed in his prayer. Would he receive the Sacrament? He that hath inured his heart by meditation, his minde is fixed in the Ordinance. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid that was excellent at meditation, had a fixed heart, Pſalm. 57. 7. Pſal. 112. 17.</p>

                     </note> this thing, and yet they laid it not to heart; and therefore he ſends Haggai the Prophet unto them to call them to repentance; and (which is an admirable courſe, and little thought of in the world) he begins with holy meditation and conſideration: Now therefore thus ſaith the Lord, conſider your wayes; that is, both in regard of the courſe of them, your wicked wayes; and alſo in regard of the bitter fruit of them, your wretched and unproſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wayes. Here be two things very remarkable according to the Text;</p>
                  <p>1. The repetition and inforcing of it again; for he urgeth it again, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your wayes, in the ſeventh verſe.</p>
                  <p>2. The benefit that came by it; it brought them to repentance; for they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44191:26"/>
all obeyed the voice of the Lord, and the words of the Prophet, verſe, 12. So that the Doctrine from hence is this, That</p>
                  <p>Serious meditation of our ſins by the Word, is a ſpeciall means to make men<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> repent.</p>
                  <p>Meditation is a ſetled exerciſe of the mind for a further inquiry of the truth, and ſo affecting the heart therewith, and therefore their be four things in meditation.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is an exerciſe of the mind, not barely cloſing with the truth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and aſſenting unto it, and ſeeing it, and there reſts, but it looketh on every ſide of the truth: I thought upon my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Pſal. 119, 59. ſaith David; that is, I looked on my wayes on both ſides, above and beneath; it's taken from curious works, which are the the ſame on both ſides, ſo that they which work them, muſt often turn them on every ſide; uſed Exod. 38. 33. as being works with two faces, as one well obſerves, ſo it was with David, I turned my wayes up-ſide down, and looked every way upon them: thou never meditateſt, unleſſe thou look on thy wayes on both ſides with all circumſtances. An ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant phraſe we have, Dan. 12. 4. Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall abound, and be increaſed, [Run to and fro] what is that? It is not the bodily removing of man from one place to another ſo much, as buſie ſtirring of the mind from one truth to another, ſo that it ſeeth the whole ſelvedge and compaſſe of the truth: thou wilt never get the truth to be meditated of, till thou run to and fro in it, meditate it on this ſide, and meditate it on that ſide, look on it in every nook of it. Meditation is like perambulation, when men go the bounds of the Pariſh, they go in every part of it, and in every skirt of it: ſo meditation is the perambulation of the ſoul, when the ſoul looks how far ſin goes, how far the fleſh goes, how far the wrath of God againſt it goes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it is an exerciſe, ſo it is a ſetled exerciſe, it is not a ſudden <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> flaſh of a mans conceit, but it dwels upon a truth. When a man is in a deep meditation upon a thing he neither ſees, nor hears, nor attends any thing elſe; the ſtream of the heart is ſetled upon the truth received; The word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the world, 1 John 2. 14. How came theſe young men to overcome Satan? not by looking into the word, or only thinking of the word; but by letting the word abide in them. When a man hath been offered an injury, his heart is alwayes ſetled upon it, when he eats, his mind runs on the injury; when he walks, and talks, ſtill his mind runs on the injury: ſo thy heart muſt go on the truth, 2. Tim. 3. Continue in things thou haſt learned: that is, take up thy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion houſe in them. A wicked man may turn into the word ſometimes to think of it; but it is as a man goes into another mans houſe: there is not his dwelling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it is to make a further inquiry. Meditation doth not only ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon the truth known, but it alſo would fain know more of thoſe truths, that are ſubject to it; as a man without may ſee the out-ſide of the houſe, but he cannot ſee the rooms within, unleſſe he come nigh, and draw the latch, and come into the houſe, and go into the rooms, and look about them; Meditation pulls the latch of the truth and looks into
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44191:26"/>
every cloſet, and every cupboard, &amp; every angle of it. Here is my ſin, here is my uncleanneſſe, and here is Gods anger, here is the woful evil that will follow upon it, and here is a remedy againſt it. Meditation ſearches into all the lofts and cloſets of the truth. The entrance of thy word giveth underſtanding unto the ſimple. Pſ. 119. 30. The ingreſs (as one expounds it) or going into thy word, gives underſtanding; the wicked ſtand looking upon the truth without the doors, but it is the ingreſſe, or going into the truth, that gives underſtanding. Indeed the truth is like a neat Palace, (ſaith Chriſoſtome) the Spirit of God is like the light of the Sunne that ſhineth into it; the wicked they ſtand without, like fools peeping in at the windows, and there be many thouſand of pearls that are not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto them: the houſe ſeems dark to them that ſtand without. Thou muſt enter into the word, and into every particular truth in it, and go up ſtairs, and down ſtairs, and have an eye into every room. There thou ſhalt find humility, there contrition, there converſion, there Chriſt and his Spirit in one cloſet, there all his Jewels in that, and that box; all is manifeſt within doors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it labours to affect the heart; it doth not only labour to know more and more of the truth, but alſo it labours to bring it home to the heart. The good woman conſiders a field and buys it, Prov. 31. 16. This is (ſaith Ambroſe) the good Chriſtian ſoul, if in civility, then much more in Divinity, he conſiders the truth and buyes it, he taketh it as his own, and appropriates it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto himſelf; Lo this (ſaith Eliphaz) we have ſearched out, ſo it is, hear it, and know it for thy ſelf, Iob 5. 27. When thou canſt ſay of the truth, lo this is it, we have ſearched it out; I have dived into it, peruſed it, ſo it is, even ſo indeed: all this is, that thou mayeſt apply it unto thy ſelf, and know it for thy good.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Reaſon is, becauſe meditation muſters up all weapons, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> all forces of arguments for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

You have committed evil in a corner, but you ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t carry it away ſo. Item, it was againſt the knowledge of God revealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Item, againſt many mercies received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, againſt many Judgements threatned, againſt many checks of conſcience, againſt many Vows and Promiſes; remember that, O my ſoul, Item for that, and Item for this; Item for every luſt, and every circumſtance, thus oft, and in this place, and at that time, in that manner So meditated the prodigal. Look<note place="margin">Luke. 5. 17.</note> as it is in warrs, were there but many ſcores come againſt an Army, they might be conquered; or many hundreds, they might be reſiſted; but if many thouſands ſhould come againſt a ſmal Army, it would be in danger indeed. Meditation leadeth a whole Army of arguments, a whole Army of curſes, miſeries, judgements, commandments againſt the ſoul, how ever one miſery or plague will not knock it down, but the ſoul may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44191:27"/>
brook it, and goe away with it: but meditation brings a great Armado of arguments, and tels the ſoul, God is againſt thee, and againſt thy wayes: God is againſt thee where ever thou art, or what ever thou doeſt. Then the heart begins to cry out, as Eliſha his ſervant did, Maſter, what ſhall we do? 2 Kings 6. 15. So many horſes againſt us, ſo many charets, and ſo many men againſt us? Maſter what ſhall we do? ſo many ſins, and ſo heinous; ſo many judgements and ſo heavy; and ſo many evils, and ſpiritual maladies! Oh, what ſhal I do to be ſaved! that I ſhould commit ſin againſt a God that hath damned innumerable Angels, millions of Kings, Princes, and Nobles! that I ſhould commit it againſt this God, ſo mercifull to me, ſo gracious, ſo patient, ſo good to my ſoul! that I, wretched rebel, ſhould for a cup of drink refuſe heaven! for a luſt not worth a ſtraw under my foot, caſt off Chriſt, and grace, and all! how ſhal I do? Then the ſoul ſtands in a maze.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe meditation having hundled up all Items againſt the ſoul, and brought it in all bils of account, it faſtens ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> upon the ſoul; I mean it makes the ſoul feel it, ſo that it muſt needs be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without any evaſion. Meditation deals with a man as Eliſha dealt with the meſſengers of the King Joram; the murderer he was coming to do miſchief to the Prophet, and the prophet did ſhut the door, and held him faſt at the door, 2 Kings 6. 32. and then he made him know that the evill was from the Lord, before he could ſtirr: ſo meditation, when the ſoul would fain out of doors into its old courſe again, it ſhuts the door upon it, and holds it faſt: Meditation tels the ſoul, this evil is from the Lord upon thee, O my ſoul, if thou ſtirr in or out upon this or that luſt any more, this evill, that courſe, that vengeance and damnation; if ever thou ſtir forth, thou loſeſt thy mercy, thou loſeſt Chriſt, thou loſeſt all poſſibility of comfort. Stir not out, if thou doſt, thou wilt rue it. Sometimes when men hear the Word, they go away touched, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve not to commit ſin again as they have done; yet when they are gone, it works not, but the heart recoyls again, and turns to its old paſſe, The reaſon is, becauſe they meditate not upon the Word, they faſten it not upon their conſciences.</p>
                  <p>It is with the word as it is with a ſalve: if a man that hath never ſo good a ſalve, that will heal any thing in four and twenty hours, if a man ſhould do nothing but lay it to the wound, &amp; take it off, lay it on and take it off, it will not heal the wound: and no marvel, Why? he will not let it lye on, the beſt ſalve will not heal the ſoare, nor eat out the corruption, unleſſe it be bound on and let lye: ſo it is with the Word, many a ſoul hears it; heart, conſcience, affections, all toucht: but when he is gone out of the Church, all is gone, his affections dye, his heart dyes, and his conſcience becomes unfruitful: Why? he is ſtill removing of the ſalve, and will not let it lye on, and therefore the Word over-powers not his corruptions; the Word is like the ſalve; conviction of conſcience is like the laying on of the ſalve; meditation the binding of it to the ſoare.</p>
                  <p>St. James compares a ſlight hearer to a man that looks into a glaſſe, who ſoon forgets his viſage, but a good hearer doth two things: Firſt, he ſtoops down and looks into it, to take a perfect view of his eſtate; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44191:27"/>
he continues looking into it, Iames 1. 25. he doth not leave the glaſſe behind him, but he carrieth away the glaſſe with him: This man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</p>
                  <p>If the pills be never ſo bitter, yet let a man ſwallow them ſpeedily, there is no great diſtaſte; but if a man chew a pill, it will make him deadly ſick. Thy ſins are like thoſe pills, they go down very pleaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe thou ſwalloweſt them: thou ſwalloweſt down thine oaths, lies, ignorance, pride, thou ſwalloweſt down the threats of the Lord, but if thou wouldeſt chew theſe bitter pills, and meditate and ruminate, and chew the cud, drunkenneſſe would be as bitter as hell; ſwearing and ſecurity, and Saboath breaking, would be as bitter as wormwood; thou durſt not go on in them, they would make thee look ſourely upon them for ever: like a man that hath chewed a pill, he can hardly ever ſee a pill, but his ſtomack riſeth againſt it. Behold, I wil hedge up thy way with thorns, Hoſ. 2. 6. I wil not be ſo preciſe (ſaith the heart) I wil go on as I have done, I wil go after theſe and theſe courſes; I will hedge up thy way with thorns (ſaith God,) meditation is Gods inſtrument, and ſets a thorn in the way to every ſin, to bring the heart back again. Would the heart laſh out into luke-warmneſſe? Meditation ſets a thorn in the way; God will ſpue thee out of his mouth. Would the heart ſally forth into any ſin? Meditation ſets a thorn in the way, Curſed art thou if thou doſt err from Gods Commandements. The heart cannot ſtep forth into any luſt, but meditation meets it with a thorn, this curſe, and that curſe, this plague, and that plague. Would the heart reach at mercy in its ſin? Meditation pricks it; mercie is venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance unto thee, ſo long as thou hankreſt after ſin. Would the heart reach after Chriſt in his ſin? Meditation puſhes it back with a thorn: no Chriſt for thee, but a ſeverejudge, ſo long as thou itcheſt after thy vanities.</p>
                  <p>What ſhal we think of them then, which are loth to practice this duty? Moſt men are loth, though they be willing enough to meditate on their<note place="margin">Uſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Mariner meditates and conſiders his courſe by his Compaſſe, or elſe he might ſoon runne on the quick-ſands; a Pilgrim is full of thoughts, what? am I in my right way? He never comes to a doubtfull turning, but he ſtands in a ſtudy and muſes, O which is my right way? The Merchant meditates, and his mind runs on his Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, or elſe he is ſoon bankrupt: The voluptuous man his thoughts run on his pleaſure: the drunkard on his cups, the proud man on his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. But it is one thing to look to that which is thine, and another thing to look to thy ſelf, Take heed to your ſelves, ſaith the Lord, Deut. 11. 16. Deut. 12. 30. Deut. 4. 9. Exod. 34. 12. as if he ſhould ſay, think on thy ſelf, &amp; of thy poor ſoul; let thy Meditation run on thy poor ſoul. The heart is untoward unto this duty, and as unwilling as a Bear to be brought to the ſtake: the Bear would rather be rambling abroad then be baited: ſo men had rather let their hearts ramble about any thing, then bait them for their ſins; yea men ſcoff at it, ſaying, ſhall we alwayes be poring on our ſins? ſhall we run mad? ſhall we drive our ſelves to deſpair? can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not men keep themſelves well while they are well?</p>
                  <p>The poor man he hath no time for this tedious duty: the rich man he needs it not, the wicked they dare not; ſo no man will, No man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented

him of his wickedneſſe, ſaying, What have I done? Jer. 8. 6. no man would meditate and think with himſelf, what is my caſe? how ſtands my condition before God? what evil have I done? in the Ark and in the old Law if there were any beaſt that chewed not the cud, it was a ſign of an unclean beaſt: the word implies the bringing up of their meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their mouths again, and ſitting down to chew it again. But now men like unclean beaſts, ſwallow down the food of their ſouls unchewed, and will not meditate thereof, that it may turn to good nutriment; but like Cormorants, they take it down by whole-ſale, and are never the better? So the Word is to them as the Quails to the Iſraelites, while the fleſh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt them, and ſmote them them with a very great plague, Num. 11, 33. So the Word of God ſticks in their teeth, ere they chew it, or meditate upon it, the wrath of God falls upon them, and ſtrikes them with a very great plague of hardneſſe of heart, and leanneſs of ſoul. But the truth is: you that will not now ſee your ſins nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on them, you ſhall ſee them, and meditate on nothing but on fear, Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, Iſaiah 26. 11.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lets of ſerious meditation are, Firſt, vain company. When<note place="margin">Let. 1.</note> Peter ſaw the people touched, Acts 2. 37. he ſaid unto them, Save your ſelves from this untoward generation, verſe 40. as if he ſhould ſay, If you love your ſelves, God hath touched your hearts, ſuffer not Satan and theſe wicked inſtruments, to ſteal away theſe impreſſions of terrour from your Souls If ever you love your ſouls. ſort not your ſelvs with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward generation. See, as it humbles you, ſo let meditation follow upon it, ſo that it may ſtill humble you. Ill company brings a man to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (as the proverb is) and ill company will bring a man to hell (ſay I:) and meditation cannot be admitted to it. David would not have a wicked man to abide in his ſight, when he was to meditate: he wiſht that there were never a wicked man in the world; much leſs would he keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with them My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet; let the ſinners be conſumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more: Bleſs thou the Lord, O my ſoul, pſ. 104. 35.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Let is, multitude of worldly buſineſses. A dream (ſaith So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon)<note place="margin">Let 2.</note> comes through multitude of buſineſſes, Eccleſ. 5. Multitude of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes cauſeth the mind ſo to run on them, that they do even dream of them in their ſleep, as Lucretius, Seneca, Claudian, and many others of the hearthens haue obſerved. He that over-imploys himſelf, his meditations of heaven are dreaming meditations; his thoughts, dreaming thoughts, he can never ſeriouſly meditate on the good of his ſoul. Many ingroſſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes into their hands never thinking they have enough, they are ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy after the world, and ſo careleſſe of heaven. So they make their hearts like high-way-ground: the word ſown in their hearts, is like ſeed ſown in the high-way, where is ſuch a throughfare, and a broad Carriers road of earthly affairs, that all the word and meditation thereof is trodden down as the graſſe in the high-way, which cannot grow, ſo neither meditation in a buſie-bodied heart. For a good meditating mind, (Nemo ad illam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44191:28"/>
occupatus, ſaith Seneca) no man ever came to it ſurfeited with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. David although he had abundance of State-affairs, both his hands ful, yet he would not to be over-charged, but that he might medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in Gods word: My hands alſo (not all down to buſineſſe only in the world, but alſo up to thy Law) will I lift up to thy commandements, which I have loved, and I wil meditate on thy ſtatutes. Pſal. 119. 48. Take not too much upon thee, like thoſe graſping worldlings, that wil have a finger in a hundred things: Martha, Martha, thou art cumbred about many things, but one thing is needfull, and Mary hath choſen the better part, Luke 10. 41.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and what was that one thing? Mary was ſitting and meditating in, and pondring Chriſts words, not (as Theophylact expounds it) as if we would ſay, Martha, Martha, thou art cumbred about many diſhes, but one thing is needfull only, only one diſh, though indeed ſo it be, yet he here ſpeaks not only of one diſh, but of many cares which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that one neceſſary duty of hearing and meditating of the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ignorance. A man cannot meditate of a thing he knows<note place="margin">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> not; nor thou of thy ſins, if thou be not skilful in Gods Catalogue of thy ſins; nor of mercies and promiſes, if thou beeſt not verſt in them; nor of his Precepts, if thou be not expert in them. the Pſalmiſt proveth that he had more knowledge than all his teachers: Why? becauſe he uſed to meditate. I have more underſtanding then all my Tutors, for thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are my meditation, Pſal. 119. 99.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, averſneſſe of the heart: The heart is like the ſwine, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<note place="margin">4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> is like the yoke: the Hogge would fain get into forbidden fields for to grub them; the yoke that hinders him; but he cannot abide it, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtep he takes, he lifts up his foot to ſtrike it off if he could; ſo the heart would fain break through hedges, and get into forbidden wayes, and if thou wouldeſt meditate, it would every moment lift up it's heel to put thee beſides it. If it cannot put thee beſides it, it wil mar it if it can, and therefore David praid to God to ſettle his heart upon the right, and put his yoke upon him, or it would never be ſtedfaſt elſe upon meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart be ever accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thy ſight, O Lord, my ſtrength and my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> redeemer; Pſal. 19. 14.</p>
                  <p>This averſneſſe of the heart conſiſts in three things: Firſt, in the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the heart, the heart prizeth not meditation, nor the things of grace that are to be meditated on; it will not be at the coſt and charge, nor at the pains for them. To what end is a price in the hands of a fool, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no heart to get wiſdom? Prov. 17. 16. The heart will not be brought to Gods price? it would fain have the wares at a cheap rate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in runnings of it: the heart is like a vagrant rogue, he would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> rather be hanged, than tied to his pariſh. Thou canſt not bring it to prayer, but it will be a gadding on by thoughts: thou canſt not bring it to a Sermon, but it will be roving after wandering imaginations; thou canſt not bring it to a meditation, but it will be a goſſipping forth. When Chriſt came to bind men with his bleſſed cords, and bind their hearts to him, Pſal. 2. they fall a meditating afterwards, but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44191:29"/>
it was meditating and imagining vain things, verſe 1. and when they ſaw they were to be tyed up, Tuſh (ſay they) let us break their bonds aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and caſt their cords from us, verſe 3. What, do Miniſters call us to ſuch ſtrictneſſe, thinking to impriſon our hearts in their ſtocks? away with their bonds, no, we will have none of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the weariſomneſs of the heart: It is as weary of meditation, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a Cur is of the whip, and the chain; Oh how it barks and maunders till it be looſe! yea, though it be never ſo eager upon it at the firſt, it's jaded preſently. When God called the Jews to ſanctifie his Name, they thought in their hearts; O, what a wearineſse is this I and ye have ſnuffed at it (ſaith the Lord) ye brought which was lame, and torn and ſick, Malac. 1. 13. What a wearineſſe is it to meditate? ſaith the heart; it ſnuffs, it is unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; it is lumpiſh; it would fain tear off a piece of the duty, or bring it wanting a leg, or without ſoundneſſe and ſincerity; yet ſome of them (ſaith Calvin) were ſo humbled, that they thought on the name of the Lord, Malac. 3. 16. they thought, and meditated, and forced their hearts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider throughly.</p>
                  <p>This may ſerve for terror unto all thoſe, who for all this that hath been<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> ſpoken, dare ſit down without it; yea, the world will not beleeve theſe things, nor meditate therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, they blame Gods meſſengers, that call ſo ſore upon them. Habakkuk was ſo ſerved; he preached the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God to the humble, and the judgements of God to the wicked: they ask him why he was ſo mad? well (ſayes the Prophet) I will ſtand upon my watch, and ſee what the Lord ſayes unto me, that I may anſwer to them that reprove me, Hab. 2. 1. What did the Lord tell him? Write the viſion, and make it plain upon Tables, that he may run that reads it, verſe 2. Will they not beleeve? Will they rove? Will they not meditate ſteadily upon theſe things? Will they not let their hearts ſtay and meditate and conſider? The viſion ſhall be ſo plain, that he that runs may read it. If thou wilt not ſtay, and meditate herein, the word is ſo plain to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that if thou didſt not but think of it with a running thought, thou maiſt read thine own vengeance, thine own woes, in regard of the multitude of them. He that runnes by a way full of holes and pits, though he ſtand not meditating where are the pits, yet he may run and ſee them. The book of God is full, leaves and cover, and all, of woes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, Lam. 2. 10. It is written without, there thou maiſt read thy ſins written; it is written likewiſe within, there thou maiſt read thy plagues.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the greatneſſe of them, he that runnes along, and loe a great town on fire, though he ſtay not to meditate on it, what or where it is, yet he may run and read it: ſo is the curſe of ſinners a great curſe, Zeph. 1. 10. he that runs may read it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in regard of the proximitie and neerneſſe of them. He that runnes, if a ſword come out at his throat, though he doth not ſtop to meditate, what is this at my throat, yet he cannot but ſee it. Behold the Judge ſtandeth before the door, James, 5. 9. Take heed how thou grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or ſinneſt in any particular; behold the Judge ſtandeth before the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44191:29"/>
door; behold it and meditate on it with thy heart; if not, he is nigh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, thou canſt not ſtep out of doors unto any ſin, but though thou runneſt, thou muſt needs ſee the Judge that will Judge thee, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eming thy ſins, noting thy wayes, obſerving thy courſes, ready to unhaſp the door on thee, to hale thee unto hell in thy ſins. Whoſe end is deſtruction? Why? Even thoſe that mind earthly things, Phil. 3. 19. If thy mind and meditation run more on thy ground, cattel, goods, kitchen, houſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, earthly talk, diſcourſes, thoughts, more than of heaven, thy end is deſtruction. If thy thoughts will not ſtay here, do but runne, and thou maiſt read it: Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets, I am come to fulfill them, Matthew 5. 17. Some (ſaith Chriſoſtome) might think now Chriſt is come, it is no matter though we not be ſo ſtrict, Chriſt is enough. Think not thus (ſaith Chriſt) but rather think and meditate that I am come to fulfill it may ſelf, and to ſee it fulfilled in thoſe I mean to ſave, ſo as to make it a rule of their lives. Themiſtocles ſaid, he could not ſleep in his bed for continual thinking and meditating on Miltiades his Tryumphs; And how canſt thou ſleep in thy bed, if thou wouldeſt but meditate on theſe places of Scripture? Retire thy ſelf apart, there is no caſting up of mans account in a croud: Let me alone, I am buſie; ſo we uſe to ſay, when we would be private.</p>
                  <p>Thou muſt do with thy ſoul as Ehud did to Eglon, who ſaid, I have a<note place="margin">Meanes 1.</note> ſecret errant to thee, O King, and ſo all went out, and he ſaid: I have a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from God to thee, and ſo ſtabd him at his heart, Judges 3. 19. So (for Ehud was a type of Chriſt, ſaith Lavator) I have a ſecret errant to thee, O my ſoul, and ſo let all go forth: I have a meſſage from God to thee, a meſſage of wrath for thy Pride, a meſſage of wrath for thy vain hopes: Thus, ſaith the Lord; Curſed art thou, O my ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtab it to the heart with this ſpirituall Dagger, wound it with the blade and haft and all, till thou have let out the fat and the dirt, the filth and iniquity all out. The Prophet ſpeaking of mens looking on Chriſt whom they have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, this meditating and laying to heart that they have crucified the Lord Jeſus, ſaith that they ſhall mourn every one in private, the houſe of David apart, and their wives apart; the houſe of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; the houſe of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; every family a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and their wives apart, Zach. 12. 2.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond meanes, if thou wouldeſt meditate aright, obſerve the<note place="margin">Meanes 2.</note> times of privacy,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the morniug, that is the beſt time for ſtudy: David choſe the morning for meditation, Pſal 5. 1. 3. Let them hear this, (ſaith Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome) that ariſe betimes in the morning to ſerve their Hoggs and their Doggs, their bellies and their backs, before they ſerve God in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or prayer, unleſſe it be the mumbling and roaring a few [Lord have mercy upon us] that pray not till after many other buſineſſes, it may may be, not then neither. David prayed and meditated in the morning. In the morning thou waſheſt thy face and thy hands, but thy ſoul hath more need, which thou waſheſt not: in the morning thou putteſt thy cloathes on thy body, but thou putteſt not on afreſh the new man upon thy ſoul; in the morning thou ſhakeſt off ſleepineſſe from thine eyes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44191:30"/>
but thou ſhakeſt not off drouſineſſe from thy ſoul. Thou lookeſt into the glaſſe in the morning, to ſee if thy face be as it ſhould be; but thy ſoul is not compoſedly looking into the glaſſe of Gods word. In the morning loook up in prayer, look up in thanſgiving, look up in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the night too; O Lord, I meditate on thee in the night wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Pſal. 93. not as carnall ones doe, when they cannot ſleep, then their mind runs on their Cow and their Calf, their markets and vanities, this neighbour and that neighbour, like Petronius his dogge, that was hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while he lay aſleep in his kennel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the evening; I prevent the night watches, that I might medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Pſal. 119. 148. he did not as wicked men doe, ſleep like a horſe in the ſtable on his litter, with his neck tyed to the manger: they did go to bed with their hearts roped to the world, worldly thoughts, this thought and that thought, and God knows what.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when the heart is touched at a Sermon or Sacrament, or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of any judgement or mercy, or act of Gods providence, it is beſt ſtriking when the Iron is hot; David, when his heart was touched at the reproches of the wicked, then he meditated, Pſall. 119. 23. When the Inſtrument is in tune, then it is good playing upon it; when a Churl is in a good mood, then it is fitteſt to deal with him. Oft will thy heart be out of tune, oft churliſh, and in an ill mood: if thou letteſt the good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity goe; thou knoweſt not when thou ſhalt have ſuch another. When the fiſh is nibling at the bait, then it is good twiching at the angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, when the heart is a nibling at grace, then gave a pluck at it by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. See Acts 17. 11. now while the time luſts, ſee thou maiſt get into heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Rub up thy ſelf and thy memory; call as much to mind as thou<note place="margin">Means 3.</note> canſt, what evill thou haſt done ever ſince thou waſt born, what in the womb, what in the cradle, childhood, youth, age; what a ſervant, what a Maſter; what as a ſervant, what as a ſon, what as a neighbour, what as an inferiour, what as a ſuperiour; either in thought, or word or deed; how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thou haſt omitted good duties, or done them by halvs; Item for this; and Item for that. They ſhall remember themſelves and turn unto the Lord, Pſal. 22. 27. Firſt, they ſhall remember themſelves, and ſay, what have I done. O wretch! how careleſſely have I lived! Secondly, ſo medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they ſhall turn unto the Lord. Many ſay, Oh! they cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their ſins. They lye in a thouſand particulars: for they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to commit them well enough. See Lam. 3. 19. 20. 21. our Greek tranſlation turns it, I ſpake to my ſelf, and meditated: as if they ſhould ſay, O what a rebell have I been! how unthankfull, how unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table under all the means of grace! I may thank my ſins for all the plagues of the Almighty that are upon me: if he had damned me, I had been well ſerved. What follows? The heart bowed, and was humbled, as it is in the text.</p>
                  <p>The fourth means. Rouze up thy heart. As it is with the eye of the<note place="margin">Means 4.</note> body, ſo it is with the eye of the Soul: when a man would look wiſtly upon a thing, as if he would look thorow it, he ſets his eye on it, as

Paul ſet his eyes on Elymas, Ah thou child of the Devill, thou, &amp;c. Acts 13. 9. Meditation is the ſetting of the eye of the ſoul upon a thing: ſet thine eye upon thy ſelfe, and ſay, Ah thou childe of the wicked, why hath Satan filled thy heart! O wretched heart! whence hadſt thou thy ſelfe-love? hadſt thou not it from the Devill? God might do well to ſend thee to the Devill, if thou loveſt ſo to be his Broker. Set thine eyes ſtedfaſtly upon thine own wayes, and thou ſhalt ſee infinite helliſh evils in thy ſins.</p>
                  <p>The third Uſe is for Reprehenſion. What is more uſual than this,<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> that men make ſlight account of their ſins? Nay, when God tels them in their hearts, Thou ſhalt not do this, thou ſhalt not doe that, yet they meditate and think, Why may I not? Samuel bid Saul ſtay for directions from him, before he ſacrificed unto God. It ſeems that God ſpoke to his heart. Stay till Samuel comes to direct thee: yet Saul forced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to diſobey, and to do Sacrifice, 1. Sam. 13. 12. he was bold, as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table turns it; he confirmed himſelfe, as Pagnin tranſlates it: he thruſt himſelfe upon the doing of it; God forbad him, he would do it: God urged him in his conſcience not to doe it, yet he would do it: God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain whiſpered to him not to do it, yet he forced himſelfe to do it; as if he ſhould ſay, I hope I may do it, I have ſtayed ſeven days wanting an hour, or a piece of an houre; and a little piece breaks no ſquare: No? God rejected Saul for that venture; God would have forced him by meditation, O no, doe it not by no means: he made him think, Oh, it is againſt Gods commandements, I may not do it. No, but never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he forced himſelf to do it. Thus God deals with thouſands and millions in the world: Be not a drunkard; God flings the meditation into the conſcience, yet a drunkard thou wilt be. Be not a drunkard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; a drunkard notwithſtanding thou wilt be: Be not again; they force themſelves, they will go to the Ale-houſe. And ſo of all other ſins. If men will caſt off this work of meditation darted into their ſouls, they caſt off their own mercy. God tels them, pray not, hear not, offer not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out directions from me; they dread not the commandment, they will: I truſt prayers are good, I will ſay them. Thus they will not meditate, or if they do, they break it off before it comes to any ſtrength or perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yea, Gods own ſervants, that deſire to look towards Sion, is not this your complaint oft? I cannot finde ſinne heavy: I confeſſe the word diſcovers it to me, but I cannot be troubled for it. Look as it is with men in the world, if five hundred pound weight be laid upon the ground, if a man never pluck at it, he ſhall never feel the weight of it. Your ſinnes are not many hundreds, but many thouſands, yea many ten thouſands: ſelfe-love, ſecurity; hardneſſe of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> baſe fears, &amp;c. it is impoſſible to reckon them. The leaſt vain thought that ever you imagined, the leaſt vaine word that ever you uttered, were weight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to preſſe your ſouls down to hell; Therefore what are ſo many ſins and ſo great, and ſo often committed? What are they? they are as heauy as rocks and mountains; yet ye feel them not ſo heavy. Why? Ye weigh them not; if ye did, yee ſhould finde them heavier than the ſand, as David did when his ſinne was ever before him (Pſal. 51. 3.) that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44191:31"/>
is, his ſinne was ever in his thoughts, and in his meditation, his ſin was ever like a huge Milſtone before him, and he was ever tugging and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to remove it out of his way.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>I anſwer, three things are here to be diſcovered;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ground upon which our meditation muſt be raiſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the manner how to follow it home to the heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how to put life and power into it.</p>
                  <p>The ground I referre to theſe foure heads:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, meditate on the goodneſſe, patience, and mercy of God, that hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> been abuſed by any of your ſins: the greater they have been to you, the greater is every ſinne: this maketh them out of meaſure ſinfull, becauſe God is out of meaſure mercifull. There are many ſinnes in one, when a man ſinnes againſt many mercies, See Judg. 2. 2, 3. Why have ye done thus? I, have done thus and thus mercifully unto you, why have yee done thus unthankfully to me? Why was my mercy abuſed? Why was my goodneſſe ſleighted? Why was my patience deſpiſed? as if the Lord ſhould ſay, I ſpeak to your owne conſcience, think of it, meditate of it, why have ye done this? Doe ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? Is not he thy Father? Meditate of it firſt, and tell me then. For it is a queſtion put to thy meditation to anſwer. Do ye thus requite the Lord, ye fooliſh people? Wert thou ever in want, but God ſupplyed thee? Wert thou ever in weakneſſe, but God ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee? Wert thou ever in ſtraits, but God delivered thee? When thou wert in ſickneſſe, who cured thee? when thou wert in poverty, who relieved thee? when thou wert in miſery, who ſuccoured thee? Hath not God been a gracious God to thee? Every ſoul can tell, never poor ſinner hath had a more gracious God, than I poor ſinner have found to my ſoul. All my bones can ſay, Lord, who hath been like unto thee? This heart hath been heavy, and thou haſt cheered it: this ſoul hath been diſtreſſed, and thou haſt eaſed it: many troubles have befallen me, and thou haſt given me a gracious iſſue. This poor man (ſaith David, pointing to himſelfe,) this poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him, Pſal. 34. 9. And ſhall I thus reward the Lord? ſhall I ſinne againſt his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Then what ſhall I ſay? Hear, O heavens, and hearken, O earth; Sunne, ſtand thou ſtill, and thou Moon be amazed at this, and be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on ſuch a heart as this. The Oxe knows his owner, and the Aſſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Crib; but here is a heart that will not remember to know the Lord. Hear, O heavens, this villany cryeth ſo loud, that your ears may hear it. Hear all ye Angels add be aſtoniſhed, here is villany to make your ears glow: yea, hear hell, hear Devils, if ever there were worſe committed by you. When men are but ingenuous, if they haue received any kindeneſſe from a friend, they were never in want but he relieved them: never harbourleſſe, but he houſed them; never to ſeek, but he found them: Let a man deal thus kindly with a man, if this man ſhould deny him any ordinary favour; he will be aſhamed of himſelfe, aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to come into his preſence. What will he think? his houſe was mine, his cupboard was mine, and his purſe was mine, and his friends
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44191:31"/>
were mine, and that I ſhould deal thus unkindly with him, even nature rebukes me. This ſerious meditation will help to break thy heart.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ground of meditation is to mediate on the justice of God: God is a juſt God as well as mercifull. Speak all ye Devils in Hell, Doe ye not feel that he is a juſt God? Speak Sodome, Speak Gomorrah, your fire and brimſtone can teſtifie that he is a juſt God: Speak Adah, Zillah, and all ye that were drowned in the old world, your deluge can teſtify he is a juſt God, His judgements are all in the world, 1. Chro. 16. 14. What is become of drunken Nabal, and ſwearing Saul, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Ahab, and proud Jeſabel, and mocking Jehu, and envious Shimei? What is become of all blind Jebuſites, and parting, cavilling Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſes? Juſtice hath taken hold on them. What is povertie? What is nakedneſſe? What is famine, ſickneſſe, the gout, the ſtone, Feaver, plague? Theſe are the little arrows of Gods juſtice. What is ſhame, diſgrace, croſſes, afflictions, unſeaſonable rains, dangerous weather, wars, rumours of wars? What are all the evils under the Sun? They are the little finger of Gods juſtice. Thou ſpieſt them here and there, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Town, and in every Pariſh, in every Country: do they not all wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that he is a juſt God? Read Pſalm 7. 11, 12, 13. God hath bent his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow already (ſaith David) the arrow is ready to flie out of the ſtring: It wil not be long before it hit thee, if thou meditate not upon amendment: God is angry with the wicked every day, as an angry man uſeth to ſay, I will be revenged on thee. Wilt thou not give over thy ſins? I will be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on thee. Read Pſal. 11. 5, 6, 7. Meditate on this; he will neither ſpare King nor ſubject, nor rich, nor poor, nor noble, nor baſe, nor Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor Juſtices: yet Judges and Juſtices may ſpare, but God will not ſpare: they may be bribed to pardon, but God will not be fee'd to ſpare them that go on in their wickedneſſe; and do I think to eſcape? Nay, my ſoul, thou canſt never eſcape, except thou obeyeſt.</p>
                  <p>The third ground is, Meditate on the wrath of God; O! what wrath is it? Can I ſtand againſt it? It burns like an oven, and all the proud, and all that doe wickedly ſhall be as ſtubble, and the day of wrath ſhall burne them up. Behold this, ſaith the Text, Malac. 4. 1. Behold it, and meditate on it. Can I goe naked in a hot fiery Oven? Can I lift up my hands againſt it? My hands will be ſcorched. Can I kick againſt it? My legs will be baked. Can I blow upon it with my mouth? My mouth is fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Did I ever ſee lime burned? were I in the limes room, could I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that boyling? and yet if I live in my ſinnes, I ſhall be as the burning of lime, I ſay 33. 12. Let thy heart meditate terror: Who among us ſhall be able to dwell (that is the meaning of it, as Montanus ſheweth) who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? who among us ſhall burn with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting burning? verſe 14. Gods mercie ſhall ſay, Take him wrath: I would have converted him, but he would not. Gods goodneſſe ſhall ſay, Take him wrath I would have been kinde unto him, but he hath abuſed me; Gods patience ſhall ſay, Take him wrath: I have ſuffered him a great while, that he might have time of repentance, but he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not in that time. God ſmote Aegypt in their firſt born: Why? For his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44191:32"/>
mercy endureth for ever. God overthrew Pharaoh and his hoaſt: Why? For his mercy endureth for ever. Pſal. 136. 15. He ſmote great Kings, Sihon a King, and Og a King: for his mercy endureth for ever. So will God damn thee that art a drunkard: Why? for his mercy endureth for ever. God will confound thee that art a worlding: Why? for his mercy endureth for ever. God will be revenged on thee that art a Luke-warmling: Why? for his mercy endureth for ever. This may well make thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eare the hair off thy head, rather than let thee go on in thy ſinnes. See Ierem. 7. 29. Meditate on this.</p>
                  <p>The fourth ground: Meditate on the conſtancy of God. As the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> was an enemy to wicked men, ſo he continues the ſame God ſtill, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant enemy to them ſtill. As the Lord would not endure ſinne hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo he is conſtant, he ſtill will not endure it. Did the Lord once ſay, Weep and howl ye drunkards? Joel 1. 5. he is conſtant, ſo he ſaith ſtill. Did the Lord ſay, he would burn up ſabbath-breakers? Jer. 17. 27. he is conſtant; ſo he ſaith ſtill. Who ever hardned his heart againſt the Lord, and proſpered? Job 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>4. as if he ſhould ſay, I put it to thee to meditate of it: canſt thou ſhew me a preſident? did ever any man harden his heart againſt Gods Word, in his ſinne, that proſpered? Did Senacherib pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in his will-worſhip? Did Judas proſper in his covetouſneſſe? Did Jeconiah proſper in his ſtubbornneſſe? Where is the Scribe? Where is the diſputer? Where is he that counted the towers? Your fathers, where are they, ſaith Zachariah? Did not my words take hold of them? and are they not all now in hell, that have ever lived and died in their ſin, from the beginning of the world? Thou canſt not ſhew me one drunkard, or one mocker, or one prophane perſon, or one formall profeſſor, from the day that man was created upon the earth, that is not now in hell, if he be dead. Meditate on this, how canſt thou expect to be the one onely in all the world that ſhall eſcape, if thou liveſt and dyeſt in thy ſins? If hell were opened, and the bottomleſſe pit were lookt into, thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſee every ſoul that ever lived, and died in their ſins, even every ſoul; there is not one ſoul miſſing. Meditate on this; when I dye, do I think I ſhall not be there? nay, I ſhall be there too, unleſſe aforehand I enter in to the ſtrait gate, and walk in the narrow way of newneſſe of life.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow follows the manner, how to follow Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on home to the heart. Here are four things to be practiſed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, weigh and ponder all theſe things in thy heart. It's ſaid of Mary, ſhe pondred, Luke 2. 19. and kept all theſe ſayings in her heart: verſe 51. The words ſignifie two things: Firſt, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared theſe things together, Secondly, ſhe caſt them in the ſcales together. Doſt thou know God is mercifull? ponder it with his juſtice. Doſt thou know that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt dyed for ſinners? ponder it with the true drift of it, how that it is not to let men go on in their ſins, but to ſave them from their ſinnes. Doſt thou obey God in this or that Commandement? O ponder thy life with the reſt, Ponder the path of thy feeet, and let all thy wayes be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Prov. 4. 26. A man that eats his meat well, forty morſels well, yet one crum going awry throttles him. Thou walkeſt in theſe and theſe Commandements; yea, but there be other Commandments beſides theſe: doſt thou walk in them too? thou muſt, if thou meaneſt to have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44191:33"/>
thy ways to be eſtabliſhed. The Jews had their continers, talents, minaes, ſicles, which were greater weights; ſo they had alſo their gerahs, and aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs, ſmaller meaſures, and ſmalleſt of all: ſo have thou greater and leſſe weights; great ones to ponder the great Commandements, and leſs to weigh even the leaſt of Gods Commandements: and ſee thou make true Evangelical weight, or elſe all will not be well. Suppoſe a man were to pay a 100 pound of good and lawful money, and in weight, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forfeiture of all that he hath; if he weigh it not, but the Creditor doth, and finds it light, he is undone. If thou pondereſt not thy wayes, God will ponder them: Prov. 5. 21. the word ſignifies, he weighs and ponders them in a ballance, or ſcales; he puts the word of his Goſpel in the one, and thy goings and obedience in the other. Thou art weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and art found too light, thy kingdom is departed from thee, ſaith God to Belſhazzer, Dan. 5. 27. So if thou be light, thou ſhalt be weighed, and ſo found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou ſhalt loſe the Kingdom of heaven for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſtrip ſin, and look upon it ſtark naked ſin covers and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſeth it ſelf with pleaſure, profit, eaſe, and many a whoriſh garment, and ſo inticeth the heart. Even a toad, if ſhe were covered over with gold, thoſe that ſaw only the gold would pocket it up; if it were naked they would fling it in the kennel. Why doe men love covetouſneſſe? Why? its hooded with profit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why carding, dicing, hunting, hawking, tabring, piping, and more than the word alloweth? Why? they are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with pleaſure, and delight. Its the duty of Miniſters to unmaſk and uncaſe ſin, and pluck off he vail that covers it from appearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men. The not doing of this is the cauſe that men do not meditate on the vileneſſe of their ſin, never are humbled, never eſcape Gods wrath, even becauſe they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Alas the profit of thy ſins ſhall ceaſe the pleaſure ceaſe, the eaſe ceaſe, and all theſe goodly ſuits ſhall vaniſh away; when the ſoul comes to dye, or to ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt: ſin will remain, but thy ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and thy gold; where will that be then? thy laughter, and thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>iment, what will become of that then? thy delight will be gone. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate therefore with thy ſelf, my ſin is now gainful, and eaſie, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what will my ſin become, when I come to lye on my death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what good will it do me, when I have moſt need of ſuccour? I will never acknowledge him my friend, that will turn againſt me, when I have moſt need of him. Alas, I muſt dye, I muſt come to judgement, I, I muſt go either to heaven or to hell: the profit that I get now by my ſins, will it beſtead me then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the pleaſure, the eaſe that I now find in ſin, will it help me there?

                  </p>
                  <p>The third means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dive into thy own ſoul and heart. There is a tough brain over thy heart, that it feels not its ſins. Now Meditation muſt look through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and come to the heart at the quick, and cauſe the truth to dive into the deep places of the ſoul. When the timber is hard, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44191:33"/>
workman cannot thruſt in the nail with the weight of his hand: no, he muſt hammer it in. Meditation is the hammering of the heart. It's a pertinent phraſe, Jer. 23, 24. Is not my word like a fire (ſaith the Lord) and like a hammer that breaketh the rocks in pieces? There be two ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, firſt, of a hammer: the Word of God is the hammer; meditation is the hand that taketh this hammer, and knocks the nail into the rocky heart, and makes it enter: Wilt thou not feel? I'le make thee feel (ſaith Meditation) wilt thou not take notice of thy wretched eſtate? Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation comes with blow after blow, and makes us take notice. Secondly, of fire; the word is like fire; Meditation kindles it about the heart. A man benummed with cold is ſenſeleſſe; the water frozen with cold, though the leaſt pebble would have ſunk in it before, now a great mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is able to lye upon it, and not ſink; the water is able to bear it: ſo is the heart, be it's ſins never ſo heavy, as the hill of Baſan, yet it bears it and feels no weight: but Meditation thawes the heart, and then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin pincheth and oppreſſeth. Is not my word like fire? as if he ſhould ſay, think of it, and muſe of it, and meditate of it, and thou ſhall feel it as a fire. Meditation is the often ſmiting of the heart with this hammer: ſo did Ephraim ſmite upon his thigh, Jer. 31. 19. like a man in a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agony, he thumps his own breaſt, and in a vexation ſtrikes his hand on his thigh. Oh miſerable wretch that I am! So did Ephraim, Oh what an unruly Oxe am I? how unwilling am I to bear the yoke of the Lord? Oh, and oh the hardneſs of my heart! oh that I could tell how to beat thee black and blue! Many men ſmite their hearts, but they ſmite them not often enough. When Eliſhah bad Joaſh ſmite upon the ground, he ſmote thrice, and ſtayed; The man of God ſaid to him in anger, Thou ſhouldeſt have ſmitten five or ſix times, for then thou hadſt ſmitten Syria, till thou hadſt conſumed them, whereas now thou ſhalt ſmite Syria but thrice. 2. King. 13. 19. So men ſmite their hearts twice, or thrice, or ſo; but they will not ſmite their ſins dead: it may be they break the head of their ſins, but they recover again, and grow ſtrong upon them, as at firſt. Thou muſt ſmite five or ſix times, yea fifty times five times, till thou haſt quite broken the impoſtume of thy heart. Meditate on the mercies of God, and with them ſmite it often, and often: Meditate on the juſtice of God, and with it ſmite it again, and again: Meditate on the wrath of God, which is as a conſuming fire, and with it ſmite it ſoundly. Meditate on the truth of the Lord, this threatning and that threatning; this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and that commandment this promiſe and that promiſe; and with all theſe ſmite it to powder.</p>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ventthine own heart: meditate what thy heart will one day wiſh, if it be not humbled: and tell thy Soul as much; thou wilt one day wiſh, Oh that I had been humbled under the reproofs of the Lord! Oh that I had been wiſe to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my own mercy! Curſed be the day that ever I neglected the means of grace; ſo the Lord brings in a fooliſh obſtinate ſinner, curſing and banning his own ſoul, ſobbing and howling at the laſt. O how have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof! and have not obſerved the voyce of my Teachers, nor inclined mine care to them that inſtruct me?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44191:34"/>
Prov. 5. 12, 13. I had Miniſters to preach to me, but I would not come at them: or if I did, I cared not for their doctrine, I had friends that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me well; but woe is me damned wretch! I heeded them not. Thus thou wilt caſt the fool into thine own teeth, and fling a thouſand curſes into thine own face, becauſe of thy madneſs. I might have learned but I would not; I might have been humbled, but I would not: I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in an evill in the midſt of the aſſembly of the congregation, verſe 14. I lived where the Saints of God were in whole aſſemblies, but I mockt them, I hated them, I miſliked them for being too preciſe. I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of my ſecurity, no not in thy ſight. Thus thou wilt cry out one day, if thou wilt not yeeld unto meditation, which muſt make this as preſent with thee. Know thou, O my ſoul, the time of thy viſitation is at hand, thou wilt curſe thy ſelfe hereafter, if thou doſt not now be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Gods mercies, thou ſhalt never ſee mercy more: Now be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by Gods judgments, or elſe thou ſhalt feel them for evermore; now or for ever thou ſhalt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oar for them. Then thou ſhalt curſe thy gains and thy profits that bewitched thee, thou ſhalt curſe thy pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights that beſorted thee, curſe thine one heart, and thine own ſoul, and thine own conſcience that have damned thee. Meditation may tell thee, thus it will be with thee, unleſſe thou obeyeſt now. Hear ye me now, Oh yee Children and depart not from the words of my mouth, verſe 7. hear the word now, and obey it, let it not depart out thy meditation. Now be humbled with grace, or then thou ſhalt be humbled with horrour: then thou ſhalt wiſh, Oh that I had been ruled! When thou art in hell, then thou ſhalt meditate, Oh it was good counſel that ſuch and ſuch a Miniſter gave me; good counſel that ſuch a friend, and ſuch a brother gave me; but wretch that I was, I had not grace to follow it. I had more mind of my pleaſures, more mind of my vanities than of grace. Oh if it were to do again, I would not do ſo for a thouſand worlds: but alas, it is now too late. Therefore let Meditation preſſe this upon thee before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
                  <p>Now follows the third thing, how to put life to Meditation. Four <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> duties are to be done to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Let Meditation haunt the heart, let meditation dog thee with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> helliſh looks of thy ſinnes, and follow it with the dreadful vengeance of God, haunt it with promiſes, haunt it with threatnings, haunt it with mercies, and haunt it with judgements, and haunt it with Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, The heart is like the Beaver, when it perceiveth it cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly eſcape from the Huntſman, it cuts off the Member for which it is hunted, and flings it down, and ſo eſcapes (ſaith Aeſop:) So purſue thy heart with its ſins, with the hue and cry of Gods mercies; purſue it with the bubbub of Gods judgements; let meditation haunt it, and let thy ſoul ſee it ſhall never be rid of the haunt; at laſt it will be content to part with its luſts. Let Meditation ſay, Wilt thou forſake thine own mercies? If thou liveſt thus and thus, If thou prayeſt thus and thus, dead-heartedly, thou kickeſt againſt thine own mercy, wilt thou ruſh upon the prick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. This mercy thou mayſt have, if thou wouldſt amend, that vengeance thou ſhalt have, if thou do not amend: Either cut off thy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44191:34"/>
ſins, or elſe God will cut off thy ſoul. Return, O Shulamite, return, return, its the voice of Chriſt to thee: Let Meditation ſay, Return, O my ſoul, return, return, and thou mayſt be ſaved; return, or elſe thou ſhalt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Now what was the effect of this haunting meditation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or ere I was aware, my ſoul made me like the Chariots of Aminadab. verſe 12. That is, my ſoul muſing and meditating on theſe and theſe commandments, it ſo humbled my ſoul, that it made me yeeld; yea, and made me run as faſt as the Chariots of Aminadab, freely and willingly to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Deal with thy heart as Iunius his father dealt with him: he ſeeing his Son was Atheiſtical, he laid a Bible in every room, that his ſon could look in no room, but behold a Bible haunted him, upbraiding him, Wilt thou not read me, Atheiſt? Wilt thou not read me? And ſo at laſt he read it, and was converted from his Atheiſme: So let meditation haunt thy heart, hold forth the commandements, promiſes, threatnings of the Lord, that thy heart may ſee them; let meditation haunt thee in thy luke-warmneſſe: prayeſt thou thus luke-warm? This prayer will break thy neck one day. Repenteſt thou? This luke warm repentance will cauſe God to ſpue thee out of his mouth. Heareſt thou, ſpeakeſt thou, thinkeſt thou? Theſe lukewarm duties wil confound thee ere long, if thou lookeſt not to it.</p>
                  <p>Let meditations haunt thee, as they haunted Nehemiah with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, ten times (ſaith the Text) they ſent to Nehemiah, they will be upon thee, Nehem. 4. 12. Beware of the danger, the enemy will be upon thee: ten times they warned him, never giving over till Nehemiah looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, verſe 13. So do thou haunt thine own heart: they will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, this curſe, this wrath, that hardneſſe of heart, this ſecurity wil be upon thee. Ten times, yea, a thouſand times ten times, never give over thine own ſoul, untill thou haſt made it to ſubmit. Indeed there be ſome, let God ſend Meditations to haunt them, and follow them, ſaying, Repent, leave this or that ſin? why wilt thou be damn'd with this ſin? Oh forſake it, preſently they will gagge the mouth of meditation, and of conſcience, and ſtrike them ſtark dead: as Abner, when Azahel would haunt him and follow him, and turn neither to the right hand, nor to the left, but follow him at the heels. Turn aſide (ſaith Abner) but he would not turn aſide from following him. Turn aſide from me (ſayes Abner again) or I will kill thee, but he would not turn aſide, he would follow him cloſe: Then he up with his Spear and ſlew him, 2. Sam. 2. 19. 20, 21, 22, 23. So many deal with the Meditation of conſcience, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would dogg them, and weary them out of their ſins, they will not, when conſcience would haunt them, they will not be haunted therewith; when conſcience would follow them up with their deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wilfulneſſe, they gall, and wound, and murder conſcience to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. But David haunted his heart, and would have it haunted.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond duty: Let Meditation trace thy heart, as it ſhould haunt thee, ſo alſo let it trace thee in the ſame ſteps. So would the Church, Let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turn again unto the Lord: Lam. 3. 40. The word (in the originall, ſayes Buxtorf) ſignifies, track her ſteps, ſtep by ſtep:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44191:35"/>
this ſtep was in the ditch, that in the mire, that ſtep awry: track them all, that we may undergo them all again, and turn unto the Lord. Never pray but let Meditation track thy prayer: this paſſage was right, that paſſage was amis. Never keep a Sabbath but let Meditation track thy keeping of it; this duty was ſincere, that was rotten: Never do any thing, but let Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation track it. This thought, this word, this action was warrantable; that was out of the way: track thy heart, as the Lord tracked Eliah, he trackt him in the wilderneſſe, he trackt him under the juniper tree, he trackt him in the cave; What doſt thou here Eliah? go forth: 1. Kings 19. What doſt thou here Eliah, go, return. He tract him in the Mount, Go, return, what doſt thou here Eliah? this is not a place for thee. So let Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wait thee; what doſt thou here, O ſinner? what doſt thou here, drunkard? in thy Cupps, or in thy prophaneneſſe, what doſt thou here? this is not a place for thee, unleſſe thou mean to periſh. It may be thou art now ſcar'd out of theſe ſins, and art run into civil honesty, let Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſtill track thee. What doſt thou do here, O ſinner? Civilitie is not a caſe fit for thee, unleſſe thou wert better, thou ſhalt be torn in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It may be thou art driven out of thy civility; and art gone further, to the profeſſion of Religion, though it be without the power of it; let meditation ſtill wait thee. What doſt thou do here, O ſinner? this ſorry kind of profeſſion is not a race fit for thee: unleſſe thou be godlier than ſo, thou ſhalt be devoured with everlaſting fire.</p>
                  <p>Meditation is like the courſing of a Hare in the ſnow; the Hare fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be taken by the dogs, Here ſhe ſtops, there ſhe leaps, here ſhe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaps, there ſhe goes backward, and forward, upward and downward, and all to deceive the dogs, that they may not find her; but they goe, ſmelling, winding and turning, and track her ſtep by ſtep, till they find her: ſo meditation is the courſing of the ſoul, the heart hath a thouſand fetches, a thouſand Meanders and labyrinths, a thouſand croſſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and compaſſings, and deceits, and all to puzle Meditation. But Meditation muſt track the heart, as God dealt with Job, he counted his ſteps, ſtep by ſtep, Iob 14. 16. Meditation is the ſouls bloud-hound, it will never leave howling the wrath of God; till he hath taken the hearts ſin for a prey, Meditation haunts it out of one ſin, and it runs into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Meditation haunts it out of that, and it runnes into a third: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is a good purſevant, it proſecutes the ſinner, and attaches him.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the heart is moſt cunning, and hardeſt to be trackt by its ſent, when the heart hath taken up abundance of good duties, and attained unto ſundry graces, theſe good duties and common graces drown the ſent of the hearts wickedneſſe. As Huntſmen obſerve, that the hounds cannot well hunt in the Spring, as Theophraſtus, and Pollux, and others obſerve: the ſweet odors of the flowers and herbs (ſayes Oppian) hinder the hounds from ſmelling the hare: ſo it is with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; it is hard for it to track the heart in the green Spring-time of civill honeſty and formality. And therefore let Meditation make deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch, ſaith he.</p>
                  <p>The third duty: hale thy heart before God, and let Meditation bring it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44191:35"/>
before his throne, and there powre out thy complaint againſt it before God, out with all thy villany there, and article againſt thy ſelf, and bring as many complaints againſt thy ſelf before heaven, as there be drops in a bucket full of water. So doe the godly: I powred out all my complaints before him (Pſal. 102. in the preface) I powred out my complaints as a man powreth out water out of a veſſel; generally men are willing to call for mercy, but they are not ſo willing to bring complaints unto God againſt themſelves: ye ſhall have them whiſper after the Miniſter, as he is begging for pardon and mercy, but they will not do ſo, whiles he is complaining of their ſins, the helliſh and develiſh abominations of their heart. Theſe are men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith, and ſhall never have mercy, till they be as forward to complain of their ſins, as to be plaintiffs for mercy.</p>
                  <p>When a man in Meditation meets with a hard matter, that he cannot ſufficiently dive into, he breaks it to another: ſo do thou to God; break all thy heart to God, tell him of thy hardneſſe of heart, of the pride of thy heart, of the deſperate prophaneneſſe of thy heart: but take theſe rules with thee;</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, thy complaint muſt be full of ſorrow. Pſal. 55.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it muſt be a full complaint of all thy ſins, and of all thy luſts; Lam. 2. 18, 19. Poure aut thy heart like water before the face of the Lord. Water runs all out of a veſſel, when you turn the mouth downward; never a ſpoonfull will ſtay behind. The wicked, will not complain of their ſins fully: they make hypocriticall profeſſions. If it be a ſin, I am ſorry for it; (ſays one) if it be naught, I cry God mercy; (ſaith another) when their own conſciences tell them it is is a ſin, yet they will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it abſolutely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, thy complaint muſt be with aggravation: thou muſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate thy ſins by all the circumſtances, that may ſhew it to be odious, as Peter did: When he thought thereon, he wept, Mark 14. 72. the Originall hath it, he caſt all theſe things one upon another. Wretch that I was, Chriſt was my maſter, and yet I denyed him; ſuch a good maſter, that he called me before any of my fellow-Apoſtles, and yet I denyed him; I was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſink once, he denyed not me: I was to be damned once, he denyed not my ſoul, and yet I denyed him; he told me of this ſin before-hand, that I might take heed of it, and yet I denyed him. I ſaid, I will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, nor forfake him, and yet I denyed him: yea, this very night, no longer ago, did I ſay and ſay again, I would not deny him, and yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him; yea, I ſaid, though all others denyed him, yet would not I; and yet worſe than all others, I denyed him with a witneſs before a maid, before a damſel; nay, more filthy beaſt that I am, I ſaid I did not know the man; nay more, I ſware I did not know him; nay more than all this, I did even curſe my ſelfe with an oath, that I did not know him: nay more, all this evill did I, not above five or ſix ſtrides from my Lord and Saviour: nay more, even then, when if ever I ſhould have ſtood for him, I ſhould have done it then, when all the world did forſake him. O wretch that I was, I denyed him! he caſt up all theſe circumſtances together, and meditating on them, he went out, land wept bitterly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:44191:36"/>Fourthly, thy complaint muſt be a ſelfe-condemning complaint: thou muſt condemn thy ſelf, and lay thy ſelfe at Hell gates, and ſet the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked point of Gods vengeance at thy throat. Thus and thus have I lived, damned, caſt-away, as I have deſerved to be! So did Ezra in the behalfe of the Jews, Ezra 9.</p>
                  <p>For 1. He fell on his face; he did not bow down on his knees; but like a man aſtoniſhed, he fell on his knees, ready to fall on the ground in amazement.</p>
                  <p>2. He ſpread out his hand unto the Lord, verse 5. as if he ſhould ſay, here is my heart-blood, Lord here is my breaſt, Lord we deſerve thou ſhouldſt ſtab us with thy wrath.</p>
                  <p>3. He bluſhes to looke Heaven in the face, verſe 6. ſo vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think on the ſins of his people, that he is even confounded to beg mercy.</p>
                  <p>4. He is (as it were) dumb and ſpeechleſſe before God: And now our God, what ſhall we ſay after all this? for we haue forſaken thy commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, verſe 10. Shall I excuſe the matter? alas! it is inexcuſable. What ſhall we ſay after all this? Shall we call for thy patience? Wee had it, and yet were little the better. Shall we call for mercy, Why? we had it, and yet our ſtubborn hearts would not come down; I know not what to ſay for our ſelves: for we have ſinned againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>5. He declares Gods truth, that he had warned them by his Prophets, (verſ. 11, 12.) but no warning can better us.</p>
                  <p>6. He ſhews how God had puniſhed them, yet they would not be humbled: for all that God had brought upon them leſſe evils than they deſerved, and wrought deliverance for them, wich they could not have expected; What ſhall we ſay, ſhould we for all this break thy commandements? verſe 13, 14. What can we expect but hell and confuſion?</p>
                  <p>7. He is ſenſible of Gods Judgements and righteouſneſſe: O Lord thou art righteous: as if he ſhould ſay, How canſt thou ſpare us for this ſinne? How can it ſtand with thy righteouſneſſe? How is it that ſuch hell-hounds as we are, ſhould live above ground, when thou art ſo righteous a God? It is a wonder that the earth opens not her mouth for to ſwallow us up quick: for, O Lord thou art righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
                  <p>8. He layes down his ſoul, and all the peoples ſouls at Gods feet; as if he ſhould ſay, here we be, thou maiſt damn us if thou wilt; Behold we are all here before thee in our treſpaſſes: for we cannot ſtand before thee, becauſe of this, verſe 15. Behold here are we: rebels we are: here are our heads, and our throats before thee, if now thou ſhouldſt take us from our knees unto hell, and from our prayers unto damnation, we cannot ask thee, why thou doeſt ſo: Oh it's mercy, it's mercy indeed, that we have been ſpared. Thus Meditation muſt bring our hearts before God, and there complain againſt them before heaven.</p>
                  <p>Meditation ſhould deal with the heart, as the Father did with his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed child, who carried him to Chriſt; ſaying, Maſter my child is poſſeſſed</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a good Engliſh Proverb among us, that he that neglects the occaſion, the occaſion will neglect him. Solomon wiſely begins his Proverbs with it: for he bringeth in the wiſdome of his Father in theſe five particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, making a generall Proclamation in the 20. verſe, Wiſdome crieth without, ſhe uttereth her voice in the ſtreets. He compareth God unto a Cryer going up and down the City from ſtreet to ſtreet, and from door to door, crying his commodity, even the richeſt that ever was, which is a Chriſt, a Chriſt for redemption, a Chriſt for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, a Chriſt to enlighten thoſe that walk in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death. Ho, every one that thirsteth, here is a Chriſt for you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, here is a mercifull reprehenſion, in the 22 verſe, O ye fooliſh, how long will ye love fooliſhneſſe, and ye ſcorners take pleaſure in ſcorning? Fooliſh indeed to be without Chriſt: fooliſh to be without grace, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44191:38"/>
to chafer away our ſouls for ſin, How long ye ſcorners, will ye take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſcorning? will you ſtill perſiſt in your wickedneſſe, and never have done with your ſins? will you never turn back again, but damn your ſouls for ever? O ye fooliſh, how long will ye love fooliſhneſſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, here is a gracious exhortation in the 23. verſe: turn you at my correction, lo, I will pour out my mind unto you, and make you to underſtand my words. As if he ſhould ſay, Do you not ſee how you are going a pace to confuſion; and that the way you take, leadeth unto deſtruction? turn ye therefore, turn ye back again, for there is a Chriſt behind you: O turn ye; for if ye go on in your ſins, you periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, here is a yearning promiſe made unto the world, in the end of the 23. verſe, Lo, I will pour out my ſpirit unto you, and cauſe you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my words. As if he ſhould ſay, Return back again with me, and you ſhall have better welcome than you can poſſibly have if you go on in your ſins: the Devil will never let you gain ſo much by your living in your luſts, as you ſhall do by repentance for them, and forſaking of them. For behold, I will prour out my ſpirit upon you, whereby you ſhall be farr greater gainers than you ſhall be by your ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, here is a gratious threatning againſt the world, even all thoſe that have loytered out the day of grace. As time and tyde will ſtay for no man, no more doth the day of grace: Becauſe I have called, and you refuſed; I have exhorted, but you have not regarded; I have denounced judgements againſt you for your ſins, but you have hardened your hearts; now a day of woe and miſery ſhall come upon you, a time of vengeance and deſolation ſhall over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>take you; there will a day come wherein there will be weeping, and crying, Mercy (Lord) mercy; but I tell you beforehand what you ſhall truſt to: let this be your leſſon, now I call, and you will not hear; now I ſtretch out my hands, but you will not regard: you ſhall ſeek me early, but you ſhall not find me: and ſhall cry, but you ſhall not be heard.</p>
                  <p>The words are underclapt againſt all thoſe that procraſtinate their repentance, and returning home unto God, wherein note, firſt, the parties them ſelves that do prolong this day of grace, they: that is, they who when God cals on them, will not hear; when God invites them by his mercies, patience, and forbearance, by his Miniſters and ſervants, by his corrections and judgement, by all fair means and foul means; yet withſtand the means of grace, they are the men, they ſhall call, but God will not anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, here is their ſeeking after God? they ſhall call upon me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, here is their earneſt and diligent ſeeking after God; they ſhall not only call, but ſeek too, and not only ſeek, but ſeek as to labour to find: nay they ſhall ſeek me early: even ſtrive to go about it with all haſte, and flye to repentance, but they ſhall not find me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, here is the unſeaſonableneſſe of the time of their ſeeking, then: that is a demonſtrative, then; even a time which the Lord appoints at: as if he ſhould ſay, you ſhall ſee then theſe men will be of another
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44191:38"/>
mind, then they ſhall be glad to be converted, then they ſhall be glad to come out of their ſins, then they ſhall be glad to get grace, and ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God: but alas! they ſaw not this then, but God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw it well enough; then ſhall they call, but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, here is the fruſtration of their hope, which hath two things in it. Firſt in regard of themſelves, in regard of the flaw in their ſeeking, it being not aright. Secondly, in regard of the Juſtice of God, who rewards every man according to their works, But I will not hear them. Whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this point of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that will not hear when he calleth them; God will not hear them, when they call unto him. Thoſe that will not hear the Lord when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon them by the miniſtery of his Word, and voyce of his Spirit, the Lord will not hear them, when in their miſery they call upon him.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord dealt with the people in Ezekiels dayes; the Lord called them to repentance and obedience: but when they ſtood out; and neglected the opportunity of grace, and ſeaſons of converſion, ſee how God deals with them: though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them (ſaith the Lord.) When men have gone beyond the time of Gods mercy, and out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>rowed the tyde of Gods forbearance, and will not returne, the Lord ſets it down with himſelfe, that his wrath ſhall return upon them, he will no longer forbear they had a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord did pity them, and offered grace, and mercy unto them, but they neglecting this ſeaſon, and withſtanding this proffer of grace; God reſolves with himſelfe they ſhall never have it again. There was a time wherein God did pity them, but now he will not pity them any more; twenty five years he called unto them, and ſought to bring them home; but becauſe they ſtood out and refuſed, the Lord ſaith, I will love Ephraim no more.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, there is a double day, a white day, and a black day; there is a day of ſalvation; Iſa. 49. 9. this is the day in the which the Lord ſaid to the priſoners, Come forth: and to thoſe that lye in their ſins, repent and beleeve. Now if any man will come forth and humble his ſoul before the Lord, let him come and welcome, for it is a day of ſalvation. But there is another day of damnation, which is a dark day, a black and a duskie day, wherein the Lord will viſit the ſinnes of the world, and revenge the quarrell of his Covenant. Hoſ. 9. 7. The day of viſitation is come, yea the day of recompence; the people ſhall know it; the Prophet is a fool, and the ſpirituall man is mad. Beloved, we are fools, and all the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men under heaven are mad, that lay not this day to heart. For the day of the Lord is a day of viſitation, and all the world ſhall rue it, though now men ſleep in ſecuritie. If once mercie be rejected, and God turn away his ear from a man, then grace ſhall be no more, the door of life ſhall for ever be ſhut up againſt him: and when once this day comes, he hath loſt his own place, and deprived himſelfe of eternall happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now there are three reaſons of this point, the firſt is the law of retaliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44191:39"/>
of rendring like for like, which is the juſteſt law that can be made with man, for to give unto every man according to his works, to make him take ſuch as he brings (as the Heathen calls it) to give a man quid for qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Now if God call upon thee, and thou wilt not hear; it is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe with God, yea equity with God (that is more) that when thou calleſt on him, he ſhould not hear thee. For thus runs the tenor of Gods Word, Prov. 28. 9. He that turns away his ear from hearing the Law, euen his prayers ſhallbe abominable. He that turns away his ear from Gods Law, God will turn away his eare from his prayer. He that turns, it is ſpoken in the preſent tenſe, that is, he that now turns away his ear, his prayer ſhall be abominable (in the future tenſe) that is, the Lord marks what maſter or ſervant, what father or mother, what husband or wife, what man or woman it is, that turns away the ear of his head or the ear of his heart, from hearing his will, and obeying of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, the Lord takes ſpeciall notice of it, and ſets it down in his Calendar, and records it in his Memoriall; keeping a ſtrict account thereof: as if God ſhould ſay, Well, is it ſo: I now call, and will not this man or that woman anſwer? Do I now ſtretch out my hands; and will not they take care to obey me? Well, let them alone (ſaith God) there is a day coming, that I ſhall be a hearing of them, times of ſorrow and miſery will take hold of them, and then they in their affliction will cry unto me, but I will not hear; they will beg for mercy, but I will not regard: they will ſeek me early, but they ſhall not finde me.</p>
                  <p>It was one of the Articles of high Treaſon brought in againſt Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Woolſey, that he had the pox, and a ſtinking breath, and yet durſt come into the Kings preſence: So it ſhall be an Article againſt thee of high treaſon before the King of heaven, if thou come into his preſence with the ſtinking breath of thy ſins, living in thy luſts and wallowing in thy filthineſſe, all thy prayers are but as ſo many ſtinking breaths in the noſtrils of the Lord; and every dutie that thou performeſt unto the Lord, ſhall be as ſo many Articles of high treaſon againſt thee, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee, becauſe thou liveſt in rebellion, and a Traitor againſt God.</p>
                  <p>His prayer ſhall be abominable: he doth not ſay, I will turn away mine ear from hearing his prayer, which turns away his ear from hearing my law (that is the true expoſition of the words) no, but, like for like is ſometimes injuſtice: for if a man ſhould ſtrike a Magiſtrate a box on the ear, it were not juſtice for him to give him another: for, it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin to ſtrike a Magiſtrate than any other common perſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a greater puniſhment the Law requireth: So God doth not ſay, he will turn away his ear from hearing his prayer, but will ſerve him in a worſe kind, he will count it abominable, yea abomination, (in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract) it ſhall be loathſome, yea lothſomneſſe it ſelfe in the worſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle in the cloſure of this Chapter, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out unto us a two-fold kind of life: Firſt, the life of the Godly, and that 1. by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, verſe 17. Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk ſo as you have us for an example: 2. By way of declaration, verſe 20. But our converſation is in heaven, whence alſo we look for the Saviour, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Then ſecondly he ſets forth unto us the life of the wicked, which walked otherwiſe than the Diſciples and Apoſtles of Chriſt walked, in theſe words read unto you. The Apoſtle warned thoſe wicked men again and again; but they would not take warning, neither did they think themſelves ſo bad as he made them, and therefore they thought they ſhould ſpeed well enough; he preached to them in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44191:41"/>
the Pulpit, and wrote unto them, though he were ſix hundred miles and more diſtant from them (and that weeping too) that they were enemies to the Croſse of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, who mind earthly things.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words may be conſtrued two waies; either as being meant, 1. Of ſeverall wicked men, as firſt of Heterodox walkers, ſuch as walk contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Apoſtles: or, 2. Of wicked perſecutors of the Goſpel, enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt: 3. Of Drunkards and Hypocrites, whoſe God is their belly; 4. Of Ambitious and proud perſons, whoſe glory is their ſhame: and 5. Of covetous and carnal-minded men, who mind earthly things: or as Chryſoſtom expounds the words (and ſo it ſeems is the meaning of them) to be meant of one ſort of men, who mind earthly things, they are ſuch as walk otherwiſe than the Apoſtle walked. Who are they that mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things? they are enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt: Who are they that mind earthly things? Whoſe hearts and affections run more after the things of this life, than after the croſſe of Chriſt; Their God is their belly. Who are they that mind earthly things, and think only how to increaſe their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and enlarge their eſtate, and make them ſure unto themſelves? their glory is their ſhame. Who are they that mind earthly things? that give their hearts (the flower of man) and their affections (the flower of their Souls) unto the world, and unto the baſe things of the world, ſtill they are they that mind earthly things, which ſet either their loving thoughts, or their raking and caring thoughts, or their fretting and vexing thoughts, or the eager, covetous and vain thoughts on earthly things, they are they that walk otherwiſe than the Apoſtles of Chriſt walked; Theſe are are thoſe that are enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind earthly things, whoſe end is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Hence then will we obſerve this point;</p>
                  <p>That thoſe whoſe minds and hearts run habitually on earth, and earthly things, their end muſt needs be deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Jeremiah 9. 19. Hear O earth (ſaith God) behold I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, becauſe they have not hearkned unto me, but rejected my Law. Wherein we may ſee three things, 1. That the curſe of God is the deſert of curſed evil and vain thoughts: 2. That the plague and curſe of God is the event of evil and vain thoughts; evil thoughts do not not only deſerve Gods plagues, but alſo bring them: 3. Here is notice given to all the world; Hear, O earth: as if he had ſaid, here is a reckoning that you little dream of, I will bring a plague upon you, not only for your idolatry, for your whoredom and fornication, but even for your vain thoughts, Prov. 24. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The thoughts of the wicked are ſin; The Lord doth not only condemn the actions and courſes of of wicked men, but ſets his curſe upon their very thoughts. Sin is of an homogeneal nature, of which every part of a thing is the whole; every piece of a ſtone is ſtone, for it hath the nature of the whole: even ſo it is with ſin, the leaſt part of ſin, the leaſt thought of ſin, the leaſt ſhiver of ſin, is ſin, and abominable before God.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons why thoſe whoſe hearts and thoughts run habitually on<note place="margin">Reaſon. 1.</note>
                     <pb facs="tcp:44191:41"/>
earth and earthly things, muſt needs end in deſtruction, are 1. That mans end muſt needs end deſtruction, that never repents: Now, ſo long as a mans thoughts run uſually and habitually on the things of the world, that man never repents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> repentance not only cleanſeth the out-ſide of man, but the inſide alſo, even the heart; repentance goeth as far as the Law of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: where the word of God begins, there repentance muſt noeds begin; now the word of God begins and ſtrikes at the heart, as ſaith the Apoſtle, The Word of God is ſharp &amp; powerful, ſharper than any two edged ſword, peircing to the dividing aſunder of the ſoul and Spirit, the joynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts of the heart, Heb. 4. 12. Now then, if the word of God ſtrike at the thoughts of the heart, then repentance muſt go and teach ſo farr to reform and amend the things of the heart, or elſe he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repents. Let a man ſweep his houſe never ſo much, yet it is not clean ſo long as there remains one Cob-web in it: ſo if thy heart be ſwept from drunkenneſſe, whoring, and ſwearing, and yet if the old Cob-web of vain thoughts remain in any corner of thy heart, not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out, nor ſwept down, thou haſt not as yet repented Oh Jeruſalem (faith God to his Prophet) waſh thy heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved: how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? Jer. 4. 14. Mark how the Lord inforceth his exhortation: ſee how he backs his counſell [that thou maieſt be ſaved:] as if he had ſaid, thou canſt not be ſaved, unles thou waſh thy heart from vain thoughts: how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? He doth not ſay, why do vain thoughts come into thee? for they will come into the beſt and moſt holy heart; but how long ſhall they lodge within thee? If vain thoughts do lodge in man, and take up their neſt in his heart, if a man let his thoughts dwel upon vain things, and he give away unto them, and uſe them as his market, trade and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, he cannot be ſaved; it is an emphaticall kind of ſpeech: as if the Lord ſhould ſay. O Jeruſalem, thou never conſidereſt this, and thus he doth as it were pitty and compaſſionate them in their blindneſſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and horrrible befottedneſſe, that think that thought is free. Beloved, when the Lord comes to reckon with the world, he will not only reckonwith them for their pounds and ſhillings, for their hundreds and thouſands of ſins; for their murders, whore domes, blaſphemies, &amp;c. but he will call them to an accompt for their leaſt ſins, the pence and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſins, even their very thoughts: agree with thine adverſary quickly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while thou art in the way, leſt he deliver thee up to the Jayler, and thou be cast into priſon: thou ſhalt not come out untill thou hast paid the utmoſt farthing; thou muſt deliver up thy farthing as well as thy pound ſins, or elſe thou never agreeſt with thine adverſary. When the Lord by his prophet calls upon his people, exhorting them to repentance, he willeth and exhorteth them to change their thoughts, Iſa. 55. 7.

                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:44191:42"/>The ſecond reaſon is, that mans end muſt needs be deſtruction that hath no Chriſt in the world: now ſo long as thy thoughts run habitually on earthly things, thou haſt no Chriſt. It is not enough for a man to hang on Chriſt, for many a man doth ſo, and yet is cut off from Chriſt, and periſheth for ever: thou muſt not onely hang upon Chriſt, but thou muſt alſo get into Chriſt. As in the old world, when the deluge came, and the waters increaſed ſo greatly, that the mountains and high hills were covered with them, and the people could not ſave themſelves by getting unto the tops of the mountains, no queſtion but many ſeeing the Ark ſwim above the water, did climb up and hang upon the ſides of the Ark, thinking to ſave themſelves, yet none of them were ſaved, but thoſe that were gotten into the Ark: ſo, many a man will catch hold of Chriſt, but his hold will be gone, and he periſh for ever, unleſſe he get into Chriſt. Now a man can never get into Chriſt, unleſſe his heart be purged from vain thoughts, For Chriſt when he entreth into a man, cleanſeth his heart from vain thoughts, 2 Cor. 10. 5 If Chriſt once come into the heart, he will ſet up his throne there: he will hold his Scepter of Righteouſneſſe in it: when Chriſt cometh, ſee what a work he will make in the heart, he will not ſuffer a proud thought to remain there to upbraid him; but he will caſt down every imagination, and all high things that exalt themſelves, and he will bring every thought into ſubjection unto himſelf. Therefore if thy thoughts run after the luſts of thy own heart, thou hadſt no Chriſt in thee: for Chriſt (beloved) will never dwell in a foul houſe: I know there is no wheat without ſome darnell, no gold without ſome droſſe, no wine without ſome lees; ſo there is no man but hath ſome ſin; no man ſo clean, but hath ſome defilements of ſinne upon him; yet if a man have not this cleanſing grace of Chriſt in him, cleanſing the heart from vain things, there is no Chriſt in him: for Chriſt wil never dwel in a foul heart. Now beloved, the very vain thoughts of a man defile him: as Chriſt faith, Mat. 7. 21. 22. 23. Out of the heart proceedeth evill thoughts, and they are they that defile a man. Alltheſe, not only murder and adulteries, and uncleaneſs, and all other abominable ſins, which mens conſciences ſtartle at, but evill thoughts defile a man: Aſſure thy ſelf, that ſo long as the league of theſe evill thoughts is not broken, thou haſt no Chriſt as yet, within thee. Hence is that exhortation of the Apoſtle, Col. 3. 12. If you be riſen with Chriſt, then ſeek thoſe things that are above.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, you muſt remember that there be two kinds of exhortations, in the Scripture: the one, if a man do them, bleſſed and happy is he: the other, if he do them not, yet he may find mercy; it wil be a grief and a ſorrow to him, but it follows not that he ſhall miſcarry. But there are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that tie to obedience, that muſt be obeyed, or elſe there is no ſalvation; as this exhortation of the Apoſtle, it is not left to our choice to do, or not to do, but if a man be riſen of Chriſt he muſt do it: he muſt ſeek the things that are above: that man, then, that hath his thoughts run habitually on the world, that man hath no Chriſt in him, and therefore his end muſt needs be deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that mans end muſt needs be deſtruction that loves not God; now ſo long as thy thoughts run habitually on the things of the world,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44191:42"/>
thou haſt no true love of God in thee. For thus runs the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of love, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might, Matth. 22. 37. It is as if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, thou ſhalt love God, with all thy heart, and with all thy heart, and with all thy heart: for the ſoul, mind; and heart, are all one; that no man might dare to keep any part of their heart from God. Every one will ſay, I love God with all my heart, I go to Church and ſerve God with all my heart; I hear the Word and pray with all my heart, I receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raments with all my heart: Doſt thou ſo? and yet let thy thoughts run upon the world? doſt thou pray, and yet let vain thoughts lodge with in thee? doſt thou hear the Word, receive the Sacraments, and yet letreſt vaine thoughts diſtract thee? Doſt thou walk in thy calling, and yet let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt vain thoughts ſteal away thy heart, and yet ſayeſt thou, I love God with all my heart, when thou takeſt away thy heart from God? How doſt thou think thy thoughts? with thy heels, or with thy heart? Surely thou ſayeſt, with thy heart: Why then if thou loveſt God with all thy heart, thou muſt give thy thoughts unto God; God that cals for thy heart, cals for all thy heart: now the heart is nothing but all a mans heart; all the affections and deſires, all turnings and windings, all thoughts that are in the heart do but make up the heart: and therefore when God calls for thy heart, he calls for all the powers and faculties of the ſoul. And therefore, the Prophet David would bleſſe God with his ſoul and all that was within him. Pſal. 103. So thou muſt give thy thoughts, and all that is within thee to God, or elſe thou giveſt God nothing; therefore that mans end muſt needs be deſtruction that loves not God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that mans end muſt needs be deſtruction, that never gives over his ſinne: and ſo long as thy thoughts run after the world; thou canſt never forſake ſin: thou maiſt reſolve and think on the contrary, yet ſo long as thy thoughts run habitually on the things of the world, thou doſt not forſake ſin. Wicked and carnall men may have the eyes of their conſciences opened, and their hearts awakened, whereby they may ſee their ſins, and the helliſh evill and danger of them: whereupon they may reſolve and purpoſe to forſake them, and then they will make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God that they will not do thus and thus; I have been tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and cholerick, but I will be ſo no more; I have been a prophane ſwearer and blaſphemer of the name of God, but I will be ſo no more; I have been a drunkard, and an unclean perſon, but Lord thou ſhalt ſee a reformation in me. Nay it may be he will tell his miniſter of it, and his father and his mother, his wife, his children, and all his friends too of it: but when he comes to his cold blood again, and theſe cold graces which flattered ſo, come to be cold in him, ſo that his heart comes to it ſelfe again, then vain thoughts reſt in his heart, and he returns to his old ſins again, as the dog to his vomit, and the ſow being waſhed, to the wallowing in the mire.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle excellently deſcribes a man that can never depart from his ſins: They have eyes full of adultery, which cannot ceaſe from ſin: 2. Pet. 2. 14. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks not only of that adultery which is a breach of the ſeventh Commandement: but of ſuch an adultery which is a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44191:43"/>
perfect breach of every commandement, when the heart runneth a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after every ſin and vanitie: when the eye of the ſoul is full of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, the heart cannot ceaſe from ſin; when the eye cannot ſee an object of gain or profit, but the mind is preſently engaged and runs after it, when it cannot ſee an object of delight and pleaſure, but it is ſtraightway caught by it: when he cannot ſee any wrong or injury done unto him, but preſently he is inflamed with revenge, and his heart runs after it: I ſay, that if thy eye be thus full of adulterie that thou canſt not ſee the occaſions, and hints of ſin, but preſently thou art inſnared; and thy ſoul is taken by it; thou art the man that canſt not ceaſe to ſin: therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou turn the eye of thy ſoul, which is the thoughts and affections of thy heart, another way, thou wilt never ceaſe to ſin. For whereſoever thou lookeſt, thou wilt be inſnared, ſo long as thy thoughts are evil and vitious; either upon pride, or covetouſneſſe, or ambition, or envy, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; thy ſoul will look aſquint on God: and untill theſe vain thoughts of thine be crucified, thou wilt only look upon the ſatisfying of theſe vain luſts of thine.</p>
                  <p>Prov. 3. 6. In all thy way wayes acknowledge God, and he ſhall direct thy paths. In all thy waies think on God, or elſe thou maieſt go to many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Religion, but never be direct in thy going; thou maieſt pray a thouſand times, but never be eſtabliſhed in thy prayer: thou mayeſt go from Lecture to Lecture, and yet never be eſtabliſhed in thy ſervice: thou mayeſt go about many things, and never be eſtabliſhed in any thing, unleſſe God be in all thy thoughts: a man may go on in a courſe of Religion, but it is a hap hazard he is inconſtant, and unſteady in his his courſe, unleſſe in his heart he think upon God, and therefore his end muſt needs be deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>This then may ſerve, firſt, for humiliation to the godly: ſecondly, for matter of condemnation to the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for humiliation; Are vain thoughts thus damnable, that when they bear ſway in the heart, they make that mans end to be deſtruction? How then ought this to fill the faces of them that have the Spirit of Chriſt, with ſhame and confuſion, and to make them in a holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be confounded in themſelves, and to think of the emptineſſe, naughtineſſe, and vanities of their hearts? Beloved, thou canſt not go to prayers, but abundance of vain thoughts will be about thee, like waſps to aſſault thee; thou canſt not go to the Word, but theſe vain thoughts will be a humming in thy ears; thou canſt not go about the works of thy calling; but vain thoughts will haunt thee, and creep into thy meditations, and take away the main burthen of the work all the day long. Beloved, this ſhould make a godly man aſhamed, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in himſelf, in the conſideration hereof. The Prophet David was ſo confounded and aſhamed hereat, that had not God poured in mercy and comfort into his ſoul, he had been diſtracted, and ſhould have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, conſidering the company of vain thoughts that lodged within him, Pſal. 94. 19. where he ſhews what abundance of diſtracting thoughts he had; that if God had not ſuſtained him with comfort after comfort, he had been overwhelmed in deſpair by them.</p>

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:44191:43"/>Auguſtine ſaith, a mans thoughts are not in his own power: the heart of man is like tinder; and if the Devill caſt a ſpark into it, thou canſt not hinder it from taking fire; but thou mayeſt hinder it from burning fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A ſhip may have leakes in her, and thou canſt not hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of water into her; but by thy pumping and induſtry thon mayeſt ſave her from drowning in the water; even ſo evill thoughts, though they be rooted out, yet they will come in again; a mans heart is like to to the fig-tree that grew out of the ſtone wall, which Epiphanius ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of; the branches were lopt off, and it grew again; the boughs were lopt off, and it grew again; they cut down the body of it, yet it grew again; they pluckt up the roots of it, yet it grew again: till at laſt the ſtone wall and all was fain to be pulled down: Even ſo it is with vain thoughts in the heart; a man may lop them off by godly ſorrow; he may cut them down, and root them up by mortification, and yet they will be ſprouting up, and riſing up again; till the whole body of ſin be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down, and deſtroyed in a man. Gregory ſpeaks of them, and ſaith man may pluck them up, but yet not ſo, but that they will riſe again.</p>

Take the Apoſtles exhortation, Whatſoever things be true; whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are of good report: if there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things, Phil. 4. 8. what, are there ſo many vertuous things, ſo many holy and pure things; ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and glorious things, ſo many heavenly graces, and divine promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſo many bleſſed paſſages of holy Writ to take up my mind? and ſhal I ſpend my thoughts and time upon ſuch vain and curſed things as will yeeld me no profit? this ſhould aſtoniſh the hearts of Gods people, and greatly humble their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond uſe may ſerve for matter of condemnation unto the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: let this doctrine ſtrike terrour into the hearts of thoſe men, that ſuffer their hearts to be taken up with vain thoughts: as Peter ſaid unto Simon Magus, ſo let me ſay unto them, Repent of this thy wickedneſſe, and pray unto God (verſe 8) that if it be poſſible, the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee. The Apoſtle doth not only wiſh him to repent of his ſimony and bribery, but alſo of the leaſt vain thoughts of his heart: pray pray unto God, if perhaps the very thoughts of thy heart may be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee: for, beloved, the very leaſt vain thoughts that thou thinkeſt, without repentance are impardonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is an impoſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of vain and idle thoughts without true repentance.</p>
                  <p>Oh what fearful news is this to the world of men that lay not this to heart! Beloved, may we not run into the ears and hearts of all earthly men with this point, whoſe minds and thoughts are earthly? Is it ſo that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44191:44"/>
he whoſe thoughts run habitually on the world, his end is deſtruction? Then they that make no conſcience what their thoughts are, what their imaginations are, what they think of as they go up and down, how can ſuch eſcape the vengeance of hell? Tell me then what thy thoughts are; are they not of thy hawks and hounds, of thy cattel and grounds, of thy gardens and orchards, rather than of Chriſt? When thou walkeſt in the ſtreets, whereon run thy thoughts, but on thy pleaſures, and profits, and earthly delights? yea of every vanity, and every delight canſt thou think, rather than of God and his Commandements. Thou comeſt to Church, thou prayeſt, and heareſt the Word of God; but do not vain thoughts come along with thee? thou goeſt home again, but do not vain thoughts haunt and dog thee?</p>
                  <p>It is the brand of a wicked man, not to have God in all his thoughts, Pſal. 4. 10. when goods and cattel, plough and cart, pleaſures and outward contentments are in his mind and thoughts; when ruffs and cuffs, houſes and diſhes, tables and fair hangings, or any thing but God can take up their thoughts; they can have thoughts of every thing, but of God they can think none; this is the brand of a wicked man, that he hath no blood of a Chriſtian in him.</p>
                  <p>It is a true deſcription of a Pagan and Infidel, that hath no knowledge of Chriſt, to be vain in his imaginations: Rom. 1. 21. When they knew God, they glorified him not as God; but became vain in their imaginations: vain in their diſputes, vain in their reaſonings, vain in their thoughts, in their carriages and diſputations; ſo then though thou knoweſt God, and haſt things enough in thy mind, that convince thee that this God is to be worſhipped; and underſtandeſt the worſhip of God and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of Chriſt: yet if thou glorifieſt him not as God, giving thy heart and affections to him, but art vain in thy imaginations, thou diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureſt God. Hear what God ſaith unto ſuch, All the day long have I ſtretched out my hand unto a rebellious and gain-ſaying people, which walk in a way that is not good, but after their own thoughts, a people that provoke me continually to my face, Iſa. 65. 2, 3. As if God had ſaid, I ſent Prophet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prophet, Miniſter after Miniſter, to inſtruct them in the knowledge of my wayes, I laboured to convert them, and to bring them home unto my ſelfe, and to work better thoughts in them; but ſtill they are a people that walk after their own thoughts, that provoke me continually unto my face. There is never a thought of thine, but it is in the very face of God, both thought and imagined.</p>
                  <p>But ſome man may ſay, I think of God, and of Chriſt, of faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and of calling on God, of mending of this and that courſe; I think of death, and of my laſt account, and every foot I have holy thoughts in my mind.</p>
                  <p>But beloved give me leave, I pray you, to ſpeak ſomething unto you, which, it may be, may ſtick upon you while you live: I will propound theſe four things, and diſtinctions unto you, which I will uſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What? doeſt thou think of God and of heaven? then tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy thoughts be injected thoughts into thy heart, or thoughts raiſed by the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44191:44"/>
heart; for there is a great deal of difference betwren thoughts injected and thoughts raiſed: God caſts good thoughts into a godly mans heart, which being fit ſoyl, it fructifies, and brings forth fruit. Again, God caſts good thoughts into a wicked mans heart, but becauſe his heart is not ſanctified, and therefore no fit ſoyl to harbour in, they dye and vaniſh: God caſts in, and they caſt out, God caſts in again, and they caſt out again; therefore if thou haſt good thoughts, examine and try whether they be thoughts raiſed from the heart or no; ſee whether thy heart be a renewed heart, a ſanctified, an holy heart, fit to bring forth good thoughts every day. Beloved, a wicked man may have a thouſand good thoughts, and yet go to hell in the midſt of them all. God caſt a good thought into the heart of the King of Aſſyria to go againſt Judah and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem to puniſh his people for their ſins, and to avenge himſelfe on them for the breach of this Covenant: but what ſaith the text? Howbeit he thought not ſo Iſa. 10. No, his onely aim was how to get honour, how to inrich, to enlarge his territories, and to bring down the Nations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and to make his name and fame to be ſpread, and declared through all the world. So God caſts many good thoughts, into many a wicked mans heart to repent, and to leave his drunkenneſſe, his pride, his ſwearing and whoring, to be holy and religious: howbeit he thinks not ſo, but he thinks how to eat and drink, how to be proud and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; how to be rich and great in the world; how to be vain and licen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ious, yea his thoughts are vile and vain all the day long.</p>
                  <p>Oh that men were wiſe, truly to underſtand this! the want whereof is the cauſe why many thouſands go to hell and are damned for ever. I will make it plain to you: a wicked man reaſons thus with himſelfe; I confeſſe, and it is true, I ſinne every day againſt God, and ſometimes drink a pot with my friend, though ſometimes I let fall anoath, and am overtaken with my infirmities, yet I thank God, he hath ſanctified my heart; For I think of God and of Chriſt, and I oft call upon his name, and let my thoughts runne on good things; God and heaven are many times in my mind, and I am ſorry when I do amiſſe, and the Lord hath bleſt me with a large portion of outward things. Beſides, I ſee theſe and theſe ſigns of grace in me, and therefore I think my caſe to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hy. And thus ſecurely they live, and ſo they go on, and ſo they dye, and ſo go to hell and periſh for ever and ever. Here is the miſery of it many think of God, and of Chriſt, of death, and of their laſt account, of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of hell, of faith and repentance, of leaving ſinne, of crucifying their luſts, and practiſing of holineſſ. Now men think that their thinking of theſe things, is a part of their diſcharge, when indeed they are Additions to, and pieces of their talents, which increaſe their judgements. God caſts in a though of repentance, holineſſe, of the remembrance of death, and laſt account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doſt thou find thy heart never the better, and holier by them? Then know, it is only Gods haunting of thy heart, and Gods calling upon thee, and Gods inviting thee unto repentance, to leave thy ſinnes, to come out of thy deadneſſe and formality, to prepare for thy death and judgement; and therefore I ſay, if thy heart now think not ſo, if thy heart do not repent, beleeve, and grow more zealous, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44191:45"/>
thou art not drawn the neerer to God; I ſay then, that the more of theſe good thoughts that thou haſt had, the greater thy doom will be: if thou haſt had ten thouſands of them, if they have been only Gods haunting of thy heart, think thou then now of grace, of God, of thy poor ſoul, which is not bettered by them, nor made holy, then know they are pieces of thy talent, and it doth make thy torments in hell the greater.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou haſt good thoughts, but the question is, whether they be<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> fleeting or abiding thoughts: Many think of God, of grace, of heaven, of the word of God, and when they hear a Sermon, they will think of God; but theſe thoughts, though they come into their minds, yet they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way preſently, they are in and out at an inſtant, in a trice, they paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and are gone. Beloved, there are two kinds of vain thoughts, 1. vain, becauſe the ſubſtance and matter of them is vain, and ſo all worldly thoughts are vain: 2. or elſe for their want of durance and laſting, and ſo are all thoughts of heaven, of God and grace, and of Chriſt, if they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away, they are all vain thoughts, though they ſeem otherwiſe. Hear what God ſaith Gen. 6. 5, God ſaw that the wickedneſſe of man was great upon the earth, and all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart were only evill continually: [all the imaginations] great is the emphaſis of this word [all] all the thoughts: yea all univerſally, are only evill continually.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay unto me, Doth not a wicked man think that there is a God? why, that is a good thought; doth not he think that this God is to be obſerved and worſhipped? why, this is a good thought; doth he not think that ſin is to be forſaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is a good thought; doth he not think of heaven, and of Chriſt? how then are their thoughts only evil and that continually?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Becauſe all the thoughts of a wicked mans heart are vain, that is vaniſhing thoughts; not vain for the matter, which ſometimes may be good and Holy; but vain becauſe they ſoon vaniſh away; thoughts that come and carry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot, that leave no impreſſion in their hearts behind them, theſe are all vain thoughts, according to that of the Apoſtle, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe that they are vain: 1 Cor. 3. 20. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a godly mans heart, when a good thought comes, it abides and dwells a good while in him, and when it goes away it leaves a good impreſſion behind it, it leaves a ſweet ſmell and favour in the heart after it is gone, its made more holy and ſanctified by it. When a good thought comes into a godly mans heart, it leaves the print of it behind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when a wicked man hath a good thought, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oſſeth it up and down, and ſuffers it not to ſtay, but preſently puts it away: let a thought of the world come in, and he can give it entertainment for ſeven days, yea for ſeven years, yea all his life he ſets his heart as a wide gate open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them and to entertain them: but if a thought of God, or of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of holineſſe and ſalvation come into his mind, he is tyred out with it, and it ſoon vaniſheth away; therefore ſo long as thy thoughts are thus vain, though for the matter good, if thou haſt never ſo many of them, yet if they abide not, but thou thinkeſt and unthinkeſt them again;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44191:45"/>
if they come and give thy Soul a jog, and ſo away; the more I ſay thou haſt of them, though thou haſt many millions, the greater will be thy doom at the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thou thinkeſt of God, but the queſtion is, whether thy good thoughts be ſtudied, or accidental thoughts. A wicked man that runs gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his thoughts here and there, over the whole world, upon this and that, and I know not what, in the midſt of a lottery of thoughts, he cannot chuſe but ſtumble upon ſome good: he thinks on God, he thinks on Chriſt, he thinks on Heaven; but it is by the by-gone, theſe thoughts of his are not naturall; but if he think of the world, of his pleaſures, of his outward delights and contentments, theſe thoughts ariſe naturally out of his heart, they are his own. Now it may be a thought of God comes by the way; But a godly man not only thinks of God, but he ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies how to think of God; it is his continuall endeavour to bring his mind to be fixed upon God; it is his whole care to have good thoughts to dwell habitually in him. There is an excellent phraſe uſed to ſet it forth, Malac. 3. 16. They that feared the Lord ſpake one unto another, and the Lord hearkned and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him of all them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his Name. Where I pray you to mark, that thinking upon Gods Name, and the fear of God are joyned together: for thinking on God, comes from the fear of God; a godly man thinks upon God and fears him; he thinks that God is alwayes with him in every place, and he trembles before him: he thinks God beholds all his thoughts and affections, and trembles at him: he thinks as he walks up and down in his way, as he he is imployed in his calling, as he is performing of any duty of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Gods eye is upon him and beholds him: and therefore he fears to offend and diſpleaſe him. A wicked man will ſwear and blaſpheme the Name of God, and by and by it may be he will cry God mercy, and ſo he thinks of God. The man breaks out it may be into wrath and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, fury and paſſion; and then it may be a thought will come into his mind to cry God mercy for it, and thus he thinks of God. The man is careleſſe, earthly, dead, and lukewarm in the performance of good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and becauſe his Conſcience tells him it is not good, he will aslo God forgiveneſſe: he will be proud, vain and rotten in his ſpeeches, and then it may be a thought will come into his mind to ask God forgiveneſſe, and ſo he thinks of God; he will think of the world, of his pleaſures, profits, of his luſts and ſins, and then it may be a good thought will come into his mind, and then it may be he will think a little of God too. Beloved, this is carnal and devilliſh thinking of God, thy thoughts then of God muſt be joyned with the fear of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, thou thinkeſt of God, but the queſtion is, whether thy thoughts of him be profitable or unprofitable thoughts: a godly man thinks of repentance, and repents upon it; he thinks of calling on God more faithfully and fervently then he did before, and he accompliſhes his thoughts: for he goes a bout it, and his heart is the better for it. Thus it was with David when he ſaid, I thought on my way ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies, Pſalm 119. 59. I thought on my wayes (there was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44191:46"/>
his good thoughts) and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies (there was the profit of his good thoughts:) but on the contrary thou thinkeſt of God, but God hath never the more ſervice of thee; thou thinkeſt of leaving of thy good fellowſhip, and merry companions, but for all thy thought, thou retaineſt them ſtill: thou thinkeſt to give over all thy deadneſſe and luke-warmneſſe, and ſo get more zeal &amp; fervency: yet day after day, and year after year, thy heart is as dead, vain and ſecure as before, as ever before. Examine thy ſelf and ſee, thou haſt good thoughts (thou ſaiſt) but where is the profit of them? thou thinkeſt of leaving thy wrath, and of bridling thy filthy paſſions, but art thou enabled by thy thoughts, to put up an injury the better? it may be thou thinkeſt of death; but is thy life the more holy and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it? Thou thinkeſt of Chriſt and his blood; but is thy heart pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by it? Oh the wretched miſery of the moſt men in the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the unprofitableneſſe of their thoughts! they have many good thoughts, but they want the profitable uſe of them, they get no good by by them.</p>
                  <p>There is an excellent deſcription of the thoughts of wicked men (though it be Apocrypha,) The heart of the fooliſh is like a Cart-Wheel, and his thoughts like the rowling Axeltree. As the Cart-wheel goes round all the day, and yet remains on the Axeltree; ſo is it with wicked men, their thoughts wheel, and wheel them up and down a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand times, their thoughts run upon this thing, and then upon another thing, and ſo they rowl up and down continually, yet their heatt is at the ſame paſſe it was ſtill; an earthly heart it was, and ſo it is ſtill, a prophane heart it was, and ſo it is ſtill; a carnall proud heart it was, and ſo it remains ſtill; But let theſe know, that the time haſtens wherein God will judge them, even for their very thoughts.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where are they then that ſay thought is free? It is true indeed, it is free from mens knowledge, and from mens Courts, but not from Gods, they are not free from Gods all-ſeeing eye and knowledge, Thou haſt tryed and known me (ſaith the Prophet) thou underſtandeſt my thoughts afar off, Pſal. 139. Beloved, as you are in the Ale-houſe, or gaming houſe, as you walk abroad in the fields, as you are imployed in your callings, or about any holy duty, God ſeeth all thy thoughts, what is going in, and what is coming out there is never a thought in thy heart, but God ſees it; how then can thoughts be free? God will weigh the thoughts of men, Prov. 16. 2.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, what a fearfull day will that be, when God ſhall take his Scales and weigh (not mens bodies and eſtates, for then in may be that rich men, and fat, and groſſe men will out-weigh them that are better:) but he will take mens thoughts and weigh them, he will weigh their ſouls: he will take mens good thoughts, and put them in one ſcale, and their bad, earthly, carnal and unprofitable thoughts, into another ſcale, and to try which weighs heavieſt: Now if thy earthly and ſinfull thoughts weigh heavieſt, then down thou goeſt into eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as thoughts are not free from Gods knowledge, ſo are they not free from Gods Word; for Gods Word can meet with them; for it is lively
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44191:46"/>
and mighty in operation, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, Heb. 4. 12. Doth the word of God diſcern the thoughts of mens hearts? Then much more doth the God of this word, and therefore how can thoughts be fee?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly and laſtly, they are not free from the condemnation of hell and and damnation. I am he (ſaith God) that ſearch the heart and reins, and I will give to every one of you according to his works; or as ſome tranſlations have it, according to your thoughts, Revel. 3. 23. Now if God will ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh thoughts, take heed then, how thou retaineſt any evil thoughts.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould here give you ſome meanes in the uſe, that ſo you might rid your ſelves from vain thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, love the word of God, if ever thou wilt come out of them; prize<note place="margin">Means 1.</note> the truth of God, and labour to get thy mind and thoughts to be ſet on better things; and then the thoughts of the world, and all vain things will vaniſh away. This courſe the Prophet David took, Pſal. 119, 113, I hate vain thoughts, but thy Law do I love, How came it to paſs that he hated vain thoughts? namely, by loving Gods Law: if he had not loved Gods Law, and thoſe excellent things therein, and ſet his heart on them; he could never have hated vain thoughts. The way then to break off thy league with vain thoughts, is to be in league with good thoughts. Doſt thou complain of vain thoughts in prayer, in hearing the word, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacraments, and art thou ſtuffed and filled with them, that thou canſt not think upon God and holy things? thou doſt hereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray thine own rotteneſſe and corruptions. And therefore know, that if thou loveſt the Lord and his Word, and didſt ſet thy thoughts upon him, thou wouldeſt never have them ſo much imployed about ſuch baſe things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if ever thou wouldeſt rid thy heart of vain thoughts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when thou art in holy action, thou muſt go unto God by prayer; there is no greater bridle to reſtrain a man from vain thoughts, than this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that he is to goe to God. I ſpeak not this to the men of this world: Carnal men, who can ruſh into Gods preſence hand over head, without any fear or reverence, they can ſet upon any duty without any preparation: but I ſpeak it to the godly man, whoſe heart dreads and ſtands in awe of God: Wilt thou let thy mind rove and run all the day on worldly things? how then wilt thou call upon God? Doſt thou not know that this is the cauſe of thy dulneſſe, thy deadneſſe, and wandrings of thy heart, when thou art about any good duty? namely, becauſe thou ſuffereſt thy heart to be laſhing out, and roving abroad on the world all day, no marvell if it keep his haunt at night, and therefore thy heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vain, God will never hear thy prayer, Job 35. 13. God will never hear vanity. Comeſt thou to God with a vain prayer? God wil never hear it. Comeſt thou with a vain ear to the hearing of the Word? God will never hear it; or with a vain heart to the Sacrament? God will not regard it. Lay this ſeriouſly to thy heart, if ever thou wouldeſst have thy heart to the duty thou art about, buſie thy mind upon good things; for if thy heart be accuſtomed to vain and worldly things all the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44191:47"/>
day, it is no marvell if it return to its hau nt again at night.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider that you have not ſo learned Chriſt. It is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles argument, Epheſ. 3. conſider then what you have learned of Chriſt; hath Chriſt taught you ſo? hath Chriſt taught you ſuch a love, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you ſuch a liberty, that you ſhould love the world more than him, and imploy and beſtow all your thoughts wholy in ſeeking after vain things? Hath Chriſt taught you ſuch a faith as this? Hath Chriſt taught you ſuch a repentance as this, to have your thoughts more upon the world than upon Chriſt? to repent of ſin, and yet never forſake ſin? Have ye ſo learned Chriſt? Hath he not taught you ſuch a faith as purifieth the heart? ſuch a ſanctification as cleanſeth the ſoul and the mind? ſuch an obedience as bringeth every thought into ſubjection unto himſelf? Therefore, if now thou ſhouldeſt ſtill retain thy vain, dead, earthly and carnall thoughts, it is not to learn Chriſt: Chriſt teacheth thee no ſuch doctrine, nor giveth thee any ſuch licencious liberty; but thou learneſt of the Devil, and of thine own heart: for all evil and vain thoughts ariſe from theſe three heads;</p>
                  <p>Firſt from the variety and abundance of the thoughts of the world, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our Saviour calls the cares of the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the fountain of corruption in mans heart, the heart of man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> being alwayes like a ſink, naturally running with filthineſſe, or like a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quickſet, always bearing: ſo it is with the heart of man, always ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining vain thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from the damned malice of the Devil, and his fearful ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and temptations, both within and without: the Devil is fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a tempter and tryer; for by his ſuggeſtions and temptations he feels and tryes mens hearts; and thereby knowing to what they are moſt inclined, and which way they are ſooneſt overcome, accordingly he fits his temptations to intrap them. Now theſe thoughts are infinitely varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to the conſtitutions, place, quality, paſsions, affections and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men: as of the poor man in his beggary, of the rich man in his abundance, of the Miniſter in his calling, of the Majeſtrate in his, and ſo of all other men. Now the whole world is not able to fill the heart; how then ſhall we number the thoughts of it? But for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we will rank them into theſe four heads, to ſhew how thoughts become vain;</p>
                  <p>1. Materially, mens thoughts are vain, when the matter of them is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vain.</p>
                  <p>2. Formally, when though for the matter they are never ſo good, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the manner of thinking them is evil.</p>
                  <p>3. Eſſentially, when the man that thinks them is vain.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. When it is a thought that might become the beſt Saint upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> earth, or a glorified Angel in heaven; yet the drift of the ſoul being carnall and vain, the ſoul thereby becomes vain alſo.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then material vain thoughs, are all thoughts of the world, of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> works of thy calling, of thy recreations, eating, drinking, ſleeping, thoughts of thy wife and children, and the like; they are vain thoughts, not ſinful neceſſarily, yet they may come to be ſinfull five manner of ways;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:44191:47"/>Firſt, when we think of them primarily, that is, in the firſt place, when<note place="margin">Manner 1.</note> we think of them before we think of God. Tell me then, what are thy firſt thoughts in the morning? Hereby a man may know his thoughts whether they be good or evill. Conſider, I ſay, what is that firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelfe unto thy thoughts: certainly, that which the heart is moſt haunted withall, and moſt taken up with, is moſt naturall unto it: If the heart be carnall and earthly, it will have carnall and earthly thoughts; if it be a godly and gracious heart, it will labour to make God the firſt in his thoughts. I know the godly man fails in many things, and many unruly thoughts in him may rebell; but it is the very grief of his ſoul, and he will never reſt nor be at quiet, till he hath got Balme from Gilead, ſtrength from Chriſt for the ſubduing and crucifying of them, even of thoſe vain and ſinfull thoughts that ſtick cloſeſt unto their hearts, and are moſt prone unto them naturally: ſo that it is the practice of a godly man firſt in the morning to lift up his heart with his hand unto God; and when he is up, his thoughts are wholly upon God. See this in David, who conſidering that the Lord was preſent every where, made this uſe of it, When I awake, I am preſent with thee, Pſal. 139. 18. His heart was lifted up to God, he did endeavovr to ſhake hands with God (as it were) in his holy meditations, worſhipping and adoring God with his firſt thoughts; he would be ſure to give God the flower and Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of his firſt ſervice and thoughts: as ſoon as ever he was awake, his heart was in heaven. This ſhews, that the thoughts of men that live in their ſins, are damnable thoughts; Thou that art a drunkard, a ſwearer, a prophane perſon, a carnall worlding, that never haſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I tell thee, that the very thinking of thy meat and drink is damnable, the very thoughts of thy recreations and of thy ſleep, are damnable thoughts: to think of the works of thy calling, yea of ſetting thy foot upon the ground, or of any thing that God hath commanded thee to doe, are all damnable thoughts. Why? Becauſe thou giveſt not God thy firſt thoughts. Wilt thou think of thy belly, and back, before thou thinkeſt of God, and how to be converted unto him? Wilt thou think of thy Markets and Faires, before thou thinkeſt of thy reconciliation with God? The firſt thing that every ſoul is bound to doe, is to get in with God: Firſt ſeek the kingdom of God (ſaith our Saviour) and the righteouſneſſe thereof, Matth. 6. 35. Where our Saviour doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid our taking of thought for the things of this life, but that they ſhould not be ſought after in the firſt place, ſo that our firſt thoughts and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould be after the Kingdom of heaven. Therefore all thoughts whatſoever, which are conceived before a man be converted, and ſo thinks of God, are all damnable thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all worldly thoughts are ſinfull, when we think of them too u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually<note place="margin">Manner 2.</note> (as Chryſoſtome ſpeaks) becauſe we think of the univerſality of them. Beloved it is lawfull to think of the world, and to think of our trade and imployments, to think of our corn, of our cattell, fields, barnes, wives, children: For if God have commanded or commended theſe things unto us, then ſurely he gives us leave to think on them, that ſo we may accompliſh our buſineſſe the better; but let us take heed they be not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44191:48"/>
too uſuall with us: for we have ſouls as well as bodies, and there is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly as well as an earthly buſineſſe to think upon: thou art not to live here alwayes, therefore take heed that thy thoughts be not too uſuall and common upon the things of the world, let not earth and earthly thinhs have too much of thy thoughts. As the Prophet David ſeeing the thoughts of wicked men wholly to runne after the things of the world, he tells them, all their thoughts periſh; and ſo I tell you; if that your thoughts on the world run together with heap and croud, and then you bundle them in bundles (as it were) they all prove damnable, and ſhall periſh.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, worldly thoughts are ſinfull and damnable, if thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt<note place="margin">Manner 3.</note> of them too ſavourily: a carnall-minded man thinks ſavourily of the things of the world, the thoughts of earthly things are ſavoury unto him: a wicked man wil think of God and of the world; but which is the ſavouryeſt thought to him? He wil think of Chriſt, of Heaven, and of the Word of God, and of ſuch a Sermon he heard, but alas, he finds no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, taſt, nor relliſh in them; he finds no ſweetneſſe, joy, or delight in them; but when he thinks of the world; of his gold and ſilver, of his lands and livings, Oh theſe are merry thoughts unto him, theſe are ſweet unto him, and pleaſant to him, and his heart is now at home in his own neſt; He can think of theſe, ſeven dayes, nay ſeven moneths, nay ſeven years together, and yet never be weary, but his thoughts as full and as freſh as at the firſt: But bring him to a Sermon, or to a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and he is jaded preſently, his heart is empty, and his thoughts are at an end. For (ſaith the Apoſtle) they that are after the fleſh, ſavour the things of the fleſh. Rom. 8. 5. It is a true note of an earthly, carnal, fleſhly heart, to be thinking on earthly and vain things ſavourily. Thou maiſt think on the world, but it muſt be only with a caſt of thy thoughts, as one that looks upon a thing with a ſquint eye; but when thou art to think on God, or on the things of God, then thou muſt gather all thy thoughts and affections, thou muſt lay all the powers of thy ſoul together, and thou muſt imploy them only to this work.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, worldly thoughts become ſinfull, when we think of them<note place="margin">Manner 4.</note> without counſel; then (faith Solomon) they come to nought; when a man conſiders not afore-hand what thoughts are neceſſary and needfull, and ſo reſtreines and keeps off all impertinent thoughts, then his thoughts will prove diſtruſtfull, carking thoughts, caring for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, contrary to the rule of Chriſt, Matth. 6. 33. Take no care for to morrow, let to morrow care for it ſelfe. He doth not forbid here Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian provident thoughts; for, godly, honeſt, and ſober thoughts are fitting and neceſſary; but he ſeems hereby to cut off all diſtruſting cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, worldly thoughts come to be ſinfull, when they are thought<note place="margin">Manner 5.</note> needleſly: And here I will ſhew how far a man may think of the world; namely, ſo far as his neceſſary buſineſſe requires. Suppoſe a mans buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be upon merchandiſe, it is lawfull to think of it, and of his ſhop and wares; but if thou wouldeſt know how far; why, ſo far as it is for thy buſineſſe; But if thou haſt ſo many of them, that thy heart is taken up
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44191:48"/>
with them, and thy mind ſtill on them, then they are ſinfull thoughts. There is many a man that in following of his buſineſſe beſtowes more thoughts upon it than his buſineſſe requires, he hath ten thouſands of ſuperfluous thoughts; but let ſuch remember the exhortation of the Wiſe man, eſtabliſh thy thoughts by counſell, counſel wil tell a man when he hath thought enough, and what thoughts are fit for his imployment. Not that any man can carry himſelfe alwayes in that golden mediocrity or mean; but a Chriſtians care muſt be dayly more and more to pare off all ſuperfluous thoughts of earthly things.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond thing: 2. Thoughts are vain formally; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when though the matter of them be never ſo good, yet the manner of thinking them is evill. It is poſſible that a wicked man goe to hell, though he performs the ſame things, for the matter of them, that a godly man doth; a godly man comes to Church, ſo doth a wicked man: a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man prayes in his family, ſo doth a wicked man; a godly man reads the Scriptures, ſo doth a wicked man; a godly man repeats Sermons, and conferres of good things, ſo doth a wicked man. There is no work that comes to the outward act, that a godly man doth, but a wicked man may doe the ſame; here only is the difference, in the manner of working. I will ſet it out to you by a place of Scripture; In a great houſe (ſaith the Apoſtle) there are not onely veſſels of gold, and of ſilver, but alſo of wood and of ſtone, ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour, 2 Tim. 2. 20. Mark how the Apoſtle here ſets out the reprobate and the elect, comparing them to veſſels of honour, and diſhonour the veſſels of diſhonour are of the ſame matter that the veſſels of honour are of: ſuppoſe it be pewter, or ſilver, caſt it into an honourable form, and it wil be a veſſel of honour; but caſt it into a diſhonourable form, and it wil be a veſſel of diſhonour, for baſe and mean ſervice; even ſo it is between a true Chriſtian and a meer formall profeſſor, the matter of their ſervice is one and the ſame; ſuppoſe it be hearing the Word, or receiving of the Sacraments, prayer, or the like, the ſubſtance and action is the ſame; but take the ſame prayer, and let a godly man caſt it in his form, and it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and prevails with God: let a wicked man take the ſame prayer, and caſt it into his diſhonourable form, and it becomes ſinfull, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and abominable in Gods eyes. For hearing of the Word of God, the godly man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hears, and the wicked man hears; the matter in both is the ſame; the godly man he caſteth the Word into a godly mould, he hears the Word, and he trembles at it; he hears the Word, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves it; he hears the Word, and his heart bowes to it, and reſolves to practiſe it: a wicked man he hears the Word too, but he caſteth it into a diſhonoura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le mould, he hears it with deadneſſe and dulneſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trembling, without faith and obedience. So a godly man may think thoughts of God, and ſo may a wicked man think thoughts of God, the matter of both is good; yet the thoughts of the wicked are vain; though he thinks of God, yet, becauſe he caſteth it into his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable frame, he fears not God, his heart trembles not at God, but his heart is as full of dead earthly affections as before; he thinks of hearing the Word, but it is after this own faſhion, he thinks of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44191:49"/>
but he prayes with his own ſpirit, and not with the ſpirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Pſalmiſt tells us, that the whoremaſter, the drunkard, and the thief thinks of God, it is after his own faſhion: Pſal. 50. 21. Theſe things haſt thou done (ſaith God) and I held my tongue, and then thoughteſt that I was even ſuch a one as thy ſelf. A wicked man goes on in his ſins, and thinks that they are not ſo devilliſh and abominable, as ſome ſay they are, and he thinks that God thinks ſo too; he is earthly, carnall, luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, and dead-hearted, and if he repent at the laſt, he thinks all will be well, and he thinks God is of the ſame mind too; he goes on in his drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, pride, and hypocriſie, and he thinks if he do but remember to ask God mercy, and to cry, Lord receive my ſoul, when he is going out of the world, he thinks he ſhall not go to hell, but be carried to the joyes of heaven, and he thinks God is of his mind, that God thinks ſo too: But mark what the Lord ſaith; I will reprove thee, and ſet thy ſins in order before thee. O conſider this you that forget God, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, mens thoughts are vain, when the heart that thinks upon them is earthly and vain; wherefore if all the wicked men in the world ſhould lay their heads together to think a good thought. yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: for their hearts are vain hearts, ſinfull hearts, they may think of excellent propofitions concerning God, his worſhip, his word, and ſervice; but ſo long as the heart that thinks upon them is carnall and vain, they cannot ſpeak that which is good, as ſaith our Saviour: Maithew 12. 34. How can you ſpeak good things? Why, may ſome men ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> may not a wicked man read a Chapter in a Bible, are the words<note place="margin">Object.</note> ſo hard to be underſtood, and pronounced? cannot a wicked man take a Sermon and read it, and hear a Sermon and repeat it? What? are Letters and ſyllables ſo hard to be pronounced?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, (beloved) that is not the meaning of our Saviour, [How can<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ye that are evill ſpeak good things:] no, no, a wicked man may read Gods word, and propound good queſtions as well as a true Chriſtian: but he cannot ſpeak good words, that is, he cannot ſpeak them from a good heart; and therefore his heart being carnall and vain, good words in his mouth are as a Jewell in a ſwines ſnout: it is a word indeed, but not a ſpeech, when he reads or pronounceth Gods word. Ariſtotle ſaith, that ſpeech is nothing but the expreſſion of that that is within the heart. Now then, if the word and truth of God be not ingraffed in thy heart, if thy heart be not heavenly when thou ſpeakeſt of heavenly things, thou doſt pronounce them, but not ſpeak them. But when thou ſpeakeſt of earthly things; then thou ſpeakeſt to the purpoſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy heart is ſet upon them, and thy mind and thy tongue go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there is no jarre not diſcord betwixt them: but if thy heart be not pure, though thou ſpeakeſt good things, or holy things, yet in Chriſts ſenſe thou ſpeakeſt them not: For (ſay I) how can a vain, evill, corrupt heart think good thoughts? An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit, (ſaith our Saviour) he doth not ſay, that an evill tree cannot be made good, for it may be grafted into another ſtock; divers ways
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44191:49"/>
there are to make it good: but ſo long as it is a corrupt tree, it cannot bring forth good fruit; Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles? Doſt thou go to a drunkard, and thinkeſt there to find any religion in him? or to a whore-maſter to find grace in him? Doſt thou go to a ſwearer or a prophane perſon, and thinkeſt thou to finde any fear of God in them? Indeed ſometimes there may be ſome morall good found in them, but they are as a pearl in a dunghill, out of its place.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, all mens thoughts come to be vain when the drift and end of the heart and ſoul in thinking of them is vain.</p>
                  <p>But thou wilt ſay unto me, The end of my thoughts is Gods glory. What? is it not to Gods glory that we go to the Word and Sacrament, that we pray and give almes?</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, The end of every good work in it ſelfe is Gods glory; but is it the end of the worker, ſpeaker, or thinker? I make no queſtion but the end of a good action in it ſelfe is the glory of God; ſo, the end of prayer is the glory of God, the end of all preaching and Sermons is the glory of God, the end of giving of almes, and of all good thoughts, is the glory of God, but the end of the man that prayes and preaches, what is that? the end of the hearer and giver of almes, what is that? the end of him that ſpeaks well, what is that? Beloved, moſt men have falſe and corrupt ends, which we will branch out into theſe three heads;</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, men will be thinking and plodding from morning till night of their wordly buſineſſes: Now becauſe they know they muſt think on God, to make God amends, perhaps they will think on him at night, when they have diſhonoured him all the day. So men will ſwear and ſwagger, drink and be drunk, and when they have done, ſay, Lord have mercy upon me, and ſo they think to make God amends. What (beloved) will yee ſwear, ſwagger, drink, be drunk, and lye, be ſecure and worldy, and and then ask God forgiveneſſe to make him amends? This is to break Priſcians head, that you may give him a plaiſter. Will you treſpaſſe your neighbour, that you may ask him forgiveneſſe? This is a damned and devilliſh religion; yet this is the religion of many men in the world, you ſhall have them keep daies and weeks and years in the obſervation of the times of Gods worſhip; they will keep the Sabbath in coming to Church, and they will hear Sermons, pray and think of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all this is to make God amends for the wrong that they have done him: they know they have offended God, and therefore they will doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make him ameds like thoſe wicked men in Jeremies time, who did ſteal, murder, commit adultery, ſwear falſly; and burn incenſe unto Baal, and walk after the Gods they knew not, and then come and ſtand before God in his houſe, which is called by his name, and ſaid, We are delivered though we have done all theſe abominations. As if God ſhould ſay unto wicked men, What, will ye ſwear, ſteal, lye, and be earthly, giving up your ſelves to all manner of lewdneſſe, in the breach and contempt of my commandements, and then think by making a prayer unto me and by lifting up your eyes unto me, and by giving your ears to hear my
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44191:50"/>
word, thereby to make me recompence? No, no, I have ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, Micah. 8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the end of mens thoughts is commonly to collogue with God. Let a man be under the croſſe, in calamity, pain, and miſery, then God will hear of him often, then he will think of God, and of his ſinnes: Nay, the beaſtlieſt wretch in a whole Pariſh, upon his ſick bed, then, Oh how will he call upon God, then ſend for the Miniſter, let him pray for me, read a chapter or ſome good book; then God ſhall have ſervice upon ſervice, then he ſhall have the firſt, ſecond, and third courſe. But all this is but to be raiſed up again; and then when he hath received a little ſtrength, he falls off again: like the Jews, who when God ſlew them, they ſought him: and they returned and enquired early after God; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they did but diſſemble with him with their mouths; and flatter him with their double hearts, Pſal. 37. 34. There is many a man that ſeeks to God, yea, that ſeeks to him with tears, and performs many a good duty, and yet he doth but flatter with God, he doth it but to curry favour with him; is afraid of ſickneſſe, croſſes, plagus, and death, and curſes upon him, if he ſhould not do ſo: and therefore to prevent this he will diſſemble ſome ſervice to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to ſmother and choak their own conſciences; their hearts think and tell them, they muſt think of God, their conſciences tell them, that they muſt have ſome holineſſe, ſome religion, that they muſt keep the Sabbath in ſome ſort, that they muſt pray and go to Church: and hence it is, that the drunkard, ſwearer, whoremaſter, will ſometimes have thoughts of God, and wil be performing ſome outward acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Why? his conſcience otherwiſe would not let him be at reſt, but is as the Devils ban-dog to drive him to it.</p>
                  <p>Thus when the Prophet commanded the people to worſhip the Lord; to reverence his name, to hallow his Sabbaths; their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces told them that they muſt do ſo, or elſe all the threatnings of wrath, and vengeance donounced by the Prophets would come upon them. Hence it is that the Lord by his; Prophet exhorts, ſaying, Ariſe ye, and depart, for this is not your reſt; your mind hath another haunt, you have this and that black luſt, this is not your reſt. Doth thy heart reſt on God and good things? If thy heart be good and holy, ſo that it takes up its reſt in God, and in Chriſt, then it is well; but if thou only turneſt aſide to good duties, and falleſt, as it were, by chance upon holy things, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, away (ſaith God) this is nor your reſt. Ariſtotle ſaith, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing conſiſts in the end of a thing. Therefore if the end of thy thoughts and courſes be earthly and vain, then certainly thy religion is earthly and vain. Thou goeſt up and down; what is it that thou lookſt after? Is it that thou maiſt have grace, or that thou maiſt follow thy calling, and get thy living? is it this that thou wouldeſt have, for which thou keepeſt ſuch a digging and ſcraping, and ſuch a laying up? Then thy end is carnall and vain, and thy drift and end declareth the truth of thy ſoul, that it is carnall and vain.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Corinthians, though Paul had converted many poor mean men amongſt them, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 1. 26, 27. God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and the weak things of the world, to confound the things that are mighty: yet the Nobles, the Lawyers, the Counſellors, the chief men in the City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Apoſtle had not converted one of them, or at the leaſt very few. Brethren, you ſee your calling; who they are that be converted to the obedience of the Goſpel of Chriſt from the evill of their wayes: not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many rich, not many nobles, ſome few there be, here and there one; but for the moſt part they are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poor beggarly Chriſtians: now (it ſeems) theſe poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have controverſies one with another, went to Law among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that before unbeleevers. The Apoſtle condems this their going to Law, and would have them ceaſe their ſuits and quarrels, one againſt another, before the unjuſt and unbeleevers, and that by four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:44191:52"/>Firſt, by the ſhamfulneſſe of it, verſe 5. I ſpeak it to your ſhame; as it he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſhould ſay, Are you ſuch fools, that you cannot take up theſe matters among your ſelves? that you cannot make references of your wrongs to mediate one to another, but that you muſt goe to Law before unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the ſcandalouſneſſe of it. It is a thing ſo ſcandalous and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> offenſive to thoſe that are without, that I wonder any of you dare be ſo bold as to goe to Law one with another. What will the world think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What? Are theſe the men that profeſſe the Goſpel? Are theſe they that have the Wiſdom of God in them, and that are led by the Spirit of God? And have they no more underſtanding in them, than when they have any matter of controverſie, they cannot end it among themſelves, but muſt goe to Law before the unjuſt and unbeleevers? (as they term them.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from the unſeemlineſſe of it, in the ſecond verſe. Doe you not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> know that the Saints ſhall judge the earth? What? hath God made you Judges of the world, and do you go to be judged by the world? Or as Ambroſe ſpeaks, hath God appointed you to be Judges of the men in the world, and are you not fit to be Judges of the things of the world?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, from the ſtrangeneſſe of it; Dare any of you? He ſpeaks inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatively <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> (verſe 1.) It is a ſtrang thing that you ſhould come to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt; one would think that you would tremble and quake at ſuch a thing as this is. What is there never a wiſe Chriſtian amongſt you? never an underſtanding Profeſſor, that is able to take up a controverſie, or decide and judge between his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? what a ſtrange thing is this? Then he backs it with four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe they were brethren, verſe 6. Brother go to Law with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe it was about things of this life. What? hath God made you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Judges of heavenly things, of Angels, and are you unfit to judge of the things of this life?</p>
                  <p>3. It was about ſmal matters (verſe 2.) whereas you ſhall ſit upon men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and Angels, and the weightieſt matters in the world, the greateſt things of Gods Law, judging them to the greateſt penalty and puniſhment, even to eternal damnation: and are ye unworthy then to judge even of the ſmalleſt matters?</p>
                  <p>4. And laſtly, Becauſe it was about ſuch things; as the meaneſt Chriſtian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in the town might have taken up, and have ended: Set up them that are leaſt eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>Do you not know that the Saints ſhall Judge the world?</p>
                  <p>I need not go far for a point, the word affords it; The Doctrine is, That the Saints ſhall judge the world.</p>
                  <p>It is an old truth. yea as old as the World it ſelf: you may read it in<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> the fourth verſe of Judes Epiſtle. That Enoch the ſeventh from Adam propheſied, ſaying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints. God will not only come to judgement himſelf, but he will come
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44191:52"/>
attended with all his Saints, even with all the godly, to execute vengeance upon all the world, So our Saviour told Saint Peter, and not only him, but all that follow him in the regeneration: They ſhall ſit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael, Matth. 9. 18. They ſhall judge the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and have dominion over the people, Wiſ. 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>And now becauſe doubt is the beſt way to attain unto knowledge, let me anſwer a doubt, that may creep in by the way, How ſhall the Saints judge the world?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>Anſ. Not by pronouncing of judgement upon the world, for that Chriſt only ſhall doe, Then ſhall the King ſay to them on his left hand, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ye curſed, Matthew. 25. But the Saints ſhall judge the World theſe four wayes:</p>
                  <p>1. They ſhall judge the world, by their conſent unto Chriſts judgement.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God trains up his children in this world, and educates them, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them how they may judge the world hereafter; he teacheth them in this life how to aſſent with his proceedings in the world; to that they are able to ſay, Righteous art thou O Lord, and juſt are thy judgements, Pſal, 119. 137. Now if the Saints be trained in this life to aſſent unto Gods proceedings with the world; much more then will they be able to know and conſent unto Cſtriſts judgement, when he ſhall come with his Saints to judge the world: Now the Law ſaith, that conſenters are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and therefore becauſe the Saints ſhall conſent to the judgement of Chriſt, therefore they are ſaid to judge the world.</p>
                  <p>2. The Saints ſhall judge the world by their applauſe of Chriſts judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they ſhall not only give conſent unto the judgement of Chriſt, but they ſhall alſo applaud it and commend it: when God ſhall ſay to all drunkards, ſwearers, lyers, Sabbath-breakers, and to all unbeleeving impenitent and graceleſſe ſinners, Depart ye curſed into hell fire, then though it was his own father that begat him, or his mother that bare him, though it were his own brother or ſiſter, wife or child, that hath been as dear as his own life and ſoul to him, yet they ſhall clap their hands for joy, and applaud the moſt righteous ſentence of God upon them; and they ſhall ſing Hallelujah, ſalvation, and honour, and power, be to the Lord our God, for true and righteous are his judgements. Rev. 19. 1, 2. Let them go accurſed as they are; for it is a righteous ſentence paſſed on them.</p>
                  <p>3. They ſhall Judge the world by their Majeſty; they ſhall not only ſtand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> againſt the wicked, and conſent to, and applaud that ſentence that Chriſt ſhall paſſe againſt the wicked, but they ſhall be inveſted with robes of majeſty, and with a diademe of glory: then ſhall the righteous ſhine as the ſtars in the firmament, and the wicked ſhall be amazed and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the ſight of them: as you may read in the platform of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Matthew 25. where Chriſt ſets his Saints over againſt the world, that ſo the world may look upon them, and be confounded at their ſight.</p>
                  <p>4, They ſhall judge the world by their lives and converſation; (as Ambroſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſaith rightly) then is the world judged by them, when as the courſes and manners of the world are not found upon them. Therefore it is a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44191:53"/>
pretty obſervation of Hilary (if it be the meaning of the Text) (I will not ſay it is) upon the 2 Pſ. Be wiſe ye judges: God hath appointed you to be Judges, to ſit on his bench with his Sonne, learn then to be wiſe, get to be indued with ſpirituall wiſdome and underſtanding, and to ſhine in all integritie and righteouſneſſe; and then turning his ſpeech to the wicked, he ſays, Kiſſe the ſonne le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t he be angry. However it be, yet this is a truth, that by the lives of his Saints, he wil judge the world, their faith ſhall judge the worlds infidelity: their repentance ſhall judge the worlds impenitency; their accepting of, and taking the Lord Jeſus, ſhal judge their rejection and neglect of Chriſt Jeſus; their zeal ſhall judge the worlds luke-warmneſſe, and their holineſs ſhal judge the worlds prophaneneſſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe of the myſticall union that is betwixt Chriſt and his Saints; He<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> is the head and they are his members; now that which the head doth, we aſcribe it to the whole body; when the head ſpeaks, the whole body ſpeaks; when the head ſees, the whole body ſees: ſo when Chriſt judgeth the world, the whole body of Chriſt may truly be ſaid to judge the world. In as much as you did it unto one of theſe (ſaith Chriſt) you did it unto me: ſo, in as much as Chhiſt paſſeth ſentence, even all the members of the myſticall body of Chriſt judge with him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of compaſſion: I ſpeak not of the word [compaſſion]<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> as it ſignifies [pity] but of compaſsion, of ſuffering with Chriſt, ſeeing that Chriſt was reproached, contemned, hated, miſuſed, and condemned by the world, the Saints are likewiſe with him; ſeeing they partake of the afflictions, humiliations, and debaſements of Chriſt here, they ſhall alſo be made partakers with Chriſt in his glory. Here the wicked judge the Saints, and call them hypocrites, and diſſemblers, and laugh and ſcoff at them, and wonder at them, as the Prophet brings in Chriſt ſpeaking, Iſaiah 8. Behold, I and the children that thou haſt given me, are for ſigns and wonders in Iſrael: The wicked count them for won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and monſters in the world, judging them hypocrites and lyers, which have nothing in them but rottenneſſe and diſſimulation. Now the rule of like for like ſhall take place here, and as they were judged by the world, ſo they ſhall be Judges of the world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for great terror to all wicked men at the day of judgement: for<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> as it is with a thief, not onely when the Judge ſhall command to hang him, but all the Juſtices, and all the Country ſhall cry out, Hang him, hang him, he is judged the more terribly; ſo God will not only ſay of all wicked and ungodly ſinners, Damn them, damn them, but he will have all the Saints in heaven, and all the Saints on earth to cry out, Away with them, away with them, let them be damned, Pſalm. 50, 4, 5. This will make their judgement ſo much the more terrible.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Saints ſhall judge the world becauſe God ſhall ſo convince<note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> them, that their mouth ſhall be ſtopped, they ſhall have never a ſyllable to to excuſe themſelves withall, when they ſhall ſee men, fleſh and bloud as themſelves are, when they ſhall ſee men and women, that have lived in the ſame town, enjoyed the ſame Ordinances of God, lived in the ſame family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that did partake of the ſame bleſſings, and of the ſame
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44191:53"/>
croſſes and afflictions with themſelves, ſubject alſo to the ſame corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſins as themſelves, when they ſhall ſee theſe at Chriſts right hand, they ſhall have never a word to excuſe themſelves withall as when the Apoſtles had healed the creeple (Acts 3.) if the people had judged them for wicked and peſtilent men, the creeple would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them, and ſhewed that they were of God; if they ſhould have cryed, Root them up, the creeple would have condemned them, and told them, that they did good. And when the wicked ſhall ſee the Saints at Gods right hand, would they call them hypocrites and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they themſelves ſhall ſee, that they are ſincere; will they call them Puritans? why, they ſhall then ſee that their purity ſtands them in good ſtead: then the ungodly ſhall not ſtand in judgement, nor the ſinners in the congregation of the righteous, Pſal. 1. 6. Thus the point is clear.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Uſe then is for inſtruction, whereby we may learn, that the Saints by their now being Saints, doe now judge the world: if by the lives of Saints then God doth judge the world, then there is never a Saint in a Town, or Citie, or Pariſh in all the Countrey, but he judgeth all the wicked that are about him: How? By living godly, by hating the ſinnes of the times, by keeping his or their garments clean from the pollution of the world: For by doing this he judgeth the world. See it in Noah, Heb. 11. 7. By faith Noah being warned of God, as yet moved with fear, prepared an Ark for the ſaving of his houſe, by which he condemned the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>But ſome men will ſay, Could Noah be ſaid to condemne the world by making the Ark? all the world did not ſee him when he did it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>Beloved, Noah was making the Ark an hundred and twenty years, though it was not ſeen of all, yet all the world muſt needs hear of it, it being ſuch a ſtrange thing. Now he condemned the world in that the whole world did not come unto Noah to inquire of him in ſober ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but rather mockt him for building the Ark; they thought him to be a peeviſh melancholy man, and not well in his wits, and ſo ſcoft at him, ſaying, Will he make an Ark to ſwim upon dry land? whereas they ſhould have ask'd him ſoberly the cauſe why he did it; and if they had done ſo, Noah no queſtion would have told them, that the wrath of heaven was upon the World, and that the floods of God's vengeance were ſhortly to be powred down upon us: and, becauſe my heart hath been naught, and I have ſinned and provoked the Lords wrath, I fear if I get not into this Arke which the Lord hath commanded me for to make, I ſhall periſh. Now becauſe they would not come unto Noah to ask him this reaſon, therefore the world was condemned by him: even ſo the Saints, by making an Ark for their poor ſouls, even by getting into Chriſt, (as the Ark was a type of Chriſt without whom none can be ſaved) the Saints, I ſay, by getting into Chriſt, doe judge the whole world, when they hear there be men that be no ſwearers, and no drunkards, and that there be men that will pray, read, hear the word, confer of God and of Chriſt, and that weep and mourn for their ſins, that ſpend their times in mortification of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44191:54"/>
their luſts, and endeavour after holineſſe and ſanctification; the whole world, I ſay, is judged by them. How? why, they ſhould ſay: Sirs, what is the matter that you do ſo run after Sermons? that you keep ſuch a ſtirr about getting faith and repentance, more than other men? that you pray, weep, faſt, and mourn, and are ſo ſtrict in your works? If thus men would but come unto Gods Saints, and ask them the reaſon of all theſe things, the Saints of God would tell them, that the wrath of God would come upon them, if they did not thus, they would never be ſaved; if they did not thus beleeve, and thus repent, and thus pray, and walk thus holily and preciſely, they ſhould be all damned. But the world it falls a mocking and a ſcoffing at them, and never ſeeks to prevent the wrath of God; but it ſuddenly ſeiſeth on them to their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this teacheth us, that when there is one ſinner converted from the wickedneſſe of his wayes, and is become a Saint, then all the world may know that there is a new judge come to ſit upon them. Seeſt thou a drunkard, a ſwearer, a prophane perſon converted from his ſinnes, and now walks ſoberly, holily and purely? ſeeſt thou a man or a woman ſtruck at a Sermon? Then know, that unleſſe thou comeſt out of thy ſinnes, unleſs thou doeſt repent, and walk holily, there is a new judge added to the reſt, that ſhall judge thee. As our Saviour told the Phariſees, If I through Beelzebub caſt out Devils, by whom doe your children cast them out? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall be your judges, Matthew 12. 27. where Chriſt tels them, that their children who were his Diſciples, (for ſome of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees children did beleeve in Chriſt and follow him, and had power from Chriſt to do the ſame works that Chriſt did;) Now they liked it well enough in their owne children, but they could not endure it in Chriſt: and therefore he tells them, that their children whom God had converted, and to whom he had given power to do the ſame works that he did, even they ſhall be their Judges to condemn them: and even ſo may it be with thee, thou art a father or a mother; God having converted any of thine owne children, that childe ſhall bee thy Judge and condemne thee, if thou repent not. It may be God hath conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thy brother and ſiſter, and thou art not not converted; thy own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter ſhal condemn thee, ifthou do not repent and come out of thy ſins.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly we may learn, that it concerns all the world to take notice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> grace in Gods children; There is never a grace of God in any of his Saints but it ſhall condemn the world if it be voyd of it. The wayes of the Lord are all judgements, becauſe they judge them that will not walk in them. Every grace, yea the very thoughts of the righteous are called Judgements by Solomon, Prov. 12. You may know a crooked thing by laying it to a ſtraight line, and by that it is judged to be croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: ſo the thoughts of the righteous which are right, holy, and pure, ſhall judge the impure, unholy and crooked thoughts of wicked men. Is the child of God humble? His humility ſhall judge thy pride. Is the child of God meek and patient in ſuffering wrong and injuries? His meekneſſe and patience ſhall judge thy choler and revenge. Hath
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44191:54"/>
the child of God faith given him to beleeve in the Lord Jeſus: his faith ſhall judge thy infidelity. Hath the child of God the Spirit of prayer given him? it ſhal condemn thee that prayeſt only with thine own ſpirit. Hath he zeal? His zeal ſhall judge thy lukewarmneſſe. Doth his ſpeech and communication adminiſter grace to the hearers? It ſhall condemn thee that ſpeakeſt of vain and idle things. Yea, all the actions of thegodly ſhall judge the wicked: and hence the Saints are ſaid to do Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Zep. 2. 3. that is, they do according to Gods judgements whereby he wil judge the world: Thus they that do mourn, do judge them that do not mourn; they that bewayl their wickedneſſe, and the ſins of the times, judge them that do not: they that faſt, weep, pray, and humble themſelves for the miſeries of the Church in theſe dreadful daies, they judge them that make no good conſcience of their duties.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, learn hence, that all the texts of Scripture, all the whole word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of God, that is it that begets theſe Saints, and therefore they muſt needs judge the world, the word of God begets mens hearts unto ſanctification and holineſſe, whereby they become Saints: and therefore if they, then much more ſhall the word it ſelf judge the world: and hence it is that all the words of God in the Scripture, are called Judgements, Pſal. 105. 5. And our Saviour ſaith, The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge you in the laſt day, John 12. 48, The word that I have ſpoken, where mark, he doth not ſay, The word which you have heard: No, there are many ſwearers, and drunkards, and prophane ungodly wretches, that will not come to Church to hear the word; there are many wicked men, and dead-hearted worldlings, and rotten livers, that will not be brought to heare Gods word: it may be at this preſent, there are many whore-mongers, drunkards, and wicked perſons, that wallow in their filthineſſe; in the Ale-houſe, Game-houſe, or Drab-houſe; or in the fields, or beds, or at their ſports. Well, this word that is now a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, whether they will hear it or no, ſhall judge them at the laſt day. Now all the wicked in Aſhford, that hear the word of God calling upon them to repent, and to come out of their ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but will, not or out of contempt of Gods word, will abſent themſelves from it; this word ſhall judge and condemn them. There is never a drunkard, ſwearer, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon, though his pew be empty, but this word of God that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the eternal wrath and vengeance of God upon them, if they come not out of their ſins, this word ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt them, and condem them eternally. Oh that they could but hear it! but the word that I have ſpoken ſhall judge you, whether you hear it or not.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, hence it followes, that all the miniſters of the word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of God ſhall alſo judge the world. Son of man (ſaith God to the Prophet Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel) wilt thou judge the bloody City? Yea, thou ſhalt ſhew her all her abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Ezek. 22, 2. as if he ſhould have ſaid, Sonne of man, they are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, wilt thou not tell them of it? They are whoremaſters, wilt thou not tell them of it? They are filthy idolaters, wilt thou not tell them of it? They live in their ſins, and in their abominations, and wilt thou not tell them of it? Son of man, tell them of all their abominations, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44191:55"/>
tell them that they ſhall goe to hell, if they repent not, tell them that they are damned men if they go on, and come not out of their ſinnes: Wilt thou judge them (ſon of man?) Beloved, there is never a Miniſter in England, nor ever a Sermon that is preached by them, but it judgeth every Pariſh, and every man and woman in the congregation, that do not labour to do what is commanded them, and leave undone what is forbidden them: I ſay, it judgeth them, or elſe it is a judgement unto them.</p>
                  <p>This then ſerves to condemn three ſorts of men in the world: Firſt,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> All thoſe that deſpiſe the Saints, and that ſee not amiableneſſe in their faces. All the Countrey doth reverence the face of the Judge, when he rides his circuit; Let the Judge come into the Countrey, and all the Knights, Juſtices, and Gentlemen in the Countrey will go out to meet him, and bow unto him; yet theſe Judges are but Judges of a few rogues, male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and peaſants in the Country: Alas, they are far from the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Saints? for the Saints ſhall judge Saints and Angels: All the world, Kings and Queens, Lords and Nobles, and Captains of the Earth, the pooreſt Saint in Chriſtendome ſhall judge them. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or rather, our Saviour ſaith, To him that overcometh, and keepeth my words unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, Rev. 2. 26. Whatſoever he be, if he do the works of Chriſt, and walke in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, he ſhall have power over the Nations, not only to condemn their pomps and vanities, their luſts and corruptions, but alſo to convince their conſciences, and to condemn their ſouls for ever.</p>
                  <p>2. Shall the Saints judge the world? Then what fools are the wicked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that prepare not for theſe Judges? When the Judge comes to an Aſſiſe, all men prepare for him; the Conſtables make ready their Preſentments, the Juries are warned, and the Clerks make ready their Bills, &amp;c. leſt the Judge ſhould clap a fine upon them: and ſhall the Saints be Judges, and doſt thou not prepare thy heart by grace? Doſt thou not get purity and holineſſe againſt that day? Surely, if thou doſt not, the very Saints will judge thee unmeet for heaven, and fit only to have thy portion in hell. When Chriſt ſaid, To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, Rev. 3. 21. He adds, Let him that hath an ear, hear: Will God make his Saints to judge the world? Then let all wicked men give ear and hear what God ſaith of his Church: The Saints ſhall judge the world: Therefore let all men take notice of it, and prepare themſelves for their judgement.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It condemns all thoſe that do not ſee glory and majeſty in the faces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of Gods Saints. There is majeſty in the face of a Judge; yea a man may diſcover in them a kind of ſoveraign majeſty. Even ſo the Saints of God have a majeſty in their courſes, in their looks, in their thoughts, and in all their wayes? and in all theſe they ſhall judge and condemn the wicked. The wicked may give the Saints nick names, and ſcorn, flout, condemn, and deride them now in this life, but let me tell them, that how lightly ſoever they eſteem of them, they ſhall be their Judges: They may cry out againſt the Saints, as long ſince the wicked Sodomites did againſt good Lot, Gen. 19. 9. This fellow (ſay they) will be our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Why, what had Lot done with them? Alas, he did nothing, but when they would have done that Sodomitiſh villany againſt the two Angels that came to him, Lot went to them and ſaid, I pray you my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do not ſo wickedly. So let the godly be in the company of wicked men, that abuſe the good creatures of God; ſay, I pray you my brethren, do not ſo wickedly, be not drunkards, be not ſwearers; brethren I pray you do not ſo vainly, nor ſo prophanely uſe the name of God in your mouths; I pray you my brethren, do not prophane Gods Sabaths; do not lye, do not cheat, nor cozen, if you do theſe and theſe things, the wrath of God will plague us for it; Oh then preſently they cry out, Who made you our judges? As once the Hebrews did of Moſes, Acts 7. 39. Doſt thou call Saints hypocrites and diſſemblers, men that judge before the time? Thou fool, wert thou not as good to ſuffer the Saints to judge thee now, whereby thou maieſt ſee thy wretchedneſſe and miſerie, and by faith and ſpeedy repentance prevent that doom, which otherwiſe they tell thee will come upon thee, as hereafter, when if thou haſt not repented, thou ſhalt never eſcape that doom and vengeance, to which the Saints will judge thee? What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wilt thou not ſuffer them to call a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, a drunkard? or an adulterer, an adulterer? a blaſphemer, a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer? a carnal man, a carnall man? or a worldly man, a worldly man?</p>
                  <p>It is a pretty obſervation out of Cyprian, that becauſe Chriſt did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all ſorts of religions, and ſpared none, he reproved the Scribes, the Phariſees, the Lawyers, the Souldiers, &amp;c. and yet doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Prieſts, becauſe they were Judges of the people, not becauſe he durſt not, but he would not: If thou revileſt the Saints, thou revileſt thy Judges. Take heed then, how thou caſt the leaſt aſperſion upon the Saints; do not ſay, they are raſh Judges, uncharitable cenſurers, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling hypocrites; for they ſhall be your Judges. O that the people would hearken and be admoniſhed in time, to prevent this judgement. Our Saviour ſaith, that this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men hate it. Joh. 3. 19. But the children of God, whom God calls the light of the world, theſe lights are come into the world, and men love darkneſſe more then the light. How can the wicked eſcape dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that have ſo many thouſand Judges to condemn them? If the malefactor that is indicted for murther or felony, cannot eſcape con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that hath but one Judge to ſit upon him: thou that art a wicked man, living in thy ſins without Chriſt, how canſt thou eſcape, that haſt ſo many millions of Saints to judge thee, yea from Adam the firſt, till the laſt Saint that ſhall be upon the earth? Surely the wicked ſhall never eſcape condemnation: for,</p>
                  <p>1. God the Father, who judgeth by way of authority, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee; all judgement cometh originally from him; he that hath often commanded thee to repent, and come out of thy ſins, he ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee, becauſe thou haſt not obeyed him.</p>
                  <p>2. God the Son, he will judge thee, who judgeth by way of diſpenſation, Acts. 10. Firſt, Chriſt preacheth to thee repentance and remiſſion of ſins, to which if thou yeeld not, then know, that there is a day appointed, wherein he will judge thee. That Saviour that thou ſayeſt thou deſireſt, if thou part not with thy luſts, he himſelfe will be thy Judge that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:44191:56"/>3. God the holy Ghoſt will judge thee; that Spirit that now ſtrives and wreſtles with thee, that ſuggeſts good motions into thy heart, that puts thee in mind of repentance, bidding thee leave and forſake thy ſins, and live holily, but if thou wilt not, this Spirit ſhall judge thee by way of conviction.</p>
                  <p>4. The word of God ſhall judge thee, and that by way of form, it being the platform, according unto which Chriſt will judge the whole world. Now ſuppoſe there be forty priſoners in the Jaile together, one in for murder, another in for theft, another for treaſon, (that man that knows the Law, if there be equity and Juſtice in the Aſſiſe) he, I ſay, that knows the Law, knows who ſhal be hanged or quartered, or burned, or ſet free; even ſo, Beloved that man that looks through the Scriptures, that reads this or that Chapter, this or that ſentence, may know that or this man will to hell, if he repent not. Say I this of my ſelfe? or ſaies not the Scripture as much? The fearfull, and unbeleeving, and all that love and make lies, ſhall be caſt into that lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for ever, Rev. 12. 8. By this text the Lord Jeſus will come and judge the world: and therefore for all ſuch as live and dye in their ſins, we may all know, that they ſhall be all damn'd in fire and brimſtone for ever. Hereby I know that all they that make no conſcience of idle, vain and earthly ſpeeches, and reproachfull words, they ſhall give an account for them by this Text. Mat. 12. 56. Doth the Scripture ſay, that all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be turned into hell, with all the Nations that forget God? I know it ſhall be ſo by the text. Pſal. 10. For all things ſhall be done according to the Scriptures. Romans 2. 16. In that day (ſaith the Apoſtle) when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of mens hearts by Jeſus Chriſt according to my Goſpel; that is, juſt as Gods Miniſters preach, juſt as you find it written in the ſame Scriptures, ſo will he judge at that day.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, there is never a Text throughout the whole Scripture, that commands you to leave and forſake your ſins, but it ſhall judge you, if you do not: there is not one Text of Scripture, that commands perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any holy duty, but it ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt thee, if thou perform it not. Doth the Scripture ſay, Be not drunk with wine wherein is exceſſe? Ephe. 5. 18. It ſhall judge and condemn the drunkard that drinks exceſſively. Doth the Scripture ſay, Mortifie the members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanneſſe, inordinate affection, evill concupiſcence, and covetouſneſſe, which is Idolatry? Col. 3. 5. If notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe ſinnes live in thee, this Text ſhall riſe up and condemn thee to hell. Doth the Text ſay, That the father to the children ſhall make known Gods truth. Eſay 28. 9. Eph. 6. 4. Parents bring up your children in the nurture and information of the Lord? It ſhall riſe up in judgement and condemn thoſe parents that have not inſtructed their children to fear God. Doth the Text ſay, Thou ſhalt teach the word of God unto thy children, and that thou ſhalt talk of it when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou goeſt by the way, when thou lyeſt down, and when thou riſeſt up? Deut. 6. 7. It ſhall judge thee, becauſe thou makeſt no conſcience of holy conference. All theſe and the like Texts of Scripture, ſhall riſe up and ſtand in rank to condemn thee, that haſt not ſwayed thy heart, and framed thy life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:44191:56"/>5. All the Miniſters of God ſhall ſit as Juſtices in common, from the firſt preacher of righteouſneſſe unto the laſt; Moſes ſhall judge thee, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah, David, Eſay, Jeremy, Hoſea, Daniel, Paul, Peter, &amp;c. they ſhall all judge you: juſt as Gods Miniſters judge you here, ſo will God; he will take all his Sermons and clap them upon the heads of all rebellious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and ſo damn them for ever.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Saints ſhall judge you; yea, all the Saints from one end of the world to the other, they ſhall aſſiſt the juſt Judge of heaven and earth, and they ſhall be interpretative Judges.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, how can the wicked eſcape condemnation, that have ſo many thouſands of judges, ſo many thouſand exhortations and reproofs, ſo many thouſand admonitions and invitations, ſo many thouſand mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and proffers of Chriſt? When God the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, ſhal judge them, when heaven and all the Angels in heaven, and all the Saints on earth, ſhal judge them, and condemn them? How canſt thou eſcape? Is there never a drunkard in this congregation? is there never a ſwearer? never a prophane perſon? never a mocker? never a railer in this town, that refuſeth to hearken to the word? the men of Niniveh ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt them and condemn them, becauſe they ſtill live in their ſinnes, notwithſtanding they have had not three daies preaching, nor forty dayes ſpace only for repentance, but many years of grace calling upon them. The Queen of Sheba ſhall condemn many that live in their ſinnes, who went many hundred miles to hear the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Solomon (for going and coming it was well-nigh two thouſand miles) but you have the word of Chriſt preached in your ears, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Kingdome of God is come among you; but you will ſcarce ſtep out of your doors to receive it, or take any pains for it. This one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall judge them. There will be no way for the wicked to put off their judgement: then the ſonnes of Eli ſhall have none to advocate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them, none to cloak or cover their wickedneſſe; they ſhall then have no excuſes for themſelves: for, would they excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? the Saints ſhall judge them: would they ſend out excuſes? the Saints ſhall cut them off.</p>
                  <p>Would they in the firſt place ſay, Alas! I was ignorant, I knew not how to pray, or to read, or to meditate on the Scriptures, nor to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize my family; I was dull and blockiſh to conceive ſuch points as were taught me; and if I did live in ſinne, it was ignorance that taught it me, I was never book-learned? Saith Auguſtine, this Ignoramus that was as ignorant and as little book-learned as thou, he eſchewed thoſe ſins that thou liveſt in, got the anointing of Gods Spirit to anoint his eys, to ſee and know the things of God, which thou haſt neglected to get; he ſhall condemn thee.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond excuſe is poverty. I have no means to live on; if I ſhould run after Sermons, I ſhould beg my bread: I have a great charge to keep, and nothing but my labour to maintain them: and therefore I cannot ſpare time, for meditation; I have no while to ſtudy the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to pray and to mourn for my ſins, and to get grace. Well, the poor Cobler that liveth next door to Saint Anthony, ſhall riſe up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee, he was as poor as thou, and had as great a charge to keep as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44191:57"/>
thou: yet he mourned and wept, he got grace, and he ſet time apart for prayer, reading, meditation, holy conference; he ſhall judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they ſhall have no excuſe by imployment; I am a ſervant, I am commanded to doe this or that, I find ſo much buſineſſe to follow, that I cannot find any time for ſuch things. Another ſaith, I have great imployment, I have many Irons in the fire, and therefore God, I hope, will be mercifull unto me. Well then, Cornelius that had as many and as great imployments as thou, and Eleazar (Abrahams ſervant) who was a ſervant as well as thou, yet in as much as they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with God, and waited upon him in his ordinances, they ſhall judge thee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they ſhall have no excuſe from their callings and trades, I<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> am an Inne-keeper, and if I ſhould not ſuffer drinking, and ſwearing, and gaming, I ſhould not live. Another ſaith, I am a tradeſman, and if I ſhould ask at firſt juſt ſo much as I could take, I ſhould never bring cuſtomers to my price, and ſo I ſhould not live of my trade. Well, Rahab was an Inne-keeper, as well as thou, and yet ſhe lived by faith, and did not ſuffer ſuch wickedneſſe in her houſe. So many a tradeſman, that had the ſame trade, and the ſame imployment with thee, and as great a trade as thou, and yet have avoyded theſe ſins and evils that thou falleſt into: they ſhal judge thee.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they ſhall have no excuſe from the times they live in; Alas (ſaith one) I live in wretched times, all the world is given to ſin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I ſhould be ſo ſtrict and preciſe in my wayes, if I ſhould run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſermons, pray, ſing Pſalms &amp;c. all the world would be againſt me. There are no profeſſors of religion but are reproached and miſcalled, I ſhould loſe all my friends, I ſhould be hated and oppoſed; yea, it may be (the time being ſuch) I ſhould be accuſed to Councils, and have my life queſtioned; there is nothing but diſgrace and reproach, and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherefore I was afraid, and did diſpenſe with my conſcience. Ah wretch! that man that lived in thoſe wicked times, in the ſame town with thee; that had the ſame hatred and reproach that thou waſt afraid of, that hath endured all the rebukes of Chriſt that thou waſt aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of, yet he went on, and continued unto the end; he ſhall judge thee.</p>
                  <p>The uſe is for the juſt reproof of many of the Saints of God, becauſe they<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> are not ſo circumſpect and watchfull over their wayes, as they ought. Doſt thou judge others (ſaith the Apoſtle) and yet doſt the ſame things thy ſelf? Romans 2. 2. So may I ſay to all ſuch, Will you give way to ſin? will you ſuffer your luſts and corruptions to ſway you, and not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to root out or kill them rather? how wilt thou then judge the world? How wilt thou then be able to riſe up in judgement againſt the wicked, to judge them for ſuch ſinnes wherein thou alloweſt and liveſt thy ſelf? Surely God will never account thee for a Saint, if he cannot judge the world by thee. Oh this ſhould rend the heart and bowels of thoſe that go for Chriſtians, that go for Saints, yet live not as Saints ſhould live. If God cannot take thee, and judge the world by thee; if he cannot take thy life, and judge the life of the Pagans, infidels, all luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm earthly and ſecure ſinners, he will not account thee for a Saint.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44191:57"/>
This then firſt condemns all unholineſſe in the lives of them that be Saints. Beloved, if we did but live like the Saints of God in holineſſe and purity in the ways of God, the Lord would put ſuch ſplendor and glory upon us, that would even daunt the very face of our enemies, and make them ſtand amazed at Saints. But it is the contrary with us, the glory of God is departed from us, Spain, France, and other Nations fear us not: Why? the righteouſneſſe and purity of Religion is departed from us. For you ſhall have a Saint come into the company of a wicked man, and yet the ſwearer will not be afraid to ſwear before him, the drunkard will not be afraid to be drunk before him, the filthy ſpeaker will not be afraid to utter rotten ſpeeches before him, the lyer will not be afraid to lye before him, the worldly man will not be afraid to diſcover his vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before him by his carnal and filthy conference. Beloved, all this is, becauſe the Saints have loſt their glory; if they did live as Saints ought to live, the wicked would tremble to work wickedneſſe before them. Though a wicked man be a drunkard, &amp; abuſe the good creatures of God when no Saint is in his company, yet if a Saint were preſent, he would tremble and not dare to do it. Though he were a ſwearer, a filthy talker, a vain worldling amongſt his companions, yet if he come in the Saints com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and the Saints ſtand in Gods councel, then would the wicked trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quake to do ſuch things: then would they lick in their tongues, and not dare to ſpeak any ſuch blaſphemous oaths, ſuch vain and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable words, filthy lyes and ſlanders; It is ſaid of thoſe that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Apoſtles words, and were added to the Church, that the fear of them came upon the world, Acts 2. 41. Why, did the Diſciples go with ſwords and guns, &amp;c. to keep men in awe thereby? No, they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and did live according thereto, and this made all the world afraid of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this condemns the little difference that is betwixt the wicked of the world, and ſome Saints, in their lives and manners: Beloved, is there ſo little difference between the Judge and the priſoners, that any one need to come and ſay, I pray you Sir, ſhew me which is the Judge, and which is the malefactor? is there not a plain difference both in apparell and carriage? the one is in rich apparell, and the other in ſtinking and filthy cloaths, having his hands manacled, and his legs chained. But it is to be feared, that many of the Saints have neglected holineſſe and purity in their carriage and actions which they perform, that one can hardly tell which is a Saint, and which is a reprobate. If a man deal with a Saint, and deal with a wicked man, he ſeeth no difference betwen them. Let a Saint do any action, either pray, hear, or conferre, let a wicked man do the like, there is ſuch dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſuch carnality, ſuch worldly-mindedneſſe, ſuch lukewarmneſſe of affection, that one can hardly tell which is the Saint, and which is the hypocrite. Beloved, if the Saints did live like Saints, there would be as plain a difference between a Saint and a wicked man, in in their lives and behaviour, as is betwixt the Judge and the Rogue that is to be judged by him. Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant Job, (ſaith God) how there is none like him in all the earth? Job 1. 4. 8. If
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44191:58"/>
a man come to be a Saint indeed, there is never a wicked man in the Town and Countrey, that lives and doth as he doth, and walks as he walks, nor prayes as he prayes, nor hears the word as he hears it, nor that confers or meditates as he doth, that beleeves and repents as he doth, that ſtrives againſt his luſts as he doth: there is none like him in all the world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it condemns the ſcandalouſneſſe of many Profeſſors in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours and actions. Oh how do wicked men inſult and exclaim here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to ſee a Profeſſor led away and overcome by ſome luſt! What (ſay they) are theſe they that are led by the Spirit of God? are theſe your devout men? Why they can covet and ſcrape as well as others; they can couſen and lye as well as others. I, thoſe that are your great Profeſſors, and hot-ſpurrs, they are as coveteous, as worldly, as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el as others, though they will not be drunk, nor ſwear, yet they will couſen and lye, as well as others. The conſideration whereof, made the Prophets heart to bleed in him, and to pray, O purge me from my murder and adultery, and all other my ſecret ſinnes, leſt I caſt mire and dirt in the faces of thy children, cauſing them to bear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches of my ſinns. Oh let not thoſe that ſeek thee, be aſhamed for my ſake, Pſalm. 69. For thy ſake that liveſt ſcandalouſly and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, for thy ſake that liveſt covetouſly, and ſcraping after the world, that art ſo unjuſt in thy dealings and promiſes, mire and dirt, ſcandals and reproaches are caſt upon the children. For thy looſeneſſe, yea for thy carnal liberty it is that the true profeſſors of Religion are reproached, ſuſpected, and hardly cenſured in the world. What did Jacob when he was to walk with the people of the Land? Geneſis 35. 5. 6. he purged his houſe, and (ſaith the Text) the terror of God was upon all the City, he made them all to tremble at him. I tell you, all the wicked in Aſhford would tremble at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors that live therein, if they did live and carry themſelves like Saints indeed. Oh if all thoſe that did profeſſe themſelves to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, were Chriſtians indeed; and that profeſſe themſelves to be Saints, were Saints indeed, living in the power and ſanctification of holineſſe; then men would ſay of themſelves, of a truth God is in theſe men, Chriſt dwels in them, and the Spirit of God leads and governs them indeed. If thou wouldeſt judge the world, take heed how the world judgeth thee, leſt thou with the world be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned eternally. It was ſaid that Herod feared John, becauſe he was a juſt man, Mark 6. 23. So if all thy neighbours did know that thou were a juſt man, a holy and conſcionable man in all thy wayes, and in all thy actions, and that cannot endure ſwearing, lying, and deceit, but did ſee that thou waſt juſt, and one that feared God truly, they would all fear thee.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle, in this Chapter, taxeth two abuſes which were then amongſt the Corinthians: Firſt, the unſeemly habit of women in the congregation, from the 1 verſe to the 17. Secondly, the prophane uſage of the holy Communion, both by men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from the 17 verſe to the end of the Chapter: and herein, from the 23. verſe to the end of the 25 he ſets down the Inſtitution of the Lords Supper; and thence raiſeth a point of Doctrine;</p>

                  <p>So we may read in the 28 verſe; But let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup: As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Unleſſe a man examine himſelf, and ſearch his own heart, and find out his ſins, and dive into the ſecrets of his ſoul, to bring out his hidden corruptions, confeſſing them, and judging himſelfe for them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, let them never preſume to come to the holy Sacrament.</p>

So oft as you Eat of this Bread and Drink of this Cup, you ſhew forth the Lords death till he come. It is a reaſon that the men of this world are not acquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and therefore it was a good wiſh of a Reverend Father, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſhould never be miniſtred but there ſhould be a Sermon, to teach men the nature of it, and to inſtruct them in the Myſtery thereof. We approach unto the Sacrament hand over head, living in our ſinnes, not ſhewing by our coming that Chriſt is dead; we ſay, &amp; we profeſs that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, and yet not withſtanding our ſins live in us, as if Chriſt had not died for us, or as if we would proclaim, that his death had no effect in us. For were we dead with Chriſt, then ſin and the living occaſions of ſin, would be dead in us alſo. My beloved, we ſhould never come to this Sacrament, but we ſhould ſhew forth the Lords death thereby, that is, that Chriſt is dead (or rather dyed) for ſin, and that ſin is alſo dead in us.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon is taken from the damned wrong we offer unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> if we come in our ſins, for we are guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt, as it is in the 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſe; nay, thou ſinneſt againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt not a jot leſſe, than Pilate that condemned him, than Judas that betrayed him, and the Jews that cryed out, Crucifie him, crucifie him: yea thou art as much guilty, as if thy own hand in thy own perſon had been imbrued in his bloud. Now we know it is a horrible ſin to be guilty of the blood and murther of an ordinary man, yea of a very rogue; how much more is it a great and fearfull ſin to be guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the onely and eternall Sonne of God? Yet comeſt thou to this holy Communion, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt no leſſe than the guilt of the Body and bloud of Chriſt upon thy ſoul?</p>
                  <p>The third Reaſon is taken from the wofull wrong and injury that man<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> brings upon his own ſoul, that comes unpreparedly without examination of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; in the 20. verſe, he eateth and drinketh his own damnation; that is, he maketh himſelfe guilty of, and lyable to the ſame vengeance that the crucifiers of Chriſt had inflicted on them. Good had it been for that man (ſaith Chriſt of Judas) if that he had never been born: So may I ſay, Good had it been for that man and that woman, if they had never been borne, who come unworthily unto the Table of the Lord: for when they eat of that Bread, they eat their own bane; and when they drinke of that Cup, they drinke their own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſe. You come together (ſaith the Apoſtle) not for the better, but for the worſe. Whereas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f they would have come worthily, they ſhould have gone away the better, they ſhould have received more grace and holineſſe to walk with God, more power and ſtrength againſt ſin and corruption; yea, the Lord would have ratified and confirmed his Covenant with them; whereas living in contention, and not coming with preparation, they grow the worſe by the Sacrament. The Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans thought that the Apoſtle would have praiſed them for their coming to Church, and receiving the Sacrament: Shall I praiſe you? (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) in this I praiſe you not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He makes an uſe of terror againſt all thoſe that dare come in<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> their ſins unto this holy Sacrament of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his ſins unto the Table of the Lord, 1. Though he may think he receives the Communion, yet he doth not: for this is not the Table of the Lord, but the Table of devils. It is true, thou receiveſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the body and blood of Chriſt; but yet coming in thy ſins, thou receiveſt not his body and blood, as of a Saviour to ſave thee from thy ſins: Indeed thou receiveſt the body and blood of Chriſt ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; but it is as the Judge to condemn thee unto the pit of deſtruction, for thy damned impudency in coming ſo unworthily unto this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For that man cannot eat the body of Chriſt, that is not a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt; therefore thou muſt be a limb of Chriſt, if ever thou wilt receive worthily.</p>
                  <p>2. If a man come unto the Sacrament, and come in his ſins, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his own deſtruction: for though it be a ſweet banquet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh an humble and weary ſoul, and to make it walk more cheerfully in the wayes of God, all the dayes of his life: yet he that cometh unto it in his ſins, and receiveth it in his uncleanneſſe, ſpeedeth thereby, his own damnation, and receiveth it as his v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aticum to hell. The Apoſtle compares Baptiſme to the Red Sea, 1. Cor. 10. from which place Cryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome ſaith, that as the Red Sea was a way for the Iſraelites to paſſe through to Canaan? ſo it was as a grave to ſwallow up the Egypptians to their deſtruction: So the Lords Supper is as a grave, an open pit whereby many plunge themſelves into eternall deſtruction; but as a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot to the godly to carry them to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by coming in thy ſinnes, thou makeſt thy ſelfe lyable to Gods<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> temporary plagues and judgements; as appears in my Text, For this cauſe many are ſick and weak among you, and many are fallen aſleep, [For this cauſe] which is not only a note of concluſion, but of the cauſe: For this cauſe, namely, becauſe they examine not themſelves, but come in their ſins and receive it unworthily. One man hath a diſeaſe in his body, that he liveth not out halfe his dayes; another is ſick and weak neer unto death; a third is fallen aſleep. Wherefore? why (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) for this cauſe of receiving unworthily the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for instruction, that becauſe the people of God as well<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> as wicked men, are guilty of unworthy coming to the Lords Table,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44191:61"/>
therefore he exhorts them, that if they would not have the Lord judge them, that they would judge themſelves, as in the 31. verſe. For if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged of the Lord. If we would ſit down and ſearch our own hearts, and try our own ſpirits, and pry into our owne boſomes, and out with our old corruptions, and unclean luſts, and enter into a new covenant with God, of holy walking before him for after-time, if we would thus judge and condemn our ſelves, and mortifie our ſinnes, comming with grace unto this holy banquet, that we might come with comfort unto this bleſſed Sacrament, aſſuring our ſelves that we ſhall eſcape the judgement of the Lord. For thoſe of the Corinthians whom God ſtruck with ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, and death, it was to inſtruct others that are well and in health, that they venture not to enter upon theſe holy myſteryes with unholy hearts, and unclean hands.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he concludeth with an uſe of exhortation in the 33, and 34. verſes: Wherefore brethren when ye come together to partake of the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, tarry one for another: As if he ſhould have ſaid, Away with all your diſorders, and come not with a temporall, but with a ſpirituall appetite; provide not thy teeth, but thy heart for theſe dainties: for this is not a feaſt for the body, but for the ſoul; therefore away with all your diſorders and unſeemly coming unto this bleſſed Sacrament, take heed and repent of this ſin among you, and of all other ſins which you know your own conſcience to be guilty of, and ſo come unto this holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                  <p>Now, the verſe that I have read to you, is a part of that uſe of terror which the Apoſtle makes againſt the unworthy receivers of the Sacrament; and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Gods ſevere hand and puniſhment againſt thoſe that come unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily: wherein note three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the cauſe of their puniſhment, which is the unworthy eating of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Communion: For this cauſe many are ſick and weak among you and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are fallen aſleep.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the puniſhment inflicted for this ſin, weakneſſe, ſickneſse, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> mortality: For it ſeems (ſaith Peter Martyr) that the Lord ſent a ſore plague and peſtilence among them, to revenge himſelf of them for their abuſe of the Sacrament, for this cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is the Delinquents, which are you Corinthians: Many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are ſick and weak among you, and in them all others that come unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Chryſoſtom notes here, that our Apoſtle doth not fetch here an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or example of judgement from others, as he had done in the former chapter; but he brings it from themſelves, who ſenſibly felt the wrath of God upon them for this very ſin: As if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, How is it, O Corinthians, that you dare venture to come unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſo unpreparedly, and that you have no more regard of ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a buſineſſe as is the receiving of the body and blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? See you not the wrath of God upon your dwellings, and the curſe of heaven to take hold of your town? you ſee it this very time, that ſome are weak and very ſick amongſt you, near unto death, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44191:61"/>
others have been ſtruck with death before your eyes, and the wrath of God is not removed; but lies yet upon you: What, will you alwayes goe on, and never ceaſe to provoke the Lord to indignation and wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you for your ſins, until his jealouſie hath utterly conſumed you, and clean cut you off? and howſoever many of you may think that this ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, and mortality comes upon you by chance, as from the infection of the ayr, or other ſecundary cauſes, I tell you nay, but it is for this cauſe onely, even your unworthy coming to the Supper of the Lord. Whence we may obſerve this point of inſtruction:</p>
                  <p>That God doth moſt ſeverely puniſh the unworthy receivers of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>He puniſhed the Corinthians here with ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, feavers, peſtilence, death temporall, and God knows how many with death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. Theodoret obſerves, that the Apoſtle told them of a thing that was acted amongſt them, for if he had told them of ſuch judgements as had been hid from them, and not manifeſt before their eyes, as if they had not felt the ſickneſſe in their bodies, and heard the bels tolling day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their ears, they might have thought that the Apoſtle had but lyed unto them. So the people of Iſrael, as we may read in 1 Cor. 10. 2, 3. verſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were baptized in the Cloud and in the Sea, and they did all eat the ſame ſpirituall meat, and drink the ſame ſpirituall drink; yet, as it is in the fifth verſe, with many of them God was not well pleaſed. Nay God was ſo wroth with them, that within the ſpace of forty years, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them were deſtroyed by death here, and God knoweth how many thouſands of them in hell. For God ſpeaketh of hell, as well as of death, and their ſin was ſo great, that it made God confirm it with an oath, that they ſhould never enter into his reſt. And Saint Cyprian ſaith, that the Lord hath ſhewed many miracles, and declared many fearfull judgements upon the unworthy receivers of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Judas, who Ambroſe thought received the Sacrament (though Hilary and others that he did not, but only that he did eat the Paſſeover, and was coming to the Sacrament alſo) but ſee his doom, John 13. as ſoon as ever he received the ſop, the Devil entred into him; and ſo it is with all ſuch as come to the Communion in their ſins without repentance, and unfeigned reſolution of walking ever after worthy the Sacrament, I ſay unto all and every one of them, that as ſoon as ever thou receiveſt the Bread and Wine into thy mouth, thou receiveſt the devil together with it; as ſoon as ever it goeth down into thy bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Devill goeth after it, and taketh more full poſſeſſion of thy heart and ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why the Lord doth ſo ſeverely puniſh both with temporall judgements and with ſpirituall curſes, the unworthy receivers of the Sacrament, is, in regard of the author of the Sacrament, who is Chriſt: and that not only as he was man, (as the Papiſts would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve) but Chriſt as he was God did inſtitute the ſame. So ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the 23. verſe, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the ſame night that he was betray'd, took bread and brake it, when he had given thanks, and ſaid, Take ye, and eat ye, for this is my body which is broken for you. Now if the Lord Jeſus did inſtitute it, what an accurſed thing is it for any to defile it, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44191:62"/>
ſo ſin againſt Chriſt? it is a damnable thing to ſin againſt God; but to ſin againſt God, as he is God in Chriſt, is damnably damnable. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in the ſecond Pſalm exhorts to kiſſe the Son leſt he be angry, and ſo thou periſh: as if he ſhould ſay, Adore the Son, Adore the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo come and eat of this bread, and drink of this Cup: for if he be angry, thou wilt ſurely periſh: If thou ſin againſt God and ſo go out of the way, Chriſt upon thy repentance will ſet thee in again; but if thou ſinneſt againſt God in Chriſt, who is the Way, the Life, and the Truth, thou ſhalt ſurely periſh from the right way: for there is no other way to bring thee in again, Acts 4. 12. Therefore wofull is thy caſe, and miſerable is thy condition, if thou ſinneſt againſt Chriſt, prophaning his holy Ordinances which he himſelfe hath inſtituted, and abuſeſt and deſpiſeſt that bleſſed Spirit of his, that comes to ſeal unto thee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that he hath purchaſed by his bloud. Better had it been for thee that thou hadſt never been born: for if he be wroth, bleſſed only are all they that put their truſt in him, and come preparedly unto his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that by faith imbrace the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but woe unto all prophane perſons that live in their ſins: if his wrath be but a little kindled, then woe to all drunkards, ſwearers, and unclean perſons; but bleſſed is that man that is come out of his ſins. For if his wrath be ſo terrible when it is but a little kindled, O how much more fearfull will it be when it is deeply incenſed! Therefore if thou comeſt unto this holy Sacrament in thy ſins, without due preparation and examination, what doeſt thou but even ſet the wrath of God burning upon thy ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from the very bottom of hell?</p>
                  <p>When the Lord delivered the Law upon Mount Sinai, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people to ſanctifie themſelves; yea if a beaſt did but touch the mountain, he muſt dye for the ſame, even be ſtoned to death, or thruſt through with a dart, Heb. 12. Much more then now, when the Lord doth deliver the Goſpel, eſpecially the ground-work and maſter-peece thereof, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that in the moſt bleſſed manner that ever God exhibited himſelfe unto man; how much more doth God require purity and holineſſe, that all ſuch as come to receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the bleſſed Sacrament ſhould be ſanctified, purging their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cleanſing their ſouls from all their ſin and uncleanneſſe? Should not a beaſt touch the mountain where God did appear, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou touch the body of Chriſt, and drink his bleſſed bloud in thy ſinnes? The very angels of heaven will curſe thee, and the clouds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will pour down ſhowers of vengeance upon thee: for God hath more ſevere puniſhments to inflict upon ſinners under the Goſpell, than he uſed under the Law, though then he ſtruck them with more viſible and ſenſible plagues and judgements than ordinarily he bringeth upon men now: as Gehazi for his covetouſneſſe was ſtrucken with leproſie; Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, the earth opened her mouth and ſwallowed them up quick for their rebellion againſt the Lord: Er and Onan were ſtrucken dead for their wickedneſſe; Jeroboam had his hand withered for ſtretching of it forth to ſtrike the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. And though the Lord bring not ſuch ſenſible puniſhments now
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44191:62"/>
as he did then, yet he knows how to puniſh the world a thouſand times more than he did then, at this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As a father hath other kinds of puniſhments for his ſon, when he is grow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> up, than he had when he was in coats, and but a child; then a twig or two would ſerve the turn; but if he come to mans eſtate, and then rebell againſt his father, it may be that he will diſinherit him, and caſt him out of his family: So in former time God did ſcourge and whip his people when they ſinned againſt him: but now he hath drawn out his Church to this age, even to the age of the Goſpel, he hath ſeverer ſtrokes of plagues and curſes, wherewith to confound all prophane and impenitent ſinners, that dare to abuſe that bleſſed Sacrament of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, in regard of the matter of the Sacrament, which is Chriſt alſo; who as he was the efficient cauſe, ſo in regard of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental relation, he is the matter of the Cummunion, 1 Cor. 10. 16. The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the bloud of Chriſt? and the bread which we break, is it not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Communion of the body of Chriſt? Now the better matter any thing is of, the more heynous is the defilement of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A maſter will not be ſo angry for caſting his earthen veſſels into the mire, as he will be for caſting his rich jewels. The Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, are the bleſſed Communion of the precious body and bloud of Chriſt, and dareſt thou defile them? knoweſt thou not that thou doſt greatly encreaſe the wrath of the Lord againſt thy ſoul thereby? That ſoul whatever it was from Dan to Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba, that came in his uncleanneſſe to partake of any of thoſe holy things which the children of Iſrael hallowed to the Lord, whether he were man, or woman, rich or poor, that perſon was to be cut off from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, Levit. 12. whereto the Lord ſets his Seal for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof (I am the Lord:) and as ſure as I am the Lord, ſo will I ſee it accompliſhed. So my beloved, let me ſay unto you of England, from Dover to Newcaſtle, or from the one end of the town unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſoul who toucheth any one of theſe holy things with an impure heart, and cometh to partake of them with his uncleanneſſe upon him, living in his ſinnes, and wallowing in his luſts, caſting off the fear of the Lord, and making no conſcience to walk in Gods wayes, that ſoul ſhall ſurely be cut off that cometh ſo unworthily unto the Table of the Lord; not only the hand that taketh it, and the mouth that eateth it, but even the very ſoul of him that cometh, ſhall periſh from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord. So Levit. 7. 20. That ſoul that eateth of the fleſh of the Sacrifices of peace offerings, that pertain unto the Lord, having his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſse upon him, even that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people. Now you know that all thoſe ſacrifices had relation unto Chriſt; but yet under the Law they were but ſhadows, and typicall relations, and were not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lievly and effectuall means for the exhibiting of Chriſt, as the Lords Supper is. And therefore if ſuch as came in their uncleanneſse unto them, were puniſhed with no leſſe puniſhment than a cutting off from fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Lords people; what wrath and vengeance will the Lord bring upon thee that comeſt with thy uncleanneſſe upon thee unto this holy Communion? Auguſtine ſaith, that man that receiveth the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44191:63"/>
Sacrament unworthily, receiveth a great plague to his own ſoul, and a great torment to his own conſcience, yea and heapeth up a ſtore of wrath unto himſelf againſt the day of wrath. Me thinks thou that liveſt in thy ſinnes, and wilt not come out of them; when thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt theſe words [This is my body] and ſeeſt the bread broken before thy face, it ſhould even make thee tremble and quake to look upon it, more to touch it, and moſt of all to taſt it: for it is the Communion of the body and bloud of Chriſt; and how dareſt thou come in thy ſins to defile it?</p>
                  <p>A third Reaſon is, in regard of the form of the Sacrament, which is Chriſt too, for as he is the efficient cauſe that inſtituted it, and as he is alſo the matter of the Sacrament, ſo in the third place Chriſt is the form of the Sacrament alſo, wherein the confirming grace of God is ſealed up unto thee: Now as it is treaſon for a man to offer contempt unto the Kings broad Seal; ſo certainly is it high treaſon againſt this King of Kings, to contemn this bleſſed Sacrament, which is the Seal of the righteouſneſſe of faith. If thou ſhouldeſt clip the Kings Coyn, I will ſay that thou art a Traitor. Oh what a traytor art thou then, yea, accurſed traytor in the account of God and Chriſt, if thou clippeſt his holy Communion, if thou clip it of thy examination, and due preparation, and ſo come hand over head, not regarding ſo holy an Ordinance. Thou ſinneſt againſt the Court of heaven. That which Saint James ſpeaks in general of the whole worſhip of God [Draw near unto God] let me apply it in particular unto this drawing near unto God in his holy Communion, James 4. 8. Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purifie your hearts ye double-minded. Draw near unto God in the hearing, reading and meditating on Gods Word; draw near unto God in Prayer, and in his holy Sacrament, and receive it for your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life. [Draw near unto God] I, that I wil, (ſaith the wicked man) I wil come to Church, and draw near unto the holy Communion. Will you ſo? (ſaith the Apoſtle:) No, firſt, Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purge your hearts ye double-minded: As if he ſhould ſay, never think of drawing near unto God, or ſetting foot on this holy ground, and handling thoſe holy myſteries of Chriſt, unleſſe thou firſt purge thy heart, and cleanſe thy ſoul from all thy filthy luſts and curſed corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leſt otherwiſe, thou coming in thy ſins with thy uncleanneſſe on thee, and ſo receiving unworthily, thou eateſt and drinkeſt thine own damnation (as our Engliſh tranſlation hath it) damnation to thy ſelf, and not to another. No, God forbid, that thou ſhouldeſt by thy unworthy coming, eat and drink condemnation to another, for thou that art a child of God, and comeſt unto the Table of the Lord with repentance, and a ſound meaſure of preparation, though others that ſit in the ſame pew with with thee, for their prophaneneſſe eat and drink their own damnation, yet thou ſhalt be ſure to receive the ſeal and aſſurance of thy reconciliation and ſalvation, with free acceptance of God, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for every man ſhall bear his own burden.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Reaſon is, in regard of the end of the Sacrament, which is Chriſt alſo: For as he is the efficient, material, and formal cauſe, ſo Chriſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44191:63"/>
is alſo the final cauſe of the Sacrament: So it is in the 26 verſe, As oft as you eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, you ſhew forth the Lords death until he come. Not that Chriſt may be eaten with the teeth, or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received in the Sacrament, or as if he were there productively, or tranſubſtantially, (as the Papiſts ſay;) no, the Apoſtle ſhews, that the end of the celebration of this Sacrament, is to ſhew forth the death of Chriſt untill he come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>I, but (ſay the Romiſts) unleſſe we eat the body and drink the blood of Chriſt really; and not the conſecrated bread and wine, how can any man by this unworthy communicating, eat and drink his own damnation, and make himſelf guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer</note>I anſwer, a man cannot bring this guilt upon himſelfe by eating a peece of bread, or drinking a cup of wine; but the Apoſtle hath an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſo fitted for this, as that all the Papiſts in the world ſhall never be able to gain ſay; and therefore I pray you to mark it: for he hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe two verſes together; as oft as you eat of this bread and drink of this cup, you ſhew forth the Lords death till he come: Wherefore whoſoever eateth this bread or drinketh this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord; even for this cauſe, becauſe it is the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of Chriſts death till he come. Therefore if thou eateſt and drinkeſt unworthily, coming in thy ſins, and reſolveſt to go on in them, that as thou wert proud before thou cameſt to the Sacrament, ſo thou art ſtill; as thou wert cholerick, angry, and impatient before, ſo thou art ſtill; as thou wert luke-warm and dead-hearted in Gods ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo thou remaineſt ſtill, remember I pray thee, that as oft as thou haſt come unto the Communion in thoſe thy ſins, thou haſt made thy ſelfe guilty of the body and blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore I beſeech you to look to it, and in time to repent, and pray with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet David Pſ. 51. Deliver me from blood-guiltineſse, O Lord, even from the blood of thy Son, leſt one day it be laid unto thy charge and required ſtraitly at thy hands. For, for this cauſe many are ſick among you, and many weak.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo then, that the Lord doth ſo ſeverely puniſh the unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the Sacrament? Take notice (I pray you) then from whence co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, and mortality, and the reaſon why the Lord doth ſend ſo many kinde of ſorrowes, croſſes, and miſeries upon men; namely, becauſe of the unworthy receiving of the Lords Supper. So ſaith Maſter Calvin, why do you wonder to ſee ſuch wars, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of wars, that there is ſo many blood-ſheds, ſo many Towns and Cities ruinated, and ſo many Countries ſacked and depopulated, ſo many calamities come upon the Churches abroad, and ſo many plagues and ſcourges to over-run Chriſtendome at this day, is not the cauſe plain enough? men come unto the Table of the Lord careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unworthily. And, beloved, we ſhall never ſee the Lord take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his judgements here from the earth, until we betake our ſelves to a more diligent and holy receiving of the Sacrament. For this very cauſe there are ſo many ſtrange diſeaſes amongſt us, never formerly known or heard of untill theſe dayes, as, the French-Pox, the Engliſh ſweat (as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44191:64"/>
they call it) that even the Phyſitians themſelves are blunted at them, and (as Peter Martyr well obſervs) hence are all diſeaſes, as plagues, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilences, (which were late amongſt us) dropſies, bloody-Flux, Agues, Apoplexies, Convulſions, burning-Feavers, and Impoſtumes, &amp;c. and all for this cauſe. One man hath fallen into a Feaver, and we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the cauſe whence he took it; but in truth the communion hath caſt him into his Feaver, and the Lord will avenge himſelf on him for the ſame. Another is ſick, and he thinks that a cold hath brought it upon him; but it is the unworthy receiving of the Sacrament that is truly the cauſe of it. A third man dyeth before his time, even in his full ſtrength, before in the courſe of nature he hath ended half his daies; but the cauſe is unworthy coming to the Communion, which hath taken hold on him, and cut off the thread of his life.</p>
                  <p>Many there be that expound theſe words in a ſpirituall ſenſe, Many are ſick and weak and many are fallen aſleep, that is to ſay, many have their conſciences ſeared, and their hearts hardened, &amp;c. and this is true alſo, that becauſe men come unpreparedly, they have their hearts har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and their conſciences ſeared, and their ſoul plagued with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpirituall plagues. But it is as true alſo in temporall judgements, thou haſt had many afflictions, and much ſickneſs laid unto thee; but thank thy ſelfe for it; namely, becauſe thou haſt come unworthily unto the communion, thou haſt had much weakneſſe in thy body, which hath coſt thee much money, and weakned thy eſtate; but thy unholy coming unto the Sacrament, is that which thou maieſt thank for it. Thou haſt been reproched and contemned, and endured much ſhame; but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, that it proceeds from the fore-going cauſe, and that is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reaſon why the Lord hath brought theſe and many other evils up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee. Thou canſt ſay the Commandements (for the moſt part) by rote; but thou didſt never know the myſterie of this one Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. Behold, the Communion is one of Gods own names, and how many thouſands are there in the world that take this name of God in vain? Is there never a drunkard here in this congregation, that hath been at the Sacrament? Is there never a whoremonger, never a covetous worldling? Where is the man, whoſoever he be among you all, that is ſuch a one? He is in the ſtate of damnation. Is there never a luke-warm and carnal Chriſtian, that contents himſelfe with a formall worſhip, and a dead performance of holy duties, that hath no zeal for God, nor courage for his truth, but is careleſſe of all Gods commandements? whoſoever amongſt you are guilty of theſe ſins, or any other, and hath come unto this holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in them, they are the perſons, that how oft ſoever they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo oft they have taken this name of the Lord in vain: And if I ſhould examine this Congregation from the one end of it unto the other, I fear that every pew would yeild ſome one, if not many that have taken a Communion (which is one of Gods names) in vain. Should I but examine thee that comeſt unto the Communion this day, how by the laſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou receivedſt, and the laſt Sermon thou haſt heard, thy faith is ſtrengthened, thy repentance renewed, and thy obedience is increaſed,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44191:64"/>
and thy care doubled for to walk with God? whether thou art made by them more zealous for God, more forward in his worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and every day more holy and heavenly-minded; if not, then t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> haſt taken this Name of the Lord thy God in vain, and the Lord will not hold thee guiltleſs, that is, the Lord will not take away the guilt from thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but he wil let thy ſin lye open, and thou ſhalt not be cleanſed from it, nor juſtified by the very blood of Jeſus Chriſt, but it ſhall reſt upon thee to thy utter ruine and deſtruction, unleſſe thou forſake thy ſins, and ſo come preparedly unto this holy Table and banquet. I know there is a convenant of grace, a ſweet refreſhing for every humbled ſoul that is hungry and broken for his ſins, and for every poor diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; let all ſuch come and lay their ſin upon Chriſts croſſe, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: But if there be any that come in their ſins, and will not reform their lives, but be as they came ſinners, and ſo they mean to continue, the Lord himſelf will lay this mans ſins upon his own head, and they ſhall never be taken away from him, but Chriſt ſhall at the day of judgement pronounce him a guilty perſon, to his eternal condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>King Belſhazzar that abuſed but the holy Veſſels of the Temple, and the Cups thereof, what a ſmall plague befel him for it? Dan. 5. 27, 28. God hath numbred thy Kingdome and finiſhed it, thou art weighed in the ballance, and art found too light, thy kingdom is departed from thee, and is given to the Medes and Perſians. So (beloved brethren) if any of you ſhall abuſe this Cup of the Lord, coming to it with a filthy unclean heart, and polluted conſcience, and earthly affections, there is a hand-writing againſt every ſoul that thus cometh this day unto the Table of the Lord: thou art numbred and weighed and found too light: Thou O man and woman, whoſoever thou art that prophaneſt and contemneſt theſe holy things of God, thou ſhalt be found out, and the Lord will keep thee out by his ſpirituall plagues, and thy ſin ſhall never be done away, but be required at thy hands, and ſtand in everlaſting record againſt thee; O my brethren, that you would but ſeriouſly conſider it, and look about you, it being ſo weighty a thing that ſo nearly concerns every one of you.</p>
                  <p>But I would not have any poor broken heart and humble Soul to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me, and ſo thereby be diſcouraged: but give me leave (I pray you) to uſe the words of the Prophet, though ſpoken in another ſenſe, Pſal. 115. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the glory: So let me apply this doctrine unto the comfort of all poor broken-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinners, and beate off all carnal prophane wretches that live in their ſins; not unto you, O drunkards, &amp; ſwaggerers, not unto you whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters and unclean perſons, that wallow in ungodlineſſe, I ſay not unto you, but unto the poor afflicted ſoul and contrite ſpirit that lieth bleeding and gaſping under the weight of his ſin, and that trembles and fears being oppreſt with the ſenſe of its own unworthineſs, panting and breathing after Chriſt Jeſus, and ſuing earneſtly unto the Throne of grace for mercy and forgiveneſſe: unto thee only belongs this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and therefore take it home to thee, and know it for thy ſelf. Art
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44191:65"/>
thou troubled with a hard heart, and an unbeleeving ſoul, and art even wearyed and tyred out with thy many ſins and infirmities? Come thou with comfort unto this holy Communion: for thou ſhalt be ſure to find ſaving good by it; to thee it ſhall be a ſpirituall medicine to heal all thy diſeaſes, and to cure all thy ſtrong and prevailing corruptions; and if thou come unto this holy Table of the Lord, it ſhall make thee, as it is recorded of Saint Laurence, able to ſuffer Martyrdom, and to get victory over all thy unruly affections; yea at laſt thou ſhalt tread Satan thy arch-enemy under thy feet. Thefore be not diſmayed, for the Lord Jeſus invites thee to come. What if thy infirmities be many, yet the mercies of God, which he tenders to thee in this Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are many more. Samſon who was the ſtrongeſt Souldier and Companion in his time that was in Iſrael to overcome the Philistims, he yet began his ſtrength in weakneſſe, being at the firſt overcome by a woman: So though the Lord intend to make thee a ſtrong Chriſtian, he will make thee to begin in weakneſſe to perfect thy power, to begin in ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that he may make thee to end in glory. I know Gods children here may receive temporal puniſhments, and bring temporal ſcourges upon themſelves, as we may ſee amongſt the Corinthians here, but it ſhall be for their good and amendment, namely, for their correction, and not for their ruine and deſtruction; that ſo being chaſtened by the Lord, they might not be condemned with the world. Therefore if thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt careleſly and unprofitably, God will chaſtiſe thee with the rods of men, as he did Peter, who receiving the Sacrament with his Maſter over night, yet the next day thrice denyed him; but God whipt his ſoul, and ſcourged his conſcience for it, and beat him black and blew, ſo that he went out and wept bitterly. Nay he could ſcarce with off that ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf again whilſt he lived.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us take heed of unprepared coming to the Sacrament; for God will not hold ſuch guiltleſſe: Yea, if his own ſonnes or daughters tranſgreſſe thereby; he will make them to feel the ſmart of it. But now to come to all ſuch as come moneth by moneth, hand over head, without any examination and repentance, in their uncleanneſſe and abomination, making no conſcience of their reformation, let me tell them, that it ſhall be one of Chriſts demands of them in the day of judgement, How oft haſt thou been at my Table? How oft haſt thou been partaker of that holy Communion which I gave unto thee? Haſt thou come preparedly, or received worthily, or no? Haſt thou eat bread at my Table with me, and lift up thy heel againſt me? Did I command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thou wouldeſt not obey? Did I ſend my Miniſters to thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, but thou wouldeſt not be reformed? Did I check and reprove thee for thy pride, blaſphemies, drunkenneſſe, covetouſneſſe, anger, wrath, malice, fornication, hypocriſie and prophaneneſſe in the matter of my worſhip? and yet wouldeſt thou ſtill live in theſe ſins? Where are all the Sacraments that thou haſt received? How haſt behaved thy ſelf? Where are the ſins that thou haſt forſaken, and pleaſing corruptions that thou haſt abhorred? What grace and holineſſe haſt thou received by the means thou haſt enjoyed? and how haſt thou manifeſted the ſame
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44191:65"/>
through thy whole converſation? Oh! woe, woe unto thee, yea and a world of woes unto thee, and unto all ſuch as ſhall be ſilent and ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to thoſe or the like demands of Chriſt: for they cannot ſay they have come out of their ſins, and have been reformed by the means of grace, and have received ſpirituall nouriſhment and refreſhing from the heavenly banquet of the Communion of the body and bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>A man will eſpecially regard the laſt words of a dear friend, who is as a mans Soul, when he is to ſpeak upon his death-bed, and will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to remember them; and doſt thou not more regard the laſt Will and Teſtament of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? we count it a horrible ſin to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the laſt Will of a man that is dead. Beloved, the Lord Jeſus, before he left this world, inſtituted this bleſſed Sacrament as his laſt Will and Teſtament, and hath given us a charge, that as we would not eat and drink our own damnation by bringing the guilt of his body and bloud upon our Souls, ſo that we ſhould diſcern the Lords body, and not come unpreparedly in our ſins and abominations, without reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſuch holy and high myſteries, as if there were nothing more to be received and looked for after, then the bare and naked element of bread and wine, or as if we did come to communicate with unclean De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. O my brethren, if you had but faith, you would be able to diſcern Chriſt in the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore when thou comeſt unto it, thou muſt prepare and ſanctifie thy ſelfe to communicate with him in thoſe holy Ordinances and heavenly myſteries of his moſt pretious body and bloud: for if ſo be that thou retaineſt thy ſins, and ſo come unworthily unto this holy Table of the Lord, thou art a great Covenant-breaker with God: For thou never comeſt unto the Communion, but thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt and reneweſt thy covenant with God, wherein thou promiſeſt thus much, or the like in effect; Lord, I have been formerly a drunkard, but now I promiſe to give it over, and never to be a drunkard more; I have been a ſcoffer at Religion, and a mocker and derider of thy children, but now I faithfully promiſe (Lord) that I will never do ſo any more. I have been wicked and ſinfull, diſobeying and rebelling againſt all thy holy commandements, and reſpected not thy judgements and thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and have been careleſſe of thy glory: But now (Lord) as I eat this bread, and drink this wine; ſo I covenant unto thee, and promiſe to thee, that I wil amend all my ſinfull ways, and become a reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. And as I ever look that the body and the bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, repreſented in the elements, ſhould nouriſh my ſoul unto eternall life, ſo I promiſe to be diſobedient unto the Devill, but faithfull and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto thee. I will ſtop my ears againſt the alluring inchantments of the world, and wicked ſuggeſtions of the Devil; but I wil open them wide to hearken to thy voice, that I may obey thy commands. But now as thou haſt made it, ſo if thou haſt broken this thy covenant with God, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to thy former courſes of ſin and diſobedience againſt him, know thou, that this covenant of thine which thou haſt broken, ſhal ſtand in full force againſt thee: for God will aſſuredly require it at thy hands: and all the Sacraments which thou haſt received, thou haſt received
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44191:66"/>

If thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ilt not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and do all his commandements, then all theſe curſes come upon thee and ſhall overtake thee: Curſed ſhalt thou be in the City, and curſed in the field, curſed ſhall be thy basket and ſtore. Now if thy bread be curſed, then thou art curſed alſo that eateſt it. Secondly, in regard of the ſeal and obligation in the conſcience; ſo he that eateth and drinketh the Sacrament in his ſins, eateth and drinketh his own damnation; that is, he eats and drinks that which ſeals up his damnation againſt the great day of account. And thus many amongſt us, and I fear the moſt part of this congregation, have eat and drunk their own damnation. But this ſeal may be broken off, and God grant it may.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in regard of ſigillation in heaven, and ſo he that eats and drinks unworthily, and will not be reformed, he that receives the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment time after time, yet ſtill retains his ſins, and will not be humbled for them, nor forſake them, he ſetteth a ſeal in heaven upon his own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that all the whole world can never break off, but ſuch an one moſt certainly is a damned creature.</p>
                  <p>And now (my brethren) God forbid there ſhould be any ſuch here, but that this ſeal may be broken off: And O that God would put ſome ſtrength into this word, that it may be broken off by your godly ſorrow for your ſin, and forſaking of them all: for if this ſeal be ſet on your damnation, why do I yet ſpeak unto you, and intreat and beſeech you in the name of Chriſt to come home and be reconciled to him? and I deſire to ſtand here, as Jehoiadah ſet Porters at the gates of the City, and of the houſe of the Lord, to keep off all thoſe that come in their uncleanneſſe, 2 Chron. 23. 19. So I ſtand this day as the Porter of the Lord, to keep the Lords watch, that no prophane wretch, no proud hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinner, that means not to enter into a new courſe of life, that no ſuch one come unto this holy communion, I charge you as you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the guilt of Chriſts bloud before Gods Throne, that you meddle not with it. But now if there be any that would abſent himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will the more freely go on in his ſins, let him know that ſuch an one excludes himſelf from the benefits and merits of Chriſts death, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44191:66"/>
ſhall never have the benefit of a Redeemer at the day of judgement; but ſhall periſh in his ſins for his careleſſe neglect, and fearful contempt of ſo effectual and powerful means of ſalvation and purging, as is the bloud of Chriſt, truly and really offered in the Sacrament. Wherefore, if thou comeſt, or comeſt not, woe is thee, if ſo be thou liveſt and continueſt in thy ſins, and goeſt on in thy unholy courſes.</p>
                  <p>And now to conclude; as the Cherubin ſtood before Paradiſe with a naked ſword to keep Adam out, that he might not enter and ſo eat of the tree of life: ſo I bring with me the ſword of God, to run it up to the hilt in the heart and bowels of every ungodly man, every rebellious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner this day, that dares preſume to ruſh upon this holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, with a polluted and an unclean heart. Therefore let me exhort thee, that as thou tendreſt the eternall good of thy ſoul, ſo thou be careful not to eat the body of Chriſt, nor drink his blood in thy ſins, leſt thou eat thine own bane, and drink thine own curſe: Nay, ſo doing, thy miſery wil be ſo great, as a good man wel weighing and conſidering of it, ſaid, I profeſſe I had rather have all my veins cut open, and my bloud ſpilt on the ground, than deliver the body and blood of Chriſt unto a prophane ſinner: for why ſhould I deliver his own bane and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction unto him? But now (my brethren and beloved) come out of your ſins, come and welcome, if you part with your luſts, and ſo come, you ſhall be ſure to have his bloud to waſh your heart, and cleanſe you, his righteouſneſſe to clear you, and cloath you, his graces to ſtrengthen you, his ſpirit to heal and to ſanctifie your hearts and natures; &amp; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to ſupply all good that is wanting in you. But if yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this that hath been ſaid, you will go on in your ſins, and live as you did in your ſwearing, whoring, lying, and drinking, and all manner of filthineſſe; and as you came to it unclean, ſo you depart away from it more unclean, and never make any conſcience of any reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I pronounce this day before God and his elect Angels, that thou ſhalt ſurely periſh, and thy ſoul and body be damned and tormented in the ſcorching flames of hell for evermore. Therefore hearken unto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and give ear unto councel, now whiles that the Lord offers it unto you, that ſo you may not harden your hearts any more, but may hear and obey, that your ſouls may live, and ſo coming together to this holy and bleſſed Communion for the better and not for the worſe, you may return home with the bleſſing of children.</p>

                  <p>There muſt ſomewhat be done before we can receive it. Let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup. There are none of the Ordinances of God, that a man may ſafely ruſh upon. Wouldeſt thou offer any ſacrifice to God? but thou muſt ſtay firſt, and examine thy ſelf, whether there be not ſomething yet undone. It may be thou haſt offended God in ſomething or other; It may be thou art out with thy brother; thou muſt firſt go and be reconciled to thy brother, and then offer thy guift, Matth. 5. So wouldſt thou reprove thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?

There is never an ordinance of God that can be done, but there muſt be ſomewhat done firſt, a man muſt do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before. As in the choice of officers, as Miniſters, as Deacons, other Officers in the Church, firſt, they muſt be proved before they be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: ſo in all the Ordinances of God.

                  <p>The <hi>reaſons</hi> of this are;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe naturally we are not invited gueſts, we are not ſuch as are<note place="margin">Reaſon 1. Naturally we are not invited gueſts.</note> invited to the Lords Supper; we are children of wrath, and as long as we are in ſuch an eſtate, we cannot come aright to the Communion. This is childrens, bread, and it cannot be given to dogges. Chriſt, whenſoever
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44191:70"/>
he ſets his dainties before his people, he tels us for whom they are, Take eat, this is my body that is broken for you. This is the ſupper that is made for you, as it is in this Chapter, verſe 24. Firſt we muſt prove our ſelves invited gueſts.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the Lord Chriſt invites every man to the Lords Supper; but he invites him methodically, he muſt be in ſuch an eſtate: but every man is not ſo fitted: a man muſt be a member of Chriſt that means to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Chriſts death, he muſt be one that is in Chriſt, he muſt be able to prove that he is ingrafted into Chriſt, he muſt be able to ſhew the mark of the Lord Chriſt on him. As it is with the ſome of your great dinners,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and feaſts in this City, you have tickets and all that are admitted to the feaſt, muſt ſhew their ticket before they are admitted; So thou muſt be able to ſhew thy ticket, that thou haſt an invitation from Chriſt, thou muſt have a mark, and token from Chriſt that thou comeſt, and comeſt with his warrant.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon is, though thou be invited, it may be thou art not diſpoſed.<note place="margin">Reaſon 2. We are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> If a man will do a thing that he is naturally indiſpoſed to, there muſt be ſomewhat done before of neceſſity: So the Lords ſupper, it is a thing that naturally we are indiſpoſed unto, therefore ſomewhat muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be done firſt. Naturally we are unholy, we are unthankfull, and carnall, we are in our ſinnes, ſtrangers from God, and the Covenant of God, and from the ſeal of the Covenant: all this indiſpoſition muſt be wrought out before we can comfortablely come hither. If Chriſt would have the very Chamber firſt trimmed, before he inſtituted the Paſſeover, and the Sacrament; much more will he have the ſoul diſpoſed for him, and the heart cleanſed from all filthineſſe. If he that was of the Peace-offering being indiſpoſed, having his uncleanneſſe upon him, was to be cut off from his people, Levit. 7. 20. what will God doe to ſuch people as come hither in their uncleanneſs and indiſpoſition, unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and unqualified?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly ſuppoſe we were both invited and diſpoſed, yet this it not enough:<note place="margin">Reaſon 3. Solemn prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> This is a ſolemne Ordinance of God, and an ordinary diſpoſition will not ſerve the turn. Though every child of God be ordinarily diſpoſed to every good word and work, to pray, and to hear the word of God, he is prepared and furniſhed to every well-doing ordinarily and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually? but a man muſt be diſpoſed farther; There is a ſolemne preparation required to the Communion, as in Deut. 16. 15. there were ſolemn feaſts in the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo there is this ſolemn feaſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and there are ſolemn preparations required thereto. When we come to the Communion, to eat the Lords Supper, it is not eating and drinking in Chriſts preſence; for ſo may any reprobate do, and yet Chriſt may ſay to him, Depart from me, thou worker of iniquity. It is not to come and ſit in your Pewes, and wait till the Bread comes, and take it; and till the Cup comes, and drink it, ſo many a Reprobate may doe, as the Corinthians did, that did eat and drink their own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

the precious bloud of Chriſt; to be fed and built up in the promiſes; It is a weighty thing to come to the Communion: a man muſt be a worthy man, or elſe he hath nothing to do here. As Solomon ſaid of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah, if he be a worthy man, not a hair ſhall fall from his head; but if wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe be found in him, he ſhall dye, 1 Kings 1. 52. So, if we be worthy men and women, not a hair of our heads ſhall fall to the ground, none of the curſes ſhall light on us, that light on unprepared perſons: but if wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe be found in us, if we be guilty of any ſin, if we live in any luſt not mortified, if there be any prophaneneſſe in our lives, in our families, in our courſes and callings, though we catch hold of the horns of the Altar, though we partake of theſe holy myſteries, yet we ſhall be ſo far from having any mercy, as that we ſhall haſten our own ruine, we ſet a ſeal on our own judgement, and make our caſe worſe than it was before.</p>
                  <p>Let us take notice of it, and never dare to ruſh on any of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note place="margin">Uſe. To take heed of ruſh perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> You know what became of the fooliſh man in the Goſpel, that when they were invited to come to the marriage ſupper, he thought it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to come with them that came, to crowd in with them, and ſit down among the reſt; he conſidered not what he went about, that he might be prepared accordingly; the event was this, he was caſt out into utter darkneſſe, Matth. 22. 13. It is dangerous ruſhing on any of Gods ordinances. To ruſh upon prayer, for a man to fall down upon his knees, and to utter any thing before the Lord haſtily with his mouth, not conſidering that God is in heaven, and he on the earth. A mans word may damn his own ſoul, and pull vengeance on his own pate, his prayers may prove a curſe, his prayer for mercy may be turned into ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: So the higher the ſervice, the greater the danger. As the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 17.</note> of Abigail ſaid to her, Conſider what you do, when evill was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined againſt them: ſo conſider what you do when you come to the Sacrament, you come to a weighty thing, to that, that will either ſet you neerer to the Kindome of God, or hell and condemnation. But I let this paſſe, and come to the words themſelves.</p>
                  <q>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</q>
                  <p>In theſe words obſerve;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the matter of the duty commanded; that is to eat of that bread, and<note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note> drink of that cup.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the manner of doing the duty; not only to eat of that bread; but ſo to eat; and not only to drink of that cup, but ſo to drink.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the rule of direction how to come in a right manner to partake of it, that is, by examining of our ſelves, Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, the benefit following that direction, and that is in this word, But let a man examine himſelf. He had ſaid before, He that eats and drinks unworthily, is made guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord: and, he diſcerneth not the Lords body, verſe 27. But, ſaith he, as if he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44191:71"/>
ſhould ſay if a man would prevent this, if a man would take order that he be not guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt, that he do not come undiſcerningly to theſe heavenly myſteries, but with comfort, and title to the promiſes, with hope and confidence and ſpeeding there of the benefits of Chriſt exhibited, then, let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</p>
                  <p>Now I will paſſe over ſome of theſe points, namely that we are to eat<note place="margin">Neceſſity of receiving the Lords Supper.</note> that bread, and drink that cup. There is a neceſsity that we ſhould receive the Lords ſupper. I need not ſtand on this, you know it ſufficiently proved by the Sacrament of the Law, which was the fore-runner of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſoul that did not partake of that, was to dye the death, he was to be cut off from Gods people, Num. 9. 13. If the Lord was ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thoſe Sacraments that were inferior to theſe (and yet they were of the ſame ſubſtance as theſe) that the man that neglected to come to them, to partake of them, was to be cut off, to be excommunicated from the people of God, and to be rent off from the congregation of the Saints, then how much more for theſe heavenly, and weighty, and glorious Ordinances of the Goſpel, which are farr more glorious than them of the Law? But I will not ſtand upon that.</p>
                  <p>I might here take notice too of the frequency of the duty: for ſo it hath<note place="margin">The Lords Supper to be received often.</note> dependence on thoſe words formerly, As oft as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye ſhew the Lords death, and ſo, that is, as oft as ye eat, do it in this manner. This is the command of God, that we oft receive the Lords Supper. In the Primitive times St. Baſil obſerves, that they eat it three or four times in a week, on Wedneſdays, Frydays, and on the Lords day; but that was a time of perſecution, I will not ſtand upon that. I think it not neeedfull; But it ſhould be often, we ſhould not thurſt it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Eaſter and Whitſuntide. and Chriſt-tide, three or four times in the year.</p>
                  <p>Again, I might obſerve here from this myſtery received, in that he calls it Bread, I might obſerve againſt the Papiſts Tranſubſtantiation, that the bread received, is not tranſubſtantiated, but is bread ſtill; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that of receiving in one kind; So let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup: he doth not ſay, let him eat of that bread only, but he directs the commands in both kinds. But I let this paſſe, and come to the ſecond rhing, that is the manner how we ſhould do this duty.</p>
                  <q>So let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</q>
                  <p>It is not, firſt let him examine himſelf, and then let him eat of that<note place="margin">Obſerv. The manner of performance of duties to be regarded.</note> bread, and drink of that cup: But, let him examine himſelfe, and then, SO, let him eat: implying, that examining a mans ſelfe helps or ought to help a man to a right manner: and when he hath gotten a right manner, then to eat that bread, and drink that cup; that he may do, not only for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that which the Lord commands, but, for manner, as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Beloved, the Lord ſtands on circumſtances as well as on duties: we are all racers, we run, we muſt ſo run that we may obtain, 2. Cor. 9. 29 So pray that we may ſpeed, ſo hear that we may be converted, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that we may be edified; ſo behave our ſelves in our places and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that we may glorifie God. It is not enough for a man to runne,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44191:72"/>
but he muſt ſo run, if he mean to obtain. Every man will be ſpeaking and doing good things; but ſo ſpeak, and ſo do, Jam. 2. 12. The Lord calls upon us to have a care of the manner of duties, as well as of the matter of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It is not enough that a man come to eat of that bread, and drink of that cup, but ſo to eat, and ſo to drink of it, he muſt partake of the Lords Table, and ſo as the Lord enjoyns.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reaſons of this are;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the ſame Lord that commands the matter, commands the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">Reaſon 1. The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the manner as well as the matter.</note> too. The Lord will have his ſervice well done, as well as done, he will have the work well performed, as well as performed. It is not only the thing that the Lord ſtands upon, but the right manner and kind of doing it.</p>
                  <p>When David perſwaded his ſon Solomon to worſhip the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he bids him not only do the thing, but to do it in a right manner, And thou my ſon Solomon, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him, Is that all? No, but with a perfect heart, and a willing mind, 2. Chron. 28. 9. He commands him to do it, not only for the matter of it, but in the right manner of it. A man may ſerve God, but if it be not with a perfect heart, and a willing mind, and with a chearfull ſpirit; if he be not ready to every command, if he doe not open his ears to every rebuke, a man doth not ſerve God at all. The manner either makes all, or marres all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another Reaſon is, becauſe circumſtances overthrow actions,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2. Circumſtances overthrow acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as in Prayer.</note> if they be not rightly and duly obſerved. As for example in Scripture, prayer is an action commanded of God: the Lord commands us to pray, that we call upon his name duly, every day, in all our needs and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, upon all occaſions continually. But now if we pray not aright, not in that manner that the Lord hath preſcribed; if we pray either with a guilty defiled conſcience, with cold affection, with a dead ſpirit, or without departing from iniquity, or without a pure heart: if a man pray without the right manner of prayer, he marrs all his prayer, it is a howling, and not a prayer. They did not cry to me (ſaith God) when they howled on their beds, that is, when they prayed, becauſe they did not pray in a right manner, the Lord calls it howling, and not a prayer. We roar as Bears, in Iſaiah 59. 12. the Prophet nicknames it, ſpeaking in the perſon of the people, he calls it the roaring of Bears: The Lord had as lieve hear the barking of a Dog, or the grunting of a Swine, as a man that doth not pray aright, with a bleeding heart, with contrition of ſoul and ſpirit, with a ſpirit of grace and ſupplication. When a man prays, and prays not aright, his prayer leaves that name, it is no more a prayer in Gods account.</p>
                  <p>And ſo preaching, it is an admirable action; but if a man do not preach<note place="margin">2 Preaching.</note> aright, if it be flattering with the entiſing words of mans wiſdome, or beating the ayr, and to ſhew his own learning, this overthrows the action of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, he preacheth not Chriſt, but himſelf; not the Goſpel, though the Goſpel be in his Sermon all over, yet himſelf he preacheth, the action is marred, the circumſtances marre it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:44191:72"/>So in the Lords Supper, if a man come not prepared, that he have<note place="margin">3 Receiving the Sacrament.</note> not the Wedding Garment, that he be not aright qualified according to the requiſites of the Goſpel, this is not to eat the Lords Supper; Saith the Apoſtle, When ye come together, this is not to eat the Lords Supper: you think you eat the Lords Supper, you take the bread and the cup, and can ſay, Bleſſed be God, and I pray God to bleſſe me: you may come and do theſe actions, but the action is altered, the action is diverſified when it is not done in a right manner.</p>
                  <p>So if a man come to reprove his brother, if he himſelf be faulty, do you<note place="margin">4 Brotherly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</note> think this is ſufficient reproof? No, it is hypocriſie. Thou hypocrite, Matth. 7, 5. his reproof of his brother is hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>So, for men to tell one another of their faults, and to tell them with a Spirit of bitterneſſe; this is not Chriſtian dehortation, but biting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Gal. 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>And ſo for eating and drinking, beloved, eating is lawfull, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">5 Eating and drinking.</note> is lawfull, and marrying and giving in marriage, all theſe are lawfull, yet if a man eat not aright, and drink not aright, and marry not in the Lord, eat and drink without title to the Lords creatures, that he have not intereſt in the Covenant of God, if Chriſt be not in it, how ſhall he have comfort? Nay, that very nature of his eating is altered, his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and drinking and marrying is a ſinne. As our Lord Chriſt ſhews of the old world, They did eat and drink; and were marrying and giving in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, till Noah entred into the Ark, and the flood came and ſwept them away, Mat. 24. 37, he reckons their eating and drinking among their ſins, among the reaſons and cauſes why the flood came upon them, they did eat and drink, and marry and give in marriage.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, was that the reaſon the flood came? And was that an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Objection.</note> of their ſecurity? Did not Noah eat and drink and marry? And were not his ſonnes married that were in the Ark, and he a grand-father?</p>
                  <p>But he did it aright; therefore his eating and drinking is not brought<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> as a ſign of ſecurity, but of the old world, that were carnal and wretched people, it was becauſe they did not eat and drink aright.</p>
                  <p>There be Rules in eating and drinking, in talking and diſcourſing, in doing the duties of our callings: There be Rules how you ought to buy and ſell, and to do every good word, and work. If theſe Rules be not obſerved, the Rules of Gods bleſſed word, the actions themſelves are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; though the things be commanded of God, yea they are curſed and abominable things, when the true form and faſhion of them is not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though they be never ſo godly.</p>
                  <p>A garment though it be never ſo good, if the Taylor handle it not<note place="margin">Simile.</note> well, it is marred in the making, if he bring it not to a right form, and make it in a right manner, the man that is to have the garment, is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. So Timber, though it be never ſo excellent, though it be all Oak, or Elm, or whatſoever tree, though it be never ſo fit for building, if the Artificer deal not well in handling it, the inhabitant that comes there, may curſe the day that ever he came there: if it be not well built, it may fall on his head and kill him, and all that belong to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44191:73"/>
him. So it is in all the Ordinances of God, and the matters of Religion, we muſt not only do them for matter, but for manner too: for that either makes or marrs them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another Reaſon is, becauſe only the right manner of doing duties<note place="margin">Reaſon 3. The right manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties gets the bleſſing.</note> gets the blessing. A man may pray a thouſand times, and never be heard, he may hear a million of Sermons, and never be converted, a man may come to all the Sacraments in the year, all his life long, and never be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt the day of redemption. A man may do the things, and never get the bleſſing; all the bleſſing lies in the right manner of doing. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that ſervant, whom, when his maſter comes, he ſhall find ſo doing, Matth. 24. 48. He ſaith not, Whom when his master cometh, he ſhall find doing. Chriſt when he cometh to judgement, ſhall find many doing; it may be he will come in prayer time, it may be he will come in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when many thouſands ſhall be at their prayers in their families: it may be he'l come at night when all are at prayers in their houſes; it may be he will come on the Sabath, when all the country is at Church, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Sermons, he ſhall finde many thouſands doing, and praying. But bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord when he comes, ſhall find ſo pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo hearing, ſo receiving the Sacrament: He ſhall find many belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but ſo beleeving gets the bleſſing: many profeſſing, but it is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that gets the comfort, I ſay, all the bleſſings of God are promiſed to the right manner of doing. Now, what is it, when we do duties, what do we look for? Is it not for a bleſſing? Why do we do the duties, if we doe not do them ſo as we may get the bleſſing? Now except we obſerve the right manner of doing them, all is to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, another Reaſon is, the example of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt hath<note place="margin">Reaſon 4. Chriſts example</note> given us an example that we ſhould do as he did: Now he did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do that which his Father bid him do, for matter but for manner, both in all the words he ſpake, and in all the deeds that he performed. For the words he ſpake, <hi>As the Father hath ſaid unto me, even ſo ſpeak I,</hi> John 12. And in John 14. 31. As the Father hath given me commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even ſo do I. Mark, he did not only obey his Father in the matter of his command, but in the manner of it. And as Chriſt hath done thus, ſo all that are Chriſts, all the ſervants of God in all ages, they have been very carefull, eſpecially of the right manner of obeying God. As it is ſaid of Noah, Gen. 6. 22. As the Lord commanded Noah, even ſo did he, juſt as the Lord commanded him, he did not only make an Ark, but ſo he made all the rooms: ſo he made it in the ſame form and figure, and in the ſame ſimilitude, juſt as the Lord ſet him down in the pattern, even ſo did he. So the Lord ſets down the pattern of every good word and work, of all our prayers, and Sermons, and hearing; and conference, and keeping the Sabath, and ſpeaking holily: all our actions have their pattern ſet down in the word of God. Now as we are to do the things, ſo we are to do them in the ſame manner as the Lord commands, even ſo muſt we do.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, except we do it in a right manner, except as we come<note place="margin">Reaſon 5. From Gods glory.</note> to the duty, ſo we come to the right manner, we can never glorifie God; The glory of God lies in the manner of doing of things. So let your

light ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your father which is in heaven, Matthew. 5. 16. Mark, the light muſt not ſhine only in our lives and converſations; but ſo that the duty muſt be a means to the glorifying of God. Now the means muſt have i'ts proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and likeneſſe, and nature, and mold, and frame, from the nature of the end. Look how the end is that the dutie looks unto, ſo muſt the frame and faſhion of the duty be: Now if the end of all our actions be, that God may be glorified, that muſt put a form and faſhion upon every duty, that it may be ſo, that he may have glory. Suppoſe a man pray every day in his family and call all his houſbold, his ſervants, and wife and children, and all under his roof about him every morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: he may diſhonour God by prayer every day on this faſhion, if a man pray coldly, and careleſly, for form and faſhion, without ſaith, and life, he makes all the ordinances of God vile, and all the works of God contemptible: his houſhold ſleeps, one ſnorts it may be; another is infinitely prophane it may be, and though there be divers that would fain be quickned, and wakened, yet his prayer is ſo cold, there is no life, or heat, nor warmth in it, that God is exceedingly diſhonoured, and all are thereby rather worſe than better. So for a mans preaching, though it be never ſo good a duty, yet he muſt labour to preach ſo, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his preaching and labour in the work of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, how he may edifie others, and ſave his own ſoul. So fight I, not as one that beats the ayr; but ſo as I may get the maſtery: We muſt ſo preach, that we may attain the converſion of the people, or elſe we may rather do as Hophni and Phineas, the ſonnes of Eli, that made the table of the Lord contemptible, and the Sacrifice of the Lord loathſome in the eyes of the people: So may we do with the ordinances of God.</p>
                  <p>Take any duty of religion, if it be not done aright, God hath no glory by it. Suppoſe thou wouldeſt reprove thy brother, and tell him of his fault, and check him for his back wardneſs, or omiſſion of ſome duty, and for the commiſſion of ſome ſin; if thou do it, do it with a ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, with an humble heart, with a feeling and a pure conſcience; I ſay thou getteſt a blot to thy own ſelf, &amp; cauſeſt God to be ill ſpoken of, and the very way of his name to be diſhonoured. This wil be the effect of it; and ſo in every other duty. And ſo I come to the uſe.</p>
                  <p>It is ſo, that we muſt not only come to the Sacrament, but come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;<note place="margin">Uſe 1. To reprove thoſe that bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do duties, without loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the manner.</note> or do any duty, but we muſt do it in a right manner? This ſerves to condemn that naturall popery, that is in mens hearts, that is of opus opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, of the deed done; this is the religion of the Church of Rome, that ſo man do the duty (indeed it is better if it be done in a right manner,) but if it be done, there is ſomewhat a man may look for by that. If a man come to the Sacrament, the very eating of the Hoſt, the very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the body of Chriſt, they make it meritorious: ſo the very hearing of ſo many Sermons, the very ſaying of ſo many prayers; the very performance of ſo many duties: the very thing it ſelf, nakedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidered, it is of ſome validity. This is rooted into the hearts of men, we ſee it up and down; people do the dutie, and think all is well
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44191:74"/>
enough, when they conſider not how it is done. People pray, but not with zeal; they hear, but not with reverence: People come to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, not for the better, but for the worſe, they come not in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and yet every one hopes to ſpeed, and builds himſelfe on this, that God accepts of him. But this is the folly of mens hearts; it is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident argument that men go fooliſhly to work in the ways of God. It is the brand of a fool not to be able to obſerve circumſtances. Ariſtotle the heathen, he ſaith, it is the part of a wiſe man to think of, and underſtand the manner of actions; as a wiſe man ſaith, he obſerves circumſtances. It is the part of wiſedome to obſerve the right circumſtances of every action, as it is, Epheſ. 5. 15. Walk circumſpectly, that is, accurately, as it is in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, not as fools, but as wiſe. Mark, he perſwades them to a right manner of walking; not onely to walk in a good courſe, in praying, and hearing, in obedience, and ſobriety, in temperance, faith and diligence in our callings; but do it accurately, in a right manner; do it as wiſe men, and not as fools, who do it in a wrong manner. It is the part of a fool, I ſay, to do a thing, and to leave the right manner of doing it. Now this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with God, the Lord doth not eſteem any action though it be never ſo frequently done, except it be done with his own ſtamp, except it have his own character upon it.</p>
                  <p>I remember a ſtory in 2 King. 17. 26. The Aſſyrians there obſerved, that God ſent Lions among them, becauſe they did not obſerve the right manner of the God of Iſrael: they worſhipped the God of Iſrael; but becauſe they obſerved not the right Manner of his word, he ſent Lions among them, to tear and devour them in pieces. So though we pray, and hear, and read, and profeſſe, and have a name that we live; and though we be taken for good people and heap up duties from day to day, and vie performances, and though we do them as many times as the children of God; nay, though we could do them ten thouſand times oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than they, yet if we do them not in a right manner, if we know not the manner of the God of heaven and earth, with humble hearts, and ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying ſpirits, with holineſſe of affection, and with purity of heart: if a man do them not in a right manner, the Lord wil tear him in pieces, and he ſhall have no deliverance for all that.</p>
                  <p>Another uſe ſhall be, what may be the reaſons why people are ſo willing<note place="margin">Uſe 2. The reaſon why men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the matter and not the manner of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> generally, to do duties for the matter, and care not to do them in a right manner. It ſhall not be amiſſe a little to ſhew the myſtery of this thing: for we ſee every man is willing to do duties, every man will be praying and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Church, many reprobates, and God knows how many carnall hearts are in this congregation, ſome drunkards it may be, ſome adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, ſome it may be that committed whoredome the laſt night, ſome that have been ſwearing even now, and deceiving in their ſhops, there are many carnall hearts; yea every man is willing to do duties, to hear, and to pray; Now what may be the reaſon that people are willing to do good duties, and yet are loath to come off with their carnall hearts? There are four reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, Becauſe the matter of the duty is eaſy, but the manner is<note place="margin">Reaſon 1. The matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> difficult. It is an eaſie matter to pray, to ſay, Lord I have ſinned againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44191:74"/>
and againſt thee. Lord, I have ſworn, I have been a drunkard, I have diſallowed the Sabbath, I have done this and that, I pray thee pardon and forgive me, and give me thy grace; it is an eaſie matter to do this. It is eaſie for a man to come to Church, and mark what the Miniſter ſaith, and follow him from point to point, and it may be he go over it to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. This is good, there are few that come thus farr. And ſo it is eaſie to come to the Sacrament, to take the Bread and the Cup, and to pray for a bleſſing, this is eaſie; but when a man comes to do a duty in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, here is difficulty, when a man doth it with a How; Take heed how ye hear. He doth not call upon people to hear, that is not the matter; there needs no great diligence for that: but, if you will conſider How you hear, take heed to that. Here muſt be a great deal of circumſpection; the ſoul muſt be marvellous painfull, a man muſt offer violence to his own ſoul; a man muſt fight againſt his own will, a man muſt beat down his own ſpirit, he muſt crucifie his own thoughts, muſt mortifie his own mind, and beat down his own ſoul. It is a hard thing to do in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the Lord commands, if we conſider how to do it. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, fleſh and blood cannot abide to take pains; if it can ſerve God with eaſe, and pray with eaſe, that it will do; but for a man to weep before God, for a man to indict his heart before the throne of grace, to rend his bowels before his maker, to tear the caul of his heart upon his kees, for a man to vow to God and pay them; for a man to rid his hand of all the wages of iniquity, for a man to purifie himſelfe as Chriſt is pure, for a man to wreſtle with God, and to take grace according to the covenant of grace, with life and power; to do it in a right manner, here is religion, and this man cannot abide.</p>
                  <p>And ſo for the Sacrament, for a man to come in a right manner, Oh it is difficult to fleſh and bloud; for a man to go and examine all his life, to reckon up all his converſation, to anatomize himſelfe from his cradle to this moment; to conſider how he hath ſinned in his calling, in his family, in his ſhop, in his company, in his ſpeech, and in his life; to go and judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of theſe, and condemn himſelfe, and to accept of his own puniſhment, to go and rack his own thoughts, and crucifie his own ſoul: Oh! this is hard, men cannot abide this: therefore they go and take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they obſerve that, and leave out the manner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another reaſon is this, becauſe the matter of duties may be<note place="margin">Reaſon. 2. The matter of duties may be done with a proud heart.</note> done with a proud heart; there is no duty but a man may do it with a proud heart, and never be humble. A man may pray, and uſe good words, and make good petitions, and have marvellous good language, and Scripture phraſe, and terms, and paſſages, and an admirable ſweet tone, and yet have a proud heart. A man may come and Preach a Sermon, he may preach ſo as that he may ſtrangely affect the hearts of the people, and may make all the people wonder and admire at the gracious words that come from his mouth, and yet have a proud heart.</p>
                  <p>A man may hear, and hear oft, and hear the beſt Preachers in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and delight in hearing, and yet have a proud heart. A man may come to the Sacrament, and ſit, to ones thinking, as devoutly as any in the Church, and pray when the people pray, and give thanks when others
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44191:75"/>
give thanks, and have a kind of morall faith in the Covenant, and a moral application of the promiſes, and yet have a proud heart. It is the manner of doing duties that humbles the ſoul, as Saint Paul ſaith, Acts 20. You know in what manner I have been with you. Why, what was the manner? In all humility of mind, ſaith he, being among the Epheſians; preaching to them in a right manner, leaving them the example of his own pattern, doing all this in a right manner, he did it in all humility of heart. It is the right manner of prayer that puls down the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. It is the right manner of hearing the word, that makes a man melt at it. It is the right manner of coming to the Sacrament, that makes a man feel the comfort of God, and the promiſes of the Goſpel, and to ſeek and find the admirable things contained in it. It is the right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that makes a man walk lowly with his God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another Reaſon is, Becauſe the matter may stand with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy<note place="margin">Reaſon 3. The matter of duties may be done, and yet a man be unholy.</note> life; A man may do a duty for the matter of it, and yet be unholy. This is plain; how many thouſands are there that pray, and yet are vain, and covetous, and carnall? How many thouſands hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and yet are unprofitable? Ever hearing, and never come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth. If they were injurious before, they are injurious ſtill; if they were couſners before, they are ſo ſtill; if they were drunkards before, they are ſo ſtill. A man may receive the Sacrament every moneth, and yet may have his luſts, and roll them as a ſweet morſell under his tongue; he may delight in his ſecret luſts, and go on in his deadneſſe of heart. It is the right manner of worſhipping God, that purgeth the conſcience, and purifieth the ſoul, and makes a man that there is no room for his corruptions, as you may ſee, 1 Theſſ. 2. 10. You your ſelves know (ſaith the Apoſtle) how holily, and unblameably we walked among you. He ſpeaks there of his manner of walking, and he ſaith to them, becauſe it was in a right manner, it was an holy manner; ſuch walking as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all unholineſſe, and prophaneneſſe. Fleſh and bloud cannot abide this. Men, they love to pray, and be proud; they love to hear ſermons, and to have their profit; they love to profeſſe religion, and ſtill to carry their ſecret luſts in their boſomes. People love this alife, to go to Gilgal &amp; tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſse, to offer ſacrifice every new moon, and every morning and to find the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of their hands, this is right; but for a man to part with his iniquity, that is the thing that goes againſt the hair.</p>
                  <p>The laſt reaſon is, becauſe the matter of duties brings not the croſſe upon<note place="margin">Reaſon 4. The matter of duties brings not the croſſe.</note> a man. A man may do all the duties of Religion, and never be perſecuted for it: a man may be as devout as the devouteſt man under heaven, &amp; yet no body hate him for it, except he be devout in a right manner, and worſhip God in a right manner. One man may reprove another that is wicked; A drunkard may ſuffer a drunkards reproof, and be never the worſe: A whoremaſter may ſerve his quean ſo, he may call her ſo, and yet not be ſpited, becauſe it is not right. It is the right doing of it that brings the croſſe; as in 2 Tim. 2. 10. Thou knoweſt thy manner of life. It was that that brought afflictions and perſecutions.</p>
                  <p>We may ſee to this very day many thouſands that ſeem devout men in the Church; they will pray, and will hardly miſſe any time of prayer,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44191:75"/>
morning or evening; and yet they are farre from being perſecuted: nay, many of them are main perſecutors of the Goſpel of God, enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, and adverſaries to the Saints of God. We ſee it plain in Acts 15. 5. we read there of devout women that raiſed perſecution againſt Paul. Mark, they were devout, and becauſe it was not in a right manner, they perſecuted the Apoſtles, and ſet themſelves againſt them that were truly faithfull. Though wicked men do not love to pray aright, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are much for praying, they care not how much praying they have, and when they are at prayer, they will pray over from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the book to the end, they love it alife. But if they come to a prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that moves the heart, that rifles the conſcience, that dogges a man into his boſome that lays a man flat on his face before God, they gnaſh their teeth at ſuch a prayer. So they love Preaching too; I, it is true, if it be preaching that is flaunting, and gloſing, with the enticing words of mans wiſedome: but if a man preach to the conſcience, if he preach the pure naked word of God, and carry it home to mens ſouls, this makes them gnaſh their very teeth, and they could eat the Miniſter of God for his labour. It is the right manner of duty that is accomdanied with the croſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if we ought to be carefull to perform duties in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">Uſe 3. To labour to do duties aright.</note> Let us be exhorted in the fear of God, to go and quicken all our duties, to bring a ſoul into ſo many bodies; we have bodies of praying, and bodies of hearing, and bodies of receiving the Sacrament, and of good duties, let us get a ſoul into them, labour to do them in a right manner. The bare duty is like a carkaſſe. It is a Proverb of the Jews, Prayer without prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it as a carkeſſe without the ſoul, that is, a loathſomething; ſo is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without life, and without a right manner of powring it forth. Let us labour therefore in the fear of God, to pray, and pray aright, to hear, and to hear aright; to ſeek God, and to ſeek him with all our hearts, aright, and to do every thing in the right way.</p>
                  <p>Let us conſider, firſt, wee doe not pertake of any ordinance at all,<note place="margin">Motives to perform duties in the right manner.</note> except wee doe it in a right manner. I remember a fit place for this in Numbers 11. 14. It is ſaid there, The ſtranger ſhall eat the Paſſeover, and partake of of it according to the ordinance, and the manner of<note place="margin">1. Motive</note> it. Where the text puts in the Ordinance of the Paſſeover, and the manner of it. For it is all one, they are Synonima's. So the Ordinance in every duty, Gods ordinance in praying, in hearing the Word, in the Sacramement, in reproof, in every good duty, it is all one; as the ſelf-ſame thing. So that if we pray, and do not pray in a right manner, we have not prayed, we do not partake of the ordinance. So when we come to the Sacrament, the ordinance and the manner of it is all one; it is one compleat concrete action, we do not partake of it, except we partake of both.</p>
                  <p>Secondly conſider, it is nothing but hypocriſie, when a man prayes, and<note place="margin">2. Motive.</note> doth not pray in a right manner; when a man doth any dutie to God, and not in right wiſe, it is nothing but hypocriſie. Mark how our Saviour Chriſt ſets forth the hypocriſie of the Phariſee, Luke 18. 11. The Phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelfe, hee marks this manner
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44191:76"/>
of prayer; hee doth not ſay, Hee ſtood and prayed this, theſe words, but, Thus he prayed; he did not pray in a right manner, there was his hypocriſie, and that was the reaſon he went home not juſtified.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly conſider; it makes the ordinance of God of no effect. Thus they<note place="margin">3. Motive.</note> make the Conmandements of God of none effect, Matthew 15. 6. Hee ſpeaks there of their duties that they did in a wrong manner, and their expounding the Scripture, that they did in a wrong wiſe; and their ſacrifice, their offerings, and tithings, their precepts, and many things that were all done after another faſhion than God had commanded; therefore ſaith Chriſt, Thus they make the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God of none effect. So we make all the duties of Gods worſhip of none effect. Wee know there is never an ordinance of God, but it hath great effect if it be rightly performed. Prayer is of great effect, it is able to rend heaven, it is able to pull down God to the ſoul, it is able to wraſtle out a bleſſing, to quicken the heart, to obtain of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing we want: but if a man pray not aright, a man may pray and go away never a whit the more holy, nor more quickened, nor nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to heaven, nor comfort. So, preaching and hearing, they are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ordinances, what powerfull effects have they wrought when they have been done in a right kind? People have cryed out and been converted at them; and many a man hath been pulled out of the power of Satan to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. They had royall glorious effects upon many thouſand ſouls. But what is the reaſon that our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is ſo uneffectuall? Becauſe we hear not in a right manner, this makes the Ordinance of God of none effect, it makes prayer of no effect, the Word of no effect, the Sacrament and Sabbaths of none effect; you ſee people partake of theſe things, and are never the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it cannot pleaſe God, it is onely the right manner of doing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that pleaſed God, as in 1 Theſſalonians, 4. 1. As ye have received of us, How ye ought to walk, and to pleaſe God; Marke, there is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, That we may know HOW to walke, and by that to pleaſe God: It is not enough for a man to walk in good duties, that a man may do and not pleaſe God, but (ſaith he) ye haue received the manner HOW to walk and to pleaſe God. It is the manner how that pleaſeth God. A man may walk to hell upon heavens ground, he may go to hell in the wayes of God, it is<note place="margin">Simile</note> poſſible. Suppoſe a man ſhould go and take (if it were poſſible) all the ſurface of ground between this place and York, and lay it between this place and Dover, a man might go to Dover upon York ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So many a man lays the Ordinances of God in hell way: he walks in the way to hell, and there he lays his prayers, and there his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and his good duties; he prayes every day, and hears every day, and doth good duties every day, and yet walks to hell: he goes to hell on heavens ground; The reaſon is, becauſe he doth the duty, and doth not obſerve the manner how he doth it.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is, the rule of direction, how we may come to the right manner of receiving the Sacrament, that is, by preparing of a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44191:76"/>
mans ſelf: and the preparation is here ſet down by the ſpecification of it, namely, in examining himſelf, Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</p>
                  <p>The general ſcope of the words, and the Apoſtles meaning in them, is this, That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Obſervation 1. Eevery man muſt prepare himſelf before he come to the Lords Table.</note>Every man muſt prepare himſelf before he come to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſtand on this; I will only name it.</p>
                  <p>As in the Sacrament of the Paſſeover, there was preparation for the Paſſeover. In John. 19. 14. it is ſaid of the Diſciples of Chriſt, that they made ready the Paſſeover. In Matthew, 26. they made the Lamb ready, and the room ready, and themſelves ready, and the Table rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and every thing ready. So in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, wherein Chriſt is the true Paſcall Lamb, when we come to eat of him, we muſt make every thing ready, faith ready, and repentance ready, and intereſt in the promiſe ready, and hunger and thirſt after theſe ſpirituall dainties ready, every thing muſt be ready. Or elſe like a man that comes into the field to battell, that hath not gotten his ſword, nor his weapons ready, that is the way for himſelf to be killed; ſo it is when we come to the Communion, and have not all things ready, it is the way to be damned.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons of this are;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the Sacrament is an ordinance of God: Now all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances<note place="margin">Reaſon. It is Gods ordinance. Simile.</note> of God require preparation, they are all ſpirituall, and naturally a man is carnall, and therefore cannot be prepared. As it is with wood, there is never a tree in the wood, but it is unprepared for buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; Is there any tree in the wood of the faſhion of a Chimney, or of a Lintell, or a Door? It muſt firſt be prepared, as it is in Prov. 24. 27. Firſt prepare thy work without, and then build thine houſe. So every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is to build a man up in the fear of God, in the grace of God, and in Religion: Now man is naturally unprepared for it; Firſt, a man muſt fell his wood, and then cut it, and hew it even, and carve it, and plain it fit, and prepare it, before he build: So a man muſt hew down his own heart, he muſt humble his own ſoul, and qualifie all within him, and ſo be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, before he be fit.</p>
                  <p>As for example: in prayer, a man muſt be prepared to prayer before he pray; he muſt prepare his heart, and then Gods ears will hearken to it. In Pſal. 10. 17. The Lord will have the heart prepared before he hear the prayer. So it is with the word of God, a man muſt be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before he hear it: As a man that preacheth muſt be prepared before he preach, as Ezra is ſaid to prepare his heart. Ezra. 7, 10. He prepared his heart to do the Law, and to teach it: So a Miniſter cannot preach, except he be prepared beforehand, with a commiſſion from God, with preſerving knowledge, with a coal from Gods Altar, with a ſpirit of wiſdome and underſtanding, with a Law of kindneſſe in his lips, with meditation, and with a Theme fitted in his mouth for the people, he muſt be prepared with a burning and a ſhining light; or elſe he ſhall not edifie the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So it is with all other Ordinances. For humbling of a mans ſoul, a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44191:77"/>
man cannot humble his heart, except he be prepared to it, Amos 4. 12. Prepare to meet thy God, he ſpeaks of humiliation. If a man would humble himſelf before God, if he be not prepared, if his heart be not prepared to let go the world, his worldly profits, and vain pleaſures, and carnal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, his wonted luſts, and former delights. If he be not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to let theſe go, when he comes to keep a Faſt, or to afflict his ſoul, and goes along to do the duty, to lay himſelf down before Almighty God, ſome luſt or other will ſtick in his teeth, and intercept his heart, he ſhall never be able to do it: as Samuel ſaid to the people; If you will turn to the Lord, prepare your hearts to do it, 1 Sam. 7. So it muſt be in all the ordinances of God, and much more in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another Reaſon is, becauſe the Lord Chriſt hath made great<note place="margin">Reaſon 2. Chriſt hath made prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> preparations to provide the Lords Supper; therefore we muſt be prepared to eat it. You know what a great deal adoe there was before the Supper was made. Chriſt muſt be incarnate, and fulfill all righteouſneſſe, he muſt conclude it upon his ſuffering; he muſt tread the wine-preſse alone, and ſuffer himſelf to be beaten and rejected of God, and men, and ſuffer death, the curſed death of the Croſse, all theſe things were concluded upon, before this holy and bleſſed Supper was provided. Come (ſaith he) I have prepared my dinner, Matth. 22. Mark, Chriſt is fain to prepare his dinner; he makes a great Feaſt: there was great preparation for it; ſo there muſt be great preparation of our ſouls before we can come to this holy banquet. It is true among men, there may be great preparation for a feaſt, and little or nothing for the eating of it. Sometimes there are two or three dayes preparation for a feaſt, and is eaten preſently. The reaſon is, becauſe man naturally hungers after meat and drink, and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes provides twice or thrice in twenty four hours, for eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: But the Lords Supper is a ſpiritual banquet, a man is every day, and hour, and moment naturally unfit for it, and there is much adoe to put an edge upon mens appetites, and a keenneſſe upon mens deſires, that they may be fitted and prepared for it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another reaſon is, Becauſe the Lord Chriſt, when he adminiſters<note place="margin">Reaſon 3. Chriſt looks for good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</note> himſelf in this heavenly myſtery, he offers to come into the ſoul, and he looks for good entertainment; and therefore of neceſſity there muſt be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it. You ſee when a mortall man, an earthly Prince, or a Noble man comes to another mans houſe, what a deal of preparation there is to provide for him: there is meat made ready, and purging the houſe, and ſweeping the yard, and trimming up the very pales, and every thing, and making clean all the Chambers, and ridding out whatſoever fills it, and every thing that is out of order it ſet in tune. And what will my Lord think? and what will his Majeſty think? he wil think he is ſlighted and contemned; And when he comes in, it may be, his own children ſhal ſerve, and his own wife wait at the Table; and there is running up and down of errands, and a great deal of adoe to give ſuch a one entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is preparation to entertain a man, as Saint Paul ſaid to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon, I will that you prepare me lodging: how much more when the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God ſhall come under a mans roof, and dine with him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:44191:77"/>Laſtly, Becauſe the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is a part of Chriſts last will and Teſtament. Now it is a terrible thing when we know our Lords will, and prepare not for the doing of it. Look in Luke 12. 48. he that knew it not, did things worthy of ſtripes; but in verſe 47. That ſervant that knew the Lords will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes, that man ſhall be damned with much damnation; he ſhall be damned deeper than any body. Doſt thou know the Lords Table, that this bleſſed Sacrament is part of Chriſts laſt Teſtament? and wilt thou not prepare thy ſelf for it, to get an humble heart, and labour for a holy life, and ſeek for a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſoul, and vow upon new obedience, and enter into Covenant with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for a better kind of converſation for the time to come? Wilt thou not go and examine thine own ſoul, and go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whatſoever is amiſſe in thy family, in thy place and calling? Wilt thou not do theſe things to prepare for this holy will of Jeſus Chriſt? thou ſhalt be damned deeper than any body elſe, becauſe this is a part of Gods laſt Will and Teſtament, and thou knoweſt it, and therefore woe unto thee, if thou prepare not for it.</p>

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>PROV. 29. 1.</bibl>
                     <q>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, ſhal ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words, by reaſon of the ambiguity in the Hebrew tongue, doe bear two expoſitions, and our Engliſh can ſuffer but one.</p>
                  <p>The firſt expoſition is this, He that reproveth another, and hardneth his own neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy. The other is, as we have it here tranſlated, He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and that without remedy.</p>
                  <p>I deſire to ſpeak of both theſe expoſitions, for fear I ſhould miſſe the true ſenſe of this Text.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, it is a truth of God every where confirmed in the Scirip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he that reproves another, and yet hardeneth his own heart, he doth but make a rod for his own back, he puls ſudden deſtruction upon his own ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:44191:80"/>Then Secondly, there is no hinderance from the context, but that this may be the meaning of the text: you know the Proverbs have little or no coherence, except two or three chapters. Indeed there is a coherence in them, but generally through the Proverbs there is none; ſo that if the text it ſelf will bear one expoſition as well as another indifferently, the meaning none can tell, but only as it is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, the Text it ſelf favours this expoſition: for ſo the word in the Hebrew is, A man of reproofs, that hardens his own neck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhal ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</p>
                  <p>Now the Queſtion is, Whether the wiſe mans meaning here be of the actuall reproof, the reproving of another; or of paſſive reproof, this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined which of theſe is meant.</p>
                  <p>A man can have no light from the coherence, none in the world; and from the text it ſelf, there is as much reaſon why we ſhould expound it one way (even almoſt) as the other. So that I ſay, for fear I ſhould let go the true meaning of the wiſe man. I deſire to ſpeak a little of the active ſenſe. He that often reproves another, and yet hardeneth his own neck, ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy. From hence I may obſerve, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Obſervation 1. A guilty har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened reprover, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note>A reprover (whether a maſter or a Miniſter, or a Magiſtrate, or a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or a private Chriſtian, be he what he will be) that reproveth another, and yet is guilty himſelf (either in the ſame kind or elſe in another, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind) and hardneth his own heart in it, that man ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed without remedy.</p>
                  <p>Take a Preacher that preacheth ſtrict doctrine to the people, that is very zealous againſt their ſinnes, he is up with hell and damnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their filthy courſes: he preacheth for quickning, but himſelf is not quickned; be threatneth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>udgement againſt hardneſſe of heart, and yet he hath a hard heart himſelf; this man puls deſtruction upon his own pate. He is like the Phariſees, that impoſed upon others grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous burdens, and heavy to be born, but would not touch them with one of their fingers themſelves, Matth. 23. 4.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of this is; becauſe</p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſon 1. It is againſt his office.</note>
                  <p>Firſt, ſuch a reprover of ſin, does it againſt his office: the office of a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, binds him to be blameleſſe, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, A Biſhop muſt be blameleſſe, 1 Tim. 3. 2. Every Chriſtian ſhould be blameleſſe; how much more Miniſters that bear the office of reprovers? they ſhould be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Nay, if a man, though he take not the office of a reprover, yet if he bear the perſon of a reprover (as every private Chriſtian muſt, when God calls him to it: for every man may be called to reprove) though he have no authority over another, though he be a private man, he may bear the perſon though not the office of a reprover. Now a man muſt be unculpable, and unblameable himſelf, or elſe he ſins againſt his perſon. If a man reprove another for being carnall, himſelf muſt be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, Gal. 6. 1. If any man be overtaken with a fault, ye that are ſpirituall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him. The reprover, the exhorter, and admoniſher muſt be ſpiritual,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2. He cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to aright end.</note> if he would draw another to be ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuch a reprover as is guilty himſelf in that kind, or in any
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44191:80"/>
other kind, he can never reprove to a right end. Why ſeeſt thou a moat in thy brothers eye, and conſidereſt not the beam in thine own eye? Matthew 7. verſe 3. Why (ſaith he) to what end? what is that thou lookeſt at? thou art ſevere to eſpye faults in thy brothers eye; To what end doeſt thou reprove him? What is the reaſon? What is the thing thou wouldeſt have, that thou findeſt fault with him? Why ſeeſt thou a moat in thy brothers eye? As if he ſhould ſay, thy end can never be good, it cannot be to doe thy brother good: for then thou wouldeſt do thy ſelfe good firſt. It is not becauſe thou hateſt ſin; for then thou wouldeſt deteſt thine own ſinne. It cannot be out of a good principle, or to a good end. It is either becauſe thou art a buſie body in other mens matters, or thou art cenſorious, thou loveſt to be medling; or becauſe thou hateſt thy brother, and wouldeſt wreak thy malice on him; thou wouldeſt fain ſhame and diſgrace him, and by beating him down, get thy ſelf up; or thou wouldest get a cover to thine owne conſcience; it muſt be ſome ſuch end, it cannot be a good end. Chriſt puts it to a mans conſcience, why he reproves his brother, when he is faulty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another Reaſon is, ſuch a reprover can never do it in a right<note place="margin">Reaſon 3. Not in a right manner.</note> manner, as Chriſt ſaith, Matthew 7. 4, How wilt thou ſay to thy brother, let me pull the moat out of thine eye, when behold a beam is in thine own eye? How wilt thou do it, in what faſhion, or ſort? How wilt thou be able to bring this about? A man that is a reprover, had need to have a very clear ſight of his own, that ſees another mans faults, and will ſet another to rights, he had need to have a good judgement, to ſee all the circumſtances of reproof, and rebuke, that deals with another. As long as a man hath a beam in his own eye, as long as he hath luſts in his own heart, that will blind his judgement, and darken and cover his eyes, and make him that he ſhall not be able to ſee to goe about it. How canſt thou poſſibly ſay to thy brother, let me pull the moat out of thine eye when there is a beam in thine own eye?</p>
                  <p>A man that is to reprove another, a Maſter that will reprove his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or a Father his children, or a Miniſter that will reprove his people, or a Magiſtrate that will reprove thoſe that are committed to his charge, or any brother that will reprove another, he muſt do it with a ſpirit of compaſsion, with bowels of pity, with a ſenſe and feeling: there is a great deal of wiſedome and diſcretion to be obſerved in this act. Now when a man hath a beam in his own eye, how ſhall he be able to doe it? That man that is faulty and guilty himſelfe, either he muſt reprove too harſhly, and rigorouſly, or too ſparingly, or too inſultingly, he muſt doe it in a wrong manner, it can never be ſincerely and truly done, as long as a man hath a luſt in his own heart, and he himſelfe is guilty and faulty that is a reprover of his brother. Nay the party reproved, is holpen to retort on him, How doſt thou tell me of pride, and worldlineſſe, and covetouſneſſe? Who is proud and covetous as thou? Thus a man ſhall be ready to be hit in the teeth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſuch a reprover is an hypocrite. It is no Chriſtian reproof for<note place="margin">Reaſon 4. It is hypocriſy.</note> a man to do ſo. Wilt thou goe and find fault with thy ſervant for his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44191:81"/>
lazineſſe of thy ſervice, when thou art lazie in Gods ſervice? Wilt thou find fault with thy brother for his pride, and thou art full of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Wilt thou condemn the ſinnes of the times, and thou liveſt in ſome luſt? This is nothing but hypocriſie. Thou makeſt as if thou didſt ſtand ſo much for obedience to God, and oh! there is this and that ſin againſt God, when thy ſelfe, art a ſinner in that or in another kind; this is hypocriſie, as Chriſt ſaith here, Thou hypocrite firſt caſt the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou ſhalt ſee clearly to caſt the moat out of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eye. Thou hypocrite: Mark, it is an act of hypocriſie when a man goes to find fault with another, before he has gone to redreſſe his own ſoul, to purge his own conſcience and have ſhook hands with the wages of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity his own ſelfe, before a man hath done this, it is hypocriſie to deal with another. For when a man reproves another he takes a form upon himſelfe of one that is zealous againſt ſin, and an enemy to all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practiſes: Now what is this but hypocriſie, when a man hath not this in him that he pretends? when a man finds fault with anothers pride, as if he were humble forſooth, with anothers worldlineſſe, as if he were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall; when a man doth ſo, he incurres the guilt of hypocriſie in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving another.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, another reaſon is, becauſe ſuch a reprover is inexcuſable, his<note place="margin">Reaſon 5. It m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>kes inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</note> reproving another mans ſin, makes himſelf inexcuſable if his own, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, Romans 2. 1. Therefore thou art inexcuſable, O man, whoſoever thou art, that judgeſt: for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt thy ſelfe, for thou doeſt the ſame thing. Mark, thy own mouth ſhall condemne thee; thou findeſt fault with another mans pride: it ſeems, he is to be condemned for it, then God condemnes thee for thy pride: Thy pride is a fair mark for Gods juſtice, becauſe thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt another. Doſt thou find fault with anothers hardneſſe of haart, and ill will and backwardneſſe to any thing hat was good, and yet thou art backward? Thou expoſeſt thine own ſoul to the judgement of God; thou haſt taught (as it were) Almighty God how to condemn thee for thy own luſts and corruptions.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſixthly, another Reaſon is this, becauſe ſuch a reprover is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd<note place="margin">Reaſon 6. It is abſurd.</note> perſon. It is abſurd to reprove another, and be faulty ones ſelf, as it is, Rom. 2. 21. Thou that teacheſt another, teachest thou not thy ſelfe? Thou that preacheſt another ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal? This is a ſtrange abſurd thing, this reproof doth not ſound well in thy mouth: thou ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, and forbiddeſt ſtealing; thou preacheſt againſt adultery, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt it; thou ſpeakeſt againſt ſuch and ſuch ſinnes; thou findeſt fault with them in the children of God, and art guilty thy ſelf, or in thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or ſervants, or neighbours, and art obnoxious to them in thine own practice: this is an abſurd thing: theſe rebukes and reproofs ſound not well in thy mouth.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly it is a ſign of impudency, Pſalm 50. What haſt thou to do to take<note place="margin">Reaſon 7. It is impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> my covenant into thy mouth, when thou hateſt to be reformed, and haſt caſt my covenant behind thy back? And to the wicked God ſaith, What haſt thou to do to take my ſtatutes or covenant, into thy mouth, ſince thou hateſt inſtruction? What haſt thou to doe to reprove thy brother?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44191:81"/>
If he be proud, what is that to thee, as long as thou art proud thy ſelfe? thou goeſt and flingeſt ſtones at him, fling them at thine own heart firſt. It is a ſign of impudency.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, Shall not a wicked Magiſtrate puniſh ſinne, and a wicked miniſter preach againſt the corruptions of the times, and a wicked Maſter rebuke his ſervants, and a wicked Father correct his Children? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is wicked himſelf, ſhall he make himſelfe more wicked, and contract more guilt upon his ſoul?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that ſuch a man is in a dilemma; for the man is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, in regard of his office, and yet he is bound in conſcience to go and amend himſelf firſt. I ſay, he is bound to reprove all thoſe that God calls him to reprove, in regard of his office: but in regard of conſcience he is bound to go and amend his own fault firſt. Therefore if he be a Magiſtrate, ſuch as ſit upon life and death, Nifi prius, or any action between man and man, if he condemn a malefactor, and there remember himſelf guilty, he is bound in conſcience to ariſe from the Bench, and go and amend his own ſin. And we that are Miniſters, when we preach to the people, and remember our ſelves guilty, let us lay our hands upon our mouths, at leaſt in votis, before ever we have the face to go and find fault with the people; it is neceſſary it ſhould be ſo. Therefore, I ſay, a man is in a dilemma, if he do not reprove ſinne, it is againſt his office, and the perſon he bears, when God calls him to it; and if he be reproved, then he ſinnes againſt the command of God, that binds him to be blameleſſe, this is to bear the place of a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe of this is, firſt, to let us ſee that a man that reproves (I ſpeak<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> not of Miniſters only or of Magiſtrates, or Fathers, but of every man that reproves either by tongue, in word or in thought, if he find fault in his thought with another man for his ſinnes, and his ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,) Let him take heed, he doth but pull a judgement upon his own head; he makes himſelfe inexcuſble, as in Rom. 2. 3. the Apoſtle there ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this very point, Thinkeſt thou O man, that judgest him that doth theſe things, and doeſt them, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgement of God? A man that judgeth another and doth the ſame things, that man certainly ſhall not eſcape the judgement of God, as his brother doth not eſcape his judgement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another Uſe ſhall be for councell to every man and woman<note place="margin">Uſe 2. To be unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable ere we reprove.</note> (for it is every ones caſe) God hath called every one of us to reprove one another, Miniſters to reprove the people, and Magiſtrates to judge between man and man, and every neighbour is to reprove, when he is called thereto. Now let us mark and obſerve this rule, let every one of us labour with all care and conſcience, to be unblameable, unoffenſive, to humble our own ſouls, to cleanſe our own conſciences, that we may be able to perform this duty. Beloved we wrong our own ſouls, if we find fault with others, and ſuffer our ſelves to be faulty.</p>
                  <p>When Paul was to preach to the people, knowing that his office of preaching required reproving, you ſee, leſt he ſhould wrong his own ſoul, how he laboured to bee unblameable, ſaith he, I beat my bodie
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44191:82"/>
down, when I preach to others, lest I become a caſt away.</p>
                  <p>Again as a man wrongs his own ſoul, ſo he diſhonours God. It cannot be unknown what an unthankfull office, the office of a reprover is, the world cannot abide reproof. The wicked hate the reprover in the gate, Iſa. 29. 21. The world is full of ſcorners, that hate reproof. Prov. 15. 12. Though ſome men be not ſo wicked as to hate reproof, yet at leaſt they think hardly of them that reprove; they think they uſurp authority over them; and crow over them, or they undertake to be their betters; as a reprover undertakes in that thing to be a mans better. Now when a man is reproved, he is apt to think that his neighbour crows over him, and excerciſeth authority upon him, as if he would grow on him, and be his Judge. You ſee Lot, when he reproved the Sodomites, though as gently as ever he could, My brethren do not ſo wickedly, preſently for all that, they thought hardly of him; What, will this fellow be a judge that came but the other day to ſojourn? Gen. 19. Preſently they thought hardly of him. So we ſee, the Prophet doth but find fault with Amaziah for his fault, and preſently the Kings eyes are blinded, and his heart heardened, Who made you of the Kings counſell? 2 Chron. 25. 15. he thought him a medler, that pried into State-affairs, and into the Court and Kingdom. A man cannot reprove his brother for his ſinne, but it is a thouſand to one if his brother be not ready preſently to pry into him, and to look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into his wayes, to eſpy a hole in his coat if he can, or to make one if he cannot: all mens eyes are upon him, and they look ſtrictly and ſtraightly, and if any thing in the world be amiſſe, they will be ſure to mark it, and to make more of it, to make mountains of Mole-hills. When the blind man did but find fault with the Phariſees, and reprove them a little for perſecuting of Chriſt, what ſay they? Art thou altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and born in ſin, and wilt thou teach us? John 9. 34. Preſently they looked on his blindneſſe, and birth, Certainly he is a viler ſinner than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and ſhall he go find fault with them? If we mean to reprove another, let us labour to be unblameable, to be Godly and holy, to reform our own wayes; let us be ſure to purge our own families, to cleanſe our own ſouls, to rid our own hands of all the wayes of ſinne and iniquity, leſt God be diſhonoured. The word of God will be flung in his own face back again, and the reproof, if it be never ſo ſweet, and never ſo wiſe, it wil be retorted in a mans own teeth, if he be not unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able himſelf. And a man had need to be humble, and lowly, and gentle, and meek, and to put on all bowels, and gentleneſſe of heart, if he will reprove.</p>
                  <p>All ſins are not to be reproved alike, ſome with ſharpneſſe, ſome with lenity. He is a Mountebank, that will open a vein for every wheal and pimple. The reprover is like them in Iſaiah, when they deal with<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the Cummin and Fetches, a little rod will beat them out, but when they come to the Corn, Wheat, and Rye, they beat them out with the Cart-wheel: So when we meet with a hard-hearted ſpirit, we muſt uſe ſtronger corroſives to them, and gentler admonitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes towards others that ſin with a leſſer and a weaker hand. But this is
<pb facs="tcp:44191:82"/>
a thing that a man muſt be marvellous carefull of, that reproves. Nay, let a man be unblameable for the preſent, if he have been faulty before if it were ſeven, or ten, or twenty years before, if it be known, it is a thouſand to one, but he ſhall be hit in the teeth with it, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves: you committed adultery, and you did ſteal at ſuch a time, if it were never ſo long agoe. Therefore St. Paul would not conſent to take Mark with him in the miniſtery, Acts 15. becauſe he had been offenſive to the Church before. We had need to be marvellous careful and wary, if we will reprove.</p>
                  <p>I had thought to have named other Uſes, but I leave this expoſition, and take it as it is paſſively interpreted.</p>
                  <q>He that being often reprov'd, hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</q>
                  <p>THough it may be expounded the other way, yet I rather incline to<note place="margin">The ſecond expoſition.</note> this.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon is;</p>
                  <p>Becauſe this is the conſtant current of all interpreters generally. I meet but with one or two that expond it the other way; but all paſſively, He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe the word in the original is, A man of reproofs that harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own neck. Now, though it be indifferent whether it be active or paſſive, yet look in the ſcripture, and you ſhall find it more often paſſive then active. A man of reproofs, that is a man often reproved, in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. As in Iſaiah 53. 3. Chriſt is a man of ſorrows, not making others ſorry, but made ſorry paſſively. And ſo in Dan. 9. 23. It is ſaid Daniel was a man of deſires, that is, not a man deſiring other men, or other things, not actively deſiring, but paſſively, deſired, beloved of God exceedingly. So it is ſaid of Jeremiah, Jerem. 15. 10. he was a man of ſtrife, not a man ſtriving with others, but a man ſtriven with. So in 1 King. 2. 26. A man of death, that is, not killing others, but to be killed himſelf. It is taken more frequently in the paſſive ſenſe; and we may more boldly take it ſo. A man of reprofs, that is, reproved again and again, that hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved divers reproofs, and yet hardeneth his own neck, ſhall ſuddenly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and that without remedy. Here I might obſerve by the way, this point of Doctrine, That,</p>
                  <p>The Lord doth not deſtroy man willingly.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith not, A man ſhall be deſtroyed without remedy; but a man<note place="margin">The Lord doth not deſtroy men willingly. God deſtroys not but for ſin.</note> when he hath ſinned againſt God, when he had committed ſinne, and not only ſo, but when he is reproved for his ſin, and goeth on. The Lord doth not deſtroy a man nakedly, but upon conſideration of ſin. Willingly the Lord doth not afflict any, Lament. 3. Mercy and puniſhment they flow from God, as the honey and the ſting from the Bee; the Bee yeildeth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:44191:83"/>
of her own nature, but ſhe doth not ſting, but when ſhe is provoked: So the Lord is gracious, and good, and favourable, and kind, and bleſſeth his people from his own nature, but he doth not puniſh, and plague, and deſtroy, but being provoked by ſin and iniquity. I will not ſtand to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this point, I let it go.</p>
                  <p>The text it ſelf contains the great mercy of God in lending a man a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.<note place="margin">Obſervation 1. A great mercy to be reproved</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what a great ſin it is, what a great ill it is for a man to ſin againſt his reproof. The greatneſſe of the ill is ſet down two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by the great ſinfulneſſe of the thing, it is called the hardening of a mans own neck.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the greatneſſe of the puniſhment that God inflicts upon this ſin, and that is, he will deſtroy him, and that without remedy.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, namely, what a great mercy it is for God to let a man be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for his ſins. It may be proved by many places of Scripture only, I find Scripture is to be brought as an aggravation of ſin, when they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt reproof, Hoſea 5. 1. ſaith he, they are profound to commit ſin, though I have been a rebuker of them all. As if he ſhould ſay, Though I have been ſo mercifull, as to ſhew them the danger of ſin, to tell them what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of their wretched courſes; though I have called them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and have given them warning what would be the iſſue of theſe things; yet for all this, for all my mercy, they have gone on in their ſinnes, though I have reproved them. This Though is a word of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as we ſee in the ſpeech of Daniel to Belſhazzar; Thou, O King, haſt not humbled thy ſelf, though thou knewest this: as if he had ſaid, though the Lord let thee know the puniſhment upon thy father, and the plagues of Nebuchadnezzar thy grandfather, though the Lord have let thee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it is for thee to exalt thy ſelf againſt him; yet thou art not humbled; he aggravates his ſin; So, this aggravates a mans ſin, when he goes on, notwithſtanding he is reproved.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons are;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe when God reproves a man of ſinne, the reproof primarily comes<note place="margin">Reaſon 1. Reproofs come from love.</note> out of love; therefore when he reproved Laodicea, and told her ſhe was luke-warm, and ſaid, I would thou wert either hot or cold, and ſince ſhe was neither, he would ſpue her out of his mouth; he tells her whence the reproof flowed; becauſe I love, I reprove: As many as I love, I rebuke, Revel. 3. 19. It is not out of ill will that I tell thee of thy luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſſe, and threaten to ſpue thee out of my mouth; I tell thee theſe things that thou mayſt avoid that ill; I ſay, Gods reproofs flow prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily from love to men, whereby he would have them lay aſide their wretched courſes, and avoyd the judgements. Nay, it is an argument of hatred, when a man doth not reprove his brother of ſin. If God let a man go on in ſin, and never tell him of his drunkenneſſe, nor never find fault with his pride and ſecurity, never convince him, or wound, or touch him, nor deal with him about his unſetled eſtate, and his rotten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, It is a ſign God hates the man: But when God reproves a man from day to day, Man thou art a proud creature, thou ſhalt to hell for thy pride, and hypocriſie, and ſecurity, and hardneſſe of heart:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44191:83"/>
When the Lord reproves a man from day to day, this is an argument of love; the other is an effect of hatred, not to reprove; Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, ſaith Moſes, but ſhalt in any wiſe reprove him, and not ſuffer ſin to be upon him, Levit: 19. 17. Thou hateſt thy brother when thou ſeeſt him ſin, and doeſt not warn him; and knoweſt he is guilty of ſinfull courſes, and doeſt not reprove him; and when thou haſt time, and place, and opportunity, and fit circumſtances to reprove, and yet thou wilt not do it, it is a ſign thou hateſt thy brother; it is the greateſt degree of hatred on them. If a man deny food for the body, and let a man rather dye of hunger, than he will give him meat, or let a man fall into a pit, rather than he will prevent the miſchief, a man is guilty of bodily murder: but thou art guilty of the ſoul of thy brother, if thou let him fall into ſin. Thou thinkeſt thy brother is harſh, he will not bear<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 17.</note> with thee, he is haſty and teſty: no, thou art in an error, That man that hates reproof, erreth, ſaith Solomon. Indeed a man ſhould not be too ſharp, but firſt tell his brother in private that he is in an error: for, reproof is a means of grace, it flows from great love, it is the providence of God that hath caſt it about, that thou ſhouldeſt have reproof given thee; if thou have a heart to take it. It is an argument of love.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is taken from the primary end of reproof, which is to bring<note place="margin">Reaſon. 2. They tend to good.</note> a man to good, to reduce him into a right way, to convert a man, to ſave his ſoul, that is the primary end of reproof aud admonition: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to go in ſinnes contrary to it, muſt needs be a great evill. As Solomon brings in the wiſdome of the Father, Jeſus Chriſt, calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on people, O yee fools, how long will ye love folly? turn at my reproof. Mark what follows, to what end; I will pour my ſpirit on you. There is the end he tells them, O ye fools, wretched people without underſtanding, that go on in ſinne, and harden your own hearts, that repent not, nor turn not to God, that will not ſubmit to his wiſdom, nor imbrace his word: yee fools, that wrong your own ſouls, Oh turn at my reproof. Why? This is the reaſon that God reproves a man on this faſhion, it is, that a man may have the Spirit of God granted him. If thou have an ear to hear reproof, and a heart to drink it in, and to wear it as a crown of gold on thy head, and as a chain about thy neck, thou ſhouldeſt have the Spirit of God for thy labour: the Lord reproves thee that thou mighteſt return back, and have the Spirit, and have mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This is all the ill-will that Gods Miniſters bear thee, and all the hatred that reprovers ſhew, when they tell thee of thy ſinnes whatſoever they be, that they may ſtop thy ſteps from going down to Hell.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord ſends thee Sermon upon Sermon, Preacher after Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, thou art called on day by day, (as you hear in this place) This is the infinite goodneſſe of God towards your ſouls; therefore your ſin is infinite great if you do not amend, as the wiſe man ſaith, He that hates reproof ſhall ſurely dye, Prov. 15. 10. there is no remedy for that man. That man that puts off repentance, God reproves him from day to day, on the Sabbath day, and on the week dayes; he goes to this man and here he is reproved, and to another, and there he is reproved, and yet
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44191:84"/>
he goes on in his deadneſſe and formality in the ordinances of God, that man ſhall ſurely dye, there is no remedy, he ſins againſt the infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is no reaſon in the world why reproof ſhould be taken<note place="margin">Reaſon 3. It is brutiſh to reprove them.</note> otherwiſe than with all willingneſſe, and thankfulneſſe, and chearfulneſſe. If a man have but the reaſon of a man in him; he muſt needs take reproof in good part; he muſt be a beaſt that doth not judge well of him that reproves him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is an excellent place, Prov. 12. 1. He that puts off reproof is brutiſh; he that hates reproof is the brute, that man hath no reaſon in him. Art thou a ſwearer, and art reproved for it? thy brother tells thee thou wilt be damned for it; Doſt thou chafe at that man? thou art a beaſt, thou haſt no more underſtanding than an Oxe or<note place="margin">Simile.</note> an Aſſe. As it is with a horſe, when the Oſtler comes to rub him, he kicks with his heel, when he only beats of the dirt, he lifts up his hinder leg on him, and it may be wounds him ſo thou haſt no more underſtanding than a beaſt, that finds fault with one that reproves thee for thy ſins. So that whatſoe'r thy ſin be, he that tels thee of it, there is no reaſon in the world but that he ſhould be a dear man to thee. Me thinks of all men under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, godly Miniſters that are faithfull in their place and calling, ſhould be the deareſt men to you upon the face of the earth. Why? becauſe they reprove you, and tell you of your ſins, and what will become of your ſouls, what will be the iſſue and Cataſtrophe of all you wayes. You that come to Church every day, may read a Lecture in the Word of God, what will be your doom at the laſt day: you are told of your pride, and adultery, of your whoredom, and oaths, carnall Goſpellers of their ſecure and carnal condition, and common profeſſors of their formality, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther luſts that men are given to; you are told of all: I ſay, the feet of Gods meſſengers ſhould be beautifull, you ſhould hug the meſſengers, and put their reproofs in your boſomes, and let them have power and efficacy on your ſouls; and go and put them in practice.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe of this is;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, is it ſo, that it is the infinite mercie of God to reprove men of their ſins, to tell them of whatſoever is amiſſe in their hearts and lives?<note place="margin">Uſe 1. The miſery to want reprovers.</note> let me tell you, Firſt, ſee here what an infinite puniſhment God is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that kingdom when he is taking away reprovers from them: when God takes away reprovers, he takes away all mercy and loving kindneſſe. Therefore God when he threatned to deliver up Judah, to curſe that Kingdom, to plague them for their rebellion, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to give them over, he ſaith, he will take away the reprover; ſaith he to the Prophet, Thou ſhalt be dumb and not open thy mouth, thou ſhalt not be a reprover to this people, Ezek. 2. 26. When the Lord would curſe that people; and bind them over to a reprobate ſenſe, and deliver them to wrath, the Prophet ſhall not be a reprover, he ſilences the Prophet. Or as Piſcator thinks, the anger of God ſilenced him, or confin'd him to his<note place="margin">Or Angel.</note> houſe, that he ſhould not propheſie. So when God ſilences his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that he takes them from a place, or threatens to take them away,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44191:84"/>
it is a ſign of heavy vengeance towards ſuch a people. It may be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked people laughed at them, and made it a matter of nothing, they were glad that Ezekiels mouth was gagged, and it were no matter if the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were rid of a company of Puritans; though they had no ſuch word then, they had as bad, they think all is well: but the time will come, that they will curſe the day that ever they provoked God to take away their Miniſters, we enjoy them by the mercy of God, other places have loſt them God knows how ſoon we may loſe ours. In Hoſea 4. 4. the Lord, there, when he would ſet out the deſperate eſtate of the children of Ephram delivers them up to ſuch a ſtate and condition, that none ſhould reprove them, Let none reprove another. If they will ſinne, let them: if they will go on in Idolatry, let them; If they will harden their own hearts, let them; if they will dye in ſinne, let them; if they will periſh, and be damned for ever, let them. Let no man reprove another. It is a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Generally, people are glad when the Land is ſwept of all the good Miniſters, and the good ſervants of God: they had rather hear a fine ſong in a pulpit, of one that preacheth morally, or it may be preacheth his own ſelfe, or the like; but the time will come, when they ſhall ſay as Solomon ſaith, It is better to hear the reproof of the wiſe than the ſong of fools, Eccleſiaſtes 7. 5. people love alife to hear the ſong of fools. When a fool comes up and preacheth, At what time ſoever a ſinner ſhall repent him of his ſinne: And, be not juſt overmuch; and what need ſuch a do? Here is more puther than need, and abuſe places, and wreſt Scripture. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the thief on the Croſſe was ſaved at the laſt with a word or two; and they bring the example of the Publican, that cryed, God be mercifull to me a ſinner, and went juſtified to his houſe rather than the Phariſee that made long prayers. And ruſh, what need men be ſo zealous, and preciſe, and puritanicall? Whoſoever calls upon the name of God, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: people love alife ſuch ſongs of fools: but the time ſhall come when peoples eyes ſhall be opened, and their conſciences awakened, and then they will wiſh, O that we had heard the reproof of the wiſe!</p>
                  <p>The ſecond uſe makes againſt thoſe that deſpiſe the reproofe of the wiſe, ye<note place="margin">Uſe 2. Againſt deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of reproof.</note> deſpiſe not men but God; ye have deſpiſed me, Prov. 1. 30. You thinke you deſpiſe a poor Miniſter, he is ſtrict, and harſh with your ſouls, and preſſeth theſe things upon your conſciences, and it may be, more than he hath warrant to do: ſo you think you do not deſpiſe God, but only the Miniſter: Nay, ſaith Chriſt, you have deſpiſed my reproof. When you deſpiſe them that Chriſt ſends, you deſpiſe him. This is an expreſſe and an explicite ſign of a mans everlaſting deſtruction, when he deſpiſeth reproof, as in that ſpeech of the Prophet to Amaziah, I know that the Lord hath determined to deſtroy thee: becauſe thou haſt not hearkened to my reproof, 2. Chron. 25. 16. So I may ſay, I know that God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to deſtroy a Nation, a City, or people, when they will not take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Gods Meſſengers, when they will not hearken to inſtruction. They have been called upon, nationall ſinnes have been ripped up, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall ſinnes have been ſpoken of, yet when they are told, they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44191:85"/>
will not be reproved. We that are the Miniſters of God, know that God will deſtroy as many as turn not at reproof. I let this paſs.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now ſhew the grievouſneſſe of this ill of ſtanding out againſt reproof: it is expreſſed two ways;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the ſinfulneſſe of it, to harden a mans heart.<note place="margin">The grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt reproof.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly in the puniſhment; He ſhall be deſtroyd without remedy. And in the deſtruction you may ſee here,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the unexpectedneſſe of it, He ſhall be deſtroyed ſuddenly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the totalneſſe of it, He ſhall be deſtroyed. The word ſignifies to ſhatter all in pieces.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the irrecoverableneſſe of it, without remedy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the ſuitableneſſe of it, his puniſhment is according to his ſin. Mark, as he hardened his own heart againſt God, ſo God will harden his heart againſt him; as no remedy would turn him from his ſin, ſo no remedy ſhall turn God from his wrath: As his ſin was in hardening his heart like a ſtone, ſo God ſhall deal with him as a ſtone is dealt with, he ſhall deſtroy him. The word in the originall ſignifies broken to peeces as a ſtone is broken, that is, the Lord will deal with him juſt in his own kind. Hence I might obſerve this doctrine, that,</p>
                  <p>The Lord proportions puniſhments to mens ſins.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as a mans ſin is, ſo is the puniſhment. David ſinned in numbering<note place="margin">Doct. God proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſins.</note> the people 2 Sam 24. 15. and God puniſhed him in that; Pharaoh ſinned in deſtroying and drowning the males of the Iſraelites; God ſmote his firſt born: He drowned their babes, and he himſelfe was drowned in the ſea. I might bring abundance of examples.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reaſons of this are</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe hereby a mans puniſhment appears to be ſo much the more equall and worthy. Retaliation is a moſt equall puniſhment to the ſinne;<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1. To ſhew the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> there is no inequality in it but this, that it is too mercifull, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, burn for burn, wound for wound. You know an eye is equall for an eye: ſo when God puniſheth a man juſt in his own kind, quid for quo, that as there was no remedy would turn him from his ſin, ſo there ſhall be no remedy ſhall turn God from his wrath. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Gods puniſhment appears the moſt equall, Revelations 16. 5. 6. Thou art righteous, O Lord, in that thou judgeſt thus, for ſhe hath ſhed the bloud of thy Saints, therefore thou haſt given them bloud to drink, for they are worthy. Thou thirſtedſt after blood, there it is for thee: ſo this is moſt equall, when men have dealt thus and thus with God, when God ſhall deal ſo and ſo with them, they cannot find fault. When a man drinks as he brews, and reaps as he ſows, and finds as he brings, what inequality is here? It ſhall come to paſſe, that as when I called they would not hear, ſo when they call I will not anſwer, Zach. 7. When God calls upon thee, and thou wilt not hear, afterwards when thou calleſt for mercy, if he do not hear thee, it is juſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another reaſon is, becauſe this ſtops a mans mouth, it convinceth a mans conſcience; when a mans conſcience finds that he is ſerved in his own
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44191:85"/>
kind, that he is paid in his own coin, it ſtops his mouth Adonibezck, he had cut off the thumbs and toes of 70 Kings: afterwards he was ſerved juſt ſo as he had dealt with others; he had cut off their thumbs and toes, &amp; made them gather orts under his table, ſo afterwards his thumbs and toes were cut off. Now mark what his conſcience ſaith, Judg. 1. 7. As I have dealt, ſo God hath dealt with me. As if he had ſaid, God knows wherefore the children of Judah have done this: they know not why they cut off my thumbs, and the reaſon why they cut off my toes: God knows what they looked at in puniſhing me thus: but Gods juſt providence hath dealt thus with me, in this kind I ſerved others. This is ſo palpable a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſo equall and juſt, that though the ſin were committed twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years agoe, yet a mans conſcience will find out his ſin twenty years after. As Joſephs brethren ſold him, and after caſt him into a pit, two and twenty years after, when Joſeph was harſh with them, ſee what their conſcience ſaith; Doubtleſse we are guilty of our brothers blood, when we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, and he beſought us, and we would not hear. As if they had ſaid, What is the matter why the man is thus harſh? He never ſaw us before, why ſhould he be ſo harſh, and we be ſtrangers? Nay, ſaith conſcience, you are well ſerved, remember you were harſh to your brother, if you dealt ſo with him, marvell not if you be dealt ſo with. And after, when they came to their Inne, and found their money, they wondred, What is this that God hath done? Their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I warrant you, hit them in the teeth: without doubt they thought the money that they took for ſelling of their brother had haunted them as a Ghoſt; did not we pay the man money for his corne that we bought? Nay, ſaith conſcience, you are rightly ſerved, here is the money you ſold your brother for, (though it were not ſo) without doubt conſcience upbraided them. Naturally we are apt to find fault with Gods judgements, and quarrell, but when conſcience ſees the equity of them, we have nothing to ſay.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all the ſtanders by may ſee the equity of it, when the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is according to the ſin: Nay, Divinity makes this Argument; that there is a God to judge the earth, becauſe men are puniſhed in their own kind. I will ſhew you one example of Abimelech, that wretch, that ſlew ſeventy of his brethren upon one ſtone, Judg. 9. 7. afterward when he came to ſtand under the Tower of Abel, a woman flung a piece of a milſtone upon his head, and killed him: This was ſtrange, all the ſtanders by might ſay, that Abimelech ſhould be killed with a ſtone: no queſtion the woman thought nothing, ſhe flung the ſtone becauſe ſhe had nothing elſe to fling; it was ſtrange that it ſhould hit him ſo pat, it might have hit another as well as him, the ſtone might have fallen to the ground as well as on him; and that it ſhould be by a woman, and a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone too: Milſtones are not uſed on the top of a Tower, and a milſtone broken that a woman could lift it, and that he ſhould be killed by a milſtone and not with a ſword, nay, might all the ſtanders by ſay, This God hath done, he was the ſon of a ſtrange woman, and a woman hath killed him; he killed his brethren upon one ſtone, and now a ſtone hath killed him; all the world might be able to ſay; This God hath done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:44191:86"/>The Uſe of this is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let no creature in the world complain of Gods dealing, if he puniſh us according to our kind: he that kils with the ſword ſhall be killed with the ſword. He that ſtops his ears from hearing the poor, what ſhall his puniſhment be? He ſhall cry and not be heard. He that ſhews no mercy, how ſhall he be puniſhed? He ſhall receive no mercy, James 2. 13. Wo to thee that ſpoyledſt, and waſt not ſpoyled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when thou ceaſest ſpoyling, others ſhall ſpoyl thee, Iſa 33. 2. Judge not, (ſaith Chriſt,) what if I do? Then thou ſhalt be judged. Thus God recompenceth the fruit of a mans doing. Here is no Momus can complain; no Ariſtarchus, that can find fault with the juſtice and judgement of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is not amiſſe to conſider and ſee how God proportions puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſins.</p>

                  <p>In Kind; He ſhall eat the fruit of his own wayes, that is, he ſhall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in kind. It is a ſimilitude from a tree, every tree brings forth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its own kind; if it be an Apple-tree, it brings forth Apples; if a Crab-tree, Crabs; a Pear-tree, Pears; So every ſinner ſhall be puniſhed in their kind, a Miniſter ſhall be puniſhed in his kind, wicked Maſters in their kind, Servants in theirs, Rich in theirs, poor in theirs: If a man be a drunkard, he ſhall be puniſhed in one kind; if he be an adulterer, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Every man ſhall eat the fruit of his own wayes. Every ſin brings an homogeneal puniſhment, according to the nature of it. I cannot ſtand to follow this, though it he very clear in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is in Quantity God proportions the puniſhment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſin; he that ſowes ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly; but he that ſowes bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully. Little ſins, little puniſhments; and great ſins, great puniſhments. There are little ſins, moat ſins, gnat ſins, and there are Camel ſins; ſo there are little and great puniſhments, ſome meet with many, ſome with fewer ſtripes. Juſt according to a mans ſins, ſo the Lord ſhapes out the puniſhment, for great ſinners, great plagues, and for every one according to his own meaſure. God hath a pair of bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances that he means to weigh men in: As he weighed Belſhazzar, ſo he will weigh thee, and look how much ſin thou putteſt in one ſcale, ſo much puniſhment God will put in the other; He will not abate thee one oath, not one idle thought, not one breach of the Sabbath, not one neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of hearing the Word, or of other duties: the Lord will put wrath in one ballance, as thou putteſt ſin in the other; he will make the ſcales e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a haire: as he dealt with Belſhazzar, He will lay righteouſneſſe to the line, and judgement, to the plummet, and weigh thee out in the ſcales, and thou ſhalt have juſt according to thy ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:44191:86"/>As the Lord deals with his own people, he will not abate ſo much as a cup of cold water, but it ſhall be rewarded; he will reward all, from the greateſt to the leaſt: ſo he will deal with the wicked, there ſhall no ſinne paſſe unpuniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Again, there is a proportion in the Quality. If Adam ſin in eating, he ſhall be puniſhed in eating; if the women of Judah ſin in apparel, they ſhall be puniſhed in apparel, Iſa 3. 24. In Wiſ. 11. 16. A man ſhall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in that that he ſins in. If Abſalom ſin in his hair, he ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; Nebuchadnezzar might find his ſin in his brutiſh condition, and the Prodigall might find his ſinne in the Hog<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>trough: ſo if thou find thy ſelf in want, conſider if thou haſt not waſted thy means: if thou haſt not been vain in building, and prodigal in ſpending, or gaming or unneceſſary bounty, and im moderate liberality beyond thy means: Art thou puniſhed in thy Trade, or Children? &amp;c. ſee if thou haſt not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, for where there is ſin, God will proportion the puniſhment to the ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God proportions the puniſhment to the ſin in regard of the time. The ſame hour that Belſhazzar was drinking and quaffing in the Temple, the ſame hour the hand of God was upon him; if it be not upon thee the ſame hour, it may be to morrow at the ſame hour. It may be thou haſt ſinned this day at ſuch an hour, it may be God may ſtrike thee to morrow at the ſame time, or this day ſeven-night, it may be the next year. Nebuchadnezzar was warned of his pride this year and the ſame time twelvemoneth the Lord drove him from among men. So in Acts 13. 42. one Sabbath day the Jews heard Paul preach and went out before the Sermon was quite done, they were not able to ſtand to the bleſſing; the ſame day ſeven-night the Lord made the Apoſtles ſhake off the duſt of their feet againſt them, and leave them to a reprobate ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Lord proportions his puniſhments to the place. It is ſtrange many times, that the drunkard ſhould get his death in the ſame Alehouſe where he got his liquor. In Judg. 7. in that ſtory of Oreb and Zeeb, Oreb at the rock Oreb deviſed againſt the children of Iſrael, and upon the ſame rock he was killed; And Zeeb another perſecuter of the Children of God; ſo the Pſalmiſt calls them, he at the Wine preſſe of Zeeb took vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals from the children of Iſrael, and in the ſame place his own life was taken away.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as Judges and Magiſtrates at this day, they hang up men where they have done the villany. As they do with Dogs and Cats, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them to the place, to the Cellar or the Buttery where they do the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. But the beaſts themſelves though they have no reaſon, are able to pick out the meaning of it. The Lord puniſheth ſinners in the ſame place. Here where thou haſt been deaf to hear the word of God, when thy heart riſeth againſt the Preacher, in the ſame place, it may be the Lord wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee up to a reprobate ſenſe. In the ſame place, at the Lords Table, where thou comeſt unworthily, thou ſhalt eat and drink thine own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heretofore begun the Doctrine of the Thoughts of men; Now I deſire to finiſh it. Whence we had this Point: that</p>
                  <p>Thoſe whoſe minds run habitually on earthly<note place="margin">Doctrine:</note> things, are yet in the ſtate of miſery.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe a man is in the ſtate of miſery till he hath repented: Now, untill a man have forſaken his old thoughts, that man hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented. Oh Jeruſalem, waſh thy heart, Jer. 4. 14. A man muſt not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>id himſelfe of vain thoughts, but he muſt waſh his heart clean, with this Emphaſis, That he may be ſaved: No ſalvation without this. How long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee?</p>
                  <p>2. As a man is in the ſtate of miſery, till he have repented, ſo alſo till he is in Chriſt. Now when a man is led by his own vain thoughts, his thoughts being not ſanctified; ſo long that man is not in Chriſt. If he were in Chriſt, Chriſt would ſanctifie his thoughts. I but, may ſome man ſay, He hath wronged me, ergo, I will think thus and thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44191:90"/>
Chriſt caſteth down the ſtrong holds, and if thou wilt not yield, Chriſt will caſt thee off; but if thou belong to Chriſt, he will caſt all down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</p>
                  <p>3. That man is in the ſtate of miſery, that doth not love God, that walks not with God in his thoughts, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, &amp;c. Mat. 22. 37. So I do, ſayes one, and yet I think on my vanities too: And thus carnal men think they love God. But if thou love God with all thy heart, thou loveſt him with all that is in thy heart; for what is a mans heart, but the purpoſes of his heart? Now if a man give not over vain purpoſes, he loves not God with all his heart.</p>
                  <p>4. That man that cannot forſake ſinne, is in the ſtate of miſery, and can never enter into life, (ſee the Text) the wicked must forſake his wayes. A man muſt deny his own words, and ſpeak according to Gods own warrant: the actions of mens lives are the wayes of their thoughts; the Tongue muſt not only forſake his way, but the Heart his way alſo; elſe a man is a wicked man, Prov. 13. 26. He is wicked whoſe thoughts are not ſanctified. But what will men ſay? ſhall we be condemned for a thought? words are ſmall ſins, and thoughts are leſſe: Muſt a man then ſo ſtrictly look to his thoughts? I will make it plain, that for a man to be vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughted, is a grievous ſin;</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe if the ſin of vain thoughts be pardoned, it will ask abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Mark the Text, Abundantly pardon: No repentance, no mercy, no abundance of it; ergo, it is not ſo ſmall as the world takes it to be.</p>
                  <p>2. Thoughts are the ſins of the highest part of a man; for they are the ſins of the heart; and ſurely the ſins of the chiefeſt part are greater then any other. A King counts it not much for a Rogue to ſteale by the wayes ſide, but for a Knight or a Noble-man it is a foul matter: So the Lord would not have the lordly part to ſin againſt him; He would not have the tongue, much leſſe the heart, that is, the Kingly part of a man, to tranſgreſſe. And this is the reaſon why Deborah calls them great thoughts of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judg. 5. 15. Sins in thought, are great ſins: the Heart is the Lady, the miſtreſſe, or higheſt part of a man; and He that hath made us, looks that we ſhould ſerve him with the Maſter-part; That muſt be afforded him.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe thoughts are breaches of every Commandement; Other ſins are but againſt one, but all the Commandements condemn vain thoughts. The firſt Commandement ſaith, Thou ſhalt have no others Gods but me; But thou ſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt an Image up in thy heart, when thou thinkeſt of thy pleaſures, &amp;c. So, Thou ſhalt keep holy the ſabbath day: Now if thou think thine own thoughts that day, thou breakeſt this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo of all the reſt: The ſinne of thought is therefore a hainous ſinne.</p>
                  <p>4. Becauſe they are the ſtrength of a mans heart and ſoul, the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of originall corruption. A man by nature is a child of wrath, a ſoul and a body of death. Now what doth the heart firſt break out in? It firſt ſhews it ſelf in its thoughts; and if it be the firſt-born, it muſt needs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44191:90"/>
be the ſtrengh: as Jacob ſaid to Ruben his firſt-born, he was his ſtrength; and therefore all Lord-ſhip lies in the heart; A man may more eaſily part with all other ſins then with this, becauſe the bent of the heart runs this way; the heart will part with any ſin, rather then with his pernicious thoughts.</p>
                  <p>5. Becauſe they are the deareſt acts of men. We count a man prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when he is preferred to the thoughts of a man, Gen. 40. 14. Think on me, ſaith Joſeph to Pharoahs Butler: I count it thanks enough, if thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre me to thy thoughts. We prize that moſt, which we think moſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; That which a man ſcorns, he ſcorns to beſtow his thoughts on; but that which a man ſets his heart on, that is his dearling. Now that any thing ſhould be dear to a man, ſave God, this is a horrible ſin; when a man makes his dogs his dearling, his whore his dearling, &amp;c. For look what thou moſt thinkeſt on, that is thy dearling: Why? Becauſe thou dandleſt it in thy heart; therefore it is a horrible ſin for a man not to ſet his heart upon God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Objection.</note>But can a man live without thoughts? doth Grace call us to leave thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king? then a man muſt ceaſe to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>Non tollit, ſed attollit naturam; it takes them not away, but it takes them up. He doth not ſay, Let the wicked forſake thoughts, but his thoughts; let him ſet them on other matters. When God cals men unto him, he is ſo far from taking away mens thoughts, as that he will rather increaſe them. If thou be a new creature, thou muſt have more thoughts; Thou art full of thoughts now; but then thou wilt be fuller. Pſal. 119. 59. When David turned to God, his heart thought upon his wayes; the word in the original is, He thought on his wayes on both ſides. The curious work of the Sanctuary was wrought on both ſides; Common works are wrought only on one ſide, but on the other ſide are full of ends and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eds. So the Prophet looks on his way on both ſides; he ſtrives to walk curiouſly, preciſely, and accurately to turn himſelf to Gods teſtimonies. Ergo, God cals not to forſake thoughts, but our thoughts; it is a hard duty for men to forſake their own thoughts. I will make it appear thus:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is a hard thing to reform ones ſelf; one thing may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form another; but here is the difficulty, for a thing to reform it ſelf: it is an eaſie matter for a mans heart to reform his tongue, but it is hard for the heart to reform it ſelf, in correcting its own thoughts: it is hard for a man to deny himſelf. Ahel-hound may reform his tongue; but here is the difficulty, for his heart to reform it ſelf, for thoughts are the heart, Phil 3. 19. who mind earthly things; thoughts of earthly things are called the mind; a mans thoughts and his mind are all one, ſo that if it reform thoughts, it muſt reform it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>2. It is hard to reform thoughts, becauſe they are partiall acts; if they were full acts, a man might reform them, rather then being partiall acts: my reaſon is, becauſe they are in every action he doth; thoughts run on all mens actions; if thoughts were alone, men might mend them: but they buſie themſelves about all actions; if a man pray, thoughts run along with him in prayer, nay men pray with twiſted thoughts, ſo that before
<pb facs="tcp:44191:91"/>
he comes to an end of his prayer, he ſhall have abundance of glancings on other things. See it in old Eli, 1 Sam. 1. Hanna was praying; Old Eli ſaith the Text, thought ſhe had been drunken. Either he was, or ſhould have been praying alſo; yet you ſee he had wandring thoughts ꝙ mark the lips of his neighhours. So, as John was preaching, Mat. 3. there came a thought into his hearers hearts, that they were the ſeed of Abraham. What did make them think ſo? John ſpake of no ſuch matter; but he ſaid, Every tree that brings not forth good fruit, &amp;c. They had, it ſeems, by thoughts in the duty of hearing; therefore ſeeing thoughts do thus twiſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about mens actions, hence it is that they are ſo hard to be rooted out.</p>
                  <p>3. It is hard for men to forſake their own thoughts, becauſe they are in mens hearts, Their inward thoughts, Pſal. 49. 11. Every man hath two kind of thoughts, inward, and outward; explicite, and implicite; implicite thoughts are thoſe that never ſhew themſelves in the heart, but at ſome deſperate attempt; Explicite, are thoſe which are in the heart every day: as in Pſal. 49. 11. They think their houſes ſhall continue for ever. Would you think that men ſhould have ſuch thoughts? their outward thoughts were, they were mortall; Wee ſee (ſaith the Text) that men die, &amp;c. and yet they they think inwardly that they ſhall live for ever. Now according to theſe inward thoughts men act; and hence it is that men neglect repentance, and other holy duties, as if God would never call them to an account; they have not theſe thoughts above-board, but they are inward, and theſe ſpoile the heart, and theſe are the cauſe why men cannot forſake their own thoughts. Ephiphanius ſpeaks of a fig-tree which grew in a wall, &amp;c. Bad thoughts will be alwayes ſeizing on a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> he dies, and then all his thoughts periſh. But ſo long as a man is alive in old Adam, theſe thoughts are rooted in the bottom of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which hinder good duties; aud this is the cauſe why vanity of mind ſprouts up.</p>
                  <p>Examine your ſelves then; for it is one of the beſt wayes for a man to<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> try his eſtate by, even to examine his thoughts. If a man would ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſea be ſalt, he need not drink all the water that is in it; one drop will ſerve his turn. So a man may ſee whether he be a child of God, or of the Devil, even by his thoughts. I will make it appear by theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
                  <p>Firſt becauſe mens thoughts are the free acts of their hearts. Many times you ſpeak not as you would, you do not as you would, but a man thinks alwayes as he will. Favour of great men, and deſire to pleaſe them, makes men do many times what they would not; but thoughts are free. I may ſay ſo, and ſo, but I will think what I liſt: Ergo, if thou wilt judge a man, judge him by that he does freely, and not by that which he does by compulſion. But now thy thoughts are free, they are thine own act; nothing can force thy thoughts but thy ſelf: ergo, in them thy heart ſhews it ſelf whether it be carnal or ſpirituall.</p>
                  <p>When Peter denied his Maſter, could a man have judged him by that, then he might have judged him in Apoſtate: but that was his paſſion; he diſcovered what his fear was, not what his heart was; For if a man might have but looked into Peters heart (though it was a fearfull ſin, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44191:91"/>
without Gods mercy might have damned him) Yet there you might have heard him ſay, Oh it is my Maſter! Oh that I had never come hither! It is my Master and Saviour, I have none but he. It was for fear of his life, that he denied him: For, Prov. 23. 7. As a man thinketh in his heart, ſo is he. A covetous Uſurer may make a rich feaſt, and ſay with his tongue, Sir, you are welcome; he muſt give good words, the ſhame of the world and ſpeech of people will make him do it; yet his thoughts it may be are not towards thee. So try thy ſelfe, how go thy thoughts, at home or abroad? Are thy thoughts on heaven or heavenly things, or are they below? Sure I am if a mans thoughts were on heavenly things, then his heart would be there alſo; for as a man thinks, ſo is he, Prov. 23. 7.</p>
                  <p>2. As they are the freeſt acts, ſo they are the immediate acts of the heart. Can a man judge of the fountain by the water that runs ſeven miles off, as well as by that which runs immediately from it? The water ſeven miles off, may have tincture from the ſoyle, and ſo it may be bad there, though good at the fountains head; ergo, judge of the fountain by the water which comes immediately from it. Now, thoughts come immediately from the heart, nothing is between them and the heart, and out of the heart (ſaith our Saviour) proceed evill thoughts, &amp;c. Mark 7. 21. Other ſinnes come from the heart too, but it is at the ſecond, third, or fourth hand; abundance of circumſtances come between them and the act; as in the act of murder, it may be, there were baſe words offered, yea and blows too, &amp;c. but thoughts come immediately from the heart: Ergo, if thy thoughts be proud, carnall, &amp;c. ſo act thou; if thy thoughts carry thee away in the cares of this life, ſo is thy heart, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. Thoughts, they are the continued acts of the heart, a man is alwayes doing them. Can a man judge of an Uſurer, and ſay he is liberall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he makes one great feaſt unto his neighbours? No; but he may ſay it is a Uſurers feast, a great feaſt.</p>
                  <p>By what a man doth alwayes, by that judge him; Thou art not alwayes praying &amp;c. or in good company; but thou art alwayes thinking good or evill thoughts, thy thoughts are continued acts of thy heart. Can a man judg a horſe for ſtumbling once in a long journey? At ſuch a place he went well and at ſuch a time, and alwayes; yet perhaps once in a year he may ſtumble: Can you, or will you judge him by that? No, rather judge him by that which hee is alwayes doing. Thou art alwayes thinking; now that is thy God which thou art alwayes think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on: If on riches, then that is thy god; or whatſoever it be, then that is thy god.</p>
                  <p>Examine then thy heart by thy thoughts; for out of the abundance of thy heart thy mouth ſpeaketh: yea, for one word, there is abundance of thoughts, for one good duty, there is abundance of thoughts; ergo, if thou wilt examine thy heart, examine thy thoughts.</p>
                  <p>4. Thoughts are the Univocall acts of the heart, ſuch as wherein the heart ſhews its own nature. As for example, the Univocal act of Light is to lighten the room, but now you cannot judge of the Light by the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44191:92"/>
heat, ſo well as you may by the ſhining. So an ill ſavour muſt be judged of by the ſtinking, which is the univocal act of it: It cauſeth abundance of other effects, but this is the proper act whereby it ſhews it ſelf. So the thoughts of men are the univocal acts of their hearts; therefore in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called the way of the heart: juſt as the heart is, ſo are the thoughts: if the heart be proud, ſo are the thoughts: juſt according to the nature of the heart, ſo are the thoughts.</p>
                  <p>5. They are the ſwifteſt acts of the heart. If I judge of a Scholar, I will judge him by that which he doth extempore: if a fool ſtudy, he may ſpeak to purpoſe; but look what a man doth by his own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a man diſcovers himſelf to be. Thoughts are the extempore acts of the heart; if thy heart be heavenly, it will ſcatter out heavenly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; if carnal, then thy thoughts are carnall: thoughts are as the viſions in the night, ergo we uſe this proverb, his thoughts are gone a ſutering. If then they be the ſwifteſt acts of mens hearts, then are they moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it to expreſſe the nature of the heart.</p>
                  <p>6. Thoughts are the peculiar acts of the heart, peculiar to God only: the world may ſee what thy outward life is, but thy thoughts God only ſees; neither Angel, Devil, nor Man can ſee them: and as they are peculiar to Gods eye, ſo he moſt regards what mens thoughts are; and therefore the beſt way for a man to judge himſelf, is, to judge himſelf that way which God doth, even by his thoughts. The The Lord knows the thoughts of man, Pſal. 94. 11. Examine your ſelves in this then, concerning your thoughts, whether they be metamorphoſed, or no: a man may ſay, he hath good thoughts of God; but let him examine himſelf whether it be ſo or no.</p>
                  <p>7. Thoughts are the conſcionable acts of the heart; they are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt accuſers, or excuſers of the heart: they are Conſciences Noſe, as we may ſo ſpeak: True it is, the words of the tongue, and the actions of the hands, are all in the light and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight of the conſcience; but the neerer a thing is unto the conſcience, the more able it is to judge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And therefore St. Paul puts the accuſing, or excuſing, eſpecially on the thoughts, Rom. 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>We grant, a wicked man may have good thoughts, but they are thoughts deſcending, not aſcending; they are caſt into the heart by God, not raiſed out of the hear. Moſes thought in his heart to viſit his brethren, Acts 7. verſe 23. Good thoughts grow out of the heart of the godly, they come from the bottom of it: a wicked man may have good thoughts caſt into his minde, but he will fling them out again.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we grant wicked men may have good thoughts; but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether they cloſe with the heart or no; all the proper thoughts of a man, are the poſſeſſions of the heart, Job 17. 11. They take hold of the heart, and they are at home in the heart. Here then examine thy heart, whether the thoughts of God cloſe with thy heart: Doth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance cloſe with thy heart? doſt thou think of death, and do the thoughts thereof make thee die daily? Or doſt thou think of death, and doſt thou not love to be holden with that thought? Doſt thou think of hel, and wilt thou not be holden with that thought of hell, but thy thoughts are on thy pleaſures? So then, if thy thoughts cloſe not with thy heart, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:44191:92"/>Thirdly, there may be good thoughts in thy heart, but tis queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable whether good thoughts, or no; if they come out of due ſeaſon, it is nothing to the purpoſe: If a Printer print never ſo well, and make never ſo good letter; yet if he place one word where another ſhould ſtand, he marrs all: So, good thoughts, if they be ſeaſonable, and in their proper place, they are the effects of the Spirit; but if out of ſeaſon they may be the thoughts of reprobates: As if thou be at at Prayer, and then to be thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Sermon, is nothing to the purpoſe. They muſt be ſeaſonable, and bring forth fruit in due ſeaſon, Pſal. 1. 3. When thou art at prayer, thou muſt have thy thoughts ſuteable to thy prayer; for if thy thoughts be never ſo good, yet if they be not ſeaſonable and ſutable to the action thou haſt in hand, they are not actions of grace; grace cannot away with them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, thou haſt good thoughts in thy heart, but the queſtion is whether they be counſelled thoughts, ſuch as thou haſt determined to think on. Thoughts are called the counſels of a mans heart, 1 Cor. 4. 5. it may be thou maieſt ſtumble on a good thought now and then, it may be when thou art ſwearing, thou w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lt ſay, God forgive me: when thou haſt been drinking all the day, it may be a good thought ſteps in and cries God mercy, but thou goeſt not to ſchoole to learn the art of meditation, or the ſcience of holy thinking, or to ſay with David, O God my heart is fixed.</p>
                  <p>Now, if that ſin in thought be ſo great a ſin, this ſhould teach us what a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſin it is to ſin indeed; therefore thoughts are the ſmalleſt ſins, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſcandal, and the Pſalmiſt makes it an argument of Gods quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted power to ſee thoughts, thou ſeeſt my thoughts afar off, you will ſay that man is quick-ſighted that can ſee a pins head a 100 myles off: even ſo God ſees thoughts; if a pins point can ſtab a man, then a ſword can much more. Now if thoughts be ſo haynous and capitall a ſin, how fearfull a ſin is it to commit ſinne in deed? for thee to ſwear, to lye, to commit adultery, to keep wicked company, to mock at Gods people, to live in coveteouſneſſe, &amp;c. this is to commit in deed; if ſmall ſins be ſo damnable, what then are the greateſt? If the chockatrice in the egge be ſuch poyſon, what will it be when it is hatcht? thought ſins are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect compared with words or acts following them: yet are they perfect in their kinds.</p>
                  <p>Tis a wicked diſtinction to ſay that some ſins are Contra legem or Praeter legem; for all ſins are againſt the Law, as St. James ſaith, when luſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it bringeth forth ſin, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in when it is finiſhed it bringeth forth death: thou that art a drunkard, thy ſin is finiſhed: thou art a true ſinner in deed, if thou liveſt in the execution of any ſin.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſins in thought are ſimple ſins: but ſins in deed are compounded, if after thoughts follow ſutable act; but when it is in deed, it may be the cauſe of a 1000 ſins: for a man to think too much of his bellie is a ſin: but for a man to be drunken, this is abundance of ſins: for it is an abuſe of Gods creatures, a ſpending of his ſubſtance, a weakning of his parts, a ſcandall to others, &amp;c. Sin in deed is a ſin with an addition: ſin in deed is an impudent ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſee Iſaiah 65. 2, 3. &amp;c. that man is impudent with a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44191:93"/>
witneſſe that will commit ſinne in deed, for he is neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of Gods nor mans preſence; if any man be a deſperate ſinner, this is he.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>But it may be objected, how then can thoughts be ſaid to be ſuch ſins, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſins of the higheſt part of a man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note>I anſwer, a Thiefe or Rogue hath burnt a mans dwelling houſe, yet he may proceed further and burn his ſtable too; a 1000 pound and a ſhilling are more then a 1000 pound; Sins in thought are included within ſins in deed. The ſouls part of ſinne is the greateſt part of ſinne; Now thoughts are the ſouls part of ſin; yet ſins in deed muſt needs be worſe in regard of the progreſſe of ſinne, and alſo becauſe thoughts are included in them; thoughts and deeds, are more then thoughts alone.</p>
                  <p>I exhort and deſire you therefore to conſider;</p>
                  <p>Firſt what great reaſon you have to ſet your thoughts on God. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe merited this dutie at your hands, God hath taken a number of thoughts for us. Innumerable are thy thoughts O God to us ward. Pſ. 40. 5. the Lord thinks on us from the Cradle to the Croſſe; If the Lord ſhould have intermitted his thought of thee, thou couldſt not ſubſiſt; when thou waſt up, the Lord thought how to feed thee; when thou waſt in bed, he thought how to preſerve thee; he doth not uſe to think of thee at one time and not at another, but he thinks on thee when thou art ſick, and when thou art in health, aſleep or awake; the Devill elſe would ſeize on thee. I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinks on me, ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, Pſal. 40. 17. And Nehemiah ſaith, O Lord think on me; ſhall we call to God to think on us? then ſurely it is our duty to think on him, yea and he may call to us for that duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider with your ſelves what thoughts they are which God calls for; my ſon, ſaith he, give me thy heart. Prov. 23. 26. He would faine have thy heart, he lets thee labour with thy hands for thy living, and he lets thee have thy feet to walk, and the reſt of thy members for thy ſeverall uſes, but the Lord requires thy heart, and therefore give him the thoughts of thy heart; for if thy neighbour come to thee for fire, thou canſt not give him fire, if thou take away the heat thereof; ſo give the Lord thy heart, and the thoughts of it will follow.</p>
                  <p>The Devill calls for thy heart alſo; ergo, reaſon as Joſeph did when he was tempted, how can I doe this and ſinne againſt my God? my Maſter hath delivered into my hands all that he hath, thee only excepted, and ſhall I take thee? how can I doe this? So the Lord hath with-holden nothing from thee, but thy heart; my ſonne (ſaith he) give me thy heart, yet wilt thou deny it him with the thoughts thereof?</p>
                  <p>Tell me you that are rich, would it be any diſparagement unto you to be Gods ſervants, to ſet your thoughts on God? True, it is the greater ill men of this world thinke it ſome diſparagement to think on theſe things. But I tell thee, thou that art a Gentleman, if thou have grace, it makes thee more than a Gentleman; grace takes not away mens honor and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but if he be a Knight, it makes him more than a Knight; And as Paul ſaid to Philemon, receive him now a ſervant and more than a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; he was a ſervant when he was carnall, but now being a Chriſtian
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44191:93"/>
he is more than a ſervant; if you have grace, it is an addition to your riches; riches and more than riches; ergo, give your hearts to God, and it will be the better for you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lord hath made thy thoughts thy Jewels, thy thoughts are precious, the Lord keepeth them under lock and key, he will not let any ſee them; if all men ſhould obſerve a man, and look into him, yet they cannot ſee his thoughts; no; God hath lockt them up and made them thy Jewels; wilt thou then caſt them into the myre? wilt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre Haukes and Hounds in thy thoughts before God? canſt thou ſit at dinner, and not once think of God, but alwayes on baſe pelfe? why, thy thoughts are thy Jewels.</p>
                  <p>Again, A man that is wiſe, will be wary what companions he keeps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your thoughts are your only companions; you never go out nor in, but your thoughts go along with you: and for this cauſe Solomon would have us place the word of God in our thoughts, Prov. 6. 22. See Pſal. 139. 15. 16. when I am awake, I am preſent with thee.</p>
                  <p>Men will be carefull what meat they eat, becauſe ſuch meat as they eate ſuch is their blood; and as their blood is, ſo is their body; now as the body feeds on meat, ſo doth the ſoul on thoughts; if we look not to our thoughts, they will be ſubject to abundance of corruptions; a man muſt give an account of every idle word he ſpeaks, and thoughts are the intrinſecal words of the heart: now if men muſt give an account of every idle word, then of every idle thought alſo.</p>
                  <p>Let this then teach all and every one of us in the fear of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our thoughts, elſe our end will be deſtruction.</p>

                     <q>And he ſaid unto them all, If any man will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe daily and follow me.</q>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Text contains the firſt action performed of every Chriſtian, viz. to deny himſelf; concerning which you may here ſee,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the grounds of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the reaſons of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the occaſion of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the parts of it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, the neceſſity of it.</p>
                  <p>I intend to handle theſe words as they are in relation to the context.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the grounds of this truth, viz. that every man must deny himſelf. And it is here expreſſed to be twofold, viz. the contrariety that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and a mans ſelf, me, and himſelf, theſe two terms are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory one to the other; if any man will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; theſe two cannot ſtand together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the contrariety that is between ſelf and ſelf; if a man be in Chriſt he hath two ſelves; he hath a ſelf in himſelf; and a ſelf out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44191:95"/>
the ſelf in himſelf is old Adam; the other in Chriſt, which is the new man; there is the ſelf-denying and ſelf-denyed; if a man will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he muſt loſe himſelf. Paul muſt not be found in Paul, having his own righteouſneſſe, but he muſt find himſelf in Chriſt; for ſalvation belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth unto the Lord, Pſal. 3. 8. And ergo, let him deny himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you may ſee the reaſon of it; wich is threefold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Christs own example, verſe 22. the ſon of man muſt ſuffer, muſt be rejected. Chriſt himſelf denies himſelf, he might have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf, he might have demanded credit, honour, or riches, &amp;c. he might have done thus; yet though he had no wicked ſelf, but good ſelf, yet he denyed himſelf; and therefore if we will goe after Chriſt, we muſt do ſo too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is Chriſts merit, he hath merited this duty; Chriſt did not humble himſelf for himſelf, but he did it for us, and therefore we may well deny our ſelves for him. This is included in this word And. And if I have done this for you, I would have you do the like for me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here is Chriſts command too; Let him deny himſelf; Chriſt enjoynes this to all that will come after him, Let him deny himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now follows the occaſion, and that is threefold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Peters offence; when Chriſt had told Peter and the reſt of his Apoſtles how that he muſt ſuffer; Peter was offended, ſaying, Maſter, favour thy ſelf; even like a ſervant that out of love to himſelf would be loth his Maſter ſhould be troubled, becauſe then he thinks himſelf ſhall be troubled alſo; oh ſaith Chriſt, art thou offended at this? I tell thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou nor any other can come after me unleſſe you deny your ſelves. If any man will come after me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as Peter was offended, ſo alſo were the reſt of the Apoſtles. They were very ſorrie, Matth. 17. 22. they thought to have gotten cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the world, and riches and worldly preferment, and it grieved them to hear that they muſt have a ſuffering kind of trade of it; ergo, Chriſt ſaid not only to Peter, but to them all, If any man &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, like as his Apoſtles, ſo likewiſe he did foreſee that all the world will be offended at this; for man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> would faine have Chriſt and their ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will too; but Chriſt gives a watch-word before-hand, If any manwill, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The parts of it. The whole duty is this, Let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Chryſoſtome on the text ſaith, not onely deny himſelf, but in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deny away himſelf; nor onely deny credit, &amp;c. but abhorre it; if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had but with the loſſe of Chriſt, we muſt not only barely deny ſelf-reſpects, but abhorre them, and trample them under our feet.</p>
                  <p>The parts of this duty are two;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let him take up his croſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let him deny himſelf and follow me.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is oppoſed to ſelf-favouring, the ſecond to ſelf-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let him take up his crosse, let him not favour himſelf, he muſt be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44191:95"/>
content to part with ſelfe-means and maintenance, and ſelfe-ends too; he muſt be content to part with all theſe; he that will come after me, muſt loſe many good friends, and many a good bit and ſweet morſell to the fleſh: he that will come after me, muſt not ſtand upon theſe termes: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a croſſe of diſgrace come, take it up and wear it as thy crowne, nay thou muſt be willing to take a croſſe before it is offered, and when thou haſt it, thou muſt be willing to bear it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he muſt follow me too, ones ſelfe will do as ones ſelfe would have him; that is true; but you muſt follow me, not your ſelfe; look to me, and frame your ſelves to walk in my ſteps, take up my crosse, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, here is the neceſſity of it. It is abſolute true, a man may go to hell if he be ſo minded, he may follow himſelf to hell; but if a man tender his ſalvation, then here is an hypotheticall neceſſity, a neceſſity with an if.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if he mean to come after me, he muſt take up his croſſe and deny himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if a man would ſave his life, he muſt loſe it: if he will loſe it, he ſhall ſave it. If a man will keep his old relation, he may; but if he will find credit and life in heaven, he muſt deny all ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; if a man will gain himſelfe, let him deny himſelfe. But what ſay ſome, how ſhall we live then? how then ſhall I hold up my head? Theſe men would faine have the gaine of the world, but what is a man profited, if he win the world and loſe his ſoule? &amp;c. verſe 25. If you ſtand upon theſe termes, if you can baulke a commandement for ſelfe-reſpects, you may loſe your ſoules, but if you will ſave your ſouls, thus you muſt doe. Again the text ſaith, if a man be aſhamed of me and of my word, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed; ergo, if ever you look that the Son of man ſhould not be aſhamed of you, deny your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Expoſition.</p>
                  <p>Deny himſelfe; there is the difficulty. A man cannot deny himſelfe, 2. Tim. 2. 13. ſo affirmare &amp; negare are contradictions; ergo, ſomewhat muſt be meant by ones ſelfe: yet by ones ſelf is not meant the Devill, as Macarius would have it; for ſince man hath ſinued, ſaith he, the Devill is got into him, and is as neer unto him as himſelf, he is another ſelfe within his own ſelf, another heart within his own heart: ergo, if he will come after Chriſt, he muſt forſake the Devil; though this be true, yet, this is not the meaning of the text.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, a mans corrupt will, wit, reaſon and all a mans corrupt ſelfe muſt be put off. Put off concerning the former converſation the old man, &amp;c. Epheſ. 4. 22. which is a mans ſelf. Viz. thou muſt lay aſide the man that thou art, thou muſt not be the ſame man, if thou wilt follow Chriſt, thou muſt be a new ſelfe in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. Here is not onely meant a mans corrupt will, wit, reaſon, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but alſo all mens luſts and corruptions, all ſinnes that cleave ſo cloſe as if they were himſelfe, as fornication, uncleanneſſe, evill concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,

&amp;c. mortify therefore your earthly members, Coloſ. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. The Apoſtle accounts a mans luſts as cloſe to him as his members; for untill a man be brought home to Chriſt, he and his ſins are all one, he muſt deny himſelf, viz, all his luſts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By ſelfe is not onely meant a mans corrupt ſelfe as ſinne and iniquity: but alſo a mans good ſelfe in ſome reſpects; not only ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Father, Mother, Children, Friends, &amp;c. yea, life it ſelfe, all, if they be hinderances to him from Chriſt, ſo farre he muſt deny all theſe nay grace it ſelf; for a man may make a God of grace, or of prayer, &amp;c. a man I ſay muſt deny all theſe, ſo farre as they are ſtumblings and offences in his way to hinder him from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But oh ſayes one, my father will diſinherit me, I muſt humour him, he cannot endure a Puritan; If I muſt live as you would have me, I ſhall never have foot of his land; ſo the ſervant ſayes, I have a prophane ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and he will turne me out of doors, if I be ſo preciſe; yea, but what ſayes Chriſt? If you will come after me, you muſt deny Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and all; better it were that thy Father diſinherit thee, then that Chriſt ſhould reject thee; therefore you muſt deny all and take up his croſſe, and make it thine own.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I come to the words, Let him deny himſelfe. It is neceſſary to ſhew what ſelf-ſeeking is, before you underſtand what ſelfe deniall is.</p>
                  <p>By ſelfe-ſeeking, I mean a man that hath a head-luſt whereby he is ſelfe conceited of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>There are five things in ſelfe-ſeeking.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, ſelfe is a head-luſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, its a luſt of ſelfe-conceit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of ſelfe-will.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly of ſelfe-wit.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, of ſelfe-confidence.</p>
                  <p>1. Selfe is a head-luſt, it is the main luſt that keeps'men from coming unto Chriſt; all ſeek their own, not that which is Jeſus Chriſts, Philip. 2. 21. What is the reaſon? Why, becauſe they ſeek ſelf, they follow their own thoughts; and becauſe they are ruled by their own ſelves, therefore they are not ruled by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>That it is a head-luſt, I prove it by five arguments.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe it is the leading luſt to all lusts; no luſt in the world but ſelfe leads the dance; why is man proud, but becauſe ſelfe would get cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? Why is a man covetous, but becauſe ſelfe would have means and maintenaince? Why is a man revengefull, but becauſe ſelfe will not put up wrongs? Chriſt bids us of all luſts to take heed of ſelfe, Luke 21. 34. Chriſt knowing what a deceitfull thing ſelfe is, he bids us have a care of ſelfe-beguiling; Take heed to your ſelves (ſaith he) for if you do not, ſelfe will bring you into many noyſome luſts, as ſurfetting, and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life, &amp;c, and ſo that day will come upon us una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:44191:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. Self is the cauſe of all other luſts of the heart; it is the plotter and the ruler of all, it is the maſter of Arts; it was ſelf that found out all luſts. Self found out pride, ſecurity and coverouſneſſe, and all other noyſome luſts; ſelf is loth to take the paines that God would have it, and therefore ſelf ſets his wits on the tainters, and hence it is that Solomon ſaith, God made made man upright, but he (viz. ſelf) hath found many inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Eccleſ. 7. 21. Man was upright, and God was the cauſe. He became wicked, how? why, ſelf found out many inventions. Self is the inventer of all, and when ſelf cannot get meanes enough by that way which God hath allowed, then ſelf ſeeks out for credit, wealth, pleaſure, &amp;c. then it deviſes wayes of it ſelfe to get reputation, ſo that ſelfe is the cauſe of luſt.</p>
                  <p>3. Selfe is an inluſt, it runs along through all the luſts of the fleſh, there is in every luſt of the fleſh an ounce of ſelfe. There would be no ſecurity in man but that ſelfe would faine live at eaſe. So that as David ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woman of Tekoah, Hath not Joab a hand in all this? ſo may I ſay, hath not ſelf a hand in all this? Aquinas ſaith it is called ſelf out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate love that a man bears to himſelf, and to thoſe things which ſeem good to a mans ſelfe: A man hath not onely luſt to pride, pleaſure, &amp;c. but a man looks alſo to things for ſelf, either for ſome profit for ſelf, or credit for ſelf; ſelf is alwayes an inluſt. See it in the wicked Steward, Luke 16. he ſaid within himſelf, &amp;c. he was to be turned out of his ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip. Now, what did he? he ſaid to himſelf, or within himſelf; what ſaid he? why, he ſaid to begge he was aſhamed, and dig he could not; ſelf was too lazie to work, and to proud to beg, and ſo he brought his maſters two hundred pounds to fifty; and what was his reaſon for it? why, ſaith he, that they may receive me into their houſes, verſe 2. &amp;c. and it is ſaid, the Lord commended the unjust Steward, not as if he had commended the ſin, but as if he ſhould ſay, I commend his wit.</p>
                  <p>4. It is a make-luſt; a man would never break out into luſt if it were not for ſelf. Doeg had a luſt of confidence in his riches, Pſal. 52. 7. and this made Eſau comfort himſelf againſt Jacob; he had a murthering luſt to comfort himſelf, Gen. 27. 42. The Jewes had a luſt of formality to pray, to hear, to bring offerings, to obſerve all the new Moons, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, yet they had no delight in theſe things; no, their mind was on their imaginations, they loathed the word of God; why then would they not do this? why ſelf was the cauſe, and they thought thereby to ſtay themſelves upon God, Iſaiah, 48. 2. And for this cauſe many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us come to Church; this is a damnable luſt.</p>
                  <p>Haman would not have vaunted of being invited to the Queens ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, but that the Queene invited none but himſelf with the King; he would not have been ſo willing to anſwer to Ahaſhuerus's queſtion, but for himſelf; whom doth the King delight to honour more then my ſelf, thought he? ſelf makes a man covetous, injurious, and full of wrongs, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>5. As it is a make-luſt, ſo it is a requeſting lust; Other luſts are with ſome men out of date; many reprobates cannot abide drunkenneſſe, nor pride, nor uſury; theſe ſins are out of date; why, doth a man love a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44191:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
niggard? why, becauſe ſelf is not the better for him; he cannot get ſo much as a dinner by him; many other ſins may be out of date alſo with men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſelf is never out of date, it is alwayes in requeſt, and ſo long as men do well unto themſelves, they ſhall be praiſed, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Pſal. 49, 18. he hath none to make much of himſelf but himſelf. Every man for himſelf and God for us all, ſaith ſelf. But ſometimes ſelf is out of love; but how? why he will do no good but unto himſelf; this men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide; this they ſay is ſelf out of his wits; but ſelf with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh is alwayes in requeſt, viz. when men will be kind to others, that they may be kind to them again; this ſelf the world loves alife.</p>
                  <p>2. Now I come to the ſecond, which is ſelf-conceit; ſelf-ſeeking ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſelf-conceitedneſſe. There is a bird called S. a fair bird, in French it is called the Devils bird, it is a black bird, and yet it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited with it ſelf that it is fair. By<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> S. I meane firſt the conceit a man hath of himſelf. What, ſhall I (ſaith ſelf) be diſgraced by one that goes to plough and to cart, and ſhall I put it up? No, I am a Gentleman, &amp;c. Another ſaith, I am ſuch and ſuch a Scholar, and ſhall I be contented with ſuch a poor living? theſe men will bear no reproof, they will none of my counſel, Prov. 1. 30. and therefore they ſhal eat of the fruit of their own way, &amp;c. verſe 31.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when a man is conceited of himſelf, and of his own gifts, as commonly women are of their beauty, and ſcholars of their learning. A handſome man, and I warrant you he knowes it; diligent at Church, and he knowes it is ſo, &amp;c. and he thinks his caſe the better; nay, you ſhall have men ſo conceited of their parts, as that they will be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their wicked parts, as Simon Magus was of his Sorcerie, Acts 8. 9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when a man is ſelf-conceited of his actions; he doth as Siſera's mothers Ladies did, when they had given their verdict of Siſera's ſtaying; they were preſently conceited, oh what a wittie anſwer they made her! ſee Judges 5. 29. 30. as if they ſhould ſay, we have anſwered very wiſely; ſo a man cannot make a Sermon, but preſently he is conceited, oh what a learned Sermon it was! he cannot break a jeſt, but ſtraight he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, oh what a wittie one it was! nay of wicked actions; you ſhall hear many an old man tell what prettie pranks (as he calls them) he played in his youth, and he tells it laughingly, which is a ſign that he is ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited, or elſe ſurely he would ſpeak it with ſhame and grief of heart.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, ſelf-conceit is when a man is ſelf-conceited of the eſtate he is in. Many a man though he be the child of hell, yet he is conceited that he is the child of God; who with the wretch in the Goſpel have conceits that they love God and Chriſt, and therefore with him they will come to the Sacraments; but Chriſt will ſay to ſuch as he did to him, friends how came you in hither? can you conceit your ſelves to be friends? get you gon into utter darkneſſe (i.e) into hell, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:44191:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now if you would know what ſelf-conceit is, you muſt remember that it containes four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, where there is ſelf conceit, there is no real worth at all; he that is ſelf-conceited is a baſe man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take that for a rule. A ſelf-conceited fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is a baſe fellow, as we uſe to ſay; there is no real worth at all in a conceited man; all the worth that he hath, is either reall as he thinks, or conceitable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now what reall worth can ſelf have? You know what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, tis only in imaginations of their hearts. Luke 1. 43. They it may be do imagine that they are Gentlemen, or that they have faith, and yet God ſcatters theſe men in their imaginations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as he hath no reall worth in himſelf, ſo he will not ſtand to the judgement of thoſe that can judge him. God can tell the worth of every thing, but they will not be judged by him; Gods Miniſters out of Gods word can tell him, that he hath no reaſon to think his caſe good; but he will not ſtand to the judgement of Gods Miniſters. If a Miniſter ſhould come to a man and ſay unto him, Sir, you are conceited that you are a good Chriſtian, I pray what ſignes have you for it? you pray, ſo do Reprobates; you hear the word and receive the Sacraments, ſo do Reprobates; hast thou no better ſignes than theſe? no better arguments than theſe? Why, I tell thee that a Reprobate hath theſe, and more than theſe too. A ſelf-conceited man will be judged by none but by himſelf; A ſluggard is wiſer in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit then ſeven men who can give a reaſon, Prov. 26. 19. The ſluggard is loth to take more pains; why, he thinks he takes pains enough, and ſo he is conceited, and more he will not do; let ſeven men come and tell him that he muſt take more pains; yet he will not, and that becauſe he is conceited that he doth enough. Even ſo it is with the ſluggiſh Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, he is wiſe in his own conceit; for let ſeven Miniſters come and tell him that he muſt take more paines for heaven, or elſe he will never come there; yet he will not beleeve them, he is wiſer then ſo, they are fooles, as he thinks, though he have no reaſon ſo to think; he indeed is not as he ſhould be, and Gods Miniſters can bring reaſons out of the Scriptures to prove it; for wiſdom is profitable to direct, Eccleſ. 10. 10. But every conceited man is a blinde man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A ſelf-conceited man as he will not ſtand to the judgment of thoſe that can judge him, ſo he hath too high a conceit of himſelf; be he never ſo little godly, he is preſently conceited he is a child of God; ſo if a man have never ſo little humility or patience, if he come to Church, pray or doe but a few good duties in religion, he thinks preſently it is as a high wall unto him, and he ſhall go to heaven cock-ſure; and let other men be never ſo holy, ſtrict, religious, and pious in their wayes, yet they are apt to think them Reprobates. If he ſee never ſo little ſlips among them, he is preſently ready to ſay they are all naught; if any be falſe among them, he is ready to ſay they are all hell-hounds; but if himſelf be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited that he have never ſo little faith, oh preſently he thinks that is a high wall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, he reſteth in the judgement of himſelf; and this is the caſe of thouſands in the world; they think well of their own caſes, when they dye they ſhall go to heaven, there is no queſtion but Chriſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44191:98"/>
will ſave them, and from this conceit they will never be put; let all the Miniſters in the world come one after another, and diſcover unto a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man his eſtate, yet he wil not come from his own cenſure; for though you bray a foole in a morter among wheat with a peſtle, yet will not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him, Prov. 27. 22. So, if you ſhould bray theſe men with the threatnings of the law, with the plagues contained in the Bible, making their conſciences black and blew (as we uſe to ſpeak) yet they will not leave off their conceitedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reaſons hereof are four;</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe all ſinners are fooles; and the fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in Gods ſight, Pſal. 5. 5. All that work iniquity are fooles; a ſelf-conceited fool is a proverb; and our Saviour who knew the combination of all ſinnes, joynes pride and fooliſhneſſe together, Mark 7. 22. a proud conceited man and a fool are put together by our Saviour. And this is the cauſe why ſo many thouſands in the world are conceited of themſelves, that their caſe is good, when tis nothing ſo, even becauſe they are fools; none but fools will look more after pelf, than jewels, and preferr tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things before heavenly; yet ſuch are the wiſe men of this world. That man is a fool that cannot eat his meat; and ſuch is every ſinner; his ſoul hath no food but Chriſt, the word, and his promiſes; yet he knows not how to feed on them; he hath no cover to hide his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but Chriſt, &amp;c. yet he knows not how to put on Chriſt; therefore he is a fool.</p>
                  <p>Secondly men are born fools; of all fools none ſo ſelf-conceited as the born-fool; one that hath been a wiſe man, knows how to hold his peace, but a born fool is invincible; vain man would be wiſe, though he be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rne like a wild Aſſes colt, Job 11. 12. Of all creatures the foal of the Aſſe is the ſimpleſt; needs then muſt the wild Aſſes colt be moſt ſimple. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man be born a fool, yet he would be counted wiſe; he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited that all the Miniſters in the world cannot direct him; no, he is wiſe enough for that matter; this folly is bred and borne in him, he hath it by kind, and that is the reaſon that it is hardly clawed off, but they are ready to ſay, they are as wiſe as the Miniſters themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I call not into queſtion the wits of many; I know many of you are underſtanding men and women; but I ſpeak now of the Wiſdom of the Spirit, and how you may underſtand to ſave your ſouls. What is it for a man to be worldly-wiſe, to get riches and honour, and to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe like a Gentleman, and yet a fool in ſeeking his ſalvation? this is to be penny-wiſe; but here is the queſtion, are you not pound-foolish? can you go on in your ſinnes, ſwearing, &amp;c? then ſurely you are pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooliſh; all your wiſdom and mony avails nothing; alas you are butpenny Gentlemen. The Sodomites, Gen. 19. were blind, they could not find the door, they could ſee well enough elſe, they were only blind in this; ſo man is ſtultus ad hoc, wiſe enough for any thing in the world but this; take him for huſbandrie, and his knowledge is good; for matter of carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, he can behave himſelfe as well as the wiſeſt; he is only ſtultus ad hoc, for ſalvation he is a fool, a born fool, and ſelfe-conceited.</p>
                  <p>3. Men are ſelfe-conceited of their own eſtate; thoſe that praiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44191:98"/>
we uſe to ſay have ill neighbours; ſo if a fool had a good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to tell him of his folly, and to laugh at him for it, he would not praiſe himſelfe; ſo he that praiſeth himſelfe, it is certain he hath ill neighbours: ſo the reaſon why men are well-conceited of themſelves, is becauſe they have ill neighbours, they think they are honeſt, and ſo do their neighbours, but now if a drunkard could go no where but that everie one would tell him that he were a hel-hound, he would not be drunk, but an ill neighbour he tells him he need not fear, by the grace of he ſhall do well enough, he is a good Chriſtian, and hence it is that when fools are not anſwered according to their folly, that they are conceited of themſelves; when men are ſoothed up, others think well of them, and they alſo think their own caſes good; for ſay they, if I were no at good Chriſtian, ſuch and ſuch would not be acquainted with me.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Lord delivers many up to the ſpirit of ſlumber, Rom. 11. 8. Black poppy ſeed will caſt a man into ſuch a ſleep as that his eyes ſhall be broad open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet he not ſee; ſo the Lord hath caſt men into a ſlumber like a man between ſleeping and waking; of all ſleep none like to ſlumber, becauſe it is full of imaginations; never is a man ſo full of dreams as then when he is in a ſlumber. If a man were a drunkard and in the deep of all evil, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uld in the deep ſea of ſecurity, he could not be ſo well-conceited; but now that his eyes are halfe open, halfe ſhut, halfe awake, halfe aſleep, halfe out, halfe in, he thinks his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is good, his caſe good, and he hopes he ſhall find mercie at the hands of God, as well as the beſt Puritan in the puriſh; they are like the dreamer (as Joſephs brethren termed him) ſingular, in Hebrew the Maſter dreamer; they dream they ſhall have mercie, and they ſhal not be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e men are in a ſlumber they have eyes and ſee not &amp;c. Iſa. 28, they ſee the judgement of God, but perceive it not.</p>
                  <p>Conſider what a wofull caſe theſe men are in, and how the Scripture calls this ſelfe conceit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it calls it nothing but a thinking; if a man think himſelfe to be ſomething, he is nothing. Gal. 6. 3. to think thy ſelf a Chriſtian, is a vain thought.</p>
                  <p>2. The Scripture calls it ſuppoſition: what a vain thing it is for a man to be a ſuppoſing? they ſuppoſe they ſhall go to heaven, they ſuppoſe they are better then others, better then thoſe on whom the Tower of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loam fell; and ſo many ſuppoſe they are not in the gall of bitterneſs nor in the bond of iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it calls them ſhaddowes; they walk in a vain ſhew, Pſal. 39. 6. viz. their repentance ſhews as if it were good repentance. They can ſpeak lowly, there is a ſhew that they are humble. Man walks in a vain ſhew, like a Tradeſman who hath abundance of things which he makes ſhew of, yet are none of his own: ſo he talks of grace which was never his own.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly it calls them imaginations; Acts 4.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it calls them appearances, Matth. 6. 16. So men appear all at a Sermon, but their hearts neverly down before the Word, there are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſeemings, 1 Cor. 3. Thus you may think your ſelves or ſuppoſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44191:99"/>
your ſelves to be in good caſe, when as it were better thou didſt appear to be a hel-hound then a Chriſtian, and not be ſo indeed; for then there were ſome hope that thou wouldeſt look out. If a man be ſick, yet if he ſeem to be well, none will look out for him, as they would do if he ſeemed to be ſick indeed; and therefore this is the moſt dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſo if men did ſeem to be damned wretches, that they were born and continue in ſin, and when they dye, they muſt be damned, if men feared thus, they would look out.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider ſo long as thou art well conceited of thy ſelf, Chriſt hath no commiſſion lo call thee; and Chriſt wil do nothing but what he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to do, he wil not run into a Praemunire; Chriſt doth proteſt to all the world that he hath no commiſſion from his Father for ſuch; I am not come to call the righteous, &amp;c. Matth. 9. 3. viz thoſe that are righteous in their own eſteem and thoughts, but are not; if a man tell them that they are fitter for hell then for heaven, they are better-conceited of themſelvs then ſo; if a man tell them for all their profeſſion they may be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, yet they concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> better of their profeſſion then ſo; now then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a caſe thou art in, if thou be out of Chriſts road.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as Chriſt hath no commiſſion, ſo he is glad he hath not, and he gives thanks to his Father that he put him not into commiſſion, I thank thee O Father, &amp;c. Luke 10. 21. q. d. thou doſt not convert thoſe that are ſelfe-conceited, thoſe that think they ſhal not be damned, ſuch as conceit that they need no ſummons, that are righteous enough; Father I am glad of it, &amp;c. and it is ſaid there that Jeſus rejoyced, &amp;c. I rather rejoyce that thou haſt ſent me to poor ſouls, ſuch as are the off-ſcouring of the world, &amp;c. but he that is ſelfe-conceited, is wiſer forſooth then ſo; Chriſt tels thee that thou muſt take up his croſſe; but thou thinkeſt that thou haſt more wit, thou canſt go a wiſer way to work; thou haſt an eaſier way to heaven, thou wilt none of the Croſſe; and I tell thee then that Chriſt wil none of thee, but he will be glad to ſee thee damned.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, he is in the broad way to hell that is ſelfe-conceited; there be many wayes to hell; the covetous goes one way, the Drunkard goes another, there are a thouſand wayes to hell; though there be ſundry wayes to hell, yet they all meet in ſelfe-conceit there is the broad high way where all meet; ſelfe-conceit is not only the way to hell but it is the brood way where all wayes meet. There is a way (ſaith the wiſe man) that ſeems right, &amp;c. Prov. 14. 12. but the end of it is death; there is the wages, there all the wayes meet. Oh then examine your ſelves. I ſhould give you ſignes and tokens to make it appeare unto you; but the time will not give me leave. I will only name one or two. That man that ſelfe-ſwears, is conceited of himſelf, that is one ſign; As I am an honeſt man, As God ſhal help me, by my faith and troth, As I look that the Lord ſhould ſave my ſoul, &amp;c. theſe men are highly conceited of themſelvs, they think that their ſalvation is ſure, yea ſo ſure that they may ſwear by it, but theſe are devilliſh and damnable ſelf conceits; it is Gods prerogative only to ſweare by himſelf, Heb. 6. 13. 14. I ſpeak this becauſe I know it is a common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe among men, and a helliſh brand of a curſed ſelf-conceited man.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Saviour CHRIST being demanded by one of his Diſciples, how they ſhould pray; He here teaches them theſe two things. Firſt, a Platform of prayer, in the 2, 3, 4. verſes; Say, Our Father, &amp;c. Secondly, he teaches them the Importunity of Prayer; which he ſets forth by the ſimilitude of a man who having a gueſt come to him at midnight, and had nothing to ſet before him, he went to his friend to intreat him to lend him three loaves, and at the firſt he nakedly intreats, Lend me three loaves: The door is ſhut, ſayes his friend, and I cannot open it now. Secondly, he falls to intreat and to beſeech him to do him this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. He had a gueſt come to him, and he knew not what to do: Why 'tis midnight ſaies he, is there no other time to come but now? Thirdly, he begins to knock, he muſt needs have them, though it be at an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44191:101"/>
hour. Why, I tell you I am in bed. Then he intreats him as a friend. Friend me no friends, ſayes he again. Yet the man would not leave knocking: at laſt with much adoe the man riſes, ſaying, Will you never be anſwered? and he lends him three loaves, becauſe of his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Now, ſaith our Saviour, I ſay unto you, though he would not give him as a friend, yet becauſe of his importunity he will.</p>
                  <p>The ſimilitude is this: Thou art that man, oh Chriſtian ſoul, this gueſt is thy ſelf: Now then, come home to thy ſelf with the Prodigall, who when he was come to himſelf, goes to his father and friend. This friend is Chriſt, that thou art to pray unto; theſe three loaves are grace, mercy, and peace: Theſe thou art to pray for; it may be Chriſt anſwereth thee in thy conſcience, It is midnight, thou commeſt too late, there is no mercy for thee. The ſoul prayes ſtill, Oh Lord awaken and help me: it may be the Lord will anſwer thee by terror in thy ſoul, The door of mercy is ſhut, thou ſhouldeſt have come rather. Yet Lord, open unto me, ſayes the ſoul: Nay ſaith the Lord, all my children have mercy already; now mercy is aſleep, I have converted them already; they came in due ſeaſon, thou commeſt at midnight, there is no mercy for ſuch a hell-hound as thou art. Up Lord, have mercy on me, ſayes the poor ſoul, and look on me, &amp;c. Look me no looks, ſaith the Lord; I came to ſave the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael: there was a time when I would have converted thee, when I called unto thee early and late: But now I am aſleep, and my mercy is aſleep, it hath been awake as long as it could well hold open its eyes; and comeſt thou now? Oh the ſoul cries ſtill, and will never give over: if mercy be to be had at the throne of grace, he will have it. Even as a begger being at a gentlemans door, they bidding him be gone, there is nothing to be had: nay, ſayes the begger, I will not be gone, here is ſomething to be had, and I will have ſomething, or elſe I will die at the door: The gentleman hearing him ſay ſo, thinks it would be a ſhame for him if he ſhould die at his door; and gives him ſomewhat: So when the ſoul is thus importunate, becauſe of importunity it ſhall be granted. Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſay unto you, if you thus ask, it ſhall be given unto you.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words contain in them the main duty of importunate prayer. Aſk; if asking wil not ſerve turn, ſeek; if ſeeking will not ſerve turn, then knock: try all meanes.</p>
                  <p>Another parable our Saviour put forth, Luke 18. 1, 2. that men ought alwayes to pray, and not to faint. There was a poor woman wronged by her adverſary, and there was no Judge to right her but a wicked one, ſo that ſhe had but poor hopes; yet ſhe reſolves to go, or elſe ſhe ſhall be undone; therefore if ſhe periſh, ſhe will periſh at his feet. He cals her all to naught. Oh; for Gods ſake help me, ſayes ſhe. I care not for God nor man, ſayes the Judge: Nay, good my Lord, ſaith the woman. The Judge ſeeing her thus importunate, ſaid, I ſhall be troubled with her if I do her not juſtice. How much more (ſaith the text) ſhall not God avenge his elect that cry day and night?</p>
                  <p>Obj. But ſome man may demand, what is importunate prayer?</p>
                  <p>Anſ. I anſwer, it is a relſteſs praier, which will take no nay, nor contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious repulſe, but is in a holy manner impudent until it ſpeed; and there are in it four things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:44191:101"/>Firſt, it is reſtleſſe: he that is importunate, cannot reſt till he ſpeed in his ſuit before God as the poor woman of Canaan, ſhe ſought the Lord God of Heaven and earth, (ſhe was of the curſed ſtock of Cham whom the Lord commanded to deſtroy; yet ſhe repented, and became of the faith of Abraham) to ſee if the Lord would own her: but the Lord ſeemed to reject her, and ſuffered the devil to poſſeſs her daughter. Now, what, might not this poor woman think ſhe had made a ſorry change of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing that God the author of it would not own her, but ſuffered the devil to poſſeſſe her daughter? But ſee the importunity of this woman, ſhe would not be quiet untill ſhe had found Chriſt, Mark 7. 24, 25. Chriſt could not be hid. No? What, could he not hide himſelf in ſome corner? No. no, thinks ſhe, there is a Chriſt, and if he be to be had under the cope of heaven, I wil have him. Even ſo it is with the ſoul that is importunate in prayer, it is reſtleſſe. What if Chriſt do hide himſelf in the Word, &amp;c. and will not own a poor ſoul, yet the poor ſoul knowes there is a Chriſt, and if he be to be found in the whole world, he wil have him: I wil, ſaith he, turn over all duties, I will go to all the Miniſters that are neer, I will uſe all the means. Now Chriſt cannot be hid from ſuch a ſoul that is thus importunate.</p>
                  <p>Now as it is a prayer that will take no nay, ſo firſt it will take no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative nay of ſilence; Secondly, no poſſitive nay of denial.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, no privative nay of ſilence: A man that is importunate in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, muſt and will have ſome anſwer; he is not like Baals Prieſts, that could get no anſwer, 1 King. 18. 26. nor like wicked men that pray in their pewes, they know not what, nor whether God hears them or no: but an importunate prayer will have an anſwer, like the woman of Canaan: Have mercy on me O Lord (ſaith ſhe;) but Christ anſwered her not a word. Hath ſhe done then? No, ſhe cries ſo much the more, Have mercy on me O Lord: yea ſhe was ſo importunate, that his Diſciples were aſhamed to hear her; yet ſhe cried, Have mercy on my daughter; the devil hath my daughter, and miſery will have me, unleſſe thou wilt have mercy on us. Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her never a word. It was much trouble to her to have her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vext with a devil; but this troubled her much more, that Chriſt in whom all her hope was, would not hear her, nor lend her one look. What might ſhe think, Is this the merciful Saviour, that is ſo ful of pitty &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion? Is this he that hath made proclamation to all the world, ſaying, Come unto me all ye that are weary, &amp;c? and I am tyred and wearied by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the devil that poſſeſſes my daughter, &amp;c. yet he regards me not. Thus ſhe might have ſaid: yet theſe diſcouragements could not put her off, but ſhe cried ſo much the more, yea ſo that the Apoſtles were aſhamed that Chriſt ſhould let her ſtand on that faſhion; yet ſhe ſtood it out, and prevailed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it will take no poſitive nay of deniall: For when ſhe had an anſwer, and that flat againſt her, it was like bellowes to the fire, ſhe was ſo much the more inflamed, ſhe doubles her forces, Have mercy on me O Lord, &amp;c. Chiſt put her off with a deniall, I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael; I come for ſheep, not for goats; you are of the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites, on whom I have ſet a brand of damnation, a ſervant of ſervants, a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44191:102"/>
ſlave of hell and darkneſſe: Theſe are all of your blood; but I come to ſave them of the houſe of Iſrael. But the deniall of an importunate ſoul is like the ſtop in a paſſage of water; the more it is ſtopt, the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo this poor woman is ſo much the more eager with Chriſt; ſhe did but cry before, now ſhe worſhips him, verſe 24. 25. as if ſhe ſhould have ſaid, Lord help me now, I am one of thy lost ſheep; I confeſſe I am a Canaanite, I am of that damned blood; yet Lord help me; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that thou canſt take a courſe whereby to help me, Thou canſt caſt ſome mercy on a Canaanite.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, an importunate ſoul will take no deniall, but will renew its forces at the Throne of grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly an importunate Prayer will take no contumelious repulſe; ſuppoſe God ſhould anſwer never a ſyllable of thy prayer, yet thou wilt pray; ſuppoſe he do anſwer, and that againſt thee, yet ſtill thou wilt pray. Nay ſuppoſe he call thee all to naught making thy conſcience tell thee of all thy ſins and abominations, making thee think that heaven is ſhut up againſt thee, and God hath ſhut his ears, calling thee Dog hell-hound, and wretch, &amp;c. yet nothing can break thee off if thou be importunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. So this woman was not beaten off with Chriſts ſending the Devill into her Daughter, nor with Chriſts hiding himſelfe when ſhe ſought him; nor with Chriſts anſwering never a word, nor with the Apoſtles frumps, nor with his deniall, nor contumelious repulſe, for he called her dog, verſ. 26 Hence dog<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had as lieve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ling my mercy on a dog, as on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e. What creature but an importunate one, could have gone ſo far? But ſee here the nature of importunity, it gets within Chriſt and takes advantage: ſhe confeſt the cauſe, ſaying, Truth Lord, thou haſt hit me right, I am a dog, or a wicked woman; let me then have the priviledges that dogs have; though dogs may not be equal with children at the cable, yet they may wait under the table: I acknowledge that thy children are ſo plentifully fed, that ſome crummes fall from the table, therefore let me have the priviledge of a dog. Naaman the Syrian was a dog, as well as I; Rahab the harlot was a dog, as well as I; Ruth a dog, as well as I; yet theſe got c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ums: truth Lord, I am a dog, yet thy mercy can metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſe a dog: Of theſe ſtones thou canſt raiſe children to Abraham. Thus it is with an importunate ſoul, though God call it all to naught, and caſt all ignominious terms upon it, as I had as lieve thou ſhouldeſt offer me ſwines blood, as to ſpeak in my hearing, yet if thou be importunate, thou wilt bear any contumelious repulſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, an importunate prayer is impudent in an holy manner: And as an impudent begger that is needy, counts it no manners to hold his peace from begging, although he be bidden; Or as a poor petitioner to the King, the King bids him hold his peace, yet he will not, but ſtill he goes on, The officers ſay, Thou filthy fellow, wilt thou never have done? doſt thou not ſee that the King is angry? Yet he ſtill cries, Help me Lord, ô King. So the Canaanitiſh woman, or an Importunate prayer, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent prayer, yet in a holy manner.</p>
                  <p>I remember a ſtory of a poor woman in Eſſex condemned to die: ſhe falls to crying and ſcreeching, as if ſhe meant to pierce the heavens; the
<pb facs="tcp:44191:102"/>
Juge and thoſe on the bench bid her hold her peace: O my Lord, ſaid ſhe, it is for my life I beg, I beſeech you, it is for my life. So when a ſoul comes before God, and begs for mercy, he muſt conſider that it is for his life, O Lord it is for my life. Now though the Lord will not anſwer, and though he call the ſoul all to naught, letting it go up and down with a heavy heart; yet the ſoul crying out, 'Tis for my life; If I muſt go to hell, I will go to hell from the throne of grace, weeping and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ling for my ſins, and catching hold on the horns of the altar: this ſoul ſhall finde mercy.</p>
                  <p>I have wondered at the ſtory in the 5. chapter of Luke, it is a ſtrange paſſage, where this godly kind of impudencie was ſeen. Our Saviour Chriſt was preaching in the houſe to the people, and there was a poor man that could not tell how to come to Chriſt; ſo the poor man got ſome to lift him up to the top of the houſe and to untile it, and ſo to let him down; now the rubbiſh could not chooſe but fall either on Chriſts head, or on the heads of ſome of his hearers; Was not this an impudent action? could not this man have ſtaied until the ſermon had been ended? But importunity hath no manners: And although he did interrupt Chriſt, yet Chriſt ask'd him not why he did ſo, but ſays, Man be of good comfort thy ſins be forgiven thee. Let us therfore come with boldnesſ unto the Throne of grace, Heb. 4. 16. with freedom to talk any thing; Not as if God had given us leave to be irreverent, but as to a loving generous man of whom we uſe to ſay, He is ſo kinde, you may ſay any thing unto him; come to him at dinner, he will riſe up and hear you, or what buſineſſe ſoever he be about, yet he will hear you. Even ſo it is with God: he is ſuch a God: that all poor ſouls may be bold before him to ſpeak what they will, they may lay open their caſes, and ſhew their eſtates. Now when ſouls come boldly, and give the Lord no reſt till he eſtabliſh them, Eſai. 62. 7. then ſaith God, How now, cannot I be at reſt for you? &amp;c. This holy kinde of impudencie is in prayer, and it will give the Lord no reſt.</p>
                  <p>Reaſons why we muſt ſeek importunately, are three.</p>
                  <p>Firſt in regard of Gods majeſty, he loves to be ſought unto, and it is fit he ſhould be ſought unto. Among men, we account it a matter of too much ſtatelineſſe to be much intreated; and we uſe to ſay he loves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; this is a fault among men; yet for all this, Quis veſtrum, &amp;c as Seneca ſpeaks, what man of us can be content to be but once, or ſlightly intreated? when a man comes to intreat a kindneſſe of a man there is I ſing and Anding and ſhall I &amp;c. nothing but importunity can get a kindneſſe of a man; and this is a ſin among men, becauſe men are bound to do good; but the Lord is not bound to us. If we ſin, he is not bound to pardon us therefore; the Lord being a God of majeſty, lookes to be ſought unto of us for his mercy, and he lookes that we ſhould be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; and hence it is that God ſaith, I will give you a new heart, Ezech. 36. I will vouchſafe you all theſe favours, yet I will look to be inquired for of you. verſe 76. I will look that they ſhall ſend to me for theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:44191:103"/>Suppoſe a man ſhould need a 1000 pound; What, ſaith the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, doth he think a thouſand pound is nothing? I will have good ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for it. So when we come for ſuch high mercies as theſe, for ſuch infinite compaſſions; theſe are ſomewhat, and God looks to be ſought unto for them; and Chriſt the Son of God is a great heir, and thoſe that are faulters to him, muſt be importunate with him, if they mean to be at peace with him.</p>
                  <p>If one will marry a rich heir, who hath all the preferment and dignity that the country can afford, he looks to be well ſued unto. So the Lord Jeſus is a great heir, heir of the whole world; if thou goeſt to be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, thou muſt ſue unto him, and he looks for prayer, he loves to heare his children crie: this is one of his titles, though he be a God, yet he is the hearer of prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal. 65. 2.</p>
                  <p>Again, we have wronged his Majeſtie. Suppoſe thy ſervant wrong thee, thou wilt ſay thou wilt pardon him, but firſt thou wilt make him humble himſelf unto thee, he ſhall and muſt know that he hath wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good maſter: So God is willing to pardon thee, but yet he will make thy bowels know that thou haſt ſinned againſt a good God; he will make it appear by thy prayer, he will make thy ſpirit melt, he will fill thy face with ſhame and confuſion, he will make thee know what a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient God thou haſt rebelled againſt, or elſe the Lord will never pardon thee. Doeſt thou think to pacifie God with a lazie prayer, with coming to Church and ſaying, Have mercy upon me, moſt mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Doeſt thou think that the Lord will have mercy upon thee for this? No, no, he may ſend thee quick to hell for all this; he will make thee cry and cry again with groans; he will make thee cry out and pray on another gates faſhion, and he will make the ſoveraignty of his mercy to be ſeen in thy ſalvation: therefore in regard of Gods majeſty, he loves men ſhould be importunate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of Gods mercy; it is a diſgrace for Mercy to be begged frigidly; 'tis a diſgrace to Gods bounty, for a man to beg it with lukewarm importunity. What makeſt thou of the mercy of God? doſt thou think that it is not worth a groan, with the running over of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noſter? doſt thou make Gods mercy of ſuch baſe reckoning? this is a diſgrace to Gods goodneſſe, to be ſo cold or frigid in prayer. Thou haſt offered many offerings, yet I ſcorn them, ſaith God, Iſaiah. 43. 23. Thou haſt not honoured me with them, thou haſt not called on me, thou haſt been weary of calling on me, thou haſt too ſhort a breath in thy prayers, thou careſt not how ſoon thou comeſt to an end? Do you come and lay lazie prayers upon my altar? Thou haſt not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured me.</p>
                  <p>It was a cuſtom among the Romans, when any was condemned to die, if he looked for mercy, he was to bring father &amp; mother, and all his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and acquaintance, and they ſhould all come with tears in their faces, and with tattered garments, and kneel down and beg before the Judge, and cry mightily; and then they thought Juſtice was honoured. Thus they honoured juſtice in man, for a man condemned to die; and ſo the Lord loves his mercy ſhould be honoured, &amp;c, and therefore he will have prayer

to be importunate, that it may appear by groans how highly we eſteem of grace; our ſoules muſt pant and gaſp after grace, the breath of the Lord being the ſoul of our ſouls, our hearts will die without it: This is to the honour of mercy, therefore the Lord will have us Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as importunity muſt be in regard of Gods mercy, ſo it muſt be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our ſelves, elſe we cannot tell how to eſteem it: Soon come, ſoon gone; lightly gotten, ſuddenly forgotten; I have it, come let us be jovial and ſpend it, when this is gone, I know where to have more; But if he had wrought for it, and alſo muſt work for more, if he mean to have more, he would better eſteem it. The world little eſteems Mercy; what's the reaſon? The greateſt covetous men are they that once were poor; when a poor man hath gotten ſtore of riches, he is more coverous than he that was born to hundreds or thouſands; they are careleſſe of it, and ſpend laviſhly, whilſt a covetous mans teeth water at it; and the reaſon is, becauſe they come lightly by it. Therefore the Lord loves that we ſhould come hardly by our mercy; not as if he ſold mercy for our pains, but for our good: yet we are not capable of it. See Jer. 31. 9. where the Lord ſpeaks thus to his people: They come with weeping, and with ſupplication will I lead them. This is a fine phraſe, God leads a ſoul up and down with ſupplication, before he grants his requeſt; juſt as a begger on the high-way, a gentleman coming by, he begs of him, the gentleman goes on his way as if he took no notice, but the begger goes on crying, For Gods ſake (ſir) beſtow ſomething on me; yet he goes on ſtill, till at laſt the gentleman comes to his houſe, and then he gives him his deſire. Even ſo God leads a ſoul up and down, from one good duty to another, till he have brought the ſoul to that paſſe that he would have it to be, and then he hears it, and ſayes, What is thy ſuit? I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee.</p>
                  <p>What then is the reaſon, may ſome man ſay, why ſo few are importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in prayer?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, becauſe men count Prayer a penance: there is a naturall kind of Popery in mens breaſts; the Papiſts, when men ſin, their Prieſts enjoyn them penance, as pilgrimages and ſcourgings, ſo many Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's, and ſo many Ave-Marie's, where they reckon Prayer to be a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. This naturall Popery is in mens breaſts; they count Prayer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious unto them, and they are weary of it, they are not eager upon prayer, they look not on Prayer as a bleſſing, but as a yoak; behold what a weariſome thing it is, Mal. 1. 13. They were weary of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; Oh, ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they, that the Miniſter would once had done! they had rather be in an Ale-houſe, or about their buſines; all good duties are as penance unto carnal men. If a man be to do penance, he care not how little he does of it; a Rogue cares not for to much whipping.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, men content themſelvs with formality. Many men pray, as Haman ſpake the Kings words before Mordecai, for he had rather have led him to the gallows, than to have ſaid, Thus ſhall it be done unto the man whom the King wil honour: but he thought it would be the worſe for him if he ſpake them not, and therefore he only ſpake them for forme. And ſo men for the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44191:104"/>
moſt part go to Church, to hear the Word, to Pray, to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments &amp;c. even for forme, or becauſe it is the faſhion, and they think, if they do not thus and thus, they ſhall not be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>You ſhal have the Drunkard ſay, I am ſorry for my drunkeneſſe; but he lies; for the next day he will be at the Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>houſe again: ſo the Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter ſayes, Lord I am ſorry that I have ſinned againſt thee; but he lies; for the next Quean that he meets with, having opportunity, he falls to whoreing again: So the Covetous man will ſay, I am ſorry I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I am ſo full of earthly thoughts; yet he lies; he is not ſorry; for you ſhall have him carking and caring all the day long, and he hath a thouſand proclamations in his head; He only prayes for forme with the reſt, they only ſay prayer, they pray not. I deny not ſaying of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if they pray; Our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, When you pray, ſay Our father; The proud man diſhonours Gods name, ſaying, Thy will be done; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſhould be humble, for that is Gods will; it is Gods will he ſhould be zealous, yet he prayes not: He ſayes, Forgive us our treſpaſſes, &amp;c. but he prayes not ſo; for he wrongs his neighbour, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour wrongs him, and he does not forgive thoſe that treſpaſſe againſt him. He ſayes, Lead us not into temptation; but he prayes it not; for he runs preſently into temptations, and hath no care to avoyd them. And this is the reaſon why men are not importunate; viz. becauſe they do make formality of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe they are gentlemen-beggers. Of all the beggers in the world, I would be loth to meet with a gentleman begger, for he is prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of them all; if a man tell him that he hath been an ill husband, and hath abuſed himſelf, preſently he ſets his hands to his ſide, ſaying, I am not as every begger, I am thus and thus deſcended, am as good a man by birth as your ſelfe: a gentlemen-beggers heart will not ſtoop. So men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> gentlemen beggers to God, they were (ſay they) borne of Chriſtian parents, and they have been baptized the children of God already; What are none the children of God, but a company of Puritans? We are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended as well as the beſt of you all. Theſe are proud, and not as yet brought to a ſenſe of their own miſerie.</p>
                  <p>When John did preach to, and baptize the Scribes and Phariſees, he calls them all to nought, O ye vipers and full of poiſon, who hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned you to flee from the anger to come? Vipers, ſaie they? Viper in thy teeth; we are the children of Abraham, we are better deſcended then ſo; we are Believers, and do you call us vipers? then indeed we might crie out, Oh we are damned! then we had need crie for mercie. And in this ſenſe, men are Gentlemen-beggars.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon why men are not importunate, is, becauſe they have wrong conceits of Prayer. I will tell you the ſundrie conceits of men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they have high conceits of their own prayers; they cannot pray in a morning, between the pillow and the blankets, halfe aſleep and halfe awake, but they think that they have done God good ſervice; ſo that he cannot afford to damne them: At night he ſaies, Lord have mercy upon me, and ſo goes to ſleep, and then he thinks God muſt keep him untill the morning: So when he goes to dinner, he ſais, Lord bleſs theſe creatures unto
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44191:104"/>
us, and ſo falls aboard, and he thinks that God muſt needs ſanctifie them unto him; and after ſupper he goes to prayer, and ſo to bed, and thinks that he ſhall be heard for his much babling ſake, Mat. 6. they think God will have mercy on them. But poor ſouls, if they knew how unſeemingly they prayed, how unfitly, and what want there is in ſeeing their own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, they would ſay, is this to pray for my ſoul, for ſuch infinite mercy? Lord, how do I abuſe the throne of grace? how do I abuſe thy ſabbaths, thy houſe, thy name, and all the holy ordinances which I go about? A man that is importunate in prayer, is aſhamed; but when they think high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their prayers, they are inſolent, their prayers are damned, and they too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as men have high conceits of their prayers, ſo they have mean conceits of their ſinnes, they think not their ſins ſo bad as they are. Theſe men are like Abner, who ſaid, Let the young men ariſe and play before us, 2 Sam. 2. 15. They account murder a ſport, and dancing and muſiking lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worſe then Davids playing on the harp; Amos 6. 5. And if they commit adultery, they ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that's but a trick of youth; if they tell a lie, it is only at a dead lift when they have no other ſhift. That man that doth not think of every ſin he commits, as David did of his, even to make his heart to ake for it, that man ſhall never ſpeed well before God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as men have mean thoughts of their ſins, ſo they have baſe thoughts of God. They cannot think that God ſhould damn a man for drinking a pot with his friend; I cannot think God will be ſo ſtrict; No, no, I love God with all my heart, ſay they; and they think that God is of their mind; and if they were as God, they would not be ſo ſtrict. So, Pſal. 50. They thought I was ſuch an one as themſelves; they think God will pardon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>em, and therefore becauſe of this, men are not importunate with God. God hath ſent me a croſſe (ſaith one) but I hope to rub it off well enough. Why? God will not keep his anger for ever, Jer. 3. 5. Suppoſe a man be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Church, or break out into ſome unſavoury ſpeech, will God be angry for this? Suppoſe a man be negligent in a good duty, will God require every dayes work? Tuſh, tuſh, God will not, Pſal. 10. 13. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Puritans ſay he will, but I know he will not: and hence it is, that men will not be importunate.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, becauſe they have wrong conceits of importunity. If a man knock once or twice, or thrice, and none anſwer, preſently he will be gone; this is for want of manners; thou wilt knock ſeven times, if thou be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with them: They within may ſay, Hold thy peace, be gone, &amp;c. but thou wilt not ſo be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, men are cloſe-handed, they are loth to give; and they are cloſe-hearted too, they are loth to take the pains to ask of God; they are loth others ſhould be importunate with them, and therefore they are loth to be importuate with God. Examine your ſelves then in this duty; for importunate prayer is evermore the prayer of an importunate man.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O proceed then: There be ſix ſignes to know whether our Prayers be importunate or no.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, importunate prayer is evermore the prayer of an importunate man; and the man is importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, if his praier be importunate, but how can a man importune God for mercy, when his perſon importunes God for vengeance? It muſt be the prayer of a godly heart; Preſerve my ſoul, for I am holy. Pſal. 86. 1, 2. David makes a prayer, and he was holy when he made it; his prayer could tell him that he was one that laboured to work in holineſſe. Therefore when thou goeſt to God in praier, conſider whether thou canſt ſay, Lord hear me, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>ak thee, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en thy prayer condems thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:44191:107"/>Of all begging, it is a great matter who it is that begs at the door: Who is that, ſaith the indweller? and when he opens the door and ſees it is a thief; &amp;c. Oh, is it you? ſaies he; you may ſtand long enough, you ſhall never have alms of me. So in praier, it is all in all, who it is that prays.</p>
                  <p>The woman in the Goſpel having an iſſue, touched our Saviour; he looking about, asked who touched him, and when he ſaw the woman, Oh is it you? ſaies he, be of good chear, Luke 8. 48. So when a man praies to God, Who is that, ſaies God, that would have theſe mercies? And when the Lord ſees it a Drunkard, or a covetous man, &amp;c. is it you? ſaies the Lord; you may ſtay till Dooms day, and yet never find mercie. The ſpirit of ſupplication and the ſpirit of prayer, is called the ſpirit of grace, Zach. 12. 10. If them thou haſt not the ſpirit of grace, thou canſt not pray. The text ſaith not, Whoſoever asketh the Father in my name, but, whatſoever you ask the Father in my name? there is many a man may uſe the name of Chriſt at the throne of grace, but certain it is, none but thoſe that are in Chriſt, can pray; and with them every thing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. A man that will walk with God in obedience to his lawes, muſt be a holy man: hence is that ſaying of our Saviour, John 15. 7. a place fit for the purpoſe; If you abide in me, and my word abide in you &amp;c. as if he ſhould have ſaid, You may ask what you pleaſe, and intreat God all the daies of your life; yet unleſſe you abide in me, you cannot ſpeed. That man that walks not in holineſse of life, can never be an importunate orator, as was Moſes the man of God; but a wicked mans prayer (as Auguſtine ſpeaks) is tanquam latratus canum, &amp;c. no better then the barking of dogs, or the grunting of ſwine: therefore you whoſe conſciences tell you that you live in ſin, your prayers never ſpeed at the throne of grace for eternall mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, an importunate praier is the praier of a pure conſcience. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man doth not ſee that he lives in ſin, yet if his conſcience crie guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if he have a foul conſcience, his prayer never prevails with God. If I regard wickedneſſe in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer, ſaith David, Pſal. 66. 18. that is, If I can ſay, or my conſcience can tell me, that I regard iniquitie in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. A man muſt have a pure conſcience, 2 Tim. 1. 3. elſe let him not look God in the face; beg he may, but he ſhall never ſpeed as long as he goes on with a conſcience that can tell him he regards iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>There be many pray, (for indeed their conſcience wil make them pray) but they may pray till they come to hell, yet they ſhal never be delivered, if there be but one ſin unrepented of.</p>
                  <p>I remember a ſtory of a poor woman being troubled in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and many Miniſters uſing to viſit her, at laſt came one which (after much talking and praying) hit upon one ſin which ſhe was guilty of, and loth to part with; Then the woman cried out, till now you have ſpoken to the poſt, but now you have hit the mark, my conſcience tels me I have been loth to part with this ſin, but I muſt leave it, or elſe I cannot be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Mala conſcientia bene ſperare non poteſt. The Pagans had ſo much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as to ſay, The gods muſt be honoured with purity; therefore they wrote on the doors of their temples, Let none having a guilty conſcience enter this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:44191:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thirdly, Importunate prayer is evermore a prayer that is full of ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And hence it is that Job ſaith, I will fill my mouth with arguments, Job 23. 4. like an importunate man, who will bring all reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to effect his cauſe; even ſo an importunate man at the throne of grace, will bring all argu,ents to perſwade God. If a man be to pray for any particular grace, he will bring all the arguments he can deviſe to get it; as, Lord, it is a grace of the Covenant, for the want whereof I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure many temptations; thou haſt made me a Miniſter, I cannot worke on mens conſciences untill I have it, he preſſeth all arguments he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe. A good orator before God, muſt be a good logician. It was noted of the High-Prieſts that were to pray before God, they were to have Urim and Thummim, and that was two parts of Logick, viz. knowledge and perfection: ſuch an one ſhould a Miniſter be, he muſt be a good Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitian at the throne of groce.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, importunate prayer is a ſtout prayer; Continue in praier, ſaith the Apoſtle, Col. 4. 2. a weak-hearted praier is a cold prayer, a prayer without a ſpirit; yet theſe men that have weak ſpirits to pray, have ſtrong enough to ſin; and wit enough to ſin, and knowledge enough to ſin; but bring them to grace, then they have no ſtrength. Thou canſt not ſtrive to prevail with God, unleſſe thou ſtand to it. How came Jacob to prevail with God, but by wreſtling? Prayer is called fighting, it is a holy kind of violence. Thou canſt not obtain a mercie at Gods hand, unleſſe thou lay all thy force on it. Even as a Father who hath an apple in his hand, and his child would fain have it; he firſt opens one finger, then another, till the aple drop out. So is it with a poor ſoul at the throne of grace: the Lord opens his hands, and fills all things living with plenteouſneſſe; What is the means that is uſed? why, the praiers of his children; they by their prayers open Gods hand, and ſo make the bleſſings to deſcend. Go for grace; why, the Lord will ſay unto thee, Thou art proud, thou muſt be humble, and ſo open that finger; Thou art careleſſe, thou muſt go quicken thy ſelf, and ſo open that finger: God ſaies, thou wilt not make much of this grace when thou haſt it, but thou wilt turn it into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; then thy ſoul muſt learn to mortifie its members, and ſo open that finger; thou canſt not get grace at Gods hand, unleſſe thou do open all his fingers, and then it will fall down. There is a ſeverall power in all Gods children, ſome have more, ſome have leſſe, yet all muſt be powerfull, elſe none can prevail with God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly if thou pray importunately, thou prayeſt wakefully; he muſt be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awake that praies; his ſoul, his heart, his underſtanding muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake: that man that praies drowsily, praies not powerfully; Watch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith Chriſt, and pray, Luke 21. 36. Watch to pray. q. d. for as there is a ſleepy head, ſo there is a ſleepy heart. As a Begger who is beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, is all awake, head, feet, hands, &amp;c. all is awake to beg; ſo muſt that ſoul be that means to ſpeed in praier.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, importunate prayer is an aſſurance getting prayer; a prayer that will not be quiet till it have got aſſurance that God hath heard it. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men pray, and preſume that God hears them, but God hears them not; nay, many of Gods dear children pray many times, and are not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44191:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heard. How long wilt thou be angry with thy people that praieth? Pſ. 80. 4. Not only with their perſons, but with their prayers alſo. How then, think you, is the prayer of ſuch as live in their ſins taken? who pray, but their praiers vaniſh away in the air like clouds: theſe may pray and pray, but they get nothing.</p>
                  <p>Behold he praies, ſaith the voice to Saul, Acts 9. 22. What, did he not pray before? Yes, he had made many a long praier, elſe he could not have been a Phariſee; but now he did not only pray, but he praied unto God as David did, who did lift up his heart to God, Pſal. 25. 1. or elſe his heart could not have praied; and then in the next verſe David begins his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Our hearts are juſt like a bell, which ſo long as it lies on the ground will make no muſick, till it be lifted up; Our hearts are not like the bell of Rochea, which (they ſay) will ring of its own accord; but our hearts muſt be lifted up, elſe they will make no delightfull muſick in the eares of God. Wherefore if you pray, and labour not to bring your hearts home to God, that ſo he may hear them in mercy, he will (it may be) hear them, but it will be to your condemnation, as he hears the praiers of wicked men: therefore if thou praieſt, pray fervently.</p>
                  <p>There be ſix or ſeven marks of Prayer that is not importunate, and he that praies ſo, may go to hell, for ought I know.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is a lazy, prayer; An importunate man works hard to bring up hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> his vineyard, that man praies for a good harveſt; if a man pray to God never ſo much, yet if he do not uſe the means, he cannot obtain the thing he prayes for. Even ſo it is with grace; A man may pray for all the graces of Gods ſpirit, and yet never get any, unleſs he labour for them in the uſe of the means. God cannot abide lazy beggers, that cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to follow their calling, but if they can get any thing by begging, they will never ſet themſelves to work. So, many there be, that if they can get pardon of ſin for begging, then they wil have it; but let ſuch know that the Lord will not give it for ſuch lazie kind of praying; but if thou wilt have pardon of ſin, thou muſt labour for it, thou muſt get it with thy fingers ends; God gives not men Repentance, Faith, &amp;c. by miracles, but by means: Thou muſt then uſe the means, and keep watch and ward over thine own ſoul, that ſo thou maiſt get the grace thou praieſt for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; a praier that is not a full praier, never ſpeeds with God; but an importunate prayer is a full praier, it is a pouring out of the heart, yea of the whole heart, Pſal. 62. 8. the Pſalmiſt ſaith, poure out your hearts before him, truſt in him at all times, poure out your hearts (the addition is made in the Lamentations of Jeremy) like water. It may be thou powreſt out thy praier like tar out of a tar-box, halfe ſticking by the ſides; but when thou praieſt, thou muſt out with all before God. When thou giveſt thanks, doſt thou labour to remember all the bleſſings of God? when thou doſt petition to God, doſt thou poure out all thy heart before him? doſt thou caſt all thy care on God?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Snatch-prayer is no importunate prayer; when men pray
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44191:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by ſnatches, or peecemeals, by breaking off a limme of their prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſluggiſhneſſe, or becauſe their hearts are eager about other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; it is not good to truſt fits of devotion; 'tis a baſe kind of praying, when men gallop over their prayers, that ſo they may come to an end quickly. Should I accept this at your hands, ſaith God by his Prophet? when they brought a ſheep, it wanted a lim, they were loth to give God a whole offering, Mal. 1. 13. Many pray a peece of a prayer in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nig, and then they go after the world, he down's on his knees, and gives God a rag of a prayer, a companie of ragged ends; And God counts it an indignitie; ſhall I accept this (ſaith he?) What, a lame prayer? No, no, the Lord looks for a prayer that hath its full grouth; it is a ſhame to ſpeak in the congregation what men do in ſecret before God, which many have confeſſed after they have been converted, how they have gone into Gods preſence, and have ſhuffled over their prayers, thinking every hour ſeven, untill they had done.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Silent prayers are never importunate. I mean by ſilent prayer, when a man is ſilent in that which God looks he ſhould moſt inſiſt upon. David made a prayer, Pſal. 32. and the Lord looked that he ſhould ſtand much upon his adultery and murther, which he had committed, to ſee what ſhame he took on him for it; but he ſhuffled it over: and what ſaith the Text? When I kept ſilence; what, did the Prophet roare, and yet keep ſilence? theſe are contradictions. Yea, the Prophet roared and kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; as if he ſhould ſay, the Lord counted his prayer but roaring, ſo long as he laid not open that ſinne, which the Lord lookt he ſhould have ſtood on; the Lord let him roare, and roare he might long enough, but (ſaith he) I brake my ſilence, I ſaid, I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſions, and then thou forgaveſt the wickedneſſe of my ſin. So, many go to God, and tell God they muſt needs have mercy, and fain they would have mercy, and yet they are ſilent in confeſſing the ſinne they ſhould. I ſay, the Lord will never hear that man; he may pray to God all his life, and yet go to hell in the end. Haſt thou been a drunkard, and doſt thou think that the Lord will forgive thee for crying, Lord forgive me, &amp;c? No, no, thou muſt inſiſt on it, and ſay, Againſt thy word I have been a drunkard, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience told me ſo, but I would not hear; I have felt the motions of thy holy ſpirit, ſtirring againſt me, and I regarded not, Now if thou ſhouldeſt turn me into hell, I were well requited; ſo many Sermons have I neglected; I have wronged others in this kind, and I have been the cauſe why many are now in hell, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not. I have prayed for mercie, yet with the dog to his vomit have I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and therefore for all my prayers thou mayeſt caſt me into hell for ever; and now I have prayed, yet it is a hundred to one but I ſhal run into my old ſin again; yet as I expect forgiveneſſe, ſo I deſire to make a covenant to give over all my ſinful courſes, and I am juſtly damned if I go to them again. Such a kind of prayer the Lord loves.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Seldome-prayer is no importunate prayer; when the ſoul contents it ſelf with ſeldome coming before the throne of grace; an importunate ſoul is ever frequenting the way of mercie, and the gate of Chriſt; he is often at the threſhold before God, in all prayer and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:44191:109"/>The reeling'ſt Drunkard in the world ſometimes can do ſo too; the baſeſt Adulterer in the world ſometimes can be chaſt: the Devil is qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſo long he is pleaſed, and the wicked may ſometime have a fit in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But this is the condition of an importunate heart, he is frequent at the throne of grace. The Prophet David prayed ſeven times in a day; and Hannah continued in prayer night and day.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Lukewarm prayer is not an importunate prayer; when a man prais, but is not fervent, when a man labours not to wind up his ſoul to God in prayer. That man that prayes outwardly only, that man teaches God how to denie his prayer. Though you make many prayers, ſaith God, yet I will not hear you; why? Your hands are full of blood. Qui frigidè or at, docet negare. They are like luke warme water, that never boils out the blood: So they have been guilty of murder and abundance of other ſins, and they did indeed pray againſt them, but they were never but luke-warme, they have never boiled away the blood of their ſins. Thou muſt pray fervently, with a ſeething hot heart, if thou meaneſt to get pardon for all thy ſins, as ſecuritie, and deadneſſe of heart, &amp;c. And as it is in Jonah 3. let every man crie mightily unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly and laſtly, Bie-thoughts in prayer keep prayer from being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; as when a man prayes, and lets his heart go a wool-gathering. I remember a ſtorie of an unworthy O ratour, who being to make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, O earth! O heaven! when he ſaid O heaven, he looked down to the earth; and when he ſaid O earth, he looked up to heaven. So, many when they pray to God in heaven, their thoughts are on the earth: theſe prayers can never be importunate. When a man praies, the Lord looks that his heart ſhould be fixed on his prayer; for our hearts will leake, and the beſt child of God, do what he can, ſhall have bie-thoughts in prayer.</p>
                  <p>And that,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from corrupt nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from nature curbed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from Satan.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, from a mans own ſluggiſhneſſe.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt; The beſt children of God have corrupt natures, and when they have done what they can, diſtractions will faſten on them. They would perform good duties better, if they were able, ſaying with Paul, The good which I would I do not, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from nature, as it is curbed; The more grace binds nature to its good behaviovr, the more ruſtling it keeps. Even a Bird being at liberty keps no ſtir, but being in a cage, it flutters about, becauſe it is abridged of its libertie: ſo when thou haſt curbed thy corrupt fleſh, it will be ſkittiſh in every good dutie thou goeſt about; and hence it is that the Apoſtle uſeth this phraſe, viz. I find another law in my members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt the law of my mind, &amp;c. When grace curbs the law of ſin, then nature rebels.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from Satan; as in Job, Satan ſtands at his right hand as a Plantiffe, as Aegidius compares it, which puts in all Caſes to hinder the Defendant; Even ſo the Devil puts in all bie-thoughts that he can deviſe, to hinder a mans ſuit for going on before the throne of grace. But thou
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44191:109"/>
muſt do as Abraham did, when he was ſacrificing; when the birds came, he drave them away; ſo muſt thou do by thy bie-thoughts, if thou wilt have fruit of thy ſupplications before God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they come from ſpiritual ſluggiſhneſs, that creeps on the beſt, if they take not heed: And this was the reaſon the Apoſtle cryed, O wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man that I am, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not now to the children of God, who are troubled with bie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts in their praiers; For they, the more bie-thoughts they have, the more earneſt they are in prayer; they mourn with David, in their prayer. Conſider O Lord (ſaith he) how I mourn, Pſal. 55. There was ſomething in the Prophets prayer that did vex him, and that made him ſo much the more to mourn before God.</p>
                  <p>But as for you that can have bie-thoughts in prayer, and let them abide with you, your praiers are not importunate; the Heathen ſhall riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you and condemn you.</p>
                  <p>I remember a ſtorie of a certain Youth, who being in the temple with Alexander, when he was to offer incenſe to his god, and the Youth holding the golden Cenſer with the fire in it, a coal fell on the Youths hand and burnt his wriſt; but the Youth conſidering what a ſacred thing he was about; for all he felt his wriſt to be burnt, yet he would not ſtir, but continued ſtill to the end.</p>
                  <p>This I ſpeak to ſhame thoſe that can let any thing, though never ſo ſmall, to diſturb them, yea (if it were poſſible) leſſer things then nothing; for if nothing come to draw their hearts away, they themſelves will employ their hearts. Baals Prieſts ſhall condemn theſe, who did cut themſelves with knives, and all to make them pray ſo much the more ſtronglie. What a ſhame is it then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we ſhould come on life and death to pray for our ſouls, and yet come with ſuch looſe and lazie prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers! Think you that a male factor when he is crying at the Bar for his life, will be thinking on his Pots and Whores, &amp;c? Was it ever heard of, that a man at deaths-door, ſhould be thinking on his Dogs? can he then think on them? Do you think that Jonah prayed on this faſhion, when he was in the Whales belly: or the Thief on the croſſe, or Daniel in the Lions den, or the three Children in the fierie furnace, or Paul in Priſon? Do ye think that theſe prayed thus? What, ſhall I be at praier, and my mind in the fields? No, no; if I will pray, I muſt melt before God, and bewail my ſins, and be heartily affected in prayer. But as long as I pray thus, I pray not at all. And as God ſaid to Adam, where art thou? ſo may he ſay to thee, Man, where art thou? art thou at prayer, and thy mind at mill? is thy mind on thy Oxen, and art thou at prayer before me? what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie is this? Should a man come to ſue to the King, and not mind his ſuit? will not the King ſay, Do you mock me? know you to whom ye ſpeak? The Lord takes this as a haynous ſin, when men come into his preſence with ſuch looſe hearts.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing theſe things are thus, take a word of exhortation to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for importunate Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Prayer is the art of all arts; it enables a man to all other duties, it is the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44191:110"/>
art of Repentance, &amp;c. Samuel confeſſed, if he had not had the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> Prayer, he could not have had the art of preaching, 2 San. 12. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See the antitheſis between theſe two words. God forbid; as if he ſhould ſay, God forbid that I ſhould ceaſe to pray for you, for then I ſhould not teach you the right way. A Miniſter can never preach to his people, that prayes not for his people. It is the art of Thankſgiving; a man cannot be thankful, if he cannot pray. Pſal. 116. 12. It was the means whereby the Prophet David would be thankful to God; he would take the cup of ſalvation, and call on the name of the Lord. A man hath not a good ſervant, unleſſe he can pray for his maſter; ſee the ſtory of Abrahams ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Gen, 24. Prayer helps to perform all other good duties. How doſt thou think to have benefit by the Word, unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſe thou be fervent in prayer with God to get a bleſſing upon it? We can do nothing but by beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as Prayer is the art of all arts, ſo it is the Compendium of all divinitie. Therefore to call zealouſly on the name of the Lord, is to be a Chriſtian; Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord, &amp;c. It includes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, humiliation, ſorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſin, joy in Gods goodneſſe, thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for mercies, obedience to his commandements, yea the whole du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie man; therefore we muſt labour to be importunate in prayer. A Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul is eminently all ſouls; ſo Prayer is eminently all good duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal. 72. The prayer of David the ſon Jeſſe; that is, all his repentance, in all paſſages; he did humble himſelf before God; all Davids duties are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the name of the prayer of David the ſon of Jeſſe. And therefore thou hadſt need to make much of Prayer; for thou canſt never repent, unleſſe thou pray well.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Prayer is a mans utmoſt refuge; a man cannot have Chriſt, but only by Prayer. 'Tis bad enough for a man to be a Drunkard, or to live in any other ſin; but yet after all this, if a man have the ſpirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there is hope of this man; if after all his ſinnes committed, he can pray to God, there is hope. But for a man to ſinne, and not to be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in prayer, is dangerous. What ſaith the Pſalmiſt? They are corrupt and become abominable, they have not called on the name of the Lord, Pſalm 14. 4. Oh fearfull condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Prayer is that which Gods people have, though they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; it is the beggers diſh (as I may ſo call it.) A begger hath no way to live, but by begging; therefore he had need beg hard: ſo we have nothing to live on, but praying; I mean nothing that is to be done on our ſide; all the promiſes of God are to be gotten by prayer. Suppoſe a man have nothing to live on but his fingers ends, no houſe nor land, nothing left to maintain his wife and children, but his fingers ends; will he not be toyling all the day? he is a day-labourer, as we uſe to ſay. So, to pray earneſtly, is a Chriſtians fingers ends. When a houſe ſtands but upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> falls all the hope of

                     <pb facs="tcp:44191:110"/>
 unprofitable ſervants, that Mercie will not meddle with us, unleſſe it be commanded. Patience is loth to bear; we have ſo provoked God, that Mercie is loth to make or meddle with us; for unleſſe it have command from God, it will not admit of any ſoul. When David begged for loving kindneſſe, he was importunate; elſe mercie and loving kindneſs would not look on David, Pſal. 42. 8.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Prayer is Gods delight. The ſupplication of the wicked is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ation to God, but the prayer of the upright is his delight, Prov. 15. 8. The Lord muſt have ſomething to pleaſe him; Kings (you know) muſt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im. Now nothing is more pleaſing unto him than prayer.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Importunate prayer is a willing praier. There be many that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y are not importunate. When a mans luſt runs on the world and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Eighthly, Importunate prayer is the only faithfull prayer. A begger never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> a believing ſoul. O woman, (ſaith Chriſt) great is thy faith. Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her importunity was great, therefore Chriſt concludes her faith was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>eat.</p>
                  <p>The means to get importunity in prayer, are theſe,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Labour to know thine own miſery. See Epheſ. 6. 18, 19, 20. They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ould not have praied importunately, unleſſe they had known how it had ſtood with Paul; ſo unleſſe thou know thy miſery, thou canſt not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mportunate. If a Drunkard, or Whoremaſter, or Sabbath-breaker, or Swearer, &amp;c. knew that they ſhould be damned, they would get out of their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You muſt be ſenſible of your miſery. Simon Magus knew his miſerie, yet becauſe he was not ſenſible of it, he ſayes, Pray ye to the Lord for me, Acts 8. 24. If he had been ſenſible, he would himſelfe have fallen down before the congregation, and he would have confeſſed how he had committed that ſin, in a more apprehenſive manner.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve the praiers of Gods people, as here the diſciples of Chriſt did; they hearing Chriſt pray, ſay unto him, Maſter, teach us to pray; they were ſo affected with Chriſts prayer, that they ſaid, Oh that we could pray thus! Oh that we had ſuch a ſpirit! Maſter, teach us to pray So I ſay, conſider Gods people, how they pray; they can pray as if they would ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re up to God in ſupplication; they pray as if they world read the heavens. If men did but conſider this, it would quicken them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Get a ſtock of prayer. That man muſt needs be rich, that hath a rock in every market. So if a man have a ſtock of prayer, it is a ſigne he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke to ſpeed, as 1. Cor. 4. 2. If God did lend his ears to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an when they were crying for Paul, then certainly Pauls prayers were importunate.</p>

                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:44191:111"/>Fifthly, If thou wilt be importunate, labour to be full of good works Qui benè operatur, benè erat; as Acts 10.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere are two things contained in this Text: the Patients, and the Phyſitian.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Patients; the broken in heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Phyſitian, Chriſt, it is he that healeth and bindeth up their wounds.</p>
                  <p>The Patients here are felt and diſcerned to have two wounds or maladies; Firſt, brokenneſs in heart; Secondly, wounded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: He binds up ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Brokenneſſe of heart preſuppoſeth wholeneſſe of heart: Wholeneſſe of heart is twofold; either wholeneſs of heart in ſin, or wholeneſſe of heart from ſin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, wholeneſſe of heart from ſin, is, when the heart it without ſin; and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44191:113"/>
ſo the bleſſed Angels have whole hearts, and ſo Adam and Eve, and we in them before the fall, had whole hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wholeneſſe of heart in ſin; ſo the devils have whole hearts, and all men ſince the fall from their conception, til their converſion, have whole hearts; and theſe are they that our Saviour intends, The whole need not a phyſitian, but they that are ſick. The hearts that are whole, need not the phyſitian, but they that are broken and ſick. Sinne is in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they are ſick of it; even as when poyſon is in a man, it makes him ſick; why? becauſe the poyſon is contrary unto him. But ſinne is in the wicked, and they are not ſick of it; as poyſon is in a toad, and the toad is not ſick, becauſe a toad is of that nature which the poyſon is; and therefore he needs not a Phyſitian. Will a Phyſitian go to cure a Toad? ſurely no, he will rather kill it, he will not cure it. So as long as a man is not ſick at the heart of his ſin, Chriſt will rather kill him than cure him. When a man ſayes he is ſick, and yet can ſleep, eat, drink, and work, and look as well as ever he did, feels no pain, nor any thing to trouble him, what need hath this man of a Phyſitian? So when a man lives in ſin, yet never breaks his ſleep for it, but minds his pleaſures, his profits, hath never the more pain nor anguiſh in his ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is ſoule-whole, and heart-whole, what need hath he of a Phyſitian? This is a man whole in his ſins.</p>
                  <p>The wholeneſſe of the heart is called fallow ground, Jerem. 4. 4. for it is like an unbroken field, not tilled nor manured; there can be no harveſt, becauſe the ground doth lie fallow; ſo there can be no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of grace in that man, whoſe heart is fallow and unbroken; and therefore to repent and to break the heart, in Scripture is called the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ones hand to the plough, Luke 9. 62. to plough up the fallow ground of the heart.</p>
                  <p>Brokenneſſe of heart may be conſidered two wayes; Firſt, in relation to wholeneſſe of heart in ſin: ſo brokenneſſe of heart is not a maladie, but an inchoative cure of a deſperate maladie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in relation to wholeneſse of heart from ſinne; and ſo it is a maladie or ſickneſſe, and yet peculiar to one blood alone, namely Gods elect; for though the heart be whole, yet it is broken for its ſinnes: as a man that hath a barbed arrow ſhot into his ſide, and the arrow is pluckt out of the fleſh, yet the wound is not preſently healed; ſo ſinne may be pluckt out of the heart, but the ſcar that was made with plucking it out, is not yet cured. The wounds that are yet under cure, are the plaugues and troubles of conſcience, the ſighs and groanes of a hungring ſoule after grace, the ſtinging poyſon that the blow hath left behind it; theſe, are the wounds.</p>
                  <p>Now the heart is broken three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By the Law: as it breakes the heart of a Thief to heare the ſentence of the Law, that he muſt be hanged for his robbery; ſo it breakes the heart of the ſoule, ſenſible to underſtand the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law: Thou ſhalt not ſin; if thou do, thou ſhalt be damned. If ever the heart come to be ſenſible of this ſentence, Thou
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44191:113"/>
art a damned man, it is impoſſible to ſtand out under it, but it muſt break. Is not my word a hammer that breaks the rocks in pieces? Jer. 23. 29. that is, Is not my word, my Law a hammer? Can any rock heart hold out and not be broken with the blowes of it? Indeed thus far a man may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and yet be a reprobate; for they ſhall be all thus broken in hell, and therefore this breaking is not enough.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the Goſpel; for if ever the heart come to be ſenſible of its blow, it will break all to ſhatters. Rent your hearts for the Lord is gracious, &amp;c. Joel 2. 12. When all the ſhakes of Gods mercy come, they all cry, rent. Indeed the heart cannot ſtand out aginſt them, if it once feel them: Beat thy ſoul upon the Goſpel: if any way under heaven can break it, this is the way.</p>
                  <p>Ariſtotle obſerves, that a hammer may eaſily break a hard ſtone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſoft bed; but if it be laid on an anvil, which will not give way underneath, ſtrike it as hard as you will with the hammer on the top, the anvil underneath props it from breaking, or if it do break, it will not break into ſhatters; for the anvil below helps the ſtone to hang faſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but if you ſmite it againſt a ſoft bed, it breaks it all to ſhatters. So, ſmite thy ſoul upon the Goſpel; preach the law as much as as you will, preach hell and damnation as much as you will, let that be the hammer; but then be ſure lay thy ſoul on the Goſpel, drive it to the Goſpel, ſmite againſt this ſoft bed, and then (if ever) it will break. If you ſtrike a ſtone againſt a hard anvil, though the parts thereof would fall aſunder, yet how can they flie off, when as the hard anvil will not give way? the hard anvil on the one ſide, and the hard hammer on the other ſide, ſtop up its way from falling aſunder. So, ſtrike the ſoul with the blows of Gods wrath as much as you will, and let it be upon the Law; alas whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould the Law open it ſelf that it might break? the Law doth but fear it on the one ſide, and the wrath of God doth terrifie it on the other, yet all this while it is not broken; the ſoule all this while knows not what it ſhall doe: but ſmite it on the Goſpel, and this, with the Law, rents it, and breaks it indeed. So Joel he preached hell and damnation to the people of the Jews, and laid their hearts upon mercie, and then the hammer crie, rent; for he is merciful, &amp;c. he laid them on the ſoft bed of the Goſpel, and then he ſmites them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the heart is broken by the ſkill of the Miniſter in the handling of theſe two, the Law, and the Goſpel: God furniſheth him with ſkill to preſſe the Law home, and gives him underſtanding how to put to the Goſpel, and by this means doth God break up the heart: For alas, though the Law be never ſo good a hammer, and although the Goſpel be never ſo ſoft a bed, yet if the Miniſter lay not the ſoul upon it, the heart will not break; he muſt fetch a full ſtroke with the Law, and he muſt ſet the full power of the Goſpel at the back of the ſoul, or elſe the heart will not break.</p>
                  <p>It is a pretty obſervation of Ariſtotle, Lay (ſaith he) an axe upon a block, and a great and mighty weight upon it, yet it will not enter into the block to cleave it; but if you lift up the axe and fetch a full blow at the block, then it enters preſently. So if the Miniſter have not ſkil to fetch
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44191:114"/>
a dead blow at the heart, alas he may be long enough ere he break it; but let him fetch a full blow at the ſoule, then doth he break it, if ever. I took unto me two ſtaves, ſaith the Prophet, the one I called beauty, the other I called bands, and with theſe I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed the flock, Zach. 11. 7. There is the courſe of a true feeder of the flock, he feeds them with the Law and the Goſpel; he takes his two ſtaves, and he layes about him, till the hearts of his hearers feel him: and this is the way to feed them, and to breake them off from their ſins. Thus you ſee the meanes that God uſeth to bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k your hearts. He healeth the broken in heart. Hence obſerve</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt juſtifies and ſanctifies. For that is the meaning.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe God hath given Chriſt grace to practiſe for the ſakes of the broken in heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore if this be his grace, to heal the broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, certainly he will heal them. The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, &amp;c. He hath ſent me to heal the broken in heart &amp;c. Luke 4. 18. If he be created maſter of this art even for this purpoſe, to heal the broken in heart, he will verily heal them, and none but them. He is not like Hoſander and Hippocrates, whoſe father appointed them both to be Phyſitians; he appointed his ſonne Hippocrates to be a phyſitian of Horſes, yet he proved a phyſitian for men, he appointed Hoſander to be a phyſitian for men, and he proved a phyſitian for horſes. He is not like theſe no, no, he will heal thoſe whom he was appointed to heal: now God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to heal thee that art broken in heart, and therefore without doubt he will do it.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe Chriſt hath undertaken to do it. When a skilfull Phyſitian hath undertaken a cure, he will ſurely do it: indeed ſometimes a good phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may fail, as Trajans phyſitian did, for he died under his hands; on whoſe tomb this was written, Here lies Trajan the Emperour, that may thank his Phyſitian that he died. But if Chriſt undertake it, thou maiſt be ſure of it, for he tels thee that art broken in heart, that he hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, he hath felt thy pulſe already. Thus ſaith the high and holy one whoſe name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him that is of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and broken ſpirit, &amp;c. Iſa. 57. 15. He doth not onely undertake it, but he ſaith he will go viſit his ſick patient; he will come to thy bed-ſide, yea he will come and dwell with thee all the time of thy ſickneſſe; thou ſhalt never want any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he will be ready to help thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not complain and ſay, Oh the Phyſitian is too far off, he will not come at me. I dwell in the high places indeed, ſaith God, but yet I will come and dwell with thee that art of an humble ſpirit. Thou needeſt not fear, ſaying, Will a man cure his enemies? I have been an enemy to Gods glory, and will he yet cure me? yea, ſaith Chriſt, if thou be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in heart, he will bind thee up.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe this is Chriſts charge, and he will look to his own cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; To this man will I look, even to him that is of a broken heart, Iſa. 66. 2. Mark, I will look to him, I will tend him and keep him. Neither needeſt thou fear thine own poverty, becauſe thou haſt not a Fee to give him; for thou maieſt come to him by way of begging, he will look to thee for nothing; For, to him will I look that is poor, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, none but the broken in heart will take Phyſick of Chriſt. Now
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44191:114"/>
this is a Phyſitians deſire, that his Patient would caſt himſelf upon him; if he will not, the Phyſitian hath no deſire to meddle with him. Now none but the broken in heart will take ſuch Phyſick as Chriſt gives, and therefore he ſaith, To him will I look that is of a broken heart, and trembles at my words, Eſai. 66. 2. When I bid him take ſuch a purge ſaith God, he trembles, and he takes it. I bid him take ſuch a bitter Potion, or ſuch an untoothſome vomit, to feare him from ſinne; he trembles at my word, and he dares not but off with it: But when a ſoul doth not tremble, then the Phyſitian may ſay, let him blood; but he cares not for being let bloud; he cares not for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives, he cares not for his advice and counſell, he trembles not at his word; Chriſt will never come at ſuch a one, Chriſt bids thee follow ſuch a diet as to watch, to pray, to faſt, to mourne, &amp;c. to keep in and to take heed to catechizing, grow not cold by being lukewarm, &amp;c. If thou tremble at his word, well, if not, but that thou wilt go on in thy ſinnes, and be damned for ever, then thank thine own wilfulneſſe. But if thou beeſt broken in heart. Chriſt will aſſuredly heal thee. Suppoſe thou ſhouldeſt come unto Chriſt, be his phyſick never ſoveraign, and thou ſhouldeſt take it: yet if thy heart be againſt it, the phyſick cannot work. Imagination or fancy is a great thing in the good or ill ſucceſſe of phyſick. If thou carpe at his precepts, as too ſtrict, and except againſt his word as if he had an ounce of wormwood too much in it; If thy imaginations thus run againſt the phyſick, Chriſts phyſick will never cure thee; why ſo? thou art not broken in heart, to tremble at his word; he will help thee without faile; but then thou muſt tremble at his word, and take his directions, though he preſcribe thee to eat thine own dung, and drink thine own piſſe; take it I ſay what ever it be, and I will warrant thee health.</p>
                  <p>But thou wilt reply, I have but a little faith.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, ſo had Peter; O thou of little faith wherefore didſt thou doubt? ſaith our Saviour, Matth. 14. 13. There is a little faith, and there is a great faith; O woman great is thy faith, Matth. 15. 28. whether it be a little faith or a great faith, ſo it be true ſaving juſtifying faith, it is good phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and it will aſſuredly cure thee. It is not the quantity of faith that ſaves a man, but the quality of faith. True it is, a great quantity of faith, becauſe it hath more of the quality, more of the truth, it heals more ſtrongly and more ſteadily; But faith whether it be great or ſmall, ſo it be true, that doth the deed. Shall the Patient doubt of his recovery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſmall meaſure of phyſick that the Phyſitian gives him, the Phyſitian gives but a dram of ſuch a powder, but perhaps the Patient would have a pound, when as it may be the ſtate of his body will not bear it. The Phyſitian obſervs his meaſures in preſcribing ſo many oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this, ſo many ſcruples of that; therelies his skil in giving the true meaſure, ſo there is the true meaſure of faith, Rom 12. 3. one man hath ſo much, and another man hath not ſo much faith. Abraham had more faith than Lot; the reaſon is, becauſe the ſtate of Lots ſoul would not bear ſo much as Abrahams. It is one of Hippocrates Aphoriſmes, Not too much at once.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:44191:115"/>A Phyſitian finds it dangerous ſometime to empty the body at once, or to fill it all at once, or to heat it, or to coole it all at once; it is the ſafeſt way to give by little and little; ſo God by little and little deals with thee; now he gives thee ſome faith, and then a little more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>O but my faith is ſmothered; how then can I expect to be healed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>I anſwer, a man is ſick, and Violets will cure him; now the Phyſitian makes a compound confection, ſo that the Violets doe not appeare, but onely in oyle; Now, will the Patient thus argue, I cannot ſee one leaf of a Violet, no nor yet ſo much as colour, therefore I will none of it, it wil not heale me? So God gives many a ſoul unguentum fidei, an oyle of faith, now it may be the ſoul cannot ſee one jot of faith in himſelfe, yet he ſhal be cured, becauſe there is faith in a confection, a mixed faith though there be none in manifeſtation. Thou weepeſt, mourneſt, doubteſt, and complaineſt, and thou canſt not beleeve as thou ſayeſt; yet thou never giveſt over crying, my God my God; well, here is faith in a confection, but it may be it is ſo compounded with other ingredients that thou canſt not perceive it; for you muſt know that there is faith ſo great it breakes out into a flame, and there is faith which is ſo ſmal that it does but ſmoke out a little; now whether thy faith be an inflamed faith or a ſmoking faith, be of good comfort, thou ſhalt be healed. The bruiſed Reed ſhall not be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, Mat. 12. 28.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>I anſwer, as thy heart may be broken, and yet be a right heart; ſo thy faith may be broken, and yet be a true faith: For it is ſometimes bound up in the whole, ſometimes it is broken, and all to pieces. A man that is broken in heart, although he have no faith bound up together in one act, yet he hath it broken in ſunder; never a part is miſſing, though no part cloſing one with another. The one whole act of faith is this, I beleive that God is my God in Chriſt. Indeed it may be thou haſt not this faith in the whole, but if thou beeſt broken in heart, thou haſt this whole broken in pieces.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thou beleeveſt that God is a God, there is one piece.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou beleeveſt that whomſoever God is a God unto, it is only in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou beleeveſt that he that truly repents, may ſay that God is his God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, thou believeſt that repentance is a true hatred of ſin as it is ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, thou beleeveſt, and thy conſcience tels thee it is ſo indeed that thou hateſt ſinne, not only as it is able to damne thee, but alſo as it is ſin, and diſhonourable to God; now theſe are the parts of faith in the whole. Thou haſt all the parts of the whole, though thou haſt not theſe parts in the whole. Well then, thou haſt all the parts of true faith; as thou c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All the parts and the whole doe not differ really, ſayes the Philoſopher; he that hath three groats, cannot complain he wants a ſhilling; he that hath ruffe and ſtock and ſtring, can he be farre to ſeek for a band? ſo then if thou have faith in the parts on this faſhion, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:44191:115"/>
thou haſt faith in the whole, though it appeare not yet to be whole.</p>
                  <p>Ariſtotle asketh this queſtion, whether the parts be before the whole or no; as for example, whether a man or a finger be firſt. I will not ſtand here to determine this queſtion; but this is certain, that the whole is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thing, ſpoken in relation to its parts, and it is like the relation begins in the whole; for firſt, we ſay that a whole is that which conſiſts of parts, and then the parts are they that make up the whole, and therefore if thou verily beleeveſt in part, thou verily beleeveſt indeed. Thus Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid was a beleever in part, my very ſoul ſaith he is conſumed with grief, Pſal. 31. 9. my ſtrength faileth me becauſe of mine iniquity, &amp;c. verſe 10.

Though the fruit in the womb be not yet quickened with a reaſonable ſoule, yet it growes in the womb, feeds in the womb, and yet it hath no other life in it than may be in a beaſt; yet becauſe it is in fieri a man, the Mother complains not, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oh I am afraid I have a beaſt in my womb; no, ſhe will wait Gods leiſure to quicken it; it is ſecure enough from being a beaſt; for it hath ſuch diſpoſitions as will not long be without the ſoul of a man in the ſame, though as yet there be nothing in it, but what may be in a beaſt; But yet the Mother is ſecured becauſe ſhe is perſwaded ſhe bears a babe in her womb. So many poor ſouls are too haſty to cenſure themſelves; for grant thou haſt no faith as yet, yet if thou beeſt broken in heart, thou art about to have faith; only let the word have his full work on thee, unto which thou muſt diligently attend, and then fides in fieri will be quickly fides in facto eſſe. Thus the blind man in the Goſpell was about to beleeve before he believed; he had a time of a fieri of faith; he was no beleever at this time; for he had as yet no faith; neither was he an unbeleever; for he was about to beleeve. Doſt thou believe on the Son of God? ſaith Chriſt, John 9. 35. he anſwered, who is he Lord that I might beleeve on him? verſe 39. Beleeve? yea that I would with all my heart, who is he, and where is he that I might beleeve? I have been hated for his names ſake, I have been caſt out of the Synagogue for his ſake; Lord thou knoweſt I would beleeve on him; but who is he and where is he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

him. Then Chriſt told him, I am he that now talketh with thee; and then he beleeved; and Saint Chryſoſtome obſerves that this blind man was about to beleeve, before he did deſire it in his ſoul; and ſo it may be it is now with thee; doſt thou beleeve in Chriſt? Who is he? ſayeſt thou, where ſhall I find that Chriſt is in me that I may beleeve in him? I weep and hunger, and I thirſt after Chriſt; but who and where is he? I have ſought him in the word; but I find him not; I have ſought him in prayer and in all other his ordinances; but I find him not; I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve with all my heart if I could find him. Thus the ſoul may be about to beleeve, though it doe not already beleeve; haſt thou gotten this ſame about to beleeve? be not thou diſmayed, the plaiſter is come; and it will heal thee.</p>
                  <p>Conceive theſe words aright I beſeech you; a ſpeech is not as it is taken, I mean only the broken in heart; for otherwiſe a man may be about to beleeve, yet never beleeve; about to be healed of his ſins, yet never be healed. Even like the wretch that Zophar ſpeakes of, who ſhall be about to fill his belly, and not be able to fill it Job 20. 23.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold about to be; Firſt, either ſuch a thing as is about to be, and that is the nature of it, and it will never be otherwiſe; but ſtill only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to be. Secondly, or elſe ſuch a thing as is about to be, and that is the progreſſe of it, and not to reſt there, but at the laſt to be indeed.</p>
                  <p>Feare you then, all you that are vain, and as yet in your ſins; you are about to beleeve, and that is the nature of your faith; it is only about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; like the officers of the next year, who are about to be officers and yet are not. Beloved, never look to be healed, if you be not broken in heart; It may be thou art broken from some of thy ſins; but if thou be not broken from them all, it is nothing; and thou canſt not be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Alas thou maiſt be broken in ſome ſence, and yet never be healed. There is a double breaking, ſaith Ariſtotle, either breaking into great parts, as wood is broken into logs; or breaking into ſmall parts, as a ſtone is broken into powder; it may be thy ſtony heart is broken, but it is only into leſſer ſtones, thou art fallen from greater ſins to leſſer, from bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and company keeping, to drinking and ſipping; from playing and gaming on the Sabbath, to talking of worldly affairs on the Sabbath, from praying not at all, to pray coldly. Alas, alas thou haſt a hard heart ſtill; when a great ſtone is broken into leſſer ſtones, the leſſer ſtone is as hard as a great ſtone; thy heart muſt be broken to powder, if ever God heale thee.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe Phyſick will never cure a man, unleſſe it may enter and run into the veines; and when it is entred into the body, and diffuſed up and down through all the diſeaſed parts thereof, then it cures; now if thy heart be not broken, the Phyſick cannot enter; give a purgation to a ſtone, it may moyſten the outſide, but it cannot ſoak in, to ſoften the ſtone; why? becauſe the ſtone is cloſe, but if the ſtone were broken into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then it would ſoak even into the heart of the ſtone.</p>
                  <p>God opened the heart of Lydia, and then the word entred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acts 16. 14. Brethren, you have been under the hands of Chriſts Phyſitians ever ſince you were born; but where is the heart that is broken? all the Phyſick is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:44191:116"/>
loſt the word hath no entrance, it hath ſkinned the wound; ſeared the outſide indeed; but the hardneſſe of the heart is not cured. How long have you been under Phyſick for the curing of your earthlineſſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? how long have you lion by it for your anger and malice, &amp;c under the means, yet never the neerer? whoſe hearts are broken? I fear the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick doth not ſoake, it comes no neerer than the outſide. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, Pſal. 34. 18. why? becauſe their hearts are open and broken; and Chriſt and his word comes neer, yea ſo neere that it toucheth them to the quick. But if ye be not broken in heart, no Balme, no Phyſick can come neare enough to cure you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou canſt never be cured, unleſſe Chriſt cure thee; now Chriſt will never take thee in hand till thou be broken in heart. A Phyſitian wil not meddle with a deſperate cure, ſuch a one who is not capable of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. Let not any Phyſitian ſaith Hippocrates ſet upon a fruitleſſe cure. Now it is fruitleſſe to give thee any Phyſick, it is fruitleſs to poure grace into thee, or to vouchſafe pardon to thee; this Phyſick will never heal thee ſo long as thou art not broken in heart; and therefore Chriſt ſcorns to take thee in hand. True it is if thou wert broken in heart, God would not deſpiſe thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the ſacrifice of God is a broken ſpirit; ſo ſaith the Pſalmiſt, A broken and a contrite heart O God ſhalt thou not deſpiſe, Pſal. 51. 17. ſo then if thy heart be not yet broken, it is yet incurable. Indeed if we conſider Chriſts abſolute power, no heart is incurable; for he can heal it what ever it bee, for all is at his command. But God doth not go accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his abſolute power, but according to his expreſſion and meaning of, and in his word; now the method that God ſets down in his word; is thus; firſt the heart muſt be broken, and then it muſt, or may be healed; ſo then ſo long as thou art not broken in heart, thou art incurable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe Chriſt ſhould begin to heal thee, thou being not broken in heart, wilt alwayes be taking off the plaiſter before thou be cured; ſometimes God terrifies thee with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aw, and then thou pulleſt off that plaiſter; Even like unto a dainty Dame, who having taken phyſick, and feeling it begin to wamble in her ſtomack, puts a feather in her throat to cauſe her to vomit it up, before it have its full working. And thus many take hopes and comforts and promiſes before the ſet time.</p>
                  <p>In ſome phyſick, a quarter of an houres difference may coſt one his life; when a man is to be cut of the ſtone, and he be bound hand and foot, yet if he doe but ſtir or ſtruggle before the Chirurgion hath quite done with him, it is a thouſand to one but he dies for it; ſo they in the ſecond Pſalme had a ſtone in the heart; Chriſt would have cut them for the ſtone, but they would not be bound, they would not endure their cutting, no let us break his bonds aſunder, &amp; caſt away his cords from us, Pſ. 2. 3. men cannot be ſmitten at a Sermon, but oh they muſt preſently have comfort; as ſoon as once the phyſick begins to make the head to ake, and the ſtomack to be ſick, and the man to be exceeding ill, it is a ſigne that the phyſick doth now begin to work; but if this man ſhould deviſe how to vomit it up, or to clyſter it out, he looſeth all the benefit of the phyſick; keep this plaiſter on as long as thou canſt, if ever thou mean to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. If the wound be throughly whole, the plaiſter will fall away of it
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:44191:117"/>
ſelf. Should a man have never ſo good a plaiſter and ſhould every foot be taking it off, it would never do him any good. If God have ſhot an arrow into thy heart, bind the plaiſter to the ſore, and let it there reſt till the malignity of the ſore and venom of the wound be put out. But if thou be not broken in heart, it is in vain to miniſter or to ſay any thing unto thee, becauſe thou wilt not abide the phyſick within thee, nor ſuffer the gripes that thou muſt ſuffer if ever thou be healed. And therefore all you that are broken in heart, in any meaſure or manner, be of good cheer, the Lord will heal you; he healeth the broken in heart.</p>
                  <p>See here theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the ſeaſonableneſſe of it, when it is a ſeaſonable time to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that is when the heart is in need, and it is in need when it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; as a man is in need of meat, when he is hungry; ſo a man is in need of healing, when he is broken in heart: God will give thee that which thou needeſt, and that in due ſeaſon ſayes Auguſtine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In an acceptable time have I heard thee, I ſaiah 49. 8. God looks when it will be moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to give grace, and then he gives it; therefore wait, never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Gods delaying hand; if he do, it is but for a better ſeaſon; I have need of healing already ſayeſt thou; but if God do not yet heal thee, then thou muſt know it is not yet ſeaſonable, and the more need thou art in, the better welcome is help when it cometh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when it is moſt profitable for thee; when he is broken in heart, it will do him good to be healed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if God ſhould heale thee before, it would hurt thee; when the Corroſive hath wrought out his work, then it is good to have a Cordial; now the Cordial will help the man; but if the Phyſitian ſhould give him a Cordial firſt, it would helpe the diſeaſe, and endamage the man. Comfortable Cordials, before the time, have been the damnation of many ſoules. Oh thou wouldeſt faine have comfort for thy ſoul; what? before the Corroſive hath eaten out the ſin? thou wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thine own poyſon; If God let thee wait for thy healing, underſtand that he doth it for thy good; only let his Corroſives work their full courſe, and then he will heal thee. Wait on the Lord ſaith David, Pſal. 27. 14. give not over waiting, how long ſo ever it be, and he will heal thee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly when it ſhall be beſt for thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in puncto, even juſt in the very nick of thy brokenneſse in heart will his healing come. It is well obſerved that the word in the originall is put in the participle, indifferent to any time, whether paſt, preſent, or to come, he doth not ſet down any time, becauſe he will doe it punctually, juſt at the pinch, when thou art broken in heart; Oh then if thou be not yet healed, know then that thou art not yet come to this punctum; but when thou art come to it, then thou ſhalt be healed. What if thou doſt lie under the heavy and frowning hand of God? doe not ſhake it off, but kiſſe that rod, and humble thy ſelf the more: Sometims God lets a broken heart ſhake off his hand a little to ſoon, ſometimes again he will not let them. David would faine have ſhaken it off; but he could not; God would not let him. Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, ſaith he, &amp;c, Pſal. 38. 1, 2. How did he know that Gods arrows ſtuck in him faſt? It ſeemes that he had been pulling at them; he would faine have had them out, he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44191:117"/>
would have been comforted all on the ſuddaine, but he could not; God would not let him. Lord rebuke me not (ſayes he) in thine indignation, &amp;c. Rebuke me as much as thou wilt, but let it not be in thine indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; chaſten me as much as thou wilt, but let it not be in thy heavy diſpleaſure. Oh pluck ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> thine arrowes, take off thy hand; I pluck at them, but they ſtick faſt; I ſhake and rub to get off thy hand, but it preſſeth me ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>re that I cannot get it off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beloved, it is neceſſary that ſome while Gods own people ſhould bleed under Gods wrath; for by this meanes the corruption of ſin is purged out. Thus you ſee in ſome God will not let them ſhake off his hand; others, if they will needs have it off, they ſhall, that they may afterwards ſee their own folly. Thus many a poor child of God, in conflict of conſcience and ſenſe of Gods wrathful diſpleaſure, ſcrapes comfort too ſoon, and God lets them take it before he gives it: he would have had them firſt throughly cured, but they were loth to be humbling their ſouls ſo long: but ſee the event of it, the ſore is only skinned over, and at the laſt the wound it breaks forth a freſh, and then it may be they lie ſeven years rogether and get no comfort, yea ſometimes twenty yeares, yea, I have known ſome that have lived ſo thirty years. Now they may thank their own folly; for if they would have been ruled by Chriſt, and been humbled altogether at the firſt, they might have eſcaped this ſcouring; but now they repent it every veine in their hearts, and can hardly claw it off untill death. I call theſe the children of God, becauſe they have layen a long while under Gods hand, and yet ſtill cry after God, it is a ſigne they are his children; for Gods children are many times in affliction a long while; ſee it in Job, &amp;c. Neither can I beleeve but that all thoſe that lie ſundry years on this faſhion ſtill crying after God; are the children of God; or at the leaſt, it is ſo to be hoped: for if they were reprobates, and had ſhaken off Gods hand, pluckt out his arrows, and ſcraped after comfort, he would either let them fall into a perpetuall fools<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paradiſe of preſumption or ſecurity, or elſe let them moulder away in deſpaire, not caring to ſeek after God in the meanes at all. And therefore, beloved, pluck not out Gods ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes too ſoon: I ſpeak not to all, for ſome will not pluck them out when they ſhould; but I ſpeak to all ſuch as are over haſtie for to get Cordials before the Corroſive have had his full working<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If men be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little humbled, reformed, or wrought upon, preſently they think they be in very good caſe: the very Heathen could ſay, we are commonly deceived with ſeeming vertue and grace; and hence it is that wicked men are humbled by halves, They think they are throughly humbled, when their hearts are broken by halves; they think they are broken in heart. And as a ſtick that is half in the water, and half above the water, ſeems to be broken or bent in the midſt; ſo theſe men when they are half in their ſinnes, and half out, ſeem to themſelves to be broken hearted: But if the ſtick were either all in the water, or all out, it would appear as it is: it ſeems to be broken, when as it is not: ſo, many being half in their ſinnes, and half out, ſeem to be broken-hearted, when indeed they are not.</p>
                  <p>But (beloved) before I can give you the healing here in this text, it
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44191:118"/>
is good reaſon that I examine you whether you be broken in heart, or no. Prognoſtica praecedunt Therapeuticen, ſayes Argaſtus; Prognoſtiques, and telling the ſignes and ſymptomes of the diſeaſe, are before the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the diſeaſe. When we believe a thing to be ſo, we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb to ſay, 'tis a ſigne' tis ſo. Doeſt thou ſay thou art broken in heart? 'Tis a ſigne 'ris ſo, they carriage is ſo mortified; A ſigne 'tis ſo, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is ſo heavenly; A ſign 'tis ſo, thy companions ſo holy, &amp;c. If a man cannot caſt thy water on this faſhion, thou art not broken in heart. And therefore Signa tibi dicam, &amp;c. I will help the ſigns and ſymptomes of a broken heart, that ſo thou mayeſt examine thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The ſignes I reduce to theſe two heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A breaking from ſin, as a rotten member is broken from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſo that the heart is then ſaid to be broken indeed, when it is broken off from ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a breaking in it ſelf, ſo that the heart is ſaid to be broken when it is broken with ſorrow and ſelf-deniall, ſo that nothing can peice it up again, but the favour of God. Theſe two make up a broken heart, and therefore they ſhall be the heads of examination.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, doe thy ſins go thick away from thee? when the cold is once broken we uſe to ſay, now it is going away, not in the rheume as before, but in thick fleam. If thou be broken in heart, then thy pride, thy earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thy ſelfe-love, thy deadneſſe to good duties, and all thy ſins go thick from thee. It may be thou haſt ſome poares in thy heart, and thy ſins fall away from thee in the rheume, but if they go not away from thee in thick fleame, the cold of thy frozen heart is not yet broken. The ſins of Zaccheus were injuſtice and oppreſſion, &amp;c. but as ſoon as ever he was broken in heart, theſe ſins went away thick from him, not dropping as if he were loth they ſhould part, but in great flakes, Zaccheus ſtood (ſays the text) and ſaid unto the Lord, behold half of my goods I give to the poor, &amp;c. Luke 19. 8. ſee how his ſins went away; every word voids thick fleam.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſtood; before he clymed and gazed after Chriſt, but being broken in heart, he ſtood ready preſt to doe whatſoever Chriſt would command him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he ſaid unto Chriſt; before Chriſt might have ſaid unto him what he would; what cared he? but now that he is broken in heart, here is hardly a word that Chriſt ſaid unto him of any ſuch matter, yet he ſaid to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Behold, before his behold was carnall, he did what he did to be ſeen of men, if ever he gave ought, he loved that men ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, but now all his care was that Chriſt would behold it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I give. Before he thought, I will give was enough, I will give when I dy, I will build hoſpitals when I am dead; but now that he is broken in heart, he gives it forthwith.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the halfe of my goods; before he counted a penny o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a farthing to a poor body, a great matter, a great dole, if given now and then; but now that he is broken in heart, the halfe and not only of the ſuperfluity, but alſo of his very ſubstance and goods, as it is in the originall, I give to the poor, not as men commonly doe, light come, light go; it may be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44191:118"/>
they feaſt their rich neighbours, but he gives halfe his ſubſtance to the poor Saints of God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, And if I have taken any thing wrongfully, though it were not much; If I have taken any thing, though not from the rich and great ones, but from any, rich or poor, young or old, ſtranger or not ſtranger, no matter who; if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation, not only againſt Law, where the Law binds me to reſtitution, but if I have taken any thing by forged cavillation, though the Law will boulſter me out, yet I reſtore him; he did not ſay, I give him, as many wil do, calling that which ſhould properly be called reſtitution for wrong, a gift, I give, ſay they; he ſayes not ſo; but he caſteth off the thought of a gift, and doth what he doth by way of reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, If I have taken anything; before he could ſwallow down the known wrongs that he did; but now that he is broken in heart, he makes amends for the wrongs which peradventure he did not, to be ſure, If I have taken, I reſtore, his reſtitution goes abſolute; although his wrongs go upon ifs, I reſtore him ſaies he; and that not nigardly or ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or no more than needs muſt, but four-fold. Thus he reaſons; now he is broken in heart; his ſins go thick away from him.</p>
                  <p>The text but even now called him little Zaccheus, before he had ſeen Chriſt; merito adhuc puſillus quia nondum viderat Chriſtum; Juſtly might he be ſaid to be little Zacheus, becauſe then he had not ſeen Chriſt; but as ſoon as ever he had ſeen Chriſt whom he had wronged by theſe wrongs; as ſoon as ever he was broken in heart, he became a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, his ſins ran thick away from him. As ſoon as the boyle is broken, out comes the matter; As ſoon as the vein is broken, out comes the bloud, true it is a drop of blood may come though the vein be not broken; if the finger be but rac'd a few drops may come, but if the vein be once broken, out comes the blood thick and threefold; If thou doſt but crop off thy ſins now and then, thy heart was never broken; for if thou waſt once bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in heart, thy reformation would come apace, thy repentance and thy amendment would come thick and threefold; but if we preach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and yet ſee but thin reformation in thee, as a ſigh or ſo, thou waſt never yet broken in heart: if thy heart be yet full of thy ſelfe-love, full of thy pride, luſts, &amp;c. if thy affections be yet full of earthly deſires, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, vain hopes, carnall fears; if thy back be yet full of thy gariſh and humerous apparell, thy heart is not yet broken; why? becauſe the filthy matter runs not out.</p>
                  <p>Zaccheus when he was broken in heart, his corruptions ran out apace; both his unreadineſſe to good duties, and his deadneſſe and dulneſſe to holy duties: Chriſt need not ſay much unto him, for he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, his deſire of the credit of the world ranne out, for he gave the halfe of his goods to the poore, his backwardneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying ranne out, for he made preſent diſpatch, I give, his very ſecret unknowne iniquities ran out, if I have taken, &amp;c. All his ſins ran thick away from him. Why? becauſe a broken heart can hold no ſin, this is the firſt ſigne of a broken heart from ſin, if it be broken from its ſinful courſe.</p>

Thou canſt not be croſt a little but preſently thou art wild with choller and anger; thy fleſh and blood cannot endure it, and doſt thou yet ſay that thou art broken in heart? no, no, thou waſt born a wild Aſſe Colt, and ſo thou art ſtill. Thou wert born a wild olive, and ſo thou art ſtill. Thou waſt never yet broken in heart, never yet broken from ſin; if thou wert broken from thy wildneſſe, then every exhortation would tame thee; then thou wouldſt be glad to be reproved, and controuled by the word; Thou wouldeſt leap at every commandement, were it never ſo ſtrict; But if thou count it preciſeneſſe and too much ſtrictneſſe to be holy and zealous, I ſay thou art yet but a wild colt. Oh my brethren we have many amongſt us who are like Iſhmael, who was a wild man, Gen. 16. many wild men, who pray wildly, and think wildly, and hear wildly; their hearts are wild gadding hearts, while the word is preachiug, they follow their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
                  <p>Dareſt thou venture upon any ſin againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou live in it till thou art a wicked Bedlam? The Pſalmiſt brings all ſuch in as if they were mad Bedlams, ſaying; why do the heathen ſo furiouſly rage, &amp;c. Chriſt would have bound them, but they forſooth were too wild; they would not be bound, but ſay they let us break his bonds, and fling off his cords: they will not be bound to ſuch ſtrictneſſe: dareſt thou ſwear and lie and covet, and be drunk? &amp;c. alas man thou art in a mad vaine. Dareſt thou break the ſabbath, live in thy luſts, &amp;c. a fury hath taken thee, thou art a mad-man, God muſt break that wilde heart of thine, elſe thou canſt not be tamed, it may be thou art bridled from ſin, but doſt thou bridle thy ſelfe, if not, thou art wild for all the bridling thou haſt: you never ſaw a horſe bridle himſelf, no, no, it is wild, peradventure thou doſt bridle thy ſelfe when thou art not much tempted;

but if thou beeſt broken in heart, thou wilt refrain all provocations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. I will keep my mouth, &amp;c.

The wild beaſts are tame enough till a prey comes before them, and ſo thou maiſt be tame when temptations are down; but art thou tame when a temptation is before thee. This is a ſecond ſign of brokenneſſe of heart, if thou be broken from thy wildneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if thou be broken in heart, then thou art broken from thy pride, and thou wilt ſtoop to Gods word in all things. A broken heart is an humble heart, I dwell with him, ſaith God, Iſaiah 37. 15. p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is wicked pride indeed, when thou ſeekeſt thy ſelfe more than God. I tell thee, the word hath not broken the heart, untill it hath broken the neck of this pride of thine; never tell me that thou art not proud in thy apparell; if a ſervant goe never ſo meanly in apparell, yet he is proud if he obey not all his Maſters lawfull and good comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; never tell me thou boweſt to God or thou kneeleſt in prayer to God; cluck and crouch, bow and bend thou never ſo much, yet thou art proud, if every corruption of thine will not yield to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God; thou art not broken in heart; for if thou wert broken in heart, thou wouldeſt ſtoop to all Gods commandements. Doſt thou mock at preaching, &amp;c. Tuſh, thou wilt not be ſo preciſe, If

ever thou be one of his, thou wilt not only obey him, but alſo be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in all thy obedience; nay if thou be broken in heart, thou wilt not only ſtoop to every commandment of God, but alſo count it thine honour and glory, though it be the meaneſt office in his ſervice. Thou art my glory ſayes David, David that was broken from his pride, counted it his glory to obey God, his glory to ſerve God, yea his glory to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for his ſake. Thou art not broken in heart till thou count it thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to ſerve God. We uſe to ſay ſuch a ones excellency is in his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or wit, &amp;c. but he is too preciſe and too holy, as if it were not a mans excellency to be pure and zealous, and to ſerve God: But I tell thee if thou count it not thine honour to be forward for God and to be nickna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for Chriſt, thine excellency to lie in this, that thou art godly and heavenly, thou art a proud fool; when John Huſſe was to write upon the Epiſtle of Saint James, he counted it ſuch an high office of dignity that he was confounded at his own indignity, ſaying unto God, Hei mihi lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare te contremiſco; he counted it ſuch an honour to doe any thing for God, that he was aſhamed at his own vileneſſe. O my brethren God is called the excellency of Jacob; it was not their valour nor wiſedome, but this was their excellency, that God was their God; thy riches are proud riches if thy excellency lie in them more than in God; if thou doſt not go about every commandment as thine excellency, thy obedience is proud. This is a third ſigne of a heart broken from ſin, if it be broken from its pride.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the end of the former chapter the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the ſpeciall ſin of Idol-ſhepheards who followed their own pleaſures and profits, not regarding their flock. Now he reproves the generall ſin of ſecurity in the people, and namely in this, that whereas the righteous periſh, yet no man layeth it to heart, and mercifull men are taken away, none conſidering &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This verſe is a complaint of the Prophet touching the people in generall, for that they conſidered not the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon them in taking away the righteous from among them.</p>
                  <p>In the words themſelves we are to conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the work of the Lord, viz. the righteous periſheth and mercifull men are taken away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:44191:122"/>Secondly, the peoples ſin in not conſidering it, not regarding this work of the Lord, which is, that the righteous may be delivered from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to come.</p>
                  <p>By righteous is here meant not ſuch as are legally righteous by the works of the law; for ſo no man is righteous, but by righteous is here meant ſuch as are Evangelically righteous, by the righteouſneſſe of faith in the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Periſheth, that is, from the earth, for otherwiſe the righteous periſh not.</p>
                  <p>No man conſidering, that is, no man lamenting, mourning, or grieving for the loſs of them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing then to bee conſidered, is from the firſt part; and it is plain out of the words of the text, That all men muſt dye; even the moſt holy and moſt righteous; for they are all ſubject to the ſtroak of bodily death as well as the wicked. There is no remembrance ſaith Solomon, of the wiſe more than of the fool; and how dyeth the wiſe man? even as the fool, Eccleſ 2. 16. ſo zachar. 1. 5. Your fathers where are they? and the Prophets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o they live for ever? ſo that we ſce Prophets and fathers dye as well as other men; yea thoſe Worthies recorded in the Scripture, Noah, Abraham, David, &amp;c. they are all gone the ſame way, they are all dead.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon is, becauſe it is appointed unto all men once to dye, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that comes the judgement, Heb. 9. 27. God hath thus decreed it, and therefore it muſt be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe all men and women are of the duſt; and therefore muſt return to the duſt again; duſt thou art, ſaith God, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return, Gen. 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe, all have ſinned, even the moſt righteous man; now the wages of ſin is death, Rom. 6. 23. The moſt righteous man muſt dye.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly becauſe, as death came into the world by ſinne, Romans 5. 12. ſo ſinne muſt goe out of the world by death; and therefore it is needfull that the righteous dye, that ſo they may be freed from ſin.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may object and ſay, Hath not Chriſt aboliſhed death? why then do the righteous dy?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer he hath aboliſhed death; as he hath aboliſhed ſin; now he hath not taken ſin quite away from us, for we ſee it doth ſtill remain in us; neither hath he quite aboliſhed death from the righteous, for we ſee they all dye; but he aboliſhed the dominion of ſin, ſo that it doth no longer reign in us; and ſo he hath taken away the dominion of death, ſo that it doth not rage as a Tyrant over us, ſo that it is not hurtfull unto us as a puniſhment, but as a means to convey us into a better life. Chriſt hath taken away the ſting both of ſin and death; though not the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves away from us; yet he will one day free us from them both; ſo then the righteous muſt ſuffer death as well as the wicked, though not in the ſame kind.</p>
                  <p>Let no man then look to be exempted from death for his righteouſneſſe, nor
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44191:122"/>
from any outward miſeries that may befall the ſons of Adam; nay if we are the ſervants of Chriſt, we muſt look for a greater ſhare in theſe than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; greater croſſes, greater afflictions, greater ſickneſſe and harder pangs of death do oft befall the righteous, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>eir bones full of marrow, as Job ſpeaks; they commonly have little ſickneſſe, and an eaſie death; but the godly do ordinarily undergo greater pangs; let none therefore think that for his righteouſneſſe he ſhall be free.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider we here how few amongst us have learned this Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metique, namely to number our dayes, and they are but ſhort, even a ſpan long; who is there almoſt that thinks on death? who prepares himſelf for it? and yet all, even the moſt righteous muſt die; for God hath placed that fiery blade of death at the entrance into the Paridiſe of heaven, ſo that none can enter before they taſt of death, and all muſt taſte of it, yea the moſt righteous are not exempted from the ſtroak of death. This then ſhould teach us to labour to draw our hearts from the love of this preſent life; and what can better perſwade us and wean us from the love of this world, than a due conſideration of death? we know we muſt all die, and therefore we ſhould prepare our ſelves for it. If any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon amongſt us knew that this night muſt be his laſt night, and that now he had no longer to live, would not this amaze him, and make him bethink himſelf, and to prepare for death? If rich covetous men which ſpend the whole courſe of their life in providing for the things of this life, did truely conſider of death, and that their end draweth nigh, would they doe as they do, when this life and all the things of this life, and all our joyes and pleaſures of this world ſhall ſhortly have an end? for when death comes, they ſhall all be taken from us, or rather we from them. Oh how excellent a thing is it then for us to be drawn from the things of this life, unto a due conſideration of death, and of thoſe heavenly Joyes and happineſſe to come! Oh you that look for theſe things, what manner of men ought you to be in holy life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſeeing we all muſt die, and this preſent life muſt come to an end, this ſhould teach us to prepare our ſelves for a better life; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for a ſurer building, a better eſtate which ſhall never periſh. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers who were but heathen men, could meditate on death, ſetting it always before their eyes. But this is not enough for us that are Chriſtians; we cannot truly prepare our ſelves for it unleſſe we firſt build a ſurer foundation in providing for a better life, which ſhall never have an end; and this no heathen or wicked man can ever do. Oh how wofull would that meſſage be unto a wicked man, that was brought unto good King Hezekiah, Come, ſet thy houſe in order, for thou muſt die, and not live; and why ſhould it be terrible unto him? ſurely becauſe he hath no hope of a better life, he hath not provided for a better habitation. Conſider then with what comfort thou couldeſt entertain this meſſage; with wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:44191:123"/>
comfort canſt thou meet with death? for he is no Chriſtian that cannot in ſome meaſure willingly meet with death, for by it we pas unto a better life: for as this our brother ſpake often, he that would have comfort in death, muſt look beyond death; he muſt not fix his eyes on the terrors of death, but he muſt look beyond, to that glorious inheritance, to which we are paſſing through death, and there ſhall he behold his Saviour put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth his hand ready to receive him; there ſhall he ſee the bleſſed Saints and Angels, whoſe company he ſhall enjoy, beſides an infinite heap of Joyes and happineſſe that is prepared for him alſo. O my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, nothing will make us willingly to entertain the meſſage of death, but only the comforts of the life to come. Oh let us labour then for theſe comforts, that ſo we may be provided againſt death; were it not a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe for a man who being a tennant at will, and ſhortly to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of his houſe, never to take care for another until he is caſt out of doors? Beloved we are all tennants at will, and we are very ſhortly to be caſt out of our dwelling houſes of clay, and ſhall we not provide for a ſurer habitation? Death is at hand, and our life muſt ſhortly have an end; let us therefore labour to be aſſured of a better life, when this is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſo with comfort we may meet with death.</p>
                  <p>Now we come unto the ſecond point, which is here to be conſidered; taken from the complaint of the Prophet, that the people did not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor lay it to heart, viz. the death of the righteous, whence I note, That the death and loſſe of good men must be laid to heart, as a ſpeciall cauſe of grief and ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>We ought juſtly to be grieved at the death of a righteous man, when God taketh him from amongſt us. How did the Prophet Jeremy, and the people lament the death of that good King Joſiah? 2 Chron. 35. 23. ſo devout men made great lamentation for the death of Stephen, Acts 8. 2. ſo all Iſrael lamented the death of Moſes Deut. 34. 8. And Joaſh the King of Iſrael wept for the death of the Prophet Eliſha, 2 Kings 13. 14. and thus we ſhould lament and ſorrow for the death of any righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, yet not in reſpect of themſelves, as if their caſe were worſe now then before, for they are now more happy.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, in regard of Gods glory, whereof they were inſtruments to ſet it forth; for ſince they were taken away, Gods glory is impaired; becauſe there are the fewer left which doe truly ſerve and worſhip him; for as David ſaith, the dead praiſe not the Lord, &amp;c. Pſal. 115. 17. ſo then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, do not praiſe the Lord among the faithful on earth any longer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the great loſse that others have by their death, who have alwayes received much good by them in their life; for the godly doe ſo order and behave themſelves in all their wayes that they do good whereſoever they come; therefore when they die, it muſt needs be a great loſſe unto ſuch who might, if they had lived, been bettered by them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We ought to lament the death of the righteous in regard of the evil to come; for while they live, they are as a wal about us to keep Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from us; If there had been but ten righteous men in Sodome, it had not been deſtroyed, Gen. 18. 32. If there be any meſſenger one among a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44191:123"/>
thouſand, ſaith Elihu, to ſhew unto man his uprightneſſe, then is God graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto him Job 33. 23. Run ye to and fro in the ſtreets of Jeruſalem ſaith God, and ſee if you can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgement, and ſeeks the Lord, and I will pardon it, Jer. 5. 1. ſo that if there had been but one righteous man among the people in that city, the Lord would have ſpared them even for that ones ſake; and therefore the Lord ſpeaking of the righteous, ſaith, I will faſten him as a nail in a ſure place, he ſhall be as a glorious throne unto his fathers houſe. Eſay. 22. 23. Oh conſider then what a loſſe we have when the righteous dye; we are like to periſh, when the naile that was in the ſure place is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, cut down and falls; for then the burden that was upon it, ſhall be cut off, Eſay 22. 25. You therefore of this Congregation, conſider, and lament for this your loſſe, in that this good man is taken from among you; for who knowes whether God ſpared this congregation even for this good mans ſake? for it is the righteous only that God reſpects, and for their ſakes he will ſpare a whole people; therefore ſurely as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon ſaith, the righteous is better than his neighbour, yea though never ſo poor and deſpiſed in the eyes of the world, yet are they precious in Gods account; when I make up my Jewels (ſaith God) I will ſpare them, Mal. 3. 17. ſo that the righteous are Gods Iewels, the excellent of the earth are precious in Gods ſight; and have we not great cauſe then to lament for the loſſe of ſuch?</p>
                  <p>Seeing then it becometh all Gods children to lament the death of the righteous; O how farre then are all ſuch from the ſpirit of God, who are ſo farre from lamenting that on the contrary they rejoyce at the death of the godly man, becauſe he ſtood in their way? they could not follow their works of darkneſſe as they would, but he hindered them, he ſtood in their light, they could not run on in ſin and wickedneſſe, but he would be reproving, admoniſhing, and telling them of their faults, and this makes them long for the good mans end, and to rejoyce in it when it doth come; theſe do not conſider that when the righteous is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the earth, then they lie open unto the judgements of God; But as the Sodomites thruſt out juſt Lot out of their city, that ſo Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance might fall the ſooner upon them; for till he was gone, the Lord would not deſtroy them, Gen. 19. 21. Even ſo doe theſe men deſire to be rid of the righteous, and rejoyce when they are taken away from them, not conſidering that they are open to Gods vengeance, which hangeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their heads ready to devour them.</p>
                  <p>We ought then to be moſt grieved for the death of the righteous, when any of the Saints are taken away by death. Oh what a comfort is a righteous man to the children of God? what a feeling of grace is there in ſuch a one? what comfortable words come there from the mouth of ſuch men? how full of comfortable ſpeeches was this poor man; alwayes miniſtring comfort to thoſe that came to viſit him? what a loſs is this then unto us? it is more than if thouſands of the wicked had gone together; and ſhal we not mourn for the loſs of ſuch a one? If one of our family or friends dye, we can mourne for them; and good reaſon; and ſhall we not mourne for the loſſe of one of Gods Saints, one of the ſpirituall family, one of our fellow-members?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:44191:124"/>In this then examine thy ſelf how it is with thee; when thou heareſt of any of the faithfull that are taken away, art thou grieved for it? doſt thou lament and mourn for it? if thou doeſt not, ſurely thou art no true Chriſtian; for the children of God cannot chooſe but lay it to heart and lament, when any of the righteous is taken from among them. As Iſrael lamented the death of Samuel, 1 Sam, 25. 1.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the ſin of the people in not regarding nor laying it to heart, this was a great ſin of ſecurity in them, in that they did as it were reſt on their pillows, and cryed peace unto themſelves, notwithſtanding Gods judgements upon them, in taking away the righteous, and freeing them from the evill to come, we note that,</p>

                     </note> ordinarily take away his faithfull ſervants from among them, that ſo they may be freed from the evil to come. Thus good Joſiah muſt periſh in his young years, that ſo he might not be taken with the evill to come; I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thee unto thy fathers ſaith God, and thou ſhalt goe to thy grave in peace, and thy eyes ſhall not ſee all the evill that I will bring upon this place, 2 King, 22. 20. So when God told Abraham of the bondage and captivity whereunto he would bring his poſterity, he ſaith, thou ſhalt go to thy fathers in peace, Gen, 15. 13. And thus it was with the ancient Father, St. Auguſtine; when the cruel Vandals beſieged his crity, he prayed that the Lord would either take him away, or cauſe them to leave the ſiege; and the Lord heard him, and took him a way, and preſently after the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals deſtroyed the city. So Luther writing upon this text, ſaith that the Lord after his death would bring great affliction upon Germany, and two years after, it ſo fell out indeed. Thus ordinarily God takes away his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from the evill to come.</p>
                  <p>See here the mercy of God unto his children in that he takes them away from among the wicked, he calls them out of this world that they may not partake of the evill to come; ſhall any one then think it a curſe to be taken away betimes in his young years? nay happy is he that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from theſe miſerable and fearfull times, wherein the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, for our ſins, hangeth over our heads; and is ready every day to ſeize upon us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing that God when he means to bring any heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a people, doth ordinarily take away the righteous from the evil to come, this ſhews that when the righteous are taken from amongſt us, we are certainly to expect ſome judgement of God upon us. For theſe are they which ſtood in the gap, and kept off the fire of Gods wrath from us, that it ſhould not conſume us: but now being gone, we lie open to the judgements of God; and therefore when any righteous men are taken from us, the loſſe of them ought to drive us to repentance, leaſt Gods judgements come preſently upon us and conſume us, therefore we muſt forſake our ſins and evil wayes, and performe new obedience unto God, ſo will he be mercifull unto us, yea he will be a ſhield of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence unto us, and a wal of fire about us, and he will turn away his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from us.<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                  <p>There is firſt a denomination of a judgement, and that is dearth or famine from the firſt verſe, to the ſeventh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſword is threatned, to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe; he will ſend the famine, then the ſword, and he will not be intreated.</p>
                  <p>Then in the eighth and ninth verſes, we have the importunate prayer of the Church to turne away theſe judgements: And the praier is marvellous ſweet, in confeſſion, where they confeſſe their ſinnes, and ſeek to God for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they deſire God that he would not take his providence from them, why ſtayeſt thou but for a night? verſe the 8. as if they ſhould have ſaid,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:44191:126"/>
it is marveilous ſtrange, that thou behaveſt thy ſelf ſo like a ſtranger; thou ſeeſt our ſorrowes, and doſt not help us; thou perceiveſt our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and thou regardeſt us not; It is ſtrange, it is ſtrange; that the God of Iſrael ſtands as a man aſtoniſhed; that thou that haſt hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received us, ſhould'ſt now ſtand as a man amazed, and aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as if thou wert weary of this thy work, and couldſt do no more, as if thou ſhould'ſt ſay, Jeruſalem cannot be ſaved, and Judah cannot be ſuccoured.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they deſire that God would not take away his preſence from them; leave us not to our ſelves, ſay they; let us ſee thy face; though we die, yet let it be in thy preſence; yea though thou help us not, yet it doth us good to look upon our Saviour, and thou canſt help us; and thus you ſee the arguments where with they preſſe the Lord, how ſweet they are, viz.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thou art the hope of Iſrael; Alas if thou forſake us we are all loſt; our hope is not in the meanes only; but our hope is in thee, leave us not, for thou art the hope of Iſrael, it is the taſk that thou haſt taken upon thee, leave us not therefore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou haſt made thy ſelf a Saviour, and now is the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, therefore now performe what thou haſt undertaken.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou art in the midſt of us, that is, thou art a great Commander amongſt us; always ready to ſuccour us, and wilt thou now ſee us periſh? thou art more neer to us, than the Ark in the midſt of the Campe, 1 Sam. 4. 6. As if they ſhould ſay, he lives in the midſt of us, and will he not ſave us?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we are called by thy name, and therefore we have intereſt in thee, to whom ſhould wives go, but to their huſbands? to whom ſhould children go, but to their fathers? to whom ſhould ſervants go, but to their Maſters? to whom then ſhould we go, but to thee our God and Saviour? leave us not therefore, and we will meddle with none but thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though God might leave them, yet they beg that he would not; that is the Amen to their praiers; though thou ſtand and wilt not help us; yet let us die in thy preſence; and this is the great requeſt of the Saints, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to be left of God, although God might leave them; whence learn that God might caſt off a people.</p>
                  <p>Iſrael did fear it, and it is that which they prayed againſt, God might leave them: I doe not ſay that God will caſt off his elect ones eternally, but thoſe in outward covenant, ſee Iſaiah 1. verſe 2. &amp;c. Heare O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Hearken O Earth, I have nouriſhed and brought up children, but they have rebelled againſt mee; The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Crib, but Iſrael hath not known my People have not understood, &amp;c. and verſe the ſeventh; ſee the judgement; your cities are burnt with fire, ſtrangers devour your land in your preſence, and it is deſolate like the overthrow of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                  <p>There is an out ward Calling, as well as an effectuall Calling; God may reject; for many are called, but few choſen, ſaith our Saviour. My brethren caſt your thoughts afar off, and ſee what is become of thoſe famous

Churches of Pergamus and Thyatira and the reſt mentioned, Rev. 1. verſe 11. And who would have thought that Jeruſalem ſhould have been made an heap of ſtones, and a vagabond people? and yet we ſee God hath forſaken them, ſhewing us thereby that although God wil never forſake his own electones; yet he may forſake ſuch as are in outward covenant with him.</p>
                  <p>The Lord is ſaid to diſ-church or diſcharge a people, Hoſea 1. 9, there God ſaith, call his name Loammi, for ye are not my people, and therefore I will not be your God. And as I may ſo ſay, he ſues out a bill of divorcement; as it was in the old Law, they that had any thing againſt their wives, they ſued out a bill of divorcement againſt them, and ſo doth God, ſee Hoſea 2. 2. Plead with thy Mother, tel her ſhe is not my Spouſe, nor my beloved; but let her caſt away her fornications out of her ſight, and her adulteries from between her beaſts, leſt I make her as at the firſt, that is, as ſhe was in Egypt, poore and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As if God ſhould now ſay to England, plead, plead with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, all ye that are my Miniſters in the way of my truth and ſay unto her, let her caſt away her rebellions, leaſt I leave her as I found her in the day of Captivity and bondage under the blindneſſe of popery and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</p>

                  <p>Secondly when he takes away his providence, I mean when he takes down his walls; that is, his Magiſtracy, and Miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when in ſtead of Councelling, there comes in Bribing; and in ſtead of true teaching, there comes in daubing with untempered mortar; when God takes away the hedge thereof, Iſaiah 5. 5. or the ſtakes grow rotten, and are not renewed, then is God going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when God takes away the benefit of both theſe helps, they are ſignes of Gods departure.</p>

as they did upon Paul; every one of you lay hold, on him and ſay thou thou ſhalt not go from us, for we are called by thy name, therefore leave us not; And for my part I will pray that he doth not take his leave of us. Do you think that Rome will forſake or part with her Gods? no, they will rather loſe their lives; and wilt thou let thy God goe, O England? plead with thy God and let him not depart, but part rather with thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions.</p>
                  <q>We are called by thy Name, leave us not.</q>
                  <p>You ſee the Church is very importunate to keep God with them, they lay hold on God with Coards of arguments; O thou hope of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, do not leave us; they beſet God with their prayers, and as it were they watch him at the townes end, that he ſhould not go away; and they ſay, Thou ſhalt ſtill abide with us, they are importunate that he do not leave them: whence obſerve, Doct. That it is the importunate deſire of the Saints of God, ſtill to keepe God preſent with them. They cared not ſo much for ſword or famine, as they did for the loſſe of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; O Lord, leave us not ſay they; this was their prayer; and blame them not; for conſider what a greif it is that God ſhould ſtand by and not help them. Good Lord (ſay they) leave us not, wee cannot abide to thinke that God ſhould leave us, much leſſe can we endure to feele it or taſte it; thus they did, and thus the Saints of God ſhould do, Exod. 33. 14, 15. Moſes ſaith if thy preſence goe not with us, carry us not hence; alas, Moſes might have gone upon fair termes; ye ſhall (ſaith God) poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the land in peace with proſperity; But what ſaith Moſes? though wee might have Ganaan and all the delights there, yet carry us no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> hence unleſſe thy preſence goe with us; this is the ſtay and the ſtrength that he ſtickes too. So Pſal. 80. 18, 19. Turne us again O Lord of hoſts, make thy face to ſhine upon us; here is a man, a David, a heart worth gold, hee makes not many ſuits, but hee comes home, he ſues to the purpoſe, make thy face (ſaith he) to ſhine upon us; as if he ſhould have ſaid, that is proſperity enough, for it endureth for ever.</p>
                  <p>But what is the preſence of God? In a word, it is the particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God which he expreſſeth in his ordinances, it is all the good and ſweetneſſe that flowes from the purity of Gods worſhip, whereby God reveals himſelf unto us. It is not gold, wealth, nor proſperity, that makes God to be our God; for there is more gold in the Weſt Indies than in all Chriſtendome, but it is Gods ordinances purely adminiſtred that brings Gods preſence to a people. God forſooke Shiloh becauſe his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not purely kept there; when the people left the Arke (viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) his pure worſhip, then God left the people; when the Arke of Gods preſence was among them, the word in the purity of it, then his face was there, and there God was principally preſent; hence it was that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If Sodom and Gomorrah had qut legally repented, they had remained, they had not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44191:128"/>
been deſtroyed; And hence it is that the Saints are ſo, urgent for Gods Ordinances in the purity of them: But the wicked ſay, once a Sabbath is enough and once a week is too much; by this we may ſee that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is ripe; and is ſhe not weary of God? nay, ſhe is fat fed to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But it was not ſo with the Saints and people of God in former times; it was Davids grand requeſt, that he might dwel in the houſe of the Lord, Pſal. 27. 4. And Pſalme the 42. and the firſt verſe, he ſaid, his ſoul did pant for Gods ordinances. Thus you ſee that the Saints of God are marvellous importunate to keepe God in his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, the argument is clear, the Saints maintain God in his ordinances, the want of which is under the penalty of death and damnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe we have more need of God in his ordinances than of all the gold in the world; for all the gold in the world will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy a hungry man; It is bread that he muſt have, becauſe he hath need of it; ſo the Saints have moſt need of God, and of Chriſt, for though they have but ragged coats, and their bodies pincht with hunger, yet God is he that they ſtand moſt in need of. In Pſalme the 73. and the 25. verſe, David fretted at the proſperity of the wicked; but at the laſt he breaks off kindly, ſaying, whom have I Heaven but thee?

Theſe will never help a man; he may well dote upon them, but his ſoule and conſcience will be galled and troubled ſtill; it muſt be the God of peace that muſt ſpeak peace to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſoules. It muſt be the God of peace that muſt ſpeak peace to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoul, to a ſoule that is damned in it ſelfe; it is he that muſt ſay, I will be the ſtrength of their hearts, and their portion for ever; no marvel then if a poor ſoul cryes to God, when happily the heart is full, when the ſoul gnaws and cries within it ſelfe, I am damned, I am dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, happily the palate is pleaſed with delicates, when the poor ſoul for ought it knows muſt goe down to hell; oh then beloved, if you will have ſafety, goe where God is; for every good gift comes in with him; if once a man hath got God into his company, he hath all good things with him. God bleſſed Obed Edoms houſe for the Arks ſake; now the Arke was a type of Chriſt, and where it came, many bleſſings came with it; even ſo when God comes unto a people, they are married unto him in righteouſneſſe, in judgement, in loving kindneſſe and in mercies for ever, Hoſea, 2. 9. When a man is married to a wife, all is his; ſo get Chriſt and all is thine, and then what wouldſt thou have more?</p>
                  <p>God ſpeaks to the raine, and it heares; God ſpeaks to the corne, and it heares; but if thou be in Chriſt, hell and death are thy ſervants; but they that have outward things only, as profits, pleaſures or
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44191:128"/>
the like, they have their ruine, unleſſe they have Chriſt with them; get Chriſt therefore, for if he be wanting, all outward and inward dangers befall that man, or that Nation; woe be unto him or them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God. For though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there ſhall not be a man left; yea, woe alſo to them, when I do depart from them; Ephraim, as Tyrus, is planted in a pleaſant place: but Ephraim ſhall bring forth his children to the murderer, Hoſea 9. 12. 13. True indeed, woe be unto that heart, County or Kingdome, that God is departed from; when God who is the God of mercies and all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is departed away, who can but pitty that ſoule, County or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome who will not ſubmit to Gods peace, conſolation, and ſalvation? When God parts, all miſeries follow; for that man that makes no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in outfacing God in the congregation, mark what the text ſaith, Deut. 28. 15. I will forſake them, and many miſeries ſhall overtake them, and when the floud-gates are once up, then come in all evils; And then they ſhal ſay, are not theſe things come upon us, becauſe God is not with us? If therefore we would avoid woe and ſorrow, ſlaying and killing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if the wife would not ſee her huſband killed before her tender eyes, and the man ſee his wife ſnatcht out of the world by the hands of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, then leave not God, but hold him faſt, and then evil dayes will depart from us; It is our holding of God that keeps miſeries from us; oh then what ſhall we think of them that are weary of God, and that ſay to the Almighty, Depart from us? Job. 22. 17.</p>

                     <hi>Ob. But are there any amongſt us that are weary of God?</hi> I hope there are none ſuch amongſt us.</p>

I adviſe thee therefore what to do, whilſt thou art here in this life, make thy peace with God in Chriſt, and lay thy ſelf low before him, and beare patiently his hand in his wrath which thou haſt deſerved. And mark what I ſay, thou haſt deſerved to be in hell an hundred times, that is the leaſt; and therefore be contented with thy condition;

Thou man or woman, that canſt not abide ſo much preaching, but ſtandeſt upon thorns whilſt it is preaching: Too much of one thing (you ſay) is good for nothing; You do as much as ſay you will not have God with you; you will have a little of God, but you will have more of your pleaſures: Is this your deſire, your delights? Know then, whoſoever thou art, that haſt an ill will to God and his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and wilt not have the goſpel in the purity of it; thou ſhalt have thy deſires: Thou ſayeſt, depart Preaching, and ſo it ſhall, thou ſhalt have thy deſires. When thou ſhalt hear the trumpets ſound, and when thine eares ſhall tingle with the ſound of war; then depart for ever, you that are weary of God, get you down to hell for ever: Fulfill your baſe luſts, (then will God ſay) for I have fed you on earth this twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, nay ſixty years and upwards, and my mild Word could not rule you, nor prevaile with you, and therefore now get you to hell, and there remain for ever. Think thus with your ſelves; will God ſerve me thus? yea that he will, for he hath prepared a place for the proudeſt Kings, Princes, Monarchs, Captains, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are, or ever were in the world, if they will not be ruled nor guided by God, and his word.

                  <p>But ſome may ſay, Surely Kings and Monarchs are exempted, they need not fear that ſuch torments ſhall come upon them.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that God will ſay unto them, Raign there if thou wilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then they ſhall know that there is a King that laughs at their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Inſomuch that many poor ſoules amongſt them were diſcouraged, and almoſt ready to deſpaire; That had not the Lord put in ſome inklings of hope, they had

utterly fainted. Now whilſt theſe poore ſoules were praying, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and groaning, and now ready to give over for diſcouragement that God will not heare them, preſently the Lord flings in comfort, and bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to their hearts not to be diſcouraged, but to pray on, and feare not. Thou dreweſt near in the day that I called upon thee, thou ſaidſt fear not; the words containe in them three properties of effectuall prayer:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the unſatiableneſſe of it; All the prayers of this people though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they had been of many yeares, yet they counted them as the prayers of one day; in the day that I called upon thee. They account all their thouſands of ſupplications and praiers as one ſuite; never had they done their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers till God did heare them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſenſibleneſſe of it, whereby it is able to know whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God doe heare it or no: Thou dreweſt neare in the day that I called upon thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ſupplyes it hath againſt dangers and diſcouragements; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God flings in comfort into their hearts, giving them inklings of hope to ſupport them againſt their diſcouragements, thou ſaidſt fear not. From the firſt of theſe, obſerve</p>
                  <p>That an effectual prayer is an unſatiable prayer; A man that praies effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,<note place="margin">Doctrine. 1.</note> ſets down this in himſelf as his firſt concluſion never to ceaſe, nor to give over praying till he ſpeed: This the firſt and prime thing that a godly heart looks at, as David in his prayers: He begins in this manner, Heare my cry O God, attend unto my prayer, Pſal. 61. 1. So, Give eare unto my prayer O God, and hide not thy ſelf from my ſupplications, Pſal. 55. 1. Heare my voyce O God in my prayer, Pſal. 64. 1. As if he ſhould ſay, Lord, now I come to call upon thee, now that I come to thee, to begge theſe and theſe graces that my ſoule wants, I beſeech thee to heare me: for I am reſolved never to give over my ſuit, never to give thee reſt, but for to continue my prayers and ſupplications, til thou give a gratious anſwer to my ſoul and heare me.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt and prime thing that the ſoule looks after, it being the very end of prayer to be heard; it is not with prayer as with Oratory; for in Oratory; a man may uſe all the perſwaſive arguments that the wit of man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> heart may be ſo intractable as not to be perſwaded; it is not ſo with prayer.</p>
                  <p>The end of prayer is to prevaile with God. Beloved, there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the end and office of prayer; the office of prayer is to pray, the end of prayer is to prevaile. There is many a man that doth the office of prayer, and yet never gets the end of prayer. A man hath never gotten the end of his prayers, till he hath gotten that he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. It is not with praier as with a Phyſician, that may give the beſt phyſick under heaven, and yet the Patient may die under his hands; and therefore one gives counſel that a Phyſician never meddle with a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſoul be an effectuall ſuitor with God, it can never faile of its ſuite, becauſe it is an unſatiable Suitor, that never leaves his prayer till it terminates the end of it. I cryed unto the Lord with my voyce, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. Jerom tranſlates it for ever.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44191:131"/>
Pſal. 3. 4. never doth a child of God pray, but he prayeth ſo as that his praier and Gods eare may be joyned together; I cried unto the Lord, and the Lord heard me: This alſo ſheweth how the Prophet cried and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, namely ſo as his crying and Gods hearing were coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>But ſome may object, How can a man be unſatiable in his prayers till he ſpeed? muſt a man be alwaies a praying? God calls men to other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his worſhip, and of his own particular calling; after morning I muſt have done till noon, after noone I muſt have done til night: whether God hear me or no; muſt I be alwaies a praying till I ſpeed? then I ſhould doe nothing elſe but pray? how then are we to continue our praiers till God hear us and give the grace that we pray for? to this I anſwer.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>A man muſt give over the words and times of prayer for other duties, but a man muſt not give over the ſuit of prayer. A poor begger comes to a houſe-keepers gate, and begs, but none hears him; now he being a poor man, hath ſomthing elſe to do, and therefore he ſits down or ſtands, and knits or patches, and then he begs or knocks, and then to his work again; though he do not alwayes continue knocking or begging, yet he alwaies continues his ſuite: O that my ſuite might be granted me, or that I might have an almes here; ſo when the ſoul is begging of any grace, though it doth not alwaies continue the words of praier, yet it alwaies continues the ſuite of praier. David he would dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever, Pſal. 23. 6. A wicked man it may be will turne into Gods houſe and ſay a prayer, &amp;c. but the Prophet would (and ſo all godly men muſt) dwell there for ever; his ſoul lyeth alwayes at the throne of grace, begging for grace. A wicked man he prayeth as the cock croweth; the cock crows and ceaſeth, and crowes again and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth again; and thinks not of crowing till he crowes again: ſo a wicked man praies and ceaſeth, praies and ceaſeth again; his mind is never bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied to think whether his praiers ſpeed, or no; he thinks it is good Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for him to pray, and therefore he takes that for granted that his praiers ſpeed, though in very deed God never hears his praiers, nor no more reſpects it, than he reſpects the lowing of Oxen, or the gruntling of hoggs. He is found in his praiers as the wilde Aſſe in her moneths: Jer. 2. The wild Aſſe in regard of her ſwiftneſſe cannot be taken but in her months, ſhe hath a ſleepy moneth, and all that while ſhe is ſo ſleepy and dumpiſh that any man may take her; in her months you ſhall find her; ſo a wicked man hath his prayer moneths, his praier fits: it may be in the morning, or in the evening, or day of his affliction and miſery you ſhall have him at his prayers, at his prayer fits then you ſhall find him at it, but otherwiſe his mind is about other matters. But the child of God what ever he ailes, he goes with his petition preſently to the throne of grace, and there he never removes till he hath it granted him, as here we ſee the praiers of the Church conſiſting of many years, yet are counted but one ſuit. The application follows.</p>
                  <p>Uſe 1. Try therefore and examine whether thy praiers be unſatiable<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> praiers yea or no; and for helpe herein take theſe markes; firſt, if thy prayers be unſatiable praiers, then it is a begging prayer; thou praieſt as
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44191:132"/>
if thou hadſt never praied before, as if thou hadſt never begun to pray, and thou never thinkeſt that thou haſt done any thing till thou haſt done the deed. As a hungry man eats as if he had never eat before, ſo the unſatiable ſoul praies as if he had never praied before, till he hath obtained that he hath praied for; but a wicked man he prayes not thu. Job ſpeaking of carnal profeſſors, Job 27. 10. Will he call upon God at all times? ſeeſt thou a wicked man go to a good duty, go to praier, do you think that he will hold out alwayes? he will never do it; for a wicked man he reaſons with himſelfe, I have called upon God thus and thus long, I hope I need not pray any more for this thing, and ſo he gives over.</p>
                  <p>But a godly man he will be alwayes calling upon God. Beloved, there is a beginning to an action, and a beginning of an action; thou never beginneſt to lift up a weight till thou ſtirreſt it from the ground; indeed thou maiſt begin towards the action by pulling at it, by reaching at it; but thou never beginneſt the lifting up of the weight till thou ſtirre it from its place: thou mayſt give a pull at prayer, and tugge at a grace, but thou haſt not ſo much as begun that duty, till thou ſeeſt God begin to hear thee, till thou ſeeſt the grace a coming; therefore the Prophet David when he prayed and had not that he prayed for, his praiers retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into his own boſome, Pſal. 35. 13. there to lie to be a continuall ſuit unto God. A wicked man praies, and he leaves his praier behind him in his pew, or in his hall, or chamber; but a godly man praies and his prayer is in his heart, his prayer is not out till the grace be in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly an unſatiable prayer it is evermore a proceeding praier; you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> would think that theſe are two contraries and one oppoſite to the other, but they are not, only they are two ſeverall things as it is ever a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning praier, becauſe in his own thoughts he reckons or thinks that he hath nothing till he ſpeeds: ſo the ſoule that is unſatiable in prayer, he proceeds, he gets neer to God, he gains ſomething, he windes up his, heart higher: As a child that ſeeth the mother have an apple in her hand, and it would fain have it, it will come and pull at the mothers hand for it: now ſhe lets go one finger, and yet ſhe holds it, and then he pulls again, and then ſhe lets go another finger, and yet ſhe keepes it, and then the child pulls again, and will never leave pulling and crying till it hath got it from his mother: So a child of God ſeeing all graces to be in God, he draws neer to the throne of grace begging for it, and by his earneſt and faithfull praiers, he opens the hands of God to him: God dealing as parents to their children, holds them off for a while, not that he is unwilling to give, but to make them more earneſt with God, to draw them the neerer to himſelfe. A wicked man praies and his praiers tumble down upon him again; and his heart is as dead as ever it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as ſenſual as ever, as carnal and earthly as ever, as hard, as impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and ſecure as ever.</p>
                  <p>A godly man when he praies, though he have not gotten the thing totall that he deſired, yet he is neerer God then he was before; his heart grows every day better than other by his praiers; he obtains ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:44191:132"/>
as the Prophet Hoſea ſpeaks of knowledge, Hoſ. 6. 3. Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: ſo I may ſay of prayer, and of all other good duties, then we pray if we proceed on wards in prayer.</p>
                  <p>A man may know and know, and yet never know the Lord, till he go on in knowledge; ſo a man may pray and pray, yet if he goe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in his prayers, his prayers are nothing. A godly man prayes as a builder builds; now a builder he firſt layeth a foundation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot finiſh in one day, he comes the ſecond day, and finds the frame ſtanding that he made the firſt day, and then he adds a ſecond dayes work, and then he comes a third day and finds his two former dayes work ſtanding; then he proceeds to a third dayes work, and makes walls to it, and ſo he goes on till his building be finiſhed. So prayer is the building of the ſoule, till it reach up to heaven; therefore a godly heart prayes and reacheth higher and higher in prayer, til at laſt his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers reach up to God.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſigne of a wicked man to pray and to let his prayers fall down again upon him. And here I appeale to the conſciences of wicked men, if it be not ſo with them; they pray and pray, but their hearts are as dead and deceitfull, as proud and vaine, as ignorant, blockiſh and rebellious, as if they had never prayed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is more and more a fervent prayer; if a little prayer will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not ſerve the turn, if he ſpeeds not to day, then he will pray more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to morrow; and if that will not ſerve the turne, he will adde more.</p>
                  <p>As a man in winding up of a bucket, if two or three windings will not fetch it up, he will winde it up higher and higher, till it comes up; for if he ſhould onely winde up once or twice and no more, but hold it juſt at the ſame pin, the bucket would never come up; So if a man prayes and prayes, and windes not up his heart higher, but holds it juſt at the ſame pegge it was, prayes in the ſame faſhion he did, grace will never come up. Mark then how thou prayeſt, examine thy heart; doſt thou pray to day as yeſterday, with no more zeal, nor feeling affection, nor ſenſible deſire? thou prayeſt not unſatiably.</p>
                  <p>No, thou reſtraineſt thy praying from growing; an excellent deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of an hypocrite, Job 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 4. though falſly applied to Job, Thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineſt prayer before God; in ſome tranſlations it is, Thou keepeſt thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from growing, thou reſtraineſt thy prayers as a dwarffe is reſtrained from growing, ſo thou reſtraineſt thy prayers from being more and more earneſt and effectuall and fervent, unſatiable prayer is growing in zeale and affection.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is a more and more frequent prayer, ſo that if twice a day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> will not ſerve the turne, he will pray three times a day, Pſal. 55. 17, and if that will not prevaile, he will pray ſeven times a day, Pſal. 119. 164. and when that is not enough, he will be even ever a praying, hardly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off day or night, Pſal. 88. 1. he cares not how often he prayes, it may be that thou haſt been a ſuitor for ſtrength and grace againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and haſt put up many prayers to the ſame purpoſe: It now thou
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44191:133"/>
ſtickeſt at any prayers, thy prayers are not unſatiable; an unſatiable ſoul never reſteth, though it have made ten thouſand prayers, till it have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the grace; it is ſo with other things, and therefore we need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it, when a man doth not finiſh his work one day, he will do it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo on as long as he lives, till his worke be done; ſo muſt we do for heaven and for grace.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is ever more and more a back'd praier: if ordinary praiers will not ſerve the turne: a godly heart will cut off time from his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and pleaſures, though in themſelves lawfull. Beloved, it may be with thy ſoul in its wraſtlings and ſtrivings for grace and power againſt corruptions, that ordinary praiers will not ſatisfie it, but it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſry to give over even lawfull delights, and give that time to praier; ſo a man will do for the world, if he have a buſineſſe of importance, that will bring him in gaine, he will be content to part with his delights, and recreations, and pleaſures, to follow after it; ſo a man muſt do for his ſoul, and if that be not enough, then lay aſide the duties of thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to take time from that. If a man have two houſes on fire both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the one his manſion dwelling houſe, the other ſome back room or ſtable, if he can, he will ſave both; but if he ſee that by ſpending his time on quenching the fire on the ſtable, that his great manſion houſe will burne downe, he will then neglect the other and let it burne if it will, and imploy himſelfe about his houſe; So when the ſoul is in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery under the want of grace, that it cannot live under, but muſt periſh eternally if it have it not, then the ſoule being better than the body, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that the ſoul miſcarry, we will neglect the body ſometime. And if this will not ſerve, abſtain from meat and drink, faſt it out; thus the people of God are faine to do many times; their luſt and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being even as the devill himſelfe, which cannot be caſt out but by prayer and faſting; there is an excellent place, Joel 2. 12. Therefore now turn unto the Lord with faſting, weeping and mourning, rent your hearts, &amp;c. Therefore now, now your ſinnes are ſo diveliſh, now your ſins are ſo deepely rooted in your ſoules, now your corruptions are come to be ſuch plague ſores within you, do you not think that your ordinary repentance, and ordinary praiers and humiliations will ſerve the turne, but now backe them with faſting and mourning. Here now thou maiſt examine thy ſoul whether it have praied effectually, unſatiably yea or no; hath it ever a begging praier, that thou praieſt as if thou hadſt never praied before? is it evermore a proceeding prayer, that thou doſt every day draw neerer to God than other? is it more and more a back'd prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a fervent and frequent praier? haſt thou taken from thy recreations, from thy calling to give to it, yea from thy belly and back, and uſed all meanes for a prevailing with God? then are thy praiers effectuall and unſatiable.</p>
                  <p>This then condemnes the praiers of moſt men in the world, they pray and pray for grace, and their praiers come to an end, and ceaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have it, the angry fretful man praies for patience and meekneſs, and yet ſits down without it; the covetous worldling praies to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the world, and his praiers are done before he is ſo; ſo the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44191:133"/>
luke-warmling, deadhearted and vain thoughted profeſſor praye; for better thoughts, for more zeale, and yet comes to his ſo be it, before he have it; and ſo every wicked man prayes, and he is come to his Amen before the grace is given; let all ſuchmen know that ſuch prayers, firſt they are endleſſe, ſecondly they are fruitleſſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they are endleſſe: The Philoſopher ſaid that for which a thing is, that is the end of the thing: now prayer is for the ſpeeding with God: and therefore he whoſe prayers ſpeed not with God, his prayers are endleſſe: thou haſt prayed againſt thy pride, but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t as proud ſtill: thou haſt prayed againſt thy choler and art as teachy ſtill: thou haſt prayed againſt earthlineſſe and worldlineſſe, and art earthly and worldly ſtill: thou haſt prayed againſt ſecurity and deadneſſe of heart, and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſſe in Gods ſervice, and art luke warm, deadhearted and ſecure ſtill: to what end are all thy prayers, when thou enjoyeſt not the end of thy prayers? to what end is the worke of thy ſervant, if thy buſineſſe be not done, and diſpatched when all is done? As good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pray, as pray to no end, a good that thou never hadſt begun to pray, as to ceaſe, and to giue over thy prayers before thou haſt obtained the grace thou prayeſt for: The prayers of the wicked are an abomination unto the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his delight: Prov. 15. 8. that is, the prayers of a wicked man that continues in his wickedneſſe, when his prayers are done, hi prayers are an abomination to the Lord: but the prayers of the upright though he were before he prayed never ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet if it be the prayer of an upright and godly man, when his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are done, that his prayers rid him of his ſin, and make him an upright man, his prayers are Gods delight.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, many pray againſt diſtruſt in Gods providence, Infidelity in Gods promiſes, Impatiency under Gods corrections, &amp;c. and yet have never the more truſt and affiance in God, never the more patience under the hand of God, all theſe praiers are endleſse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thy praiers are fruitleſſe: to what purpoſe is a beggers beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of an alms? if he be gone before the alms be beſtowed, his begging is fruitleſſe; ſo all thy praiers are loſt, if thou art gone from the Throne of grace, before grace is given thee; for if ſuch a praier be endleſſe, then is it alſo fruitleſſe: it will never do thee any good; what is a fruitleſſe tree good for, but to be cut down? what is a fruitleſſe Vine good for, but to be burned? So all thy praiers are loſt, all thy beginnings of grace are loſt, we know, ſaith the man that was borne blind, John 9. that God heareth not ſinners, we know it: Why may ſome ſay, how do you know that God heares not ſinners? why, we know it by experience, by examples.</p>
                  <p>A drunkard prayeth to God to cure him of his drunkenneſſe, and yet he doth not leave his ill company; all the world may ſee that God hears not the drunkards praier, becauſe he cures him not, but lets him go on in his ſinne; and ſo for all other ſinnes: ſeeſt thou a man go on in his ſins? thou mayeſt ſee that God heareth not his praiers. If a man ſhould be ſick on his death bed, and ſend for the Phyſirians; and Apothecaries in the Country, and ſend for his father, Mother, and for all his friends to

come to him to miniſter unto him: yet I know he is not cured by them ſo long as I ſee his deadly diſeaſe remaines upon him; ſo if I ſee a mans pride, hypocriſie, ſecurity, deadneſſe of heart, his luſt, anger, &amp;c. lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: notwithſtanding all his prayers, I know God heares not his prayers; he prayes to be cleanſed from his ſins, and to be purged from his luſts, and to be redeemed from his vaine converſation: if now God let his ſins continue in him, and lets him go on in them, we ſee plainly God hears not him. O what a pittiful and miſerable caſe are ſuch men in, that pray and pray, and yet all their prayers are endleſſe and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs! is not that man in a pittiful caſe, and all phyſick, all coſt and charges is loſt upon him; when his eating and drinking, his ſleeping, and winding and turning from this ſide to that ſide do him no good? do we not ſay of him that he is a dead man? ſo if a mans prayers and ſupplications to God be endleſſe and fruitleſſe: that man muſt needs be a dead and a damned man, ſo long as he goeth on in that caſe.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond part of the text, the ſenſibleneſſe of the<note place="margin">2 Gen.</note> godly ſoul, whether it ſpeed or no, the ſoule that prayes aright, that prays unſatiably, it is able to ſay, the Lord doth hear me, the Lord doth grant me the thing that I prayed to him for; Thus ſaith Jonah, I cried unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of Hell cryed I, and thou heardſt my voice, Jonah 2. 2. How could Jonah ſay, God heard his voice, if he had not known it? therefore he knew it. But againſt this ſome may object,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>How can this be? how can the ſoule know that God hears it? we have no Angels, nor voices from Heaven now to tell men, as the Angel told Cornelius, that his prayers were accepted, and come up before God; or to ſay as Chriſt to the woman in the Goſpel, Be of good comfort thy ſins are forgiven thee; I know God heares me with his All-hearing eare, and therefore I have a good belief in God: but how ſhall I know that God heares my prayers in mercy, ſo as to grant that I pray for?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>There be ſix wayes to know whether the ſoule ſhall ſpeed in prayer, yea or no.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, the having of a Spirit of further and further praying. When <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God gives the ſoul a further and further ability to pray, when God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a way for the ſoule to the Throne of grace, and gives him a free acceſſe to the gate of mercy, and a ſpirit to hold out in prayer: It is a ſigne that God meanes to hear it. When a Petitioner hath acceſſe to the King, and preſents his Petition, If the King imbolden him in his ſpeech, and let him ſpeak all that he would ſpeak, it is a ſigne that the King means to grant that man his petition, becauſe otherwiſe the King would never have endured to have heard him ſo long, but would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be gone. So it is with the ſoule at the Throne of grace; if it come with a petition and prayer to God; if God diſpatch the ſoul out of his preſence, ſo that the ſoul hath no heart to pray, nor to continue its ſuit; but prayes deadly and dully, and is glad when he hath ſaid his prayers, and hath done: it is a fearful ſign that God never means to heare that mans prayers: but if thou prayeſt and prayeſt, and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

thy prayers, but God by caſting in a ſpirit of praier and zeal, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in prayer, imboldens thy heart in its petition, it is a ſign that God will hear thee, and grant thee thy prayers.</p>
                  <p>Bleſsed be God ſaith the Prophet, that hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me, Pſal. 66. 20. How could the Prophet ſay that the Lord did not turne away his mercy from him? How! becauſe he turned not away his prayer from him. Many Expoſitors expound it of not turning away his prayer from his heart; as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, thou continueſt my heart to pray, thou haſt not taken away my prayer from my heart; therefore I know that thou continueſt thy mercy unto me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the preparedneſſe of the heart to pray, is a ſign that God means <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to hear. When the Merchant ſtretcheth his bagge wider and wider, it is a ſigne that he means to put ſomething in it: ſo when God opens the heart of a poor ſoul, it is a ſigne that he means to fill it; when God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the ſoule with more hunger and thirſt after grace, with more lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings and breathings; it is a ſign that God hath already prepared his eare to hear that prayer: it is a ſigne that heart ſhall ſpeed with God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Pſal. 10. 17. Lord thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine eare to heare Firſt, God prepares the heart to pray, and then he bows his eare to hear.</p>
                  <p>Examine thy ſoul then; art thou more and more prepared to pray? hath God ſpoken with a powerfull voice to thy ſoul to open it ſelfe wide? it is a ſigne that God meanes to fill thy ſoul with his graces. But if thou canſt ruſh into Gods preſence, and leave thy preparedneſſe behind thee; leaveſt thy ſoul and thy thoughts, and thy affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee; and comeſt with a ſtraightned heart in thy deadneſſe and luke warmneſſe; this is a fearefull ſigne that God will not heare thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gods gracious looke is a ſigne that he will hear thee: for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> (beloved) God anſwers his people by a caſt of his countenance, with a gratious ſmile of his face. Pſal. 22. 24. He hath not deſpiſed nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he cryed unto him he heard. Hereby was the Prophet able to know that God did hear his prayer, becauſe he did not hide his face from him; when his poor ſoule ſaw God ſmile on him, and ſet a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable eye upon him, this made him ſay that God heard his cry.</p>
                  <p>This is a riddle to the world.</p>
                  <p>If you ſhould ask the men of the world what the meaning of Gods gratious countenance is, or what they ſee of it? alas, they can ſay nothing of it; they know not what it means; onely the godly man underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Pſal. 34. 15. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his eares are open unto their cry. Theſe two go together, their prayers enter in Gods eares, and they know it; why? becauſe they ſee it in his countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as a Petitioner may read his ſpeeding with the King by his countenance towards him; ſo a poor ſoul may ſee how prayers prevaile by Gods countenance and look upon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:44191:135"/>If thou then art a ſtranger to Gods countenance, if God never admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee into his preſence to ſee his face and countenance; it is a ſigne that God little regards thy prayers, and hath no mind to hear thee. A wicked man is like a varlet that ſtands without dores and begges an almes, but is not ſuffered to go into the Gentlemans preſence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowes not how he ſpeeds, whether the Gentleman will give him an almes, or whether he be providing a cudgell to beat him away: ſo a wicked man prayes and puts up his petitions to God, but he is not able to come before God: he cannot ſee whether God look as if he meant to hear his prayers, yea or no; he knows not but that God may be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a curſe and plague for him in ſtead of a bleſſing. But a child of God comes within the liſt of Gods countenance; he can tell when God ſmiles on him, and when he takes another looke: he is able to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods preſence, Job 13. 16. He alſo (ſaith Job) ſhall be my ſalvation: for an hypocrite ſhall not come before him. A ſtrange verſe. Job ſaith, God is his ſalvation: and he gives this reaſon why he was able to ſay ſo, for an hypocrite ſhall not come before him. One would think that this were no reaſon: but yet it is an undeniable reaſon, as if Job had ſaid, I come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his preſence, and he lookes like a Saviour, a Redeemer upon me, but an hypocrite ſhall not come before him: he ſtands like a rogue and begs without the gate.</p>
                  <p>Indeed a wicked man comes into Gods preſence, in regard of Gods Omnipreſence: but this is not enough, thy Oxe, and thine Aſſe ſtands in Gods preſence: yea ſo, the very Devils themſelves are in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But if thou come not into Gods preſence of grace, if God do not admit thy ſoule into the liſt of his Throne, it is a ſign that God hears thee not. Men ſhould therefore examine their conſciences, what face or preſence of God they come into or ſee: when they pray in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whether they come before God, yea or no.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, no wicked man under heaven can come before God: this is made the marke of a godly man onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal. 140. 13. The upright ſhall dwell in thy preſence, (mark here) dwelling in Gods preſence is onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to the righteous: the upright ſhall dwell in thy preſence. And here I appeale againe to the hearts and conſciences of wicked men, what preſence of God doe they find in their prayers? they ſee their Pews, and the walls or hangings, &amp;c. before them: they ſee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the clouds above them: they know nothing within dores. Do they ſee Gods preſence and countenance? no: it is the upright man onely that dwells in Gods preſence: He ſees how God lookes on him, how his face ſmiles on him: and therefore, it is not a wicked mans co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Church, and falling on his knees, and uttering the words of prayer that is a coming into Gods preſence: then, this would be a falſe ſaying of the Prophet. For a wicked man may go to Church and fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees, &amp;c. but never come before God.</p>
                  <p>This preſence, is, to ſee the face of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the conſcience of a man doth anſwer him whether God hear him yea or no. As it was with the high Prieſt, whenſoever the high Prieſt came into Gods preſence to inquire of him, though God did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44191:135"/>
viſibly unto him, yet he might read Gods anſwer in his Urim and Thummim; he might there know Gods mind: ſo a mans conſcience is his Urim and Thummim. When he comes before God his own conſcience gives him an inckling whether he ſpeed or no: 1 John 3. 20, 21. If our hearts condemne us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our hearts condemne us not, then have we confidence towards God. If a mans conſcience tell a man his prayers are rotten, that his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rotten, that his heart is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o upright, that yet he is not purged from his ſins, that his ſeeking of God is fained and hypocriticall; it is the very voice of God in his ſoule: and if our conſciences condem us, God (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) is greater than our conſciences.</p>
                  <p>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus. Rom. 8. 1. as if he ſhould ſay, thoſe that are in Chriſt, God doth not condeme them; they have not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that condemnation: nay their own conſcience doth not condemn them: ſo that, that man whom any condemnation either from God, or from his own conſcience condemns, that man is not in Chriſt; being not in Chriſt, he can never be heard.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, a mans conſcience may be miſ-informed by Satan under a temptation; as you may ſee in the verſe before my text: Thou haſt heard my voyce: ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>op not thine eare from my cry. Here the Church being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, their conſciences told them they were heard in their prayers: but being under a temptation, their conſciences were afraid that God heard not. So many a poor ſoule, examine it, and it cannot deny but that theſe and theſe tokens of grace and fruits of Gods Spirit are in it; yet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are afraid that the Lord will not give them theſe and theſe other graces that they want: that the Lord will not hear them for ſuch and ſuch bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>I meane not neither a truce of conſcience: for there may be a truce of conſcience in wicked men. A truce may be between mortall enemies: but no peace but amongſt friends. Wicked mens conſciences are like the Lion, 1 Kings 13. who when he had killed the Prophet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtood by the Corps, and by the Aſſe, and did not eate the body, nor tear the Aſſe; ſo a wicked mans conſcience, it is as the devils ban-dogge or roaring Lion, till it hath ſlaine the ſinner, it ſtands ſtone ſtill, and ſeemes neither to meddle nor make with him, but lies as ſeared or dead in him I mean not this conſcience. But when God hath ſprinkled the conſcience with the bloud of Chriſt, and made the conſcience pure: this is a ſigne that God heares his prayer.</p>
                  <p>I mean not the ſtammering of conſcience, when it is dazelled, or overwhelmed: but when it ſpeaks down right as it means. A go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y mans conſcience ſometimes may judge otherwiſe then the thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what thy conſcience tells thee in ſober ſadneſſe, deliberately, convincingly, and then, know that the Lord tells thee.

                  <p>Fifthly, the getting of that grace that a man prayes for, is a ſigne that God heares his prayers. But this is not a true ſigne alwayes but with diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:44191:136"/>When the grace given, and the good will of God the giver, cannot be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then it is a true ſigne. But when the gift and the good will of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may be ſevered, then it is not a true ſigne.</p>
                  <p>Thou mayeſt pray unto God, and God may give thee many tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſſings, and many common graces of his Spirit; God may give thee good parts, a good memory: he may give thee a good meaſure of knowledge and underſtanding, even in divers things; he may give thee ſome kinde of humility, chaſtity; civility. thou mayeſt be of a loving and flexible diſpoſition ſo he may give thee a good eſtate in the world, houſes, lands, wife and children, &amp;c. God may give thee all theſe, and yet hate thee, and never heare one prayer thou makeſt; thou maiſt pray for a thouſand bleſſings, and have them: and yet never be heard, ſo long as the good will of the giver is ſevered from them; all outward bleſſings and common graces may be ſevered from Gods good pleaſure to a man.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in temporall bleſſings, or in common graces, if thou wouldſt know whether God hear thee or no: know whether God hath given thee a ſanctified uſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f them or no. If God hath given thee many common graces, or temporal bleſſings, and a heart to uſe them to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; then every bleſſing thou haſt (there is not a drop of drink, nor a bit of bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d that thou haſt,) but it is a ſigne of Gods everlaſting love to thee. Why? becauſe this, and the good will of the giver can never be ſevered. But on the contrary, if a man have not a ſanctified uſe of that he hath, then it is the greateſt ſeverity of God, and the moſt eminent plague and curſe of God upon the ſoule to give it; for a mans parts may be his bane, his civility may be his curſe, and means of the finall hardneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie of his heart.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if a man have faith given him to believe, it is a ſigne that God heares him; be it to thee (ſaith Chriſt to the man in the Goſpel) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy faith; ſo goe thou to God, and be it to thee as thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.

Thomas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid Chriſt, John 20. 29. Becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt believed: bleſſed are they that have not ſeen and yet believe. That man that believes becauſe he feels grief in his heart, teares in his eyes, groans in his ſpirit, becauſe he prayes long and earneſtly, and ſweats in his prayer, or mourns in his humiliation, I ſuſpect his humiliation, his teares, his griefe, his prayers, and all that he hath. Why? theſe are good ſignes of faith: but rotten grounds of faith: the word and promiſe of God muſt be thy ground. But againſt this the ſoul may object,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>That every Promiſe runs with a Condition: and therefore if I have not the condition, how can I beleeve the promiſe? God hath promiſed, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44191:136"/>
There is a Promiſe of filling, but it is with a condition of hungering. Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth. Bleſsed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God, &amp;c. If I have not the condition annexed to the Promiſe, how dare or how can I beleeve the Promiſe?</p>

                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>The Condition is not the way to get the Promiſe; the Promiſe is the ground of faith, and the way to get the condition; becauſe the promiſe is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Motive cauſe that moves the ſoul to get the condition. Now, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver muſt be before the Moved, then if beliefe of the Promiſe move thy ſoul to get the condition of the promiſe, then beliefe of the promiſe muſt be before that the ſoule can keep the condition of the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Saul made a promiſe to David, 1 Sam. 18. that he ſhould be his ſon in law in one of his two daughters, upon condition that he ſhould give him an hundred fore-skins of the Philiſtins. Now, David did firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the promiſe; and therby he was allured to fight valiantly, to keep the condition, to get a hundred fore-skins of the Philiſtins. So Pſal. 116. I believed, and therefore did I ſpeak. He beleeved Gods promiſe, and then he ſpake with condition. So we believe ſaith the Apoſtle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we ſpeak. Firſt, the ſoule believes; and then every action of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wherein it moves to the keeping of the condition, ſprings from this root<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay beloved, a man cannot keep any condition in the Bible without faith; he muſt believe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, faith is the inabling cauſe to keep the condition. Doſt thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> think to get weeping, mourning, and humiliation for thy ſins, and then thereby to get the promiſe to thy ſelf? then thou goeſt in thy own ſtrength; and then, in Gods account, thou doſt juſt nothing, John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. 5. Without me ye can do nothing, ſaith Chriſt; therefore firſt lay hold on me, beleeve in me, abide in me.</p>
                  <p>What, doe you firſt think to pray, to mourne, to lament and bewaile your ſinnes, to do this and that in turning your ſelves, and ſanctifying of your ſelves? Indeed you may fumble about theſe things: but you can never do any of them in deed and to the purpoſe: without me ye can doe nothing. I had fainted ſaith the Propher, unleſſe I had beleeved to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of the living, Pſal. 27. 13. where we may ſee three things,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Promiſe that he ſhould ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he could not have beleeved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Condition: if he do not faint.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The method the Prophet went by, he beleeved to ſee the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Lord. As if he had ſaid, if he had not firſt laid hold on the Promiſe, if I had not beleeved to have ſeen the goodneſſe of the Lord in the Land of the living, I had fainted.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, it is true that the keeping of the Condition, is before the fruition of the Promiſe: but not before beleeving the Promiſe: becauſe the doing of the Condition is effected by beleeving the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>This is the cauſe that many fumble about grace, but never get it: they are ever repenting, but never repent: ever learning, but never learne the knowledge of the truth everlaſting: ever ſtriving, but never get power over their corruptions, &amp;c. becauſe they fumble about it in their own
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44191:137"/>
ſtrength, and take it not in the right method.</p>
                  <p>Let the ſoul come with faith in Chriſt, and believe it ſhall ſpeed and have grace, and power from Chriſt his grace, and from Chriſts power: and then it ſhall ſpeed. Chriſt hath promiſed (John 14.) that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we aske the Father in his name, he will give it us. Chriſt (beloved) is an excellent Surety. Indeed, our credit is crackt in Heaven: we may think to go and fetch this and that grace in our own names, and miſſe of it: as the ſervant may go to the Merchant for wares in his own name, but the Merchant will not deliver them to him in his own name, unleſſe he come in his Maſters name and bring a ticket from him: and then when the ſervant ſheweth his Maſters ticket, the Merchant will deliver him what wares he asketh for in his Maſters name. So when a ſoul goeth to the Throne of grace with a ticket from Chriſt; if he can ſay, Lord, it is for the honour of Chriſt: I come for grace and holineſſe, and ſtrength againſt my corruptions; Lord, here is a ticket from Chriſt: moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhall ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>But, men muſt take heed that they foyſt not the name of Chriſt: that they foyſt not a ticket to ſay that Chriſt ſent them, when it is their own ſelfe-love, and their own luſt that ſends them; it is not enough to pray and at the end to ſay through Chriſt our Lord, Amen. No: for this may be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eer foyſting of the Name of Chriſt. But, canſt thou pray and ſhew that Chriſt ſent thee, and ſay as the ſervant, I come from my Maſter, and he ſent me? Lord, it is for Chriſt that I come; it is not to ſatisfie my owne luſt, nor to eaſe and deliver me from the galls of my conſcience, nor to free me from hell; but for Chriſt; Lord, I begge grace an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, that I may have power to glorifie Chriſt. It is for the honour of my Lord Chriſt that I come. When the ſoul comes thus in Chriſts name, beleeving it ſhall ſpeed, then his prayer ſhal prevail. Whatſoever (ſaith Chriſt) ye ſhall aske the Father in my name, he will give it you.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the third and laſt part of our Text: to wit, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies they had againſt danger and diſcouragements. The Lord upheld their hearts from being diſmayed in prayer; thou ſaidſt, feare not.</p>
                  <p>There be two things that do much hurt in prayer.</p>

                  <p>We have abundance of ſayings amongſt us, that if they were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned would prove falſe and unſound; As, that the vipers dye when they bring forth their young; for (ſay they) the young eat out the old ones bowels; that beares ſhape all their young by licking of them; that the Swanne ſingeth ſweeteſt at her death; that the Adamant ſtone is ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Goats blood, &amp;c.

It is commonly beleeved, if men come to Church, heare the Word, and call upon God, that then preſently they are good Chriſtians. Beloved, it is not ſo, Mat. 7. 21.

                  <p>Men are ready when they can but call, Lord have mercy on me; O ſweet Saviour pitty me, moſt mercifull Lord Jeſus, have compaſſion on me: if they can pray in their families, and pray at Church, &amp;c. to think, now, all is well with them, and Chriſt cannot but ſave them, and give them the Kingdome of Heaven: but our Saviour puts a not upon it, and ſaith, not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord: it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a Lord, a Lording of Chriſt with the tongue onely: it is not a taking up of an outward profeſſion of Chriſt only, that is ſufficient for a man that ſhall inherit the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: no ſaith Chriſt: but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. But, of this by the by.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are needleſſe diſcouragements which doe much hurt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in prayer. Nee leſſe diſcouragements do much hurt to many a poor ſoule, that hath forcible wouldings, and wracked deſires after grace and holineſſe, and yet is held by diſcouragements: yea, many a Chriſtian heart lieth a long time under it, wreſtling and ſtriving under its wants, and yet, kept out from grace, and from growing in grace becauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements: yea, the beſt and ſtrongeſt of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Saints, have been kept off, and have hung much on diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Fear not, ſaith God to Abraham, Gen. 15. 1. So, fear not Joſhua, ſaith God, to Joſhua, Joſh. 1. 9. Intimating that both Abraham and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua were afraid of diſcouragements: they were afraid that many evils would befall them, that they ſhould meet with many rubs and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that would be too hard for them: therefore the Lord calls to them, fear not, be not djſmayed nor diſcouraged. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ou ſaidſt, fear not. Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <p>That God would not have any Chriſtian ſoul to be diſcouraged in<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> prayer. Thou ſaidſt, fear not.</p>
                  <p>For our clearer prooceeding herein, firſt, let me ſhew you what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is: and ſecondly, how it comes to be dangerous and hurtfull in prayer.</p>
                  <p>What is diſcouragement?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a baſe diſmayment of ſpirit below or beneath the ſtrength that is<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> in a man, under the apprehenſion of ſome evill, as if it were too hard for him to grapple with it.</p>
                  <p>There be foure things in this diffinition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay, it is a baſe diſmayment of ſpirit; and ſo I call it to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it: for there is an humble diſmayment which a Chriſtian is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. A man is bound to be diſmayed for his ſinnes. I ſay. 32. 11.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44191:138"/>
Tremble ye careleſſe women that are at eaſe, be troubled ye careleſſe ones: theſe careleſſe ones went on in their ſinnes, and feared not. God calls to them and bids them to be diſmayed. But the diſmayment and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement I ſpeak of, it is a baſe diſmayment of ſpirit; which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he is diſmayed that ought not: or he is diſmayed at that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he ought not to fear: where no cauſe of fear is.</p>
                  <p>As he that riding along upon the high way, ſpying a mans ſhape, thought it was ſome Spirit: and thereupon he ſickened and died. So many a poor ſoul looking in the perfect Law of God, and ſeeing his own uglineſſe and filthineſſe, he is diſcouraged, and thinks himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; his heart waxeth cold within him, and he begins to fear that he is but a dead and damned man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is down beneath the ſtrength that is in a man: that man is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> properly ſaid to be diſcouraged, not that he hath no ſtrength at all in him nor no courage at all (for ſuch a one is an infeebled man, not a man diſcouraged) but a diſcouraged man is a man put beſides the courage that is in him; when a man hath ſtrength enough to grapple with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill before him, but through diſmayment, of ſpirit he cannot put it forth.</p>
                  <p>Have not I commanded thee? ſaith God to Joſhua. Be ſtrong and of a good courage, be not afraid, neither be thou diſmaied, Ioſh. 1: 9. God had given Joſhua ſtrength enough, whereby he was inabled to obſerve and do according to all that Law which Moſes the ſervant of the Lord commanded him; God had now doubled his Spirit upon him: yet he commands him, be not afraid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither diſmayed: as if he had ſaid, Joſhua, if thou beeſt diſmayed and diſcouraged, though thou haſt ſtrength and power to go through the buſineſſe that I have called thee unto, yet thou wilt not be able to uſe it, nor to put it forth, if thou beeſt diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is at the apprehenſion of ſome evill. I ſay not at the ſight of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſome evill: for a man may be diſmayed at the apparition of good, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry when ſhe ſaw nothing but a good Angell, Luke 1. 29. ſhe ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a glorious Angel: nevertheleſſe ſhe was afraid, and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Why? becauſe ſhe had a ſecret apprehenſion of ſome evill, either of ſome evill proceeded in the ſalutation, or ſome unworthineſſe in her ſelfe to receive ſuch a gracious ſalutation: it cannot be the apprehenſion of any good that diſcourageth a man, but the apprehenſion of ſome evill.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, not of every evill neither; for if the evill be but ſmall, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> will ſtand it out; but it is of ſuch an evill as he fears he is not able to grapple withall. If the evill before him be inferiour to him, he ſcornes it as the barking of a toothleſſe Dog. If it be but an evill equall to his ſtrength, then he makes a tuſh at it, becauſe he knowes, or thinkes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe able to encounter with it.</p>
                  <p>But if it be an evill above his ſtrength, then his ſpirit melts and droops before him. See this in Saul 1 Sam. 17. 11. and his people. When they ſaw the Champion of the Philiſtims coming againſt them, when they ſaw him ſo hugely and marvelouſly armed, and heard him ſpeake ſuch bigge words, they thought they were not able to ſtand and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44191:138"/>
to encounter with him; and therefore ſaith the Text, when Saul and all Iſrael heard theſe words of the Philiſtim, they were diſmayed and greatly afraid.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what diſcouragement is;</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond queſtion, to ſhew how diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come to be hurtfull in prayer: ſuch diſcouragements the Lord would not have our hearts to be in, when we pray unto him.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, God cannot give ear to that man that is out of heart in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Thou canſt never pray if thou beeſt diſmaied in prayer. When the ſoul begins to feare and reaſon, O I am ſo unworthy that God will not looke at me; I am ſo ſinfull, ſo blockiſh, ſo dead, and dull to all good, that God will never regard me. Thou canſt never pray, Rom. 10. 14. How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not beleeved? If thou doſt not beleeve that God will hear thee, if thou doſt not believe that thou ſhalt prevaile, that God will deliver thee out of theſe corruptions and that luſt that thou praieſt againſt; that God will give thee this grace o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that grace: if thou doſt not beleeve that God will own thee: if thou haſt theſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſcouragements, O, he will not grant me, I ſhall never get this or that: how canſt thou call on him? thou mayeſt call ſo and ſo: but never canſt thou call to any purpoſe, if thou doſt not beleeve in him.</p>
                  <p>A begger though he be never ſo well able to begge, yet if when he comes to the Houſe-keepers dore, he be perſwaded that he ſhall not ſpeed, that let him beg as long as he will, he ſhall get nothing: this blunts his begging, and makes him give over his ſuit without any great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: So, it is impoſſible that ever a ſoul ſhould hold out and pray that is diſcouraged in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou canſt not pray unleſſe thou uſe all thy ſtrength in prayer; If thou bee diſcouraged, thou canſt not uſe thy ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>A diſcouraged man, his ſtrength melts into feare; and whatſoever ſtrength he hath, he cannot put it forth. How came Jacob to prevaile and to have power with God? Why, he uſed all his ſtrength with God, and ſo prevailed, Hoſea 12. 3. Thou canſt never prevaile with God by thy prayers, unleſſe thou putreſt forth all thy ſtrength in prayer.</p>
                  <p>If Jacob had reaſoned I am but duſt and aſhes; how can I ſtrive with God? I am ſinfull and evill, how, can I contend with my Maker? and ſo have been diſcouraged in his wraſtling, he could not have uſed all his ſtrength with God, and ſo had never prevailed with God. No, Jacob he gathers all the arguments that he could make; he gathers together all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he could finde in Gods Book, or that he could heare of; he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaies all the wants that he could ſhew; he petitions all the graces that he could name; he uſed all his ſtrength, and by his ſtrength he had power with God.</p>
                  <p>If thy confeſſion of thy ſins be ſtrengthleſſe; if thy petitions, and thankeſgiving for grace be ſtrengthleſſe; if thou uſe not all thy
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:44191:139"/>
ſtrength in prayer, thou canſt never prevaile, nor have any power with God. For how can that man prevail and have power with God that hath no power with himſelfe?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou canſt never pray, and have a fearfull apprehenſion of evill in prayer; thou canſt not. It is good to have a deep apprehenſion of thy ſinnes: apprehend them to be as many hells as thou eanſt, thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver apprehend them deeply enough: but if thou haſt a fearfull appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of them, thou canſt never pray.</p>
                  <p>When the Apoſtle would exhort the Philippians to continue in one Spirit, and in one minde, fighting together through the faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, he exhorts them that in nothing they fear, Phil. 1. 27, 28. For if a man be terrified with his adverſary, with the power of his adverſay, and fears he ſhall never be able to withſtand him, but muſt fall before him through his ſubtilty, that he can never be wary enough for him: Alas, he can never ſtrive with hope and courage againſt him. So, beloved, if we have a fearfull and diſcouraged kind of apprehenſion of evill, we can never pray ſo as to prevail.</p>
                  <p>Apprehend thy ſinnes to be as helliſh, and as damnable as thou canſt: Feele even the fire of hell in every one of them: but take heed of a fearfull apprehenſion of them, ſo to apprehend the evill of them, as to thinke with thy ſelfe that becauſe thou art guilty of theſe and theſe ſinnes, that thou ſhalt never get in with God again, God will never be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thee: theſe will eate out thine heart in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we can never pray if we have any ſecret deſpair, that there is any difficulty too hard for us to grapple withall, or to get through in our prayers. Howſoever a man praies, yet if he have any ſpice of theſe fears in him, to think now I have taken a great deale of paines, but am never the better; I have prayed and prayed, but have got no good: I may goe on and doe thus and thus, but ſhall never prevail or ſpeed; all my labours, all my prayers and indeavours will be loſt, this takes away the very ſpirit and life of a mans prayers.</p>
                  <p>Judas after he had betrayed the Lord Jeſus, he was diſcouraged from ever praying for mercy. Why? becauſe he thought it was impoſſible for him to get it; I have betrayed innocent blood, ſaith he. Matth. 27 3. as if he ſhould ſay, I ſhal never outwraſtle this ſin; this ſin is my death: I have brought the blood of the Son of God on me, I ſhall never claw off this ſin: now Judas thus deſpayring, we never read one letter of any prayer that he made to God to get out of it; no, he thought it too hard for him to get mercy. Deſpaire drives a man from that he did hope for; becauſe now he thinks there is an impoſſibility in getting of it.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, miſtake me not; there is a double deſperation:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a deſperation of infidelity; and that deads and drawes the ſoule from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a deſperation of extremity; And if ever you mean to come to God and to get any grace from God, you muſt come with deſperation of extremity, this deſperation puts life into a mans prayers and indeavours,</p>
                  <p>As a Souldier, when he ſeeth nothing but to kill or be killed, that he
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44191:139"/>
ſees his ſtate deſperate; why, this will compell a very coward to fight; this will make a coward fight (as if he would kill the Devil, ſaith the Proverb) it will make him fight like a ſpirit; he will be afraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Take a Souldier that fights deſperately for his life, with a kill or be killed; he feares nothing; neither Pike nor Sword, nor Gun; why? he fights for his life. Therefore one notes that ſometimes it is the neareſt way to victory to be deſperate in attempts and in fight. Therefore when William the Conquerour came firſt into England, at Haſtings, he ſent back his Ships again, that ſo the Souldiers might have no hope of ſaving themſelves by flying back. And ſo at Battle, at one encounter, a little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Engliſh ſlew a great Army of the French. Why? they grew deſperate.</p>
                  <p>So, could men pray deſperately, could they pray with a pray or be damned: begge with a begge or be damned; ſeek to God for grace that you want with a ſpeed or be damned; then would their prayers be more earneſt and powerfull to get grace. O, did men pray thus, they would pray otherwiſe then they doe.</p>
                  <p>Men pray, but they pray deadly, coldly, and lazily, as if they had no need of prayer, or as if they had no need of the grace they pray for; they pray for grace but get it not; they pray for zeale, but have it not; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and holineſſe, but obtaine it not.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, either get zeale and holineſſe, or elſe there is no mercy: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther get grace and repentance, or elſe there is no mercy for thee. Pray then when thou prayeſt for grace, with a ſpeed or be damned; ſay unto thy ſoul, either we muſt ſpeed and get grace Soule, or elſe we muſt goe to hell. If men would pray thus, with a ſpeed or be damned we ſhould never ſee, nor God ſhould never heare ſo many cold and dead prayers as now we pray.</p>
                  <p>Deſpaire makes a man a Munke ſaith the Papiſt: but this deſpaire makes a man a good Chriſtian I ſay: never doth a man pray indeed till he feels himſelf in extremity, hopeleſſe and deſperate in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; ſo that he ſeeth no remedie at all but get Chriſt, get grace or be damned for ever. Get power and ſtrength over theſe corruptions: otherwiſe they will destroy and damne thee; this would make a man pray for life. Men pray coldly and faintly: why? becauſe though they ſee they have no grace, no zeale, no holineſſe, no repentance, no evidence of Chriſt: yet they hope to be ſaved notwithſtanding. O belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the divell hath blinded theſe men to the intent they may be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>But if men would pray deſperate prayers with a pray or be damned; ſeek with a find or be damned: men would then pray other prayers than they doe. Such prayers did David pray, Pſal. 130. 1. Out of the deep places have I called unto thee O Lord, Lord heare my prayer: as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, I am even in the depth of miſery, plunged over head and eares, ſo that now I ſinke and periſh if thou help net: Lord, hear my prayer. This deſperation a Chriſtian muſt have, this quickens up his Spirits, and puts life into him: but take heed of the deſperation of Infidelity: Saint Austin ſaith it is the murtherer of the ſoule: the ſpice of it will eate out
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44191:140"/>
the heart of a man, and kill the ſtrength of all his endeavours.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now come to apply this Doctrine; but I feare me there be many amongſt us, that never come ſo farre towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as to know what theſe diſcouragements meane. This is lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>It is true, diſcouragements are hideous caſes in prayer, and a man may periſh and goe to hell that hath them: but yet they are ſomewhat profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſignes that a man doth at the leaſt look a little towards God, or elſe he could not know what they are. But there are abundance that never have attained ſo farre in religion, as to underſtand what they meane: but goe on in drinking, whoring, carding and dicing, hating and malicing, fretting and chafing, mocking and coveting, ſwearing and blaſpheming, in ſecurity, in heardneſſe of heart and impenitency: they are more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for their doggs, for their potts, and for their tables, and for their ſhops, than they are of their ſouls: And which is enough to aſtoniſh any that is godly, theſe men ſcarce find any diſcouragements in prayer: O, they have a good courage to pray at all tims: O, ſay they, God forbid that any man ſhould be diſcouraged in praier: I thank God I have a good hope in God; God hath given me a good heart of grace to call upon him, and I make no queſtion but that God heares me: God would never bid us to pray if he did not mean to hear us.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, theſe men that are ſo bold in the goodneſs of their hearts to call upon God, they never as yet prayed in all their lives: all the prayers of the wicked are indeed no prayers.</p>
                  <p>Daniel confeſſing the ſinnes of wicked Judah, ſaith, Though all this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill be come upon us, yet made we not our prayer to turne from our wicked ways, Dan. 9. 13. all the time of thoſe ſeventy yeares, Daniel ſaith they never made prayer to God; yet they faſted every year, and prayed every day, twiſe every day at the leaſt, which would amount in that time to 50000 and 100 prayers: how then could Daniel ſay they never made one pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? I anſwer, (and pray mark it) becauſe they never did quite turn from their evill wayes. Though thou makeſt never ſo many prayers, though thou boaſteſt of the goodneſſe of thy condition, and ſnatcheſt at the Promiſes of God: yet if thou turneſt not from thine iniquities, thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as yet mad'ſt any prayer by the Judgement of God himſelf. Paul made many thouſand prayers before his converſion, he could not have been a Phariſee elſe; but they were never accounted prayers to him: therefore as ſoon as ever he was converted, behold ſaith God, he prayeth, Acts 9.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man, a carnall Chriſtian, though he have the righteouſneſs of Saint Paul before his converſion, of living blameleſſe, unreprovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in reſpect of the outward righteouſneſſe of the Law: yet he can never make an acceptable prayer, till he be truely converted; his prayers are no better than howling of dogs, or lowing of Oxen, yea the Lord abhorrs them. O what poor incouragements canſt thou have, ſeeing the Lord never tallies down any of thy prayers? wicked men are like Ulyſſes, who wept more for the death. of his dogge, than of his wife; ſo wicked men weep and mourne for the loſſe of their corn and their
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44191:140"/>
cattle, hawkes and hounds, cardes and dice: but never for the loſſe of their praiers. So long as thou continueſt in thy prophaneneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, thou loſeſt all thy praiers: there is not one of them that God tallies down, or reckons for a praier. Here we minht have a great deale of matter, if time would ſuffer me. But it will not, onely let me tell you, I ſpeak onely to thoſe whoſe hearts God hath awakened out of their ſins, but who are oft diſcouraged: take heed of theſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>For, firſt, they will drive thee to melancholy. Beloved, there are a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> many melancholy men in the world, and this is the cauſe of it; men are contented to be converted by halves: becauſe they are diſcouraged in the worke. If thou ſuffer thy ſelfe to be diſcouraged, it will ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e up thy ſpirit and thou wilt be like a ſilly dove without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a heart, Hoſea 7. 11. A dove is a melancholy creature, that hath no heart to any thing; ſo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharaim hath no heart to call upon God, no heart to returne unto God: and this is the cauſe that men and women goe whineing and mourning under the burden of ſin, and are not able to come out, becauſe of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements: all the policy of hell is leſſe than this policy of the divell, in driving men to deſpair or diſcouragements: this doth more hurt than all the reſt of hell beſides.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you do not take heed of them, they will bring you to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſpeake againſt God, I have prayed, but the Lord will not heare me: I have called, and the Lord will not anſwer, but hath turned away his eares from me. Now, thou ſpeakeſt againſt God. Num. 21. 4. 5. The ſoule of the people was much diſcouraged, and the people ſpake againſt God and againſt Moſes, ſaying, Wherefore have you brought us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderneſse? for here is neither bread nor water, and our ſoule loatheth this light bread. So, beloved, if we ſuffer our ſoules to be diſcouraged, we ſhall ſoone come to murmure againſt God: wherefore hath he brought me up to this ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and preciſeneſſe? when I was a drunkard, a worldling, when I followed the luſt of my fleſh and liberty, then I enjoyed onions, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and the fleſh-pots of Egypt: pleaſures and delights for my ſoule: then I had a good hope in God, and a good perſwaſion that my ſoul ſhould goe to heaven: and then Preachers told me that if I would give over ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, and look after Heaven a little more and doe ſuch and ſuch things; O then I ſhould come to a Land flowing with milke and honey; then I ſhould not miſſe of glory and ſalvation. But alas, I ſee nothing but Gyants and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nakims; I am in a wilderneſſe; now, now I ſee a man may have a great deal of repentance, and yet be a caſt away; A man may have a great deal of faith and yet be but a reprobate; A man may give over a great many ſins, and yet periſh in hell; now I ſee a man may live civilly and well, and have and do a great many good things, and yet be damned when he hath done all: A man may even go to Heaven Gates, and yet the gates be ſhut againſt him, and he turned into hell. Alas, my poor ſoul is in a wilderneſſe; now I know not which way to goe; I am ready to loſe my ſelfe, I ſee nothing here now but huge Gyants, the ſons of Anack, ſtrong corruptions, inclining and forcing me to evill;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44191:141"/>
moſt fearefull and violent ſuggeſtions and temptations of the Devill, ready to thruſt me into the gulfe of wickedneſſe and deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>And now, the ſoule begins to thinke that it is good for it to returne again into Egypt, to fall to its old courſes again: for certainly God looks for no ſuch matter, he requires no ſuch ſtrictneſſe and preciſeneſſe: And ſo it falls a whining and repining at the Word and Miniſters of God that have call'd men to it, and laid it upon them: and hath no heart now to do thus and thus any longer. And thus it falls into diſcouragements becauſe of the way, and into a thouſand quandaries whether it may not go back again or no. And all theſe murmurings and repinings are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men ſuffer themſelves to be diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, diſcouragements will cauſe thee to think that God hates thee. When the ſoul like Baals Prieſts, 1. Kings 18. 26. hath been crying from morning to noon; ten, twenty, thirty yeeres, it may be, and yet hath no anſwer; now it will begin to think, if God did love me, then he would grant me my petitions. Then hereupon comes into a mans ſecret thoughts and feare: that God hardly loves his ſoule. So was it with Iſrael; when they were diſcouraged, they ſaid, becauſe the Lord hated us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brought us out of the Land of Egypt, Deut. 1. 27. Becauſe that they were diſcouraged, and becauſe that their Brethren that went for ſpies, had diſheartned them; therefore they were apt to ſay the Lord hated them.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, it is a miſerable thing when the ſoule calls the love of God into queſtion. Conſider that as thou canſt not have a friend if thou beeſt ſuſpitious and jealous of his love to thee: So, thou canſt never have the love of God ſettled on thy heart ſo long as thou art jealous of his love to thee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If thou root them not out, it is to be feared that they will bring thee to deſpair. Melancholy thoughts and feares, and diſcouragements, drive the ſoul to deſpaire. For when the ſoul ſees it ſelfe ſtill diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of its hopes, at the laſt it growes hopeleſſe: If it have waited one day and the next day too: if it have prayed this weeke, this moneth, this year, and yet ſtill it ſeeth it ſelfe held off and diſappointed: it will at laſt grow hopeleſſe. Take heed therefore, I beſeech you, of all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diſcouragements; to fear becauſe that thou findeſt not that that thou wiſhedſt or prayedſt for, to day or to morrow, in thine own time, that therefore thou ſhalt never get it, that now thou ſhouldeſt for ever deſpaire of the grace and love of God, and think that now God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear thee, that thou ſhalt never get grace and power over thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Men think that the preaching of the Word of God brings men to deſpaire, the preaching of ſuch ſtrict points and the urging ſuch preciſe doctrines makes men deſpaire: men are loth to be at the paines to root out their diſcouragements: It is rather a cold or dead preaching of the Word that is the cauſe of this: for when the ſoule is inſtructed by holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse, humbled by holineſſe, converted by holineſſe, at the laſt when it comes to be thorowly awakened, when it ſees that this and this is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a true converſion of the ſoule to God, that herein true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:44191:141"/>
muſt declare and demonſtrate it ſelfe by theſe and theſe fruits, or elſe it is but falſe and rotten: Why now, the ſoul muſt needs be brought to deſpaire, becauſe it ſeeth that though it have been thus and thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, though it have praied, faſted and mourned in this and this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: yet it ſees it hath not a ſoundeſſe of grace.</p>
                  <p>There is ſuch a grace in it, ſuch a worke and ſuch a fruit of Gods Spirit in it, that yet he could never finde in himſelfe: this makes the ſoule to deſpaire. Indeed Preachers may be to blame, if they ſpeake and preach onely the terrours and condemnations of the Law without the promiſes of the Goſpel: for theſe ſhould be ſo tempered that every poore broken ſoule may ſee mercy and redemption for him upon his ſound and unfeigned repentance and humiliation. But if men doe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, they may thanke themſelves for it, their owne ſinnes for it, their owne diſcouragements for it, becauſe they ſuffer theſe to continue in them.</p>
                  <p>Cain his heart grew ſad, his conntenance fell, he was wroth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiered in his minde, and heavily diſcouraged; why? Gen. 4. Sin lay at the dore, (what dore?) the dore of his conſcience, rapping and beating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, when the ſoule lets ſin lie at the dore: drunkenneſſe, pride and worldlineſſe, ſecurity, hardneſſe and deadneſſe of heart lie at the dore: when a man lets his negligent and fruitleſſe hearing of the word lie at the dore, when a man lets his vaine and dead praying, his tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and faſhionary ſerving of God lie at the dore of conſcience, to tell him that all his hearing of the word of God profits him nothing, that his praiers are dead and vain, that his mourning, faſting, and all his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation is counterfeit and rotten, and that he hath no ſoundneſſe of grace in him, but that for all this he may fall into hell: when ſin l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth thus at the dore, thus rapping at the conſcience, it is no wonder if the ſoule fall into deſperation, as it was here.</p>
                  <p>Cain let his ſinne lie at the dore, there it lay rapping and beating, and told him that his careleſſeneſſe and negligent ſacrificing to God was not accepted: and therefore no marvell if Cain be ſo caſt down in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and that he fall to deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>O beloved, when ſinne lieth bouncing and beating at the doore of thy heart, when thy ſinne (whatſoever it is, ſearch thy heart and finde it out) lies knocking and rapping at the dore of thy conſcience day by day, and moneth by moneth, and thou art content to let it lie, and art unwilling to uſe meanes to remove it, and art loth to take the paines to get the bloud of Chriſt to waſh thy ſoule from it, or the Spirit of Chriſt to cleanſe thee from it; then thy ſoule wil deſpaire, either in this world, or in the world to come. But let us take heede then, that our conſcience condemne us not in any thing or courſe that we allow in our ſelves: for if that doe, then much more will God, who is greater than our conſciences, and knows all things.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle hath an excellent Phraſe: Rom. 8. 1. There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, there is
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44191:142"/>
not one condemnation; there is none in Heaven, God doth not condemne them; there is none in earth, their own heart and conſcience doth not condemne them; to him that is in Chriſt Jeſus, that walks not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, there is none, no not one condemnation to him; none, neither in Heaven nor in earth: no word, no commandement, no threatning condemns him. But if thy conſcience condemn thee, and tell thee thou letteſt ſinne lie at the doore, rapping at thy conſcience day after day, and moneth after moneth, telling thee that yet thou art without Chriſt, that yet thou never hadſt any true faith in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that yet thou haſt not truly repented, and turned from thy ſins: this will at laſt drive thy ſoul into heavy diſcouragements, if not into final deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire.</p>
                  <p>O beloved, religion and piety, and the power of Godlineſſe, goe down the wind every where. What is the reaſon of it, but becauſe of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements that men live and go on in? Men pray and pray, and their prayers profit them not: men run up and down and come to the Church and heare the Word, and receive the Sacraments, and uſe the meanes of grace, but to no end: they are unprofitable to them: they remaine in their ſinnes ſtill: the ordinances of God bring them not out of their luſts and corruptions: hereby they diſgrace and diſcredit the ordinances of God in the eyes and account of the men of the world, making them think as if there were no more power nor force in the Ordinances of God than theſe men manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>There is no life in many Chriſtians, mens ſpirits are diſcouraged; theſe ſecret diſcouragements in their hearts take away their ſpirits in the uſe of the meanes, that though they uſe the meanes, yet it drives them to deſpaire of reaping good; or profit by them.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, I could here tell you enough to make your hearts ake to hear it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, All your complaints, they are but winde, Job. 6. 26. Doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> you imagine to reprove words, and the ſpeeches of one that is deſperate, which are as winde? Jobs friends taking Job to be a man of deſpaire, they accounted all his words but as wind.</p>
                  <p>Doe thou neſtle any diſcouragement in thy heart? thou maiſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of ſinne as much as thou canſt: yet all thy complainings are but as winde: thou mayeſt cry out againſt thy corruptions, with weeping and teares, and pray and fight againſt them: and yet all thy weeping, mourning and praying is but as the winde: thou maieſt beg grace, thou maieſt ſeek after God, thou maiſt heare the Word, receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet all will be to thee as wind: all will vaniſh, be unprofitable, not regarded.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, diſcouragements drive us from the uſe of the meanes. If ever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we meane to come out of our ſinnes, if ever we meane to get grace and faith, and aſſurance, and zeale: we muſt conſtantly uſe the meanes, 1 Sam. 27. 1. David ſaith, There is nothing better for me than that I ſhould ſpeedily eſcape into the Land of the Philiſtins, and Saul ſhall deſpaire of me to ſeek me any more. David thought in himſelf, if I can make him out of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:44191:142"/>
hope of finding me, certainly he will give over ſeeking of me. So when the ſoule hath any ſecret deſpaire of finding the Lord, that ſoul will quickly be drawn from ſeeking of the Lord in the uſe of the meanes.</p>
                  <p>What ever you doe then; O be not diſcouraged, leſt you be driven from the uſe of the meanes: if you be driven from the uſe of the meanes, woe is to you, you will never finde God then. Be not driven from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor driven from holy conference, nor driven for the Word, nor dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the Sacrament, nor from meditation, nor from the diligent and ſtrict examination of thy ſelfe, of thy heart and of all thy wayes: for theſe are the wayes of finding the Lord. If you nouriſh any thoughts and fears of deſpaire in you, if you be diſcouraged, you will be driven from the uſe of the meanes, which is a lamentable thing; therefore be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, diſcouragements will make you ſtand poaring on your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſes, This I ſhould have done, and that I ſhould have done, woe is me that I did it not: it will make a man ſtand poaring on his ſinnes, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to get out of them. So it was like to be with them in the Ship with Paul, Acts 27. 20. In the tempeſt at Sea, they were utterly diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from any hope of ſafety: now indeed Paul told them what they ſhould have done if they had been wiſe: Sirs, you ſhould have hearkned to me, and not have looſed, verſe 21. as if he had ſaid, you ſhould have done thus and thus: but now doe not ſtand poaring too much on that, you ſhould have hearkned to me, and not have launched forth, &amp;c but that cannot be holpen, now: therefore I exhort you to be of good chear, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So beloved, when the ſoul is diſcouraged upon theſe thoughts, I ſhould have prayed better, I ſhould have heard the Word of God better, and with more profit; I ſhould have repented better, I ſhould have performed this and that religious and good dutie better; but ah wretch that I am, I have ſinned thus and thus; it is alwayes looking on this ſinne and that ſinne, this imperfection and that failing, when now I ſay the ſoule is diſcouraged, it will be alwayes poaring upon ſinne, but it will never come out of its ſinne; alwayes poaring upon its deadneſſe, and unprofitableneſſe, but never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come out of it. O beloved, be of good cheare, and be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; it is true you ſhould have prayed better; you ſhould have heard the word of God better heretofore, you ſhould have been more carefull and circumſpect of your wayes than you were; but now you cannot help it; theſe things and times are gone, and cannot be recalled: ſuch a one hath been a drunkard, a ſwearer, a worldling, &amp;c. but he cannot help it now. True, he might have helped it, and becauſe he did not, his heart ſhall bleed for it, if he belong to God: but doe not ſtand poaring too much upon it, but conſider now what you have to doe, now you are to humble your ſelves, now you are to ſtrive with God in all manner of prayer for more grace, and more power of obedience and aſſurance, and be not diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If the ſoule be diſcouraged, it will breed nothing but ſorrow.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:44191:143"/>
What is the reaſon that many Chriſtians are alwayes weeping, and mourning, and ſighing, and ſobbing, from day to day, all their life time, and will not be comforted? becauſe of theſe diſcouragements, 1 Theſ. 4. 13. Sorrow not (ſaith the Apoſtle) as thoſe that have no hope, as if he had ſaid, ſorrow if you will; but do not ſorrow as they that have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o hope.</p>
                  <p>How is that? it is a ſorrow with nothing but ſorrow, from which they have no hope of inlargement or freedome.</p>
                  <p>O then my brethren, ſuppoſe you have dead hearts, ſuppoſe you want zeale, you want aſſurance; ſuppoſe it be ſo, yet labour to attain theſe grace; ſorrow and ſpare not; weepe and mourne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and powre out whole buckets of teares for your ſinnes, if you can: but, ſorrow not with nothing but ſorrow: be not diſcouraged: ſuppoſe that thou haſt a dead heart, that thou art an hypocrite, that thou haſt a rotten heart; it is a heavy thing, and a fearful caſe indeed, for which thou haſt great cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and ſorrow; but yet ſorrow not deſperately as men without hope: be not wholly diſcouraged, but as you ſorrow for your ſinnes, ſo alſo labour with incouragement to get cut and be rid of your ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Diſcouragements breed and procure a totall perplexity. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> leave the ſoul in a maze, that it knows not whither to turne it ſelf When men come to be diſcouraged, O what ſhall I do ſaith one? I am utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done ſaith another: I know not what will become of me, ſaith a third: Oh I am utterly loſt, I ſhall periſh one day, one day God will diſcover me, and be avenged on me for this and that ſin: I were as good go to he lat the firſt as at the laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that will be the end of me. I have gone to prayer, but that doth not helpe me: I have gone to Sacraments, but I find no help: ſtill my ſoule lies under the power of ſinne ſtill my ſinnes are as ſtrong in me as ever: Thus the ſoule is diſcouraged and cries out, Oh, what ſhall I doe? I know not what to doe. What ſhall I doe, ſayeſt thou?</p>
                  <p>Alas, thou haſt things enough to doe, if thou wert not diſcouraged. Utterly undone! No, man, thou mighteſt ſee that thou art not utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done but that thou art diſcouraged. Doſt thou not know what will be come of thee? yea, poore ſoule, there is mercy, grace and peace for thee, if thou wilt not be diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Diſcouragements whiſper within a man a ſentence of death, and an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> impoſſibility of eſcaping. As far as the diſcouragement of life goeth, ſo far goeth the ſentence of death. We deſpaired of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 1. 8. 9. he deſpaired of life in himſelfe, and therfore had the ſentence of death in himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this was good, but he did not deſpaire of life in God; for then he ſhould have had likewiſe the ſentence of death from God in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>If you deſpaire in the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have the ſentence of death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from God in your conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take heed of this my beloved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not diſcouraged in God: do not deſpaire in the Lord: that will work a
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:44191:143"/>
miſerable effect in your ſouls: it will ſecretly whiſper a ſentence of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in your ſoules.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtrange to conſider how many poore ſoules rub on with theſe whiſpering ſentences in their boſomes, ſuffering their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences day by day, to tell them that they are rotten, to tell them that they were never yet converted, to tell them that they are yet in the ſtate of damnation, and yet they will not root out theſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>O goe to the Throne of grace, begge for grace and for mercie and for power againſt ſinne, and bee not diſcouraged. What? wilt thou carry thine owne ſentence of death in thy breaſt? if thou wilt not rouze up thy ſoule, and pray with more affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confidence, and ſhake off diſcouragements, take heed leaſt thou carry the ſentence of thine owne death and damnation in thy bowels. Oh therefore once more let mee beſeech you to take heede of theſe diſcouragements, and now hearken unto the voice of God, which calleth upon you, Feare not. Thou drew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est nigh in the day that I called upon thee; Thou ſaidest, Feare not.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, they are upbraiding groanes, Give ears Oh ye heavens, and I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will ſpeak, and hear Oh earth the words of my lips. Deut. 32. 1. as if God had ſaid, mark O ye heavens, and let all the whole world hear what I teſtify againſt this people: as if the heavens and the earth did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid them of their unthankfulneſſe. God commands the Sun to ſhine, and it ſhineth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the earth to fructify, and it obeyeth: But this wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he commands to repent and forſake their ſins, and they will not.</p>
                  <p>Chryſoſtome ſaith, wicked men although they have naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in them, are more ſenceleſs than ſenceleſſe creatures: the rocks, and the flints, the flye and the gnats may upbraid them; the rocks rent in ſunder, but this people will not rent their hearts; ſwarmes of flies were hiſs'd for to come, and they yielded obedience; and the liveleſſe creatures groan under the ſlavery of ſin: but they will not obey, they will not be brought to groan for their ſins. How do all the creatures upbraid man! Do ye thus requite the Lord O ye fooliſh people and unwiſe?</p>
                  <p>Beloved, how do the heavens and the earth upbraide thee for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe; wert thou ever in ſickneſs, and God did not deliver thee? wert thou ever in miſery, and God did not comfort thee? wert thou ever in any ſtraight, and God did not direct thee? in ſickneſs who was life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee? in poverty who ſupplyed thee? in danger who delivered thee? was it no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſhall the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee obedience, and wilt thou not grant it him? doth he command thee to part with thy luſt, and crucify all thy corruptions, and wilt thou not obey him? doth the Lord command thee to be meek, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, patient, and doſt thou refuſe? then, hear O heavens, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken O earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the groans of the creatures are witneſsing groanes. I call <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> heaven and earth to record againſt you: know that you ſhall ſhortly periſh, ſaid Moſes to the Iſraelites. Deut. 4. 26. So beloved, let me ſay to you, I call heaven and earth to record againſt you, that woe and damnation ſhall be to that man that obeys not the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; Curſed be that man, that goeth on ſtill in his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The heavens write his curſe, and the whole earth do witneſs his vengeance, that will not give over his luſt at the commandment of the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As Joſhuah ſaid unto all the people, Joſh. 24. 27. Behold this ſtone ſhall be a witneſſe unto us, for it hath heard all the words of the Lord, which he ſpake unto us; it ſhall be a witneſſe, &amp;c. ſo may I ſay unto you, the walls of this houſe ſhall cry, the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church ſhall anſwer, this Sermon that you have heard, this doctrine that hath been preached unto you, if you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, if you will not humble your ſelves and obey the voyce of your God, all theſe ſhall witneſſe againſt you another day, that you had a time, that you had a day to repent in, you had the

word of God calling you to it, but you would not.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou commit a ſinne? and none by, but the ſtones in the ſtreets? even they ſee thee, like Joſhuah's ſtone with ſeven eyes, and they ſhall witneſſe againſt thee. Doſt thou pray thy lazie prayers unto God, thoughtleſſe of God, and none by but the walls of thy Cloſet, or thy bed, or thy hangings? they ſhall witneſſe againſt thee. Doſt thou ſwear, and blaſpheme the King of Heaven? though none were preſent, but the fowles of the aire, they ſhall carry thy voyce and declare the matter. Eccleſ. 10. 20. If the creatures groan againſt thee, then they are ſenſible in ſome ſort, to witneſſe againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, mens hearts are ſo ſtubborne, that we the Miniſters of God may do as the Prophet did, 1 King. 13. 2. who cried O Altar, Altar, thus ſaith the Lord. What? was the Prophet ſent unto the Altar? had the Altar eares? No, he was ſent unto Jeroboam, his meſſage was to him; but he knew that he would not hear, nor believe, nor obey; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he turned from the King, and ſpake to the ſenceleſſe Altar. So may we ſay for all the hearing ſome will afford us; O walls, walls, thus ſaith the Lord, curſed is the man that obeyeth not. O Houſe of the Lord, witneſſe againſt this rebellious generation.</p>
                  <p>So Jeremy, he cried out, O earth, earth, earth, hear the Word of the Lord, this ſaith the Lord, write this man a cast-away, that ſhall never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, Jer. 22. 29. he meant wicked Jeconiah the King; but becauſe he was a deaf Adder, he preacheth to the dead earth, as being more likely to liſten than he.</p>
                  <p>O fearfull doom! When Jeconiah will not hear, God he roars ſo loud that he makes the dead and ſenceleſſe earth to hear.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, in the fear of God, take heed, if there be any dead worldly-hearted Profeſſor here, if there be any looſe prophane ſinner here, any impenitent wretch that hath not repented, if after the Lord hath ſent his Miniſters to thee, his Word and Goſpell to thee, and thou wilt not hear; take heed leſt the Lord direct his ſpeech to the dead earth, and ſay, O earth, earth, earth, hear the Word of the Lord; write these men, men that ſhall never proſper: they will ſtill covet and lie, they will ſtill fret and chafe, they will ſtill content themſelves with forms of godlineſſe, they will ſtill be lukewarm or key-cold; they do ſtill pray as they did, rub on as they did ſeven years ago; no more holy, no more zealous, no more heavenly, they will not be bettered; O earth, earth earth, hear the Word of the Lord, write them a people that ſhall never proſper, a people that ſhall never be converted; write them men dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ever; let them come and hear Sermon after Sermon, but write them men that ſhall never proſper; let them pray, and let their prayers never proſper; let them go on in their dead-hearted profeſſion, but write them men that ſhall never proſper.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, God forbid that it ſhould ſo be written againſt you, but woe be to you if ever it be! for if once the earth hath wrote this eternall decree of God upon thy ſoule, it can never be altered; I will warrant thee thy damnation ſure.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:44191:145"/>Thirdly, they are accuſing groanes; they ſhall accuſe thee for caſting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thine eye upon a creature, without taking notice of God. They ſhall accuſe thee for thy touching, taſting, handling, uſing any of the creatures without adoration of God. Doſt thou think of a creature, ſpeak of a creature, meddle with a creature, or take poſſeſſion of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? they ſhall accuſe thee, if thou doſt not live to the glory of God the Creator.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, theſe groans are judging and condemning groans. He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſhall call the Heavens above, and the earth to judge his people, Pſal. 50. 4. The creatures groan; why then doſt thou not groan? the creatures account themſelves oppreſſed and fore afflicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are conſtrained to ſerve ſinne; why then doſt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure them?</p>
                  <p>If the King ſhould build him a ſtately Palace, and one ſhould wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly deface it, or abuſe it, or pull it down; would not the very Ravens judge him a Traytor? The creatures are Gods Palace, and thou demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheſt their beauty, by making them the inſtruments, or abettors, or matter, or incentives of ſinne; thou ſhalt be adjudged of High treaſon againſt the King of Kings, for we know that every creature groaneth with us; and travelleth in pain together untill now.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to a third uſe</p>
                  <p>Of Exhortation; doth the creature groan to ſerve ſinne? take heed<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> then you do not abuſe the creatures of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is not any one of them but if it be abuſed to ſin or by ſin, but it will preſently make its complaint (like a little child to his Father) with groans unto God.</p>
                  <p>Labour to be a true Convert unto God; otherwiſe, if thou beeſt not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> regenerate and a Convert, every creature that thou haſt, is in bondage under thy hands, and it groans unto God againſt thee, till God recover it out of thy hands again.</p>
                  <p>I will recover my wooll and my flaxe, ſaith God, Hoſea 2. 9. the creature groaned under thraldome, becauſe it was poſſeſſed by them that were carnall; and therefore God ſayes he would recover it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, labour not to ſinne againſt God. For, if thou ſinneſt againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God, thou canſt not meet with a creature but it groanth againſt thee. When Jonah had ſinned againſt God, the Sea roared againſt Jonah, and he at laſt knew it well enough: for when the Marriners askt what he was, I am an Hebrew ſaith he, and I fear God, the God of Heaven, which hath made the Sea and the dry Land, Ionah 1. 9. as if he ſhould ſay, I fear the Lord, for now I ſee the Heavens are black againſt me: and the clouds mourn at me: and the Sea groaneth under me, ſeeing I am fled from the preſence of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, labour never to ſet your hearts on any creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, then,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> you abuſe it to worldlineſſe, and covetouſneſſe. What greater injury can we offer to the creatures, than by making them occaſions of turning from God, which were given us the more to oblige us to God?</p>
                  <p>If you be covetous and earthly, the creature muſt needs groan under this wrong. Covetouſneſſe is Idolatry, ſaith Saint Paul, Coloſ. 3. 5.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:44191:146"/>
thou turneſt the creature into an Idoll: every creature is the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, but an Idoll is a thing dedicated to Divels.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, labour to uſe all the creatures in humility and thankfulneſſe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> There is not a creature, but it hath this Motto engraven upon it, it is the gift of God. In every thing then give thanks, 1 Theſ. 5. 8. A thing and a creature are convertible termes: if in every thing, then for every creature muſt we give thanks; why? becauſe every thing that God doth for us, or doth beſtow upon us, it is a gift: and a gift groans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unthankfulneſſe: there is never a ſickneſſe that thou haſt been delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from, but it groans againſt thee, if thou haſt not had thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity purged by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never a bleſſing but it will groan againſt thee, if thou ſerve not God the better by it: never an ordinance of life and grace but it groans againſt thee, if thou art not ſanctified and made holy by it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, uſe them all as ſo many Bookes, and as ſo many Ladders or Riſes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to climbe up with the ſoule to God. When thou ſeeſt how kindly and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably the Sun ſhineth on thee, think, are Gods creatures ſo comfortable! how comfortable is the light of Gods countenance? When thou taſteſt the ſweetneſſe of any creature, think then, O what infinite ſweetneſſe is there in God himſelf! ſtill, from the creatures, winde up thy ſoul to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: uſe all the creatures as a riſe to winde up thine heart to ſee and know, to meditate and conceive of ſome thing of God.</p>
                  <p>Saint Anthony being found fault withall for want of Books, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, My Books are Gods creatures, and in them I may read, as in the ſilent Oracles of God; this is my Book, and it hath three pages, and as many Letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heaven, Water, Earth: they are the pages of this book: Stars, Fiſhes, Fowles, and all the Terreſtriall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> creatures, they are the letters of this book.</p>
                  <p>There are but three main Books in the world to be read: all other books are but Commentaries upon them.</p>
                  <p>The Book of the Creatures.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Book of the Scriptures.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Book of every Mans conſcience.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Read but theſe three, and meditate of them, and thou ſhalt have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the wayes of God, to know God in all thy wayes.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, this is rightly to uſe the creatures, and thus uſing them, thou ſhalt prevent their groanings againſt thee: to behold and ſee God preſent in them all.</p>
                  <p>It was the ſaying of an Ancient, that, that man is blind, deaf, ſenſeleſs, brutiſh, that knows not God. Thou canſt not ſee a creature, but thou mayeſt ſee God: thou canſt not feel a creature, but thou mayeſt feel God: thou canſt not ſmell, nor taſte, nor meddle with a creature, but thou mayeſt ſmell and taſte God in the creature: thou canſt not behold a creature, but thou mayeſt behold God in the creature.</p>
                  <p>O ſaith one, if I could ſee God as he appeared to the Fathers, then I ſhould obey him, and fear him, and truſt in him, and love him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:44191:147"/>I anſwer, God appeares now as he did then. How did God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to Abraham, Iſaak, &amp;c. and to all the holy Patriarches and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? Did God appear to them in his own eſſence and nature? No, it is impoſſible that any ſhould ſee God and live. When God appeared to them, and ſhewed himſelfe to them, he did it in the creatures. And I pray you doth not God appeare thus amongſt us now? God having made man to behold by ſenſe, by ſight, hearing, ſmelling, taſting, handling; that all the knowledge he hath, he muſt have it by theſe; God makes as it were a manifeſtation of himſelfe in the Sunne, Moon, and ſtarres, he takes the Cattle, plants, and therein he ſhewes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelfe: thou never ſeeſt any creature but it is a manifeſtation of God to thee: the whole world is an apparition of God to thee; God appears in the heavens, in the earth, and in every creature. If therefore when thou lookeſt on any of the creatures, thou makeſt not an holy uſe of them, beholding God in them, uſing them as a riſe to wind up thy heart and ſoule to God; then thou abuſeſt the creatures, and makeſt them to groan againſt thee. For, we know that the whole creation groaneth and travelling in paine till this preſent.</p>

                  <head>THE CHRISTIAN HIS IMITATION Of CHRIST.</head>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>1 JOHN 2. VER. 6.</bibl>
                     <q>He that ſaith he remaineth in him, ought even ſo to walke as he hath walked.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His our bleſſed Apoſtle in the beginning of this Chapter, doth declare theſe four things,</p>
                  <p>Firſt a generall propoſition of an advocate for the ſinnes of the world; If any man ſinne we have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, verſe 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, an actuall application of this to all true beleevers, who may all know that Chriſt is theirs and that they are Chriſts, ver. 5. And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We know and are acquainted with this principle, that Jeſus Chriſt is the propitiation for our ſinnes, if we keepe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here is the fantasticall preſumtion of many men that hope and think and ſay that they are in Chriſt, when indeed they are not in Chriſt. ver. 4.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:44191:150"/>
He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandements, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, here is an univerſall direction to all men, whereby to try and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelves, whether they be in Chriſt yea or no. He that ſaith he abideth in him ought himſelfe to walk as he walked.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words branch themſelvs into a Theſis and an Hypotheſis.</p>
                  <p>The Theſis is this, He that abideth in Chriſt, muſt walke as he hath walked.</p>
                  <p>The Hypotheſis is this, If any man be conceited of the ſubject, that he abideth in Chriſt, he muſt be aſſured of the predicate, that he walk him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe even as Chriſt walked. If he ſay he is in Chriſt, he muſt be ſure to walke as Chriſt walked.</p>
                  <p>To walke as Chriſt walked; there is a life of a Chriſtian: if he walke not as Chriſt walked, it is a plain demonſtration that he is not in Chriſt. He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelfe alſo to walke as he walked.</p>
                  <p>He that ſaith; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, If there be any that ſaith he abideth in Chriſt, he muſt walke as Chriſt walked.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, That a true Chriſtian he walks as Chriſt walked, if he be in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Before we make entrance hereupon, let me expound to you two things, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t we meere with rubs in the way.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the conditionall, If.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the exemplary As.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for the conditionall, If. it is not a precedent condition of life, as a condigne preparation unto, or a previall diſpoſition for Chriſt: for a man cannot firſt walk as Chriſt walked, and then be in Chriſt. A graft can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live the life of the ſtock, and then be inoculated into the ſtock. No: but it is a ſubſequent condition; if ever a man be in Chriſt, Chriſt holds him to theſe termes, to live as he lived, to walk as he walked.</p>
                  <p>The firſt act is before the latter act: life before the actions of life; ſo walke as Chriſt walked, this notes the actions of life. Now, a man muſt firſt be in Chriſt, before he can walk as Chriſt walked.</p>
                  <p>Indeed this condition is firſt quoad cognoſci, to our knowledge: but it is not firſt quoad eſſe, and in its own nature. So then, to walke as Chriſt walked, being a neceſſary conſequent of being in Chriſt: we cannot be ſaid to be in Chriſt, if we walk not as Chriſt walked: for, take away the neceſſary conſequent and you take away the antecedent; take away the walking as Chriſt walked, and you take away the abiding in Chriſt. This condition is put in by our Saviour. John 15. 10. If ye ſhall keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ye ſhall abide in my love, as I have kept my Fathers commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and abide in his love. This was the walk of Chriſt, he kept his Fathers commandements, and abode in his love. This muſt be your walke too, that looke to abide in Chriſts love. If ye keepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ye ſhall abide in my love. But if there be any commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt in all the Goſpell that you will not conforme to, it is an evident ſigne, that ye abide not in Chriſts love.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the exemplary, As, even as he walked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:44191:150"/>Can any man walke as Chriſt walked? is it poſſible that duſt and aſhes, that is corrupt with ſinne, can walk as he walked?</p>
                  <p>This word, as, hath a twofold ſignification: there is a twofold as, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an as, as importts an equality: or ſecondly ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>As this as imports an equality, ſo it is impoſſible that any fleſh can walk as Chriſt walked: ſo purely, ſo unſpottedly, ſo ſteadily, ſo effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually as he lived. No, for our Saviour Chriſt was filled with the Holy Ghoſt: and of his fulneſſe have we all received grace for grace. John 1. 16. Marke, he doth not ſay that we receive his fullneſſe: but, ſome of his fulneſse: ſo that none can walk as Chriſt walked with an as of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality: but there is an as of ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>A ſcholar writes as his maſters coppy directs him: he begins every line as his maſter begins, he ends as he ends, he ſets himſelfe to frame every letter as his maſter framed it, to joyne letters and ſyllables toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as his maſter joyned them together. Though there be no equality, he cannot write one ſtroke or daſh with his penne ſo well as his maſter: yet he doth write as his maſter ſets his coppy: his hand ſollowes his maſters hand. So it is ſaid of all that are in Chriſt. Revel. 14. 4. that they follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goeth: they follow Chriſt in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in all holineſs, in all his commandments: they track Chriſt in all his ſteps, though they cannot walke with ſuch long ſtrides, ſo ſteadily, ſo purely, ſo conſtantly as Chriſt; yet they labour to track him with this as of ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>Doe all that are in Chriſt, walke as Chriſt walked? yea Beloved, this is a clauſe of the covenant of grace, ſo that a man cannot be in Chriſt, unleſſe he walk as Chriſt walked. For, thus runs the tenour of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: Matth. 11. 29. Learne of me, for I am meeke and lowly of heart, and ye ſhall finde reſt unto your ſoules. Marke, there is no reſt to the ſoule, no grace to the conſcience, no aſſurance of the pardon of ſinne: Chriſt gives no comfort to the heart, unleſſe the heart will learne of Chriſt, follow Chriſt his coppy, be holy as he is holy, pure as he is pure, walk as he walked.</p>
                  <p>This will the better appear, if we conſider that Chriſt his life muſt be the example for our life, according to which we muſt live. Now, the exemplatum muſt be conformable to the exemplary, ſaith Aquinas; the draught muſt be according to the copy; ſo it Chriſts life be the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of our life, then our life muſt be conformable to his life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt declares his wayes unto us, as our ſamplers; Chriſt was humble, and ſerviceable to all in the dayes of his fleſh, with this Motto, John 13. 15. I have given you an example, that you ſhould doe as I have done.</p>
                  <p>Thou art of thy maſter the devill, and his coppy thou followeſt, if thou account it an indignity to ſtoop, a diſgrace to condeſcend to thy brother. Chriſt was willing to ſuffer diſgrace with this Motto, 1. Pet. 2. 21. Leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</p>
                  <p>Art thou loth to practice Religion for fear of the croſſe? loth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove ſinne for fear of a flout, or of the diſpleaſure of a great man: leaſt thou ſhouldeſt procure his ill will? it is evident that thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:44191:151"/>
not Chriſt, becauſe he hath left us an example, that as he ſuffered, ſo alſo ſhould we: Chriſt was obedient to the death of the croſſe, not looking to his owne things ſo much as the things of others; ſo the Apoſtle warneth us, Let the ſame minde bee in you that was in Chriſt Ieſus, 1. Iohn 2. 5. you that bee in Chriſt, muſt have the fame minde that Chriſt had. 1. Iohn 3. 3. Hee that hath this hope, purgeth himſelfe, even as he is pure. Howſoever the world nick-names and reproaches purity, yet if any have this hope (indeed he may have other hopes, he may have vaine, rotten, dead hopes, and never ſeeke after purity) but he that hath this hope, a true ſaving hope to be redeemed by Chriſt, he purifyeth himſelf even as he is pure.</p>
                  <p>Thou then which art not pure, but makeſt a mocke of pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and of conſcience of every ſin: thou canſt have no true ſound faith in the Lord Jeſus. Thou muſt be righteous even as he is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
                  <p>Thou happily ſaieſt thou art righteous, thou doeſt this and that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, this and that good action: take thou heed ſaith the Apoſtle, that thou deceive not thy ſelfe, thou muſt be righteous as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
                  <p>In a word, love is the fulfilling of the law, and Gualter carrieth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long through all the law which Chriſt walked in: Chriſt loved us, and gave himſelfe for us with this injunction, A new commandement give I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that you love one another as I have loved you, John. 13. 34.</p>
                  <p>This was one of the main reaſons of Chriſts comming into the world, to redeem us for our juſtification; and then to be an example of life to us for our ſanctification; ſaith Saint Baſil. Chriſt was ſet for a ſigne to all nations, I ſay. 11. 10. A land marke to all people, to take their aim, how to thinke, how to ſpeake, how to walke, how to live.</p>
                  <p>As men at Sea, if they ſee a Land-mark, or the Pole-ſtarre, thereby know how to guide the Ship; ſo Chriſt he is a ſigne to all Nations, a ſigne of zeale in prayer, a ſigne of reverence in the Temple, of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in holineſſe, of piety in life, and of unſpotted purity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in death.</p>
                  <p>Yea, to winde it up a little higher, to walk as Chriſt walked, is an As of participation. We muſt not onely walke as Chriſt walked with an as of proportion; for ſo the beaſts may walk; every creature, the Sunne, the Moone, &amp;c. walke according to their rule wherein God hath ſet them, as Chriſt did walke in his courſe that God ſet him in: but this is not enough; he that is in Chriſt, muſt walke as Chriſt walked with an As of participation; he muſt pattake of the ſame life, with Chriſt, and be led by the ſame Spirit of Chriſt, guided by the ſame grace of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Even as leſſe white is like more white, though not alike in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, yet in the ſame nature; there is the ſame nature in the leſſer that there is in the bigger; So we muſt have the ſame life, obey the ſame commandements, be guided by the ſame rule, ſwayed by the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, led by the ſame Spirit that was in Chriſt. If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his, ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 8. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:44191:151"/>What ſaith one, can there be any man that is none of Chriſts? doth not he ſay that every beaſt in the field, and the cattell on a thouſand hils, are his? Pſal. 50. 10. and doth he ſay that there are ſome men that are none of his?</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſaith the Apoſtle, If any man be not led by the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his. Indeed he is Chriſts as the beaſts are his, by creation and preſervation, &amp;c. but thou art none of Chriſts by grace and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſſe thou haſt the ſame Spirit that was in Chriſt to live in thee.</p>
                  <p>What is it to walk as Chriſt walked? it is to contemne the ſame gain and pleaſures and vanities of the world that he contemned; to yield to the ſame precepts that he obeyed; to yield to the ſame repproaches, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and perſecutions that he endured; to take up the ſame duties, to preach the ſame truths, to live in the ſame rule, and in all to be led by the ſame Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the explanation of the doctrine; come we now to the Reaſons which are principally theſe foure.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon is taken from the ſcope and end for which the Lord did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſend his Son into the world; as to juſtifie the ungodly, ſo alſo to conforme all thoſe that are juſtified, to the image of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>You may read that this was Gods purpoſe, that he laid downe in himſelfe from all eternity before the foundation of the world was laid; when he predeſtinated that his Son ſhould come into the world, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated that all that ſhould be redeemed by him, ſhould be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the image of his Son, Rom. 8. 29. whomſoever he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know, with the fore: knowledge of Love and predeſtination, them he did predeſtinate to be made like unto Chriſt; that looke what Chriſt was by nature, they might be by grace.</p>
                  <p>If this be the end of Gods predeſtination, then it is impoſſible that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſhould be in Chriſt, and not have the image of Chriſt; Chryſoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome ſaith, that as Chriſt was holy by nature: ſo thoſe that are predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſhould be holy by grace.</p>
                  <p>God ſhall never be fruſtrated of his end and purpoſe. If God have purpoſed it, who ſhal fruſtrate it? Man indeed may be fruſtrated of his end, becauſe of his weakneſſe and inability to accompliſh by himſelfe what he purpoſeth; ſome other perſon or thing prevents him of his end. But God as he hath a purpoſe in himſelfe, ſo he is powerfull and able to bring his purpoſe to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>We may conclude that that man that prayeth for mercy, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Oh that I might have redemption by Chriſt; Oh that I might go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet lives in his ſinnes and ſlavery to his luſts: he prayeth to have benefit by Chriſt, and to goe to Heaven in ſpight of God, againſt the will and purpoſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Our owne conſciences may tell us, that God cannot be fruſtrated of his end and purpoſe: but that thus we muſt be made conformable to Chriſt, or elſe we ſhall never have benefit or ſalvation by him: or elſe Gods purpoſe would be fruſtrated and in vain.</p>
                  <p>That thing muſt be fruſtrated, and in vaine, that attains not its end: if this
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:44191:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be the end that God hath purpoſed in himſelfe, in the giving of Chriſt for life and ſalvation to the world, that all that are redeemed and ſaved by him, ſhould be made conformable to him: either all ſuch as are not conformable to the Image of Chriſt, ſhall never be ſaved, but ſhall periſh for ever without Chriſt: or elſe Gods purpoſe muſt be fruſtrated and in vaine.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon is taken from the practice of Christanity (ſaith Leo) in vain are we called Chriſtians, if we be not imitators of Chriſt, and live as he lived. The Diſciples, are called Chriſtians, Acts. 11. 26. The very name tells us that we muſt be followers of Chriſt, or elſe, we are not in Chriſt: if any man be in Chriſt, he muſt really be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
                  <p>As a man if he be of a trade, he muſt ſet up that trade, all his layings out and travell and pains muſt be in that trade: why? it is his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: ſo, if a man be in Chriſt, all his converſation muſt be Chriſtian, his labours and endeavours muſt be in the trade of Chriſtianity, he muſt walke as Chriſt walked. He muſt be a Chriſtian in all his courſes, in all his ways, or elſe he is not in Chriſt.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oniſts are denominated from Plato, ſo are Chriſtians from Chriſt. The Franciſcans from Francis, the Dominicans from Dominick; theſe were bound to follow the rules of their Order, or elſe ſuperſtition would not ſuffer them to be of that Order: much leſs canſt thou be of the Order of Chriſt, if thou obſerve not his rules, if thou live not as he lived.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt hath given thee a law for thy mind, for to govern thy thoughts: Thou wilt not buſie thy thoughts with holy meditations; thy heart is not chriſtian. Chriſt hath given a law to thy affections: thou wilt be fretful and impatient, malitious, proud, and ambitious, and carnal; thy paſſions are not chriſtian. Chriſt hath given a law to thy life, that thy life may be holy: therefore if thy life be not according to the Goſpel of Chriſt, thy life is not Chriſtian, neither will Chriſt own thee for his, but will ſlay thee with curſes, as an enemy of his croſſe, and not as a follower of his death; Theſe mine enemies that will not that I ſhould reigne over them, ſaith Chriſt, Luke 19. 27. Bring them hither and ſlay them before me.</p>
                  <p>Thou canſt not look for a Saviour to have mercy on thee, if thou wilt not be ruled as a Diſciple of Chriſt, but thou ſhalt be damned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt. Slay them before me, ſaith Chriſt; Chriſt Jeſus which is the Saviour of the World, will damne thee, and ſee thee confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before his face; he himſelfe will ſee thee in hell: thou mayeſt cry for mercy, and for the blood of Chriſt; yet if thou wilt not live as Chriſt lived, but wilt rebel and ſin againſt Chriſt, Chriſt will ſee thee in hell, and though he look on thee, yet he will deſtroy thee without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p>If ever thou beeſt in Chriſt, thou muſt walke as Chriſt walked; thou muſt be a Chriſtian like to that good Martyr, who to all demands anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he was a Chriſtian. When they asked him what his name was, he anſwered it was Christian; his thoughts were Chriſtian, his words and actions Chriſtian; his countrey, his hopes, his aime, all
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:44191:152"/>
that ever he did, they could get nothing out of him, but all was Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and ſo he gave teſtimony to the Lord Jeſus. So I tell thee, thou muſt be a Chriſtian all over, a Chriſtian in thy thoughts, in thy words, a Chriſtian in thy calling, and in all thy imployments, being ſwayed by the Goſpell of Chriſt, or elſe thou art not in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The third reaſon is taken from the eſſentiall, or rather rather from the integrall<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> union that is between Christ and all theſe that are in Chriſt; they are all members of his moſt gracious body. Ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular, 1 Cor. 12. 27. now, we know that all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have the ſame life, and are quickened by the ſame ſoule: the ſoule is whole in the whole body, and whole in every member of the body: ſo if Chriſt be our head, we are his members, and the chriſtian life of Chriſt muſt be diffuſed thorough us, ſo that one man cannot be a drunkard, another a worldling, another an Epicure, another a ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, another a whoremaſter, another a lyar, another a lukewarme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, another a mocker, another a vaine-Jeſter, another a man-pleaſer, and yet be a member of Chriſt. All the members of Chriſt muſt have one life.</p>
                  <p>As in a mans body, there be veines, arteries, and nerves, that are the channels to convey life, and motion and ſenſe to every member, that all the members may have the ſame life diſperſed through the body. So it is in the body of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every member of Chriſt hath faith for his veines, to convey the ſame life, and the ſame ſpirits, and the ſame gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious motions to all the body, that it is not now the member that lives, but Chriſt that lives in it. Gal 2. I live not, ſaith the Apoſtle, but Chriſt liveth in me. As in the body, it is not the eye that ſeeth, if we ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porly, but the man that ſeeth with the eye: it is not the ear that heareth, but the man that heareth with the ear: ſo in the body of Chriſt, it is no more the man that ſpeaketh, but the truth of Chriſt ſpeaking in him. We have the minde of Chriſt, ſaith the Apoſtle. 1 Cor. 2. 16. if we be in Chriſt, Chriſt thinkes in us, Chriſt ſpeakes in us, Chriſt walkes in us, Chriſt doth all in us. As in the ſame body, the ſoule rules and quickens every member. The body of Chriſt cannot be a monſter, like thoſe Locuſts ſpoken of, Revel. 9. 7. that had ſhapes like horſes, heads as it were like crownes of gold, and their faces like the faces of a man, and had haire like women, and teeth like Lyons; this is a monſter, and not a ſimple body: ſuch a one cannot the body of Chriſt be; a mocker for one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, an ignorant ſot for another, an hypocrite for another, a carnall goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peller for another, a covetous worldling for another.</p>
                  <p>As in the body of a man, every member in this mans body, muſt be this mans member, and not the member of another man: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Peter muſt have Peters legs, and not Simon Magus his legs: Peter muſt have Peters eys, not Alexanders eyes: Peter muſt have Peters hands, and not Judas hands: you cannot take the eye of an Horſe, the leg of a Dog, and the paw of a Beare, and put them together, and ſay heres a man: no, this would be a monſter: every perfect body muſt have its own members.</p>
                  <p>So it is in the body of Chriſt: every member in Chriſt his Body,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:44191:153"/>
muſt have Chriſt his Members: every member in a mans body acts with reaſon, ſo every member of Chriſt acts with direction of Chriſt, it is informed by Chriſt, his minde is quickened by Chriſt his life: ſo that a man cannot be a member of Chriſt, but he muſt walke as Chriſt walked.</p>
                  <p>I know, the beſt Chriſtian may fall ſeven times a day, though he be in Chriſt: it doth not therefore follow that every particular action ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Chriſt: but, as every member in the body lives the life of the whole body, or elſe it is a dead member: ſo thou muſt live the life of Chriſt, or elſe thou canſt never be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>You know that all the actions of a man are guided by reaſon: yet there are ſome particular actions that he doth, and not by reaſon: as it may be he ſhakes his head, or moves his hand, and jogs his foote, and conſiders not what he doth: they are the actions of a reaſonable man, though not reaſonable actions: ſo, there may be many actions that are the actions of Chriſtians though not Chriſtian actions. The ſinnes of the godly, they are the actions of a Chriſtian, but they are not Chriſtian actions: there may bee ſtoppings in the body: though the ſame life and quickening runnes through the whole body, yet through the ſtopping of the liver and the pipes, diſtempers and ill humours may be raiſed in the body, ſo it may be in the body of Chriſt: and ſo many a Chriſtian may fall through infirmity; but the courſe of a Chriſtian, the life of a Chriſtian, the ordinary trade of a Chriſtian, the walke of a Chriſtian, is to live with the ſame ſpirit that lived in Chriſt, to walke in the ſame way that Chriſt walked in.</p>
                  <p>The laſt reaſon, is taken from the neere relation that is to be betweene Chriſt and every member of Chriſt. They are not onely the Servants and Diſciples of Chriſt, but they are the children of Chriſt, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of them. If all that are in Chriſt, are the children of Chriſt, they muſt needs walke as Chriſt walked. Like begets the like. Indeed a godly man may beget a wicked child, a graceleſſe ſonne; the reaſon is becauſe he begets his ſonne not as he is a godly man, but as he is a man corrupt by nature with ſinne: but Chriſt begets as he is God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he is without ſinne in himſelfe, ſo he never begets any but by an eternall ſpirit, and therefore they cannot but be like him. Be ye followers of God as dear children. Epheſ. 5. 1. The Apoſtle grounds his exhortation upon a neceſſity in grace. Conſider, if you be the children of God, it can be no otherwiſe but you muſt be followers of Chriſt as dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The begetter communicates himſelfe to the begotten: if the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter be fleſh, he begetteth fleſh: ſo Adam begot a ſonne after his own likeneſſe. That that is born of the fleſh is fleſh John 3. and is of a fleſhly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That that is borne of the ſpirit is ſpirit. If we are begotten again by the Spirit of God, then are we ſpiritualized of God; ſo that a man cannot be in Chriſt, unleſſe he be the child of Chriſt, and walke as Chriſt walked. Chriſt was perfect, Chriſt was mercifull; be you ſo, ſaith Chriſt, Matth. 5. Be you perfect as your Heavenly Father is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; as if he ſhould ſay, you cannot be the children of your Heavenly
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:44191:153"/>
Father, unleſſe you be perfect as he is perfect, mercifull as he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, holy as he is holy, righteous as he is righteous, walke as he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that all that are in Chriſt, walke as Chriſt walked? then all wicked men blaſpheme the name of Chriſt, that do not live the life of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Theſe blaſpheme the holy and ſacred name of Chriſt. Oh ſaith one, I hope I am a Chriſtian: yet the man is a drunkard, or a whoremaſter, or a gameſter, or a worldling, a proud man, a covetous man, What? was Chriſt a drunkard? was Chriſt a whoremaſter? was Chriſt a gameſter a worldling, proud, covetous? it were blaſphemy for any to ſay ſo of Chriſt: and it is alſo blaſphemy for thee who walkeſt not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Goſpell, to ſay thou art a Chriſtian. As I am a Chriſtian, ſaith another: yet the man is a filthy ſpeaker. Was Chriſt ſuch a one? a ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, &amp;c.? Thou blaſphemeſt the name of Chriſt. I hope we are all Chriſtians, ſaith a third; and yet they are men that live in ſecurity and prophaneſſe. What? was there ſecurity in Chriſt? was prophaneſſe in Chriſt? Oh, what blaſphemie is it for thee to ſtile thy ſelf by the Name of Chriſt, to ſay thou art in Chriſt? Revel. 2. 9. ſaith Chriſt, I know the blaſphemy of them that ſay they are Jews and are not: that ſay they are the children of Abraham, but doe not the workes of Abraham If a man did blaſpheme God to ſtile himſelfe a Jew, or a child of Abraham, that did not the workes of Abraham: what blaſphemy then is it for thee to ſay thou art a Chriſtian, and yet doſt not the workes of Chriſt? could not a man take the name of Abraham, but he did blaſpheme, unleſſe he did the workes of Abraham? how then durſt thou take the name of Chriſt upon thee, and not doe the workes of Chriſt, not walk as Chriſt walked?</p>
                  <p>Beloved, is any man a Chriſtian? he hath holineſſe engraven in his forehead to the Lord, in his heart, in his thoughts, in his words, and in all his wayes: he is one that gaſpeth after holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Art thou a Chriſtian? of all ſinnes under Heaven God cannot endure the ſinnes of a Chriſtian that hath the name of Chriſt put upon him. When Gods materiall temple was defiled by buyers and ſellers, Chriſt whippes them out, and after told them that the dayes would come wherein there ſhould not be left of it one ſtone upon another. God would not endure the Temple becauſe it was dedicated to his name, called his houſe, when it was made a den of theeves. Doth God care ſo much for ſtocks and ſtones, that are dedicated to his Name, will he not endure an unholy ſtone, and will he endure an unholy Chriſtian? Thou that art dedicated unto God, and unto his ſervice, thou that art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to prayer, to hearing, thou that art dedicated to an holy converſation, thou that art called the Temple of God, and the Houſe of God, wilt thou make it a den of theeves, a denne of vain thoughts, a denne of wicked words, of dead and ungodly workes? wilt thou defile the Temple of the Lord? then know, the Lord will not let one ſtone lie upon another, but will caſt thee down, and damne thee body and ſoule in hell for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:44191:154"/>Thou ſayeſt thou art a Chriſtian; how ſo? thou ſaieſt thou waſt chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened: thy condemnation is the heavier, if thou ſaieſt thou haſt been baptized into the Name of Chriſt, and haſt not put on Chriſt.

                  <p>Can I ſay that man hath put on his cloths, that hath not a ragge on his back, nor a ſhooe on his foote, nor a hatte to his head, nor a ring on his finger? ſo, when there is never a Chriſt in thy thoughts, never a Chriſt in thy ſpeech and conference, never a Chriſt in thy walke, never a Chriſt in thy calling, in thy buying and ſelling, never a Chriſt ſhining forth in thy life and converſation, canſt thou ſay thou haſt put on the Lord Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Can any man ſay that a beggar hath put on Royall robes, when he hath nothing but ragges and patches upon him? ſo, if I ſee a man with ragged thoughts of the world, with ragged ſpeeches of the fleſh, and a ragged courſe and converſation, according to the courſe and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, I can never ſay that ſuch an one hath put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Shall I ſee it by thy company? it may be they are wicked and graceleſſe. Shall I ſee it in thy courſe and converſation? it may be that is looſe and prophane. How canſt thou then demonſtrate that thou art a Chriſtian? it may be now and then thou wilt give a prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto Chriſt, turne up the white of thine eye to Chriſt, it may be thou wilt look into the Church, and lend an eare to Chriſt in his word. Is this to be in Chriſt? if thou be in Chriſt, then thou muſt live the life of Chriſt in all thy wayes.</p>
                  <p>The life of a man is a continued thing.

                  <p>Hence obſerve, That a Miniſter is bound to preach home in particular, ſo that he may ſummon this man and that man in the Church, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth here; (he that ſaith) if there be any one amongſt the whole multitude, that ſaith he abideth in Chriſt, he ought alſo himſelf to walke as he walked. And this commiſſion God gives unto all his miniſters: Mark 16. 15. Go preach the Goſpell to every creature: he doth not ſay preach the Goſpell before every creature: ſo they may doe, and preach in generall: but to every creature, that every creature may feele the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell bearing on his heart, that every creature may ſee his ſins, that ſo the Goſpell may be applyed to his heart.</p>
                  <p>All the names given to Miniſters, ſhew thus much. They are called Seeds men; now a Seeds man doth not take a whole croppe, or a whole buſhel of corne and throw it in a heap in his field; but he takes it and ſcatters it abroad that every place may receive ſome.</p>
                  <p>So, they are called Builders; now, a builder doth not onely frame the whole building, but he layes every particular bricke, and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtone in his building.</p>
                  <p>So, they are called Shepheards; a Shepheard doth not onely looke to his flocke in generall, but to every Ramme, and to every Lamb in his flocke.</p>
                  <p>So, Preachers muſt not onely preach the word of God in generall, but they muſt preach in particular.</p>
                  <p>The ground of this will appear, if we conſider three things in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>

No, it is this man, and that man that ſeeth and hears, and diſputes. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are moſt operative: preaching to men in particular, is powerfull preaching: that workes upon mens conſciences. How came the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to preach powerfully to the people? He declared to Jacob his ſinne, and to Iſrael his tranſgreſſion, Micha 3. 8. I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, ſaith the Prophet; here was the way whereby the Prophet preached powerfully; ſo that the Spirit went and rent mens hearts and conſciences, and made them tremble; how? why he made every ſoule ſee his ſinnes: ſo, that Miniſter that would preach powerfully to the conſciences of his people, he muſt make every one of them to ſee their ſinnes againſt God, and his commandements, ſo that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I ſee I have been a grievons ſinner, and I am in the ſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:

                  <p>Secondly, particulars are moſt diſtinct; when the preacher preacheth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> only in generall, it workes a confuſed knowledge, knowledge of ſinne in generall: a confuſed repenta nce, a confuſed humiliation, and a confuſed faith in the generall; it may be, it may make a man ſee he is a ſinner in the generall: but there are many thouſand thouſand ſinnes in particular that he takes no notice of, but ſwallows them down in the generall: it may be his ſinnes may be diſcovered in the generall: but alas, there are many, yea multitudes of deceits, of turnings and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the heart in particular, that are never diſcovered to them. All the religion of theſe men, is only generall: I love God with all my heart, ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thone: and yet the man is groſſely ignorant of God. Aske him any particulars, how he can prove his love to God, and the man cannot ſhew any. So, I ſerve God with all my heart: but goe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and bid him manifeſt what he ſpeakes; ſo, I feare God, I worſhip God: but bring them to the particular workes of theſe graces, and they aregone preſently, they are loſt, and know not what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>Thus the people in Malachies time, they thought they had much knowledge while the Prieſt preached thus overly to them; but when the Prophet came to preach home, and to come with particulars to them, they thought the Prophet was madde, they knew not what he meant. You have deſpiſed the Lord, ſaith the Prophet; wherein? ſay they: Mal. 1. 6. You have prophaned the worſhip of God, You have polluted the table of the Lord, ſaith the Prophet: ver. 7. wherein? ſaid they. You have wearied the Lord with your words, ſaid the Prophet Chap. 2. ver. 17. wherein? ſaid they. You have robbed God, Chap. 3. ver. 8. wherein? ſaid they. See, your words have been ſtoute againſt the Lord, ſaid the Prophet; yet they ſaid, what have we ſpoken? ver. 13. they could not tell wherein, till the Prophet told them, herein have you robbed God, herein have you deſpiſed the Lord, herein you have prophaned the worſhip of God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So, ſhould the miniſter of God come to men, and tell them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, thou art an enemy to Gods grace, thou haſt abuſed Gods pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; wherein? ſayeſt thou. Thou art one that ſcorneſt the word of God, and thou defileſt all the Ordinances of God. Wherein? ſayeſt thou. Thou art one that putſt farre from thee the evill day, wherein? ſayeſt thou.</p>
                  <p>Now, when the miniſter of God can come to particulars, and ſhew men wherein; then they cry out againſt them, and think they tell them lies, and preach falſe things to them: but the Miniſters of God are bound to preach ſo as they may diſcover mens particular ſinnes, not ſo as people may point one at another, but ſo as every conſcience may feele its owne ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly particulars are moſt ſenſible. If the Miniſter preach home in particular, there is not a falſe heart then in the congregation, but he will find it out; if he preach in particular, he will diſcover every mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, fling wilde fire in every wicked mans face, and throw
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:44191:155"/>
balme of comfort into every godly troubled ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>As King James ſaid well of a reverend Prelate of this Land, Me thinks this man preacheth of death as if death were at my back; ſo ſhould Miniſters preach, as if Heaven were at mens backes, or as if hell were at mens backes. When he preacheth of mens ſinnes and corruptions, he muſt preach ſo that their conſciences may ſee that the word of God looks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very thoughts and hearts; when he preacheth of the wrath of God, and of condemnation &amp;c. he muſt preach ſo, that the conſcience may feele even the fire of hell flaming in it; this is the way to teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the good knowledge of the Lord, as it is called, 2 Chron. 30. 22. every Miniſter may teach the knowledge of the Lord, but not the good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>There is great difference between teaching of the knowledge, and of the good knowledge of the Lord. Men may know God and his word, and their ſinnes: but if they go on in their ſins, it is not good knowledge: then indeed a Miniſter teacheth good knowledge when he makes his people ſo to know ſin as to loath it, and to come out of it; ſo to know repentance as to repent indeed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Diſcrimination. As if he ſhould ſay, there are ſome that are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in him, and ſome that are not in him: if any man ſay he abideth in him, he ought himſelfe to walk even as he walked: ſo that here the Apoſtle would put a difference between the ſound and the rotten-hearted in his congregation.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve this point, That every Miniſter is bound to preach ſo, as<note place="margin">Doctrine 2.</note> to make a difference between the precious and the vile.</p>
                  <p>Saint John preached ſo as that his hearers might ſay, the Spirit of Chriſt is in me: or, the Spirit of Chriſt is not in me: that themſelves might know whether indeed they were true members of Chriſt, or but hypocrites. This is the duty of Miniſters: Ezek 44. 23. They ſhall teach my people the difference between the holy and prophane, and cauſe men to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne between the cleane and unclean.</p>
                  <p>Here is two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt they ſhall teach them the difference between the holy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they ſhall not onely ſhew it before them: but if they will not ſee it, they ſhall cauſe them to ſee it; that is, they muſt beat it into them, and rubbe it into their conſciences; it may be when men may ſee, they will not: then, he muſt make them to ſee. If there be any prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, any luke warme or dead-hearted profeſſor, or cloſe hypocrite in the congregation, the Miniſter muſt make him ſee his prophaneſſe, his deadneſſe, and hypocriſie in Gods worſhip: or if there be any godly ſoule, or broken heart, the Miniſter muſt make them to ſee that they have a broken heart.</p>
                  <p>Firſt reaſon, becauſe elſe, a man defiles the pulpit, and prophanes the holy<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> things of God. Ezek. 22. 26. Her Prieſts have violated my law, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned my holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, neither have they ſhewed difference between the cleane and unclean. Thoſe Miniſters prophane the holy place of God, when they make not
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:44191:156"/>
mens conſciences know which is holy and prophane; when prophane perſons may come and go from Church, and have not their prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe diſcovered to them; a drunkard, a ſwearer &amp;c. and hath not his ſinnes laid open to him. Is there any prophane perſon here, that hath not an arrow ſhot into his heart, but he can goe away and not take any comfort from the Sermon? theſe men prophane the holy things of God.</p>
                  <p>When God gave Benhadad into the hands of Ahab, and Ahab ſpared him, and let him goe. 1 King. 20. the Prophet tells Ahab ver. 42. Thus ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou haſt let goe a man whom I appointed to utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, therefore thy life ſhall go for his life, &amp;c: ſo, if there be any Miniſter over any congregation, in which there is any drunkard, any ſwearer, or whoremaſter, or wordling, or lukewarmling, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that lives in ſuch ſinnes, which God hath apointed and decreed to eternal deſtruction in hell; if we tell them not their ſinnes, and make their conſciences feele them, then our life ſhall goe for their life, our ſoule for their ſoule: for we might have given them ſuch a wound as might have been a means to have cured their ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We are not the Miniſters of Chriſt, if we preach not ſo as that<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> men may know that they are not converted, if they are not &amp;c. God ſaith to to the Prophet Jeremiah, if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou ſhalt be as my mouth, Jer. 15. 19. Jeremiah could not be Gods mouth to the people, unleſſe he would divide between the precious and the vile. Unleſſe Miniſters preach ſo as to make the conſciences of their hearers feele in what ſtate they live in, they may be Miniſters of Satan, Idoll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhepheards, but they are not the Miniſters of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe otherwiſe they can doe no good: Ezek. 34. 17. and as for you O my flock, thus ſaith the Lord God, behold I will judge between cattell and cattell, &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, woe unto the ſhepheards; will they not preach ſo as to make a difference between cattell and cattell? woe unto the Prieſts; will they not preach ſo as to feede my flocke? I will require my flocke at their hands: and now ſaith God, will not the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards of my people doe it? I will now doe it my ſelfe, I will convert thoſe that are to be converted &amp;c. I will feed and provide for my flock my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Auſtin notes, that after that Peter had ſmote off Malchus his eare, Peter came to be a ſhepheard, and an Apoſtle of Chriſt, after Paul had perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Church, he came to be a Preacher, and an Apoſtle of Chriſt: ſo after Moſes had killed the Egyptian, God made him the Captain and deliverer of his people. Auſtin obſerves from this, that God appoints none for his Miniſters, but Smiters, ſuch as be men of blows, men that will ſmite men home to the heart, men that wil wound the conſciences of their hearers.</p>
                  <p>This I ſpeak that you may not be offended at the miniſters of Chriſt, when they apply the word of God to your ſeverall conſciences: and whenſoever you have the truth of Chriſt preached to your ſoules, let your hearts make uſe of it; for if thou apply not the word of God to thy ſoule as it is preached, thou art guilty of thine own bloud. If you apply
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:44191:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not the word, you put off the word of God; and then, what ſaith the Apoſtle? Acts 13. 46. It was neceſsary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you: but, ſeeing you put it farre from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>You that have heard the word of God, apply it to your ſoules, it is a bleſſed plaiſter: let it lie on your ſoules: go home and ſay, Lord, I have been told of this and that ſinne, of my pride, hypocriſie, deadneſſe, and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in thy worſhip and ſervice, &amp;c. I ſee they are againſt thy will, and thou commandeſt me to come out of them, and to leave them; Lord, I beſeech thee inable me to leave them all; ſo, Lord, I have been told this day of ſuch and ſuch graces, which thou haſt commanded me for to have, of ſuch and ſuch duties that thou wouldeſt have me to take up and performe; Lord, ſubject my heart to the power of grace, and to every commandement of thy word.</p>
                  <p>Take heed, if thou doeſt put off the word of God or any tittle of the word, and wilt not walke according to the ſame, thou putteſt off eternall life from thy ſelfe. Doe therefore as Gods people did, who when Moſes had preached the Law and Will of God to them, it is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Exod. 12. 50. Thus did all the Children of Iſrael as the Lord commanded Moſes and Aaron, ſo did they. So doe you goe home and apply the word to your ſoules, it was ſpoken for your good, make uſe of it, and the Lord be with you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Scrutiny, it is not onely an outward word, but a word of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> heart: if any man ſay, that is, if any man think, that he is in Chriſt, he ought to walke as Chriſt did. Hence we might obſerve, That a Miniſter is bound to preach to mens thoughts. But time cuts us off.</p>

                     <bibl>JOHN 3. VER. 20.</bibl>
                     <q>For every man that doth evill, hateth the light, neither cometh he to the light, leaſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is part of Chriſt his parly with Nicodemus concerning regeneration: wherein our Saviour doth declare four main points,</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, Mans naturall eſtate and condition without Chriſt. It is impoſſible that ever he ſhould be ſaved, that ever he ſhould get grace or come within the liſt of eternall life. Chriſt ſaith it, and bindeth it with an oath: ver. 3. Verily, Verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be borne again, he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God: much leſſe inherit it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is Gods gracious proviſion which he hath taken with the world, that though man were in a way of damnation, invincibly; yet now he is put in a way of probability of ſalvation: ver. 16. though he were damnable by nature, yet now he is ſalvable by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:44191:159"/>Thirdly, here is a general proclamation upon the condition of faith, that this ſalvability may be attained, if a man believe. In the ſame verſe, God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoever beleeveth in him, &amp;c. It is a condition of faith, put to all, none excepted. Whoſoever he be that beleeveth in Chriſt, he ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, here is the reprobation of the world, he that beleeveth not, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> condemned already. The cauſe whereof cannot be caſt on Chriſt, for, God hath not ſent his Son to condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved: It was Chriſts primary purpoſe, and the firſt end of his coming, to ſave the world: it is an accidentall end, or rather an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of his coming, that the world is condemned. Chriſt is not the cauſe of it: he is not the efficient cauſe, for he is a Saviour: nor the deficient cauſe, for he is a ſufficient Saviour.</p>
                  <p>That the cauſe of their condemnation, is from themſelves, and not from Chriſt: is proved by three arguments,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from their own conſciences: he that beleeveth not, is condemned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> already. He cannot here ſpeake of the condemnation of hell, for he is not in hell already. But he ſpeakes of an apprehenſuall condemnation in their own conſciences: as Chryſoſtome obſerves, he meanes the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their own conſciences; he that beleeves not, his conſcience tells him that it is his fault that he beleeveth not: though it be not in his power to be beleeve, yet God hath gone ſo farre, he hath ſo farre ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with mens conſciences, that there is no default on his part: They cannot excuſe themſelves, ſaying, I have no power to beleeve: their own conſciences will tell them that God hath knocked at their hearts, and offered them power to beleeve, but they rejected it. They cannot ſay, I know not how to beleeve; his own conſcience will tell him that God hath offered inſtruction to him, whereby he might have been taught, but that he refuſed it: ſo that he that beleeves not, is condemned already; his own conſcience riſeth within him, and tells him that it is his own fault that he doth not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is proved by experience; experience ſhews that men are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the cauſe of their own condemnation. verſe 19. This is the condemnation that light is come into the world, but men loved darknesse rather then light; the meaning of it, is this, This is the cauſe of condemnation to the world; not Gods predeſtination, not their fatall deſtiny, not their breach of the firſt covenant, nor any other impiety, but this ſinne of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>If the world ſtood guilty of never ſo many ſinnes: yet, if it did beleeve in the Lord Jeſus, it ſhould be ſaved. So that it is not all the other ſinnes that a man commits, that damnes him: but his infidelity that layes all his former ſinnes that ever he committed upon him; here is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that though light be come into the world, to pull men out of their darkneſſe, and ſinnes; yea though Chriſt, though grace come to them, yet they will not come out of their ſinnes; men will not have Chriſt, men will not have grace, men love darkneſſe rather then light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:44191:159"/>Thirdly, It is proved by reaſon, verſe 20. the verſe now read unto you,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For, every man that doth evil, hateth the light: neither cometh to the light, leaſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſtrong argument to prove that if men be damned, themſelves are the cauſe of it: for if light come into the world to inſtruct men, if Chriſt come into the world to pluck men out of their ſins, if Chriſt come with his bloud and ſpirit to cleanſe and ſanctifie men, and men will not be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: Then, if they periſh in their ſins, they are juſtly guilty of their own condemnation.</p>
                  <p>The words comprehend in them two things.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the wickeds rejection of the word of grace: which is ſet forth both poſitively, he hates the light: and then privatively or rather negatively, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cometh to the light.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the cauſe of the wickeds rejection of the word of grace: which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> twofold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the qualification of his perſon, he doth evill.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the diſpoſition of his male partneſſe, that cannot indure to be reproved.</p>
                  <p>From the firſt of theſe, we obſerve this.</p>
                  <p>That a wicked man hates the word of God grace yea he doth not onely hate<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> the word of Gods grace, but he hates grace it felfe: he doth not onely hate the Lanthorne that beareth the light, but he hates the light it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>I chooſe not to ſtand to ſhew you how the word is called a light: but that which I take to be more neceſſary for this place, I will firſt ſhew you what this hatred of the word of grace and of grace it ſelf is, and I thus define it,</p>
                  <p>It is an actual affection of the heart, whereby a man riſeth up againſt an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that which ſeems to be oppoſite and contrary to his luſt.</p>
                  <p>So that there be foure things in a wicked mans hatred of the word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is an actuall hatred: for there is an habituall hatred of the word,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> even in them that never heard the word; they doe not actually hate it, becauſe they never had it; but they would hate it, if they had it; as ſore eys hate the light of the Sunne even when it is down; for if they had it, they would twinckle at it. Thus all wicked men hate the word, and may be condemned for deſpiſers of the word, though they doe not actually hate it, becauſe they have it not; yet habitually they hate it; they would hate it if they had it. I ſpeak not of this hatred, but of that which is actuall hatred, whereby though they have the word, yet they hare to be controled, and reformed by the word: Prov. 1. 22. O ye fooles, how long will ye hate knowledge?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a paſſion of the heart, and ſo I diſtinguiſh it: for I know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a wicked man may love the word of God with his underſtanding and conſcience; his underſtanding may love the word and ſay it is good; his conſcience may love the word and ſay it is gratious; yet if he cuts not off his ſinnes for the word, he hates it. Pſal. 119. 70. Their heart is as fat as greaſe, but my delight is in thy law; as if he ſhould ſay, my heart is a leane heart, an hungrie heart, my ſoule delighteth and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:44191:160"/>
rejoyceth in and loveth thy word: I have nothing elſe to fill it but thy word, and the comforts I have from it: but their hearts are as fat as greaſe, their hearts are fat hearts, fat with the world, far with luſt, they hate the word.</p>
                  <p>As a full ſtomack loatheth meat and cannot digeſt it: ſo wicked men hate the word, it will not go down with them, it will not fetch up their luſts.</p>
                  <p>If thou parteſt not with thy ſinnes, thy heart hateth the word: yet thou thinkeſt thou loveſt the word: thou ſayeſt thou loveſt to hear the word, and thou loveſt good Miniſters, and good diſcourſes, &amp;c. it may be that this is nothing but the aſſent of thine underſtanding, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of thy conſcience, and ſo a man may love the word in his underſtanding and conſcience, and yet be a hater of the word of God.</p>
                  <p>The Devills have attained to ſo much divinity as this; they like the word in their underſtandings, and aſſent to the truth of it in their conſciences; but though their underſtandings and conſciences tell them that it is a good word, yet they hate it. This is a damnable and a moſt unnaturall hatred.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if a mans mind and conſcience were againſt the word, it were naturall for him to hate it: it is naturall for a man to hate that which is againſt his mind: but when thy conſcience ſhall tell thee, this is the word and the will of the Eternall God; and thy conſcience ſhall tell thee, that it is a moſt true word, a righteous, a juſt, an holy commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that commands thee to ſerve thy God onely, and ſo to part with all thy ſinnes; if yet thou wilt not obey, but goe contrary to his word, thy hatred it is unnaturall and diveliſh. As it was ſaid of Agrippa his dogge, he had a divell tyed to his collar: of another that he had a divell ſigned on his ſwords pummell: ſo I may ſay to every one that hates the word and to be ruled by it, and yet knowes it in his own underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and conſcience to be a true and good word; I may ſay, it is a diveliſh Hatred, and he hath a divell tyed to his heart, a divell in his heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this hatred is that whereby the heart riſeth up againſt an union <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with the word: hatred is a ſhunning of an union with a thing. A man doth not hate any evill naturally, but he hates an union with it. A man doth not hate poiſon it ſelfe, he hates no poiſon in a toade: let it be there as much as it will, he cares not; ſo the ſhepheard, be hates not the wolfe in the Forreſt, but in the Flock. A wicked man hates not the word ſo long as it keeps within it ſelf; he loves Epiſtles and Goſpells, the firſt and ſecond leſſon ſo long as the word keeps in the Scriptures, he likes it; but if the word begin to take union with him, if the word begin to plucke ſin from him, to pull his cupps from him, to pluck his pleaſures and delights from him, and his luſts from him, then he hates the word, when it comes in this union to his heart.</p>
                  <p>I put this union of the word in oppoſition to foure things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt againſt generall preaching; a wicked man loves generall preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> though it be of all the truthes in the Bible while they take no union
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:44191:160"/>
with his heart; he may heare a thouſand Sermons and like them all well enough; ſo long as the word cloſeth not in with a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo long as it grapples not with his heart, ſo long he may love and like it. But let the word come in particulars to him, and tell him, this is thy ſinne, and thou muſt to hell for it, if thou giveſt it not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: this hath been an old luſt of thine which will be thy bane, if thou repent not: This thy old corruption, it will be thy breake-necke, if thou part not with it: if the word come in this union with his ſoule then he hates it.</p>
                  <p>So long as Iohn Baptiſt tooke his text, and dwelt on the reaſons, and went no further, Herod heard him gladly: but when Iohn came to his uſe to apply it, and told him in particular, this reproves thee Herod, and all the evills that ever thou haſt done, and in particular for thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull marriage with thy brother Philips wife: when Iohn came thus, then Herod claps him up in priſon; before he heard him with joy and gladneſſe: but when he comes cloſe to his conſcience, and tells him that his marriage would condemne him, and his other ſinnes would damn him, if he repented not; Herod cannot endure this preaching any longer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in oppoſition to mercifull preaching. A wicked man loves mercifull Preaching; why? it takes no union with his heart, it is like a Plaiſter that will never ſticke. A mercifull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon can never ſticke on a prophane heart; it is likened to a greaſie paper that will never faſten, ſo mercifull Sermons, they will never faſten on his heart, they cannot take away his ſinnes from him.</p>
                  <p>Ahab he loved his foure hundred meale-mouthed mercifull Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers well enough; but when Micaiah came to him, O, I hate him, for he never Propheſieth good unto me but evill, he is alwayes upon hell-ſtrings, he is alwayes preaching judgement unto me: I cannot claw off one of his Sermons in a moneth ſcarce, I cannot catch hold on any of his Points to comfort my heart; there is not one ſentence in all his Sermons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh my conſcience, he never propheſieth good unto me but evill; I hate him.</p>
                  <p>When a Miniſter comes to the conſcience of a man, and tells him this is the truth of God, and this is thy ſinne and damnation, and makes his Sermons ſticke as a burre on his conſcience, and as an arrow ſhot into his bowells, his heart riſeth againſt it, and he cannot endure it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in oppoſition to preaching, when the Miniſter is dead. A wicked man loves the word when he that preacheth it is dead. Why? then there is none to urge a union of the word with his conſcience. A wicked man loves to read Saint Paul, Saint Peter and Saint Iohn, &amp;c. why? theſe men are not alive to urge a union of the word with their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but if Saint Paul, or Saint Peter, &amp;c. were alive to tell them, if this be the word of God, then thou art a damned man, if thou doeſt not obey it, if this be a grace, then thou art a curſed man, if thou have it not: if theſe men were alive now, their Sermons would cut to the quicke. So
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:44191:161"/>
when the Miniſters are dead, men love to buy their bookes; and to read their Sermons.</p>
                  <p>Now Maſter Perkins is dead, all the world honours him, and men buy up his bookes; but when he was alive, the drunkards made ballads of him, and profane Belials would make ſongs of him: why? they could not endure this union of the word. If the Miniſter be by, he cannot be drunk, but the Miniſter will preach condemnation to him for it, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cannot ſwear, or lie, or deceive, but the Miniſter will tell him that this will be a core to his conſcience another day. Men cannot endure this. Saint Paul and Saint Peter, &amp;c. being dead they like well enough, but if they were alive, they would hate them: why? they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure an union with the word.</p>
                  <p>This was the religion of the Scribes and Phariſees: Matth. 23. 29, 30. they built the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ombes of the Prophets, and garniſhed the Sepulchres of the righteous, and ſaid if they had lived in the daies of their fathers, they would not have been partakers with them in the bloud of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. You are the children of thoſe men that killed the Prophets, ſaith Chriſt: ver. 31. Are not you the children of thoſe men? doe not you do thoſe ſins which the Prophets cried out againſt, and for which the Prophets denounced ſuch fearfull judgements upon them? I tell you if the Prophets were now alive, they would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ie hell and damnation, to you: if the Prophets were now alive, and did ſee thoſe ſinnes you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they would denounce woe and vengeance to you as they did to their fathers.</p>
                  <p>Oh ſaith one, if I had lived in the Jews time, I would never have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Chriſt and his Apoſtles, I would have kiſſed the very ground that they trod on; then, wretch why doeſt thou not doe that which theſe men preached? look in the writings of theſe holy men, of Paul, of Peter, &amp;c. Doſt thou do that which Paul and Peter have wrote thou ſhouldeſt doe? doſt thou look in their writings, and not obey what they have wrote? I tell thee, if Peter and Paul were alive, they would tell thee thou ſhouldeſt be damned, if thou repenteſt not: if John and Iames were alive, they would tell thee, that the wrath of God will take hold on thee, if thou yeeld not obedience to that word they preached to thee.</p>
                  <p>If Paul were alive he ſhould have many a Tertullus to oppoſe him: if Iohn were alive, he ſhould have many a Herod to impriſon him: if Amos were alive, hee ſhould have many an Amaziah to baniſh him and to ſilence him; but now they are dead, men can like them well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>A righteous man in the way, is an abomination to the wicked. Prov. 29. 27. he doth not ſay an upright man when he is dead, is an abomination to the wicked: for when he is dead, they may praiſe him, and love him, and love to have his picture amongſt them: then they will ſpeake well of him, and commend him. I ſpeake that, becauſe I would not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued.</p>
                  <p>Let a man be a godly man indeed, a Saint indeed, as long as he lives, the men of the world will hate him: I have choſen you out of the world,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:44191:161"/>
faith Chriſt, and therefore the world hates you, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It hath been an old haunt and cuſtome of the world to hate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne the righteous, to reproach them, to call them Puritans, &amp;c, though very heathens have acknowledged that there is no religion without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Cicero, Horate, and others deſcribing a man that is religious, ſay that he is an intire man, a man pure from ſin.</p>
                  <p>If any man will not beleeve it, let him trie it: let him be holy and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and ſhew forth the power of religion in his life, let him contemne the world, &amp;c. and ſee whether wicked men will not hate him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and diſgrace him what they can not as if a godly man could not be godly and religious, unleſſe he be hated and reproached by the world: for it may be</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when a man that is truly religious and godly, is a great man, and all the countrey are loth to loſe his favour, or to purchaſe his ill will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he may be free from hate and reproach.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when he is a man of admirable wit and knowledge, that the world admires him for his learning, and for his underſtanding, and for his parts: ſuch a one men will rather admire then revile.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it may ſo be that God may give a godly man favour in the eyes of the world: howſoever the world would hate, and reproach them, yet God may ſo ſtrike their conſciences that they cannot doe it. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a godly man, eſpecially if he be ſuch a one by whoſe godlineſſe and purity a wicked man is judged and condemned in his conſcience for his ungodlineſſe and prophaneneſſe, the wicked will hate him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I put it in oppoſition to now and then preaching: a wicked man loves preaching, though never ſo ſharp and terrible, ſo it come but now and then: if the Miniſter preach never ſo powerfully never ſo terribly, if it give him a reproof and away, ſo it doth not ſtand digging in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ling his heart day by day; let the miniſter en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er a reproof into his heart againe, ſo it be but once or twice, he cares not. Why? he thinks he can recover himſelf again from it: but let the word of God come into him, and gall his conſcience continually, that every Sabbath he is convicted for a condemned man if he live not otherwiſe: every Sermon the Miniſter finds him out in his cloſeſt and deareſt ſinnes; he can never goe to Church, but he heares the Miniſter reprooving him for ſome ſinne or other, telling him that he muſt to hell for them unleſſe he repent, and leade a new life; thus when the word followes him every Sabbath that he hath no breathing time to recover his luſt; this makes him to hate the word.</p>
                  <p>Amos 7. The Prophet preaching the word of the Lord, and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Judgements of God to the people for their ſins, Amaziah oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him ver. 12. and ſaith unto Amos, O thou Seer, goe flye thee away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land of Judah, and there eate bread and propheſie there, but propheſie not again any more at Bethell, for it is the Kings Chappel, and it is the Kings Court. He could like it well enough that Amos ſhould propheſie once or twice: but if he did propheſie any more, he ſhould ſpoile all thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>th, he ſhould gall all their conſciences; go, ſaith he, propheſie in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and eate thy bread there. Amos ſhould propheſie where he would, ſo
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:44191:162"/>
it were not there; he might eat his bread where he would, ſo it were not there.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as it is an actuall affection of the heart, whereby the heart ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up againſt an union: ſo in the laſt place, it is againſt that that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant and repugnant to his luſt. For, as love is the conſonancy of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to a thing that hath agreement therewith: ſo hatred muſt needs be diſſonancy of affection to a thing that is repugnant and contrary to it. So, a wicked man he hates the word, becauſe it diſagrees and jarres with his luſt. Indeed a wicked man may love the word ſo long as it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not againſt his luſt. Therefore a wicked man may love three kinds of preaching.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Quaint preaching that ſavours more of humanity then of divinity.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As long as the Miniſter commeth with dainty phraſes, acute ſtories, eloquent alluſions, and fine tranſitions, they will like it well enough: it jarres not with their luſt; and therefore you ſhall heare them when they come from Church, commend him, O he was a fine ſpokes man, a wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſcholar: what a learned and excellent Sermon did he make to day? ſo farre as the word oppoſeth not his luſt, a man may love preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The people they did love to hear Ezeki l preach, they did love to hear his pleaſant words.</p>
                  <p>The Babylonians they did love to hear Davids ſongs: it was fine melody to them, though they hated the ſenſe; ſo the Phylistins they did love to hear Sampſon ſpeak, they knew he was a witty man, and could ſpeake fine riddles to them, but they hated his religion: ſo the people they did love to hear Chriſt preach, and would flock after him, they did, wonder at his authority, &amp;c. yet they hated his doctrine, for they cried, crucifie him, crucifie him; ſo if a Miniſter ſpeake onely of witte, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and memory, &amp;c. a wicked man will love it, it oppoſeth not his luſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they may love Impertinent preaching: when though it be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> never ſo pertinent to ſome in the Church, yet if it be not pertineut to him, he loves that. As the drunkard, loves to hear the Miniſter preach againſt hypocriſie, though never ſo ſharply; The prodigall perſon loves to hear the Miniſter preach againſt covetouſneſſe. But if the word come to ſtrike him under his fifth ribbe, to diſcover his corruptions, and the plagues of God due to him for his ſinnes, then he hates it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he may love preaching in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anto though not in toto; he may love <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſo, or ſo much preaching, but not preaching altogether. A wicked mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells him that he muſt have ſome religion, that he muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſome ſervice to God: and therefore ſo long as the Miniſter onely calls for ſome preaching, ſome hearing, and ſome ſerving of God, why, his conſcience calls for ſo much.</p>
                  <p>The vileſt drunkard, and blaſphemer, and ſwearer that is, will be content to hear of calling upon the Lord Jeſus at his death: the vileſt whoremaſter, and prophane perſon, the earthly worlding, &amp;c. will yeeld to ſome preaching, and to ſome hearing, and to ſome reading: why, otherwiſe their conſciences would not be at quiet, but would be as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:44191:162"/>
the divells band-dogge, bawling and houting at him. But if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter call for more religion then his luſt will ſuffer, for more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion then will ſubſiſt with his ſecurity, deadneſſe, lukewarmneſſe, hypocriſie, worldlineſſe, that he cannot yeeld to, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aine them: then he thinks there is too much of it, then he hates it, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, that wicked men hate the word of God, I ſet it forth by three inſtances; Rom. 1. 30. Haters of God. They did not hate his being and eſſence, his goodneſſe and mercy, but they hated him as he was a Lawgiver. The devils hate not God as he is God and hath a being, but they hate him as he is a Lawgiver and as he is their Judge: they cannot endure to be called by this God; to be controuled and judged by him. Thus was it with the Coloſſians, before they were converted: they were enemies to God, Col. 1. 21. Our Saviour takes away the whole doubt, and ſpeakes it peremptorily and generally of all the world, they hated me; the whole world ſo long as they live in their ſins, hate Chriſt, and hate his word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a wicked man hates the word, becauſe he hates the truth and the being of the word: he is ſorry that the word of God is true, he would be glad that the Scripture might prove falſe: that things may not be as the word of God ſaith they are; he hates the being of the word. A man loves the being of that which he loves, and he hates the being of that which he hates; and were it in his power, he would deſtroy it. Now, though a wicked man cannot deſtroy the Bible from being in it ſelf, yet he will deſtroy the Bible from being in his life.</p>
                  <p>For, beloved, the word of God ſhould not onely be in the Bible, but the Bible ſhould be in a mans life. A mans life ſhould he a walking Bible: but a wicked man deſtroyes the Bible from being in his life. A civill man would be glad that Ariſtotles Ethicks were the Bible. A worldly man would be glad that the Book of Statutes were the Bible; he is ſorry that that is the Bible which indeed is the Bible.</p>
                  <p>The young man that came to Chriſt, though he loved eternall life, and ſaid that he loved the Commandements of God, yet when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour told him one thing is wanting goe and ſell all that thou haſt, and give<note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> it to the poor, ſaith the text of him, he went away ſorrowfull; as if he ſhould ſay he was ſorry that there was any ſuch truth in the Scripture: he would have been glad that there had been no ſuch text in the word of God.</p>
                  <p>The Prophets propheſie falſely, and my people love to have it ſo. Jer. 5. 31. they hated to have it ſo as the word would have it. But, when the falſe Prophets told them it was otherwiſe, O, they loved that.</p>
                  <p>Beloved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the men of the world would be glad that God would make another Bible, that drunkards and whoremaſters might be ſaved: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bible; that earthwormes and worldlings and proud perſons might be ſaved. If God would raine down a new Bible, another Bible, I feare there are many thouſands among us, that now ſay they love the Bible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet would love to heare of it, and come from all places to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:44191:163"/>
it, after another Bible that would ſhew the way to heaven a little wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; men are loth to heare of ſo much holineſſe; ſo much preciſeneſſe, they love not to be beaten on that ſtring, a ſigne that they hate it.</p>
                  <p>Can a man that is nothing but fleſh and bloud, love the text of Saint Paul that fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the Kingdome of God 1 Cor. 15. 50? Can an old filthy ſinner love that text of Iſaiah, An old ſinner though he be an hundred years old ſhall be accurſed, I ſaiah 65. 20? Can a Uſurer love the 15. Pſalme? Can a luke warmling love Rev 3. 16? no, he would be glad there were no ſuch truth in the word, and therefore he hates it. Rom. 8. 7. A wicked man is ſuch an enemy to the word, that all the Miniſters in England cannot reconcile him to it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wicked men hate the word, becauſe they doe hate the nature of the word. If men did love the word of God, they would will what the word of God wills, and nill what the word of God nills. It is a good proverbe amongſt us, It is the property of lovers to will and nill the ſame things.</p>
                  <p>If men did love the word, then look what the word ſaith, they would doe: what the word commands them, they would obey. If men did love the word, they would comform their hearts and lives to the rules of the word. But the carnall mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Rom. 8. 7.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man hates the law of God; why? the heart of a wicked man conceives the word of God to be againſt him: he cannot think a thought but the word is againſt it, he cannot ſpeake a word, but the word of God is againſt it, he cannot pray his dead-hearted prayers, but the word of God is againſt him, &amp;c. And as the word of God is againſt him, ſo his heart is againſt the word: he is of one mind, the word of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he is of one minde, and the word of the cleane contrary mind againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as a wicked man hates the being of the word, and the nature of the word in it ſelfe, ſo he hates the being of it in his underſtanding; he cannot abide the knowledge of the word: therefore they ſay unto God, depart from us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes. Job. 21. 14.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man would faine keep this and that luſt: he is loth to depart with his old corruptions, his old ſinnes; he hath lived in them ſo long, that he is loth to part with his old friends; he would faine goe on in his luſt, and therefore he hates the knowledge of the word that would ſtrippe him of his luſt, ſaith Aquinas. Now he cannot be free for his ſinnes, and be curbed by the knowledge of the word.</p>
                  <p>I will tell you, once it was my hap to preach a Sermon two or three hundred miles from this place, and when Sermon was done, I heard a man ſay, O what a beaſt was I to come to this Sermon, what a beaſt was I to come to it?</p>
                  <p>When the word of God comes to men, and tells them that their ſtate is damnable if they live in their ſins, when the word of God comes to the heart, many are ſorry that they ever heard the word of God, that ever the word made ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>hing known to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:44191:163"/>The drunkard, the wanton, the Uſurer, and the worldling, how glad would they be that the Miniſter could prove by the word of God, that theſe ſins were lawful, that uſury were lawful, that covetouſneſſe were lawful? &amp;c. But when the word goes flat againſt them, then they cannot endure that word: why? their conſcience begins to pen them in, it puts their hearts in the ſtocks, as it were, they cannot have freedome in the purſuite of their luſts and ſinnes: an evident ſigne that men hate the word.</p>
                  <p>Auſtin ſaith of a wicked man, He loves the truth ſhing, but he hates the truth reproving. As much of the word as you will, to make him skillfull in knowing: but he hates the word every dramme of it, checking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking, girding and controuling him for his ſins.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, what is all our preaching? doth it not ſhew that men hate the word? need any goe to the field and exhort the Huſbandman to plough and ſow his ground? need we goe to your houſes to perſwade men to feed, to eate and drink, and to cloath themſelves? need we goe to the Alehouſe and perſwade the drunkard to drink, the ſwearer to ſweare, the gameſter to play? no; men love their backes, and their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, men love their profits and their pleaſures, men love their luſts and ſinnes. But they muſt be exhorted and intreated, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to obey, and to love the word of God, and all little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>Hence then is a reproofe to all the wicked amongſt us. O beloved, it<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> is too true that abundance of us doe hate the light. Did we not hate the light, we would have ſhaken all our hands of our ſinnes ſheere ere now; did we not hate the light, we would have crucified our anger, and our wrath, and our pride ere now; we would have ſubdued our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and our ſelfe-love, and our lukewarmneſſe in good duties: did we not hate the light, we had all been children of the light ere now. Plato ſaith, He loves that hath a ſimilitude of that he loves: but we have not a ſimilitude and a likeneſſe of the light, and therefore we doe not love it.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, let me come a little neerer, and convince all that heare me of this point.</p>
                  <p>They muſt needs be ſaid to hate one another whom no intreaties nor beſeeches <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> can poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Oh, how often have Gods Miniſters intreated you and beſeeched you to give over your ſinnes, and yet you will not! how often have they beſought you to be zealous, and meek, and holy, and you will not? thou art techie and revengefull in ſpeeches, how often haſt thou been ſought to leave it? thou art proude and ſtout-hearted, how oft haſt thou been fought for to be humble? thou art carnall and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how often haſt thou been beſought to be ſpirituall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly?</p>

We beſeech you as you love your ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give over your ſins: we beſeech you as you are men, as you know what is what, give over your ſinnes: we beſeech you, let the drunkard give over his drunkenneſſe, the ſwearer his oathes and blaſphemies, the Idolater his Idolatry and wilworſhip, let the idle talker give over his fruitleſſe communication, the covetous perſon give over his covetouſneſſe, the ſecure Chriſtian and luke warme profeſſor and deadharted ſerver of God come out of his ſecurity and dead-heartedneſſe, &amp;c.

                  <p>Brethren, you know that God offereth you pardon of your ſins: he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers you mercy, he offers you a Kingdom, if you wil come out of your ſins. If thou wouldſt rather loſe father, mother, wife and children, houſes and lands, goods and livings, rather then ſhake hands with ſuch a one as thou art fallen out with, I am ſure thou hateſt him with a witneſſe: and if thou wouldeſt rather hazard thy owne mercy, hazard the love and favour of God, hazard the Kingdom of heaven, let Chriſt goe, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy goe, and heaven go, rather then let thy ſinnes goe; ſurely thou hatest to be reformed. I will give you a kingdome, ſaith God, if you will be new men; I will give thee a Kingdome, if thou wilt take up Chriſt his Croſs and be pure. I will give thee a kingdome, If thou wilt walk preciſely and circumſpectly. But you will not, though you might have a kingdome for it. Repent ſaith Chriſt, for the Kingdome of heaven is at hand, Matth. 3. 2. Repent, and here is a Kingdome at hand for thee. Down with thine old luſt, thou knoweſt what I mean, and here is a Kingdome at hand for thee. Repent of your formall repentance, repent of your faſhionary prayers, repent of your overly performances of holy duties, and behold here is a Kingdome for you. Wilt thou hazard the very Kingdome of grace, and of glory, rather then thou wilt ſteppe out of thy old wont? thou hateſt repentance, if a Kingdome cannot hire thee to love it.</p>
                  <p>They must be ſaid to hate one another, whom all the deareſt love in the world can never unite and ſoder together. Love is able to burſt all the hatred in the world if the divell be not in it: love is more forcible then hatred; and therefore that hatred is moſt cankerous that love cannot overcome. What is ſo pleaſing or delightfull to the fleſh of a man, but love may command it? the love of God hath given thee the bloud of his own Sonne: if thou wilt part with thy corrpptions, thou mayeſt have it. That is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred indeed, which the bloud of thy owne Sauiour cannot diſſwade thee from.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle Peter thought he had uſed an excellent argument to perſwade men to holineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he ſetteth forth the love of God to us. 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19. For aſmuch as you know, that you were not redeemed with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation, received by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from your fathers: but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled and without ſpotte. What, doth Chriſt give his bloud to thee, to redeem thee from thy vain converſation? hath he given his bloud for thee, that thou ſhouldeſt part with thy ſinnes, with thy drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, with thy oathes, thy pride, ſecurity, luke warmneſſe, earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:44191:165"/>
prophaneneſſe; from thy vain thoughts, thy vain words, and thy vain luſts, and wilt thou not? If God had redeemed us with ſilver, and gold, that were but droſſe: no, he hath redeemed us with the bloud of his Sonne: if now thou wilt part with the bloud of Chriſt, rather then with thy ſinnes, that the word of God commands thee to part with, how great is thy hatred of the word?</p>
                  <p>Bloud it is neceſſary to the life of every living creature. I am ſure the Bloud of Chriſt is neceſſary to the life of a Chriſtian; without it, a man can never be waſhed, nor never be ſanctified, nor made acceptable to God. That man that will rather part with his bloud, rather then lay down his hatred of ſuch an one whom he hates, he hates him for ever, he hates him to the death. Thou that rather then thou wilt part with thy evill courſes, from thoſe ſinnes that Gods word would have thee to to give over and forſake, wilt part with the bloud of Chriſt, I ſay thou hatest the word, and thou hateſt a reformation of thy wayes for ever, with an everlaſting and damnable hatred.</p>
                  <p>That man that had rather be damned then leave his ſinnes, that had rather goe to hell, then be a new creature, he hates the parting with his ſinnes, he hates to be a new creature,.</p>
                  <p>It is truth, man is a reaſonable creature, and therefore cannot reaſon ſo in expreſſe words, as to ſay, I had rather be damned then to give over my drunkenneſſe, my lying, my ſwearing, my luſt; I had rather goe to hell, then be ſo pure, and ſo holy &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But every wicked man is ſo unreaſonable in very deed; for the word of God tells that wicked men that live and die in ſuch ſins, and ſuch ſins ſhall be damned; yet, they will not give over their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Doth not your own conſcience tell you, that as long as you pray no better, as long as you walke no better in your profeſſion, God abhorre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> you, and all that you doe, and will damn you? doth not thy conſcience cell thee, that yet thou haſt no aſſurance of ſalvation, that as yet Jeſu-Chriſt was never given to thee, that as yet you never had the Spirit of Chriſt to kill ſinne in you? if that thou wilt goe on in thy ſinnes, and not get Chriſt and his Spirit into thy heart, as the word of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth thee, and thy own conſcience perſwadeth thee: I ſay, if yet thou wilt goe on in thy ſinnes, then thou chooſeſt to be damned, rather then to part with ſin.</p>
                  <p>Doe we not ſay, ſuch a rogue will be hanged, that ſuch a haſty furious man will undoe himſelfe? doe we not ſay of a rebellious child that he will be diſinherited? not that any man reaſons ſo in words, I will doe thus and thus and undoe my ſelfe, I will ſteale and be hanged, I wil be a rebellious child and be diſinherited, I will goe on in my ſinnes, let the world ſay what it will, and be damned. But when a man knows that the wages of ſin is death, that the end of drunkenneſſe, of ſwearing, of lying, of pride, security, hypocriſie, formality in religion &amp;c. is death: When a man knows that the end of that ſinne which he lives i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> is damnation, and yet will goe on in thoſe ſinnes, he wills to be damned. Ezek 18. 31. Turne you, turne you, why will you dye, O houſe of Iſrale? why? were any ſo madde as to be willing to dye, to periſh for ever? yet ſaith
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:44191:165"/>
the Prophet, why will you dye? as if he ſhould ſay, why will you ſin? that man that wills to ſin, he wills to be damned; that man that will be damned rather then part with his ſinne, that man loves ſin for ever, and ſo hates the light.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, be aſhamed to carry ſo many plague-tokens upon your hearts, ſo manny ſinnes in your ſoules, ſo many oppoſitions and rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the word. That man that hates and rebells againſt the word, can never be ſaved by the word. You that have had the preaching of the word, look that you give way to it; take heed that you withſtand not the breath of it.</p>
                  <p>I could tel you one thing, &amp; I pray God to ſend it home to your hearts: commonly when God ſneds his word to a people, thoſe that are wrought upon, for the moſt part are wrought upon at the beginning: generally it is ſo, I will give you a convincing place for it: Acts. 13. 48. And when the Gentiles heard, they glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life, beleeved. Paul and Barnabas were come to Antioch, and had preached one Sabbath day, and now had preached another: The Gentiles glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life, beleeved; as if he had ſaid, all that were ordained to eternall life, beleeved at thoſe Sermons; as if he ſhould ſay again, all that beleeved not at thoſe two Sermons, were reprobates.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that did belong to God, they did beleeve, and hearkened to the preaching of the word to them, on thoſe two Sabbaths; All that were ordeined to life, they beleeved at theſe two Sermons: the reſt that beleeved not, are branded and marked out for deſpiſers and wonderers, Heare O deſpiſers, and wonder and periſh, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Agree with thine Adverſary, whilſt thou art in the way. Matth. 5. Beloved, you are now in the way of ſalvation: your Adverſary is the Lord himſelf, til he be reconciled unto you; you are in the way, while you are under the preaching of the word, you know not how ſoon God may take you out of the way, you know not how ſoon God may take his word away: or, if that continue, yet he may withdraw his Spirit: and then, if God once take away his Spirit, then you may ſeek to be converted, but ſhall never find it; you may ſeek for grace, but ſhall never get it: you may ſeek for Chriſt, but never obtaine him; if men ſtand out againſt the word and Spirit of Chriſt, while it is beating upon their hearts, and offering them grace, then Chriſt will be a ſwift witneſse againſt them. Malach. 3. 5. Doth Chriſt come to thee? now obey, now beleeve, now give over thy ſins. Doth he bid thee now repent? &amp;c. O give way to the Words of Chriſt, give way to the ſpirit of Chriſt; otherwiſe, Chriſt will come ſwiftly: I will be a ſwift witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>I tell you, the Covenant of grace will not ſtay long: God is about to put up his wares. When no Cuſtomers come, the Merchant puts up his wares; ſo God will even cloſe up all his graces; then Preachers may preach, but none ſhall be converted: People may heare, but never be turned; which the Lord deny from ever being amongſt us; therefore, while it is called to day, hearken, and the Feare of God be with you.</p>

                  <p>Theſe words, and the following verſe containe in them five se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall things;</p>

                  <p>Secondly, the Cauſes of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Judgement it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Who they were on whom this judgement was infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The effects of it.</p>
                  <p>Now by Gods permiſſion I will open theſe words in order unto
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:44191:168"/>
you, And for the firſt, the Author of it.</p>
                  <p>It is laid down by queſtion and anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Queſtion, Who gave Jacob to the ſpoyle, and Iſrael to the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</p>
                  <p>Anſwer, Did not I the Lord? was it not I the mighty God, which am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to order every thing according to my own will?</p>
                  <p>But indeed we are ready to aſcribe things to chance and fortune and lot; to prevent this ſaies God, Who did theſe and theſe things? did not I the Lord?</p>
                  <p>Now, by Jacob and Iſrael is meant the people of the Jews, which were called by the name of Jacob. Who though they were his peculiar people, yet when they ſinned, he gave them over. God ſaies, Who gave this people of mine to the enemies? did not I the Lord? therefore God, he is the Author of all puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Cauſe why the Lord did this: for, ſome might ſay, why did the Lord overthrow this people, whom he did ſo tenderly reſpect for his, which were as the apple of his eye, and the ſtrength of his right arme? becauſe they ſinned againſt the Lord, and would not walke in his wayes.</p>
                  <p>He ſets down the Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in generall, they have ſinned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in particular, they would not walk in his way, nor be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here is the Judgement it ſelf, ver. 25. therefore hath he powred upon him the fury of his anger, the ſtrength of the Battel, and hath ſet him on fire round about. He calleth it the anger of the Lord: not of a King, or of a great man, but the anger of the Lord, the fury of his anger; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extremity of it: he doth not ſay that God doth drop down his anger; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he poures out the fury of his indignation. Moreover he ſaith, the ſtrength of battel; the Lord cometh like an armed man to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and to deſtroy them, as men in wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>res doe when they ſlay both young and old, and make no bones of it, and are glad when they have done it; And, as an armed man to ſlay them; ſo likewiſe, he hath ſet a fire round about them; the Lord hath incloſed them in with indignation, ſo that they could ſee no way to get out of it, or to eſcape it. So then this ſhews the unavoydableneſſe of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, who were theſe that were deſtroyed? Jacob and Iſrael, a praying and a profeſſing and a faſting people.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the effect of all this, how it did work upon them. Yet, ſaith the Lord, they know it not, neither lay it to heart. Oh Lord, what mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſtupidity is this! though God did doe it; in his anger too; yet this poor Nation ſaw it not, nether regarded it, till the plague came and when it came, they never laid it to heart, neither were they humbled by it, but did beare the plague, and afterwards went down into hell, and never minded it.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo beloved; ſtands the caſe with us, The Lord plagues us, and we ſee it not: his anger burns round about us, and the fierreneſſe of his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:44191:168"/>
wrath is gone out to battel: and yet we perceive it not.</p>
                  <p>From the firſt of theſe obſerve: namely.</p>
                  <p>That God is the author of all plagues and judgements that befall a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> It was he that drowned the old world, and delivered the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael to the ſpoylers. Shal there be any evill in the City, and the Lord hath not dont it? ſaith Amos in his third chapter and ſixth verſe. From whence obſerve this, That God ordains all puniſhments before they come. Acts 4. 28. for to do whatſoever thy hand and counſel determined before to be done. And as God ordaineth all thing before they come; ſo he ordereth them, and the time when they ſhal come; and they cannot come one moment of time before the Lord would have them. The Iews could not lay hold on our Saviour, becauſe his hour was not yet come. John 7. 30. The wicked cannot pull down puniſhments upon a Nation when they wil; As its he ordaineth them, and the time when; ſo he doth appoint them how long they ſhall lie upon men. Revel. 1. 10. There the Lord had appointed the Church of Smyrna ten dayes tribulation; and there is meaſured how much God appoints us. The devill could go no further then his commiſſion in afflicting Job. As he doth order all, ſo he doth order all for the good of his people, and for the confuſion of his enemies; all things work for the good of thoſe that feare God, Rom. 8. 28. and for the hardening and overthrowing of the enemies of the Church that are incorrigible.</p>
                  <p>This may ſtay and comfort the hearts of Gods Children, in any<note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> heavie croſſe that befals them.</p>
                  <p>Is God the orderer and diſpoſer of all? then this may comfort thy ſoul O thou poor Child of God; I ſay comfort thy ſoul with this, that the Lord is the temperer of all things, and the Phyſician that ſtands by and ſees how many drammes the Apothecary putteth in. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill indeed may afflict thee, and wicked men may puniſh thee; but thou ſhalt have no more then the Lord ſees good for thee. Therefore though thine enemies take thee and kill thee, and Rabſhekah raile on thee, and Bonner burne thee, yet the Lord is a ſweet loving Father, and ordereth all things, and cannot find in his heart to hurt thee. Though they be the Inſtruments, yet God he is the Author, and hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted how long, and how much, and for what they ſhall afflict thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Sword find thee, and faggot come: yea though thou beeſt baniſhed or ſawne aſunder, yet the Lord ordereth all things. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith to the ſword, and to the the plague, as David ſaid to Ioab, have a care of my deare ſonne: onely ſubdue the rebell, but doe not hurt my ſonne. So saith God, uſe my ſervants kindly for my ſake: onely bring under their proud hearts, but do not hurt them. Therefore have an eye to Gods love, and let faith in him over-rule thy heart in ſpite of all that can come againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>This may terrifie the hearts of all wicked men that are out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.<note place="margin">Uſe. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is God the Author of all puniſhments? then this may make their haire to ſtand upright upon their heads. That God whom thou hateſt, is the puniſher of thee even he whoſe Sonne thou deſpiſeſt, and whoſe
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:44191:169"/>
Sabbaths thou prophaneſt; He is able if his wrath be kindled, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume thee in a moment. Oh, if thou haddeſt not an adamant heart, this would daunt it, and diſſolve it into teares of bloud. God will infinitely puniſh thee, who is a conſuming fire: but if thou wilt not be daunted, there is nothing but fearfull looking for of fire and brimſtone for ever in hell. When God puniſheth his children, it is in mercy: but to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wrath is in their puniſhments, and his Judgements are in anger and great wrath: and therefore when he puniſheth thee, thou maieſt ſay, A juſt Judge brandeth me in the hand.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo? Then when Calamities come, let us not ſo much ſtand upon<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> men, or upon the help of them: but let us look to God as David did: it may be the Lord ſent Shimei to raily on me; 2 Sam. 16. 10. and ſo did Job the Lord gives, and the Lord hath taken away. Iob 21. 12. The Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did it: but they were Gods Inſtruments. We ſhould not do as dogs, that gnaw the ſtones that are throwne at them. God takes ſtones as it were, and throweth them upon mens heads: and ſometimes whips them by wicked men. Now, the wicked are but Gods rod, and when he hath ſcourged thee, he will caſt the rod into the fire. Therefore goe unto the Lord, make peace with him and he will remove it. The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I confeſſe are in fault, but God is the Author of all: and he will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you in his good time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wherefore will God deale thus with Iſrael? becauſe they have ſinned with a rebellious ſpirit, not by infirmity, but in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Whence you may learne this point of Inſtruction, That ſinne and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> againſt Gods Law is that which brings down puniſhments and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon a Nation or a people or Church. All Sin in generall is the broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and hatcher of all judgements, and the very ſpawne of all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Ah, this ſinne and diſobedience, and willfull rebellion againſt God, it will bring ſword and famine amongſt us, and let in the enemy, and ſend out God from amongſt us, and ſtop the mouthes of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and break off the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>A more particular cauſe why God ſends puniſhments amongſt us, is this, becauſe Kings will not be ſubject to the Lawes of God, and Queens will doe what they liſt: when Biſhops and all people will have elbow room to doe that which ſeems good in their own eyes: as giving tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the prophanation of Gods Sabbaths, that the people may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour the Lord, and runne headlong to hell: this and ſuch like, ſets up wickedneſſe, and brings the wrath of God upon us, and his vengeance upon our Land and Kingdome; when thus ſinne gets the upper hand and day of the word, for which I cannot chuſe but pitty our poor Land, neither could you do leſſe if your hearts were not as hard as an ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and your eyes glued together. Ah poore Nation, now thou lieſt a bleeding and drawing to an end, and the bell now tolls for this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Lord is a going from this Land: and her puniſhments and judgements are comming on apace, ſo that all Nations may ſay, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the Lord done this unto this Land, what meaneth the heate of his anger? then ſhall men ſay they have forſaken the Covenant of the Lord God of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:44191:169"/>
their Fathers, and ſerved other Gods. Judges 4. 2. When they forgat the Lord their God, then he ſold them into the hand of Iabin King of Canaan; this was the ground why the Lord drowned the old world. Geneſ. 6. 12. becauſe they had corrupted all their waies; this was the cauſe why the Lord burned Sodome and Gomorrah with wild-fire from heaven: this was the cauſe the Lord deſtroyed Ieruſalem forty years after Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would have none of the offers of Chriſt, and of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cic. And thus much for proof.</p>
                  <p>Good Lord, what a poor weake Land have we! if ſinne and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> be the cauſe of all puniſhments, then in what a poor caſe is England? how weake are we? our hearts may ſhake within us, and our knees may knock together to conſider of it, having ſo many ſinnes of all ſorts, of all degrees, and committed with ſo high a hand, and in moſt fearfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>We are ſick from the Crowne of the head to the ſoale of the feete, there is no ſoundneſſe in us: we are ſicke in head, ſick in heart, ſicke in ſtomack; we have had peace, and that hath ſurfeited us: and now we have gotten the pleuriſie, and nothing but letting of bloud will cure us. God grant, the Lord let us blood in our hearts alſo. God muſt purge and phyſick us, and fetch out the droſſe which we have gathered by our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. If ſin and rebellion will doe it, we have given God cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſo to plague us.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo? Then we ſee who are the greateſt traytors in the kingdome,<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> and what they are that pull down puniſhments upon a Kingdome; they are diſobedient rebells and traytors, full of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>I proteſt, the greateſt traytors our land hath this day, are the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Gods Sabbaths, and ſuch as do give liberty to prophane them, and to ſwear and be drunke: theſe are the plague: ſores of this Kingdome, and bring down heavie jugements upon us; yea, of what place or dignity ſoever they be. It is not onely poor drunkards, but ſilver and velvet-Coat drunkards, even the Lordly men of this kingdom, who give liberty to ſin: for the greater are the men the greater are their ſins, &amp; they are the moſt dangerous, even as great Cut-purſes doe more harm then little ones; for as Haman was hanged before the Jews ſaw good daies, and the ſeven ſons of Saul were ſlain before they could have any peace in Iſrael: ſo while theſe rebells be not hanged, what peace can be expected? while Ionah was in the ſhip, there could be no quietneſs: ſo whilſt theſe rebells and vile wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches live and have favour, and are reſpected, and goe on ſtil unpuniſhed, they are in the land, as Ionah was in the ſhippe: and ſo long there can be no quietneſſe in the land.</p>
                  <p>One Achan did plague a whole land; but here are many Aehans in this land. Oh poor land; thou art wonderfully laden by every ungodly perſon, both in Country and City. O let us beg of God that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be removed out of the land, or that God would turne their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that ſinne is the brooder of all puniſhments? O then let it<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> teach every one of us to ſet heart and hand and all to work, to joyne all our forces of prayers and tears againſt theſe enemies, and labour for the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:44191:170"/>
reformation of theſe: When Jonas was in the ſhip, the Marriners came about him and asked him, from whence comeſt thou? So if ever we would ſee good dayes, we muſt joyne our prayers and all our powers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſins and the ſins of others.</p>
                  <p>When the Philiſtins ſaw that the Arke was the cauſe of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that befell them, then they never reſted till they had ſent it away; ſo let us ſhip and packe away our ſins, if ever we would have our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments removed from us. Say, O mine enemie, have I found thee, thou art the enemies of King, and Countrey, and Parliament, and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and thou art he that brake the laſt Parliament, thou art he that loſt the day at the Iſle of Ree, thou art he that ſent ſo many poor Rochellers to the grave with famine, and thou art he that makes divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion between Kings and commons. The Lord give us power and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: for if ever we had need, now we have; and let us beſtir our ſelves, and pray that God would be pleaſed to ſtirre up the heart of the King and other Magiſtrates againſt theſe ſinnes. Oh that Magaiſtrates in their places, would ſet their hearts and hands againſt all theſe ſinnes; but light execution is done, and moſt Magiſtrates ſtand for ciphers in their places, and onely take up a room, and do nothing. We cannot draw them with all the arguments we can uſe, to puniſh theſe ſinnes. We have cauſe to mourne: for they ſtand like ſcrare-crowes, with a peice in their hands, but never ſhoote: and the birds may pick the ſtrawes from their heads; ſo that Magiſtrates do nothing.</p>
                  <p>But to you I ſpeake that are chiefe in Towns, and chief Officers: you ſhould all joyne hand in hand, and heart in heart to pull down theſe ale houſes, hel-houſes, and nurſeries of the devil, and to ſupplant wicked neſſe. We muſt not be one for them, and another againſt them: for in ſo doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhall never ſee good dayes.</p>
                  <p>And you Gentlemen, when are your hearts and hands againſt them? when did you ever ſpeak or write againſt them? when did you ever ſet foot in ſtriving to have them ſuppreſt? men ſtand with their fingers in their mouthes, and their hands in their pockets, and dare not ſtand for God and good cauſes. The Lord be merciful unto us: we doe not joyne our forces, prayers and powers that we can make for Gods glory. Oh that the Lord would be pleaſed to put his Spirit into our hearts, that we may be all of one mind. So you Gentlemen, in your places, and we Miniſters in our places, and all of us, we are with all the ſtrength and courage and mettle that the Lord hath put into us, to cry, and pray, and preach down ſinne. And all you Maſters and Dames, you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your Families: for theſe ſinnes bring down puniſhments upon the Land. Therefore labour to find out the wickednſſe of your Families, and admoniſh them, and reprove them plainly, and ſhew them from Gods word the puniſhments that are due to them. If you would doe theſe things, then there might be ſomething done: and if reproof and admoniſhment will not ſerve the turne, then expell them and baniſh them, as Abraham did Hagar and Iſmael. You Chriſtians, mourne for your ſins, and joyne your hearts and prayers againſt the ſins of the place where you live.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:44191:170"/>If any houſe be on fire, others will come with water to quench it as if it were their own: so here is a flame of fire kindled in this Kingdome of England, and the wrath of God is like wild-fire coming down upon us from heaven: therefore let every one of us bring ſome water or other to quench this fire that is round about us in every place, and almoſt upon all hearts.</p>
                  <p>Let every man ſweep his own doore, and the ſtreets will be cleane; ſo if every one would purge his own heart, what reformation would there be in every place? then God and Chriſt and goſpel might be here ſtill, and the enemies might be kept out ſtill: which if we doe not, who knows how ſoon the enemie may ruſh in upon us? but alas, we harbour theſe traytors in our boſomes.</p>
                  <p>I proteſt againſt every man that habours ſin in his own houſe or ſoul, that he is a traytor to the Kingdom, whatſoever he be; if I knew the man, I would faſten mine eyes on him, and tell him, Oh thou vile Achan, doeſt thou harbour theſe ſins, and traytors, and keep theſe ſins, and then cry out of the dangerouſneſſe of the times?</p>
                  <p>If a man did know certainly, that the dogge that he keepes in his houſe, would one day pull out his throate, would he keep him fatte that he might the better doe it? no ſure, he would rather hang him. Or if a man did know that the fire that burnes upon the hearth, would burne him, would he blow it? or if a man did know that the knife which he hath, would one day cutte his throate, would he ſharpen it? no ſurely.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, this is the caſe of all us poor wretches that live in ſinne: they will be the cauſe of all the puniſhments that God ſends upon us all. Now therefore, I charge you all, men and women, and every one of you, to make a Covenant and enter into an oath and a curſe, to ſearch out eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin, and find them out in your families, wife and children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and do what you can to quench them. Theſe Townes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys are on fire, O that the Lord would be pleaſed to ſend his word home to every one of your hearts: you I meane that I love as well as mine own ſoule, my deare people. I would ſpend and be ſpent for you, if God would give me ſtrength and though I ſpeak plaine, it is for your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting good.</p>
                  <p>What are thoſe puniſhments that he threatned to poure upon them in the furie of his wrath? He poureth full battails, and the ſtrength of battails; all this was upon his own deare people Iſrael; even thoſe people the Lord ſo ſeverely threatens.</p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve this Doctrine, That the Lord oftentimes brings fearful,<note place="margin">Doctrine 3.</note> and unavoydable judgements and puniſhments even upon his own profeſſing people: even they that offer ſacrifice, and that pray, and call him Father, and faſt and pray, even upon theſe people he doth often times bring theſe puniſſiments. Amos 3. 2. You onely have I known among all the Nations of the earth: therefore will I puniſh you for all your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>See the whole currant of Gods word: did not the Lord puniſh the Children of Iſrael in the time of their Judges? they had many ſore ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:44191:171"/>
as Eglon and Siſera. The ten Tribes they ſinned, and were carried into captivity: and theſe were Gods profeſſing people. And afterward the other two Tribes, Judah and Benjamine, were carried away captive into Babylon, and there they were ſeventy years.</p>
                  <p>Forty yeares after Chriſts time, the Romans came againſt them, and burnt all their Cities. And theſe were Gods own profeſſing people.</p>
                  <p>The Churches of Aſia were famous Churches, but now they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne with Turkes. Now, our ſins give God juſt cauſe to make him come againſt us, with puniſhments and judgements upon this Land.</p>
                  <p>If a man lie ſick, and they ſee death in his face, they call it the foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſigne: ſo the Miniſters of God may foreſee the death and deſtruction of a Kingdome. I am ſure we have better grounds, then the Phyſicians can have. And therefore, why may not the Miniſters which are Gods Phyſicians, doe it?</p>
                  <p>The ſignes of Gods puniſhments that are coming upon us, are theſe,</p>
                  <p>The firſt is of Gods Miniſters which with one voice doe foretel judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to come.</p>
                  <p>Then, this is a ſigne that God haſteneth to battel, Amos 3. 7. Surely the Lord will doe nothing but he revealeth his ſecrets to his ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: but eſpecially when they agree all in one thing; then the Kingdom is dangerouſly gone. Luke 1. 70. The Lord giveth one mouth, as he ſpake by the mouth of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all his holy Prophets.</p>
                  <p>I will ſay nothing in this, but let me appeale to your conſciences, whether all good Miniſters in the Church of England, have not declared by Gods word, that judgements are coming out againſt this Land and us for many yeares together: And as our Saviour ſaith, Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in beaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when ſinnes of all ſorts doe abound frequently, and with a bold face, and whoriſh forehead. For when the harveſt is ripe, then cometh ſo many ſickles to cut it down: ſo when the ſinnes of a Kingdome are ripe, then it is time to cut that Kinddome down. Geneſ. 6. 12. The earth was filled with violence, all fleſh had corrupted their wayes: therefore, make an Arke: for the end of all fleſh is come, God will waſh away their filthineſſe. Conſider whether it be not thus with England or no. Was ever drunkenneſſe and blaſphemie, and ſcoffing at religion, and prophaning Gods Sabbaths, nay liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo to do, was it ever come to that height that now it is? were ever great ones, as Biſhops and Miniſters, ſo defiled, as now they are? our Land hath often been overcome: when men were grown deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, then they were deſtroyed. Now, what ſinnes, what blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, what hating of God lyeth raging in our times? I think there is none in this Congregation but ſees and heares, how City and Countrey are venomed and benumned, and defiled with ſinnes of all ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when the devill and wicked men caſt bones of diſſention, that is a ſigne of ruine. When there was a diſſention between Rehoboam and the people, then God pulled away ten Tribs, and much bloud
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:44191:171"/>
was ſhed. So when King and Commons, and all are divided, Ephraim againſt Manaſſes and Manaſſes againſt Ephraim, but both againſt Judah, then it is a fearfull ſigne that that Nation ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, to apply this, if ever a Kingdome were divided, then this is, if we could all accord, then we might expect ſomething: but now, our beſt bloud is gone, and our hearts are gone: the Lord in mercie raiſe us up from dead aſhes.</p>
                  <p>O conſider this, I beſeech you, and lay it to heart. Will God deceive his Miniſters, and make them all blindfold? no, no. When God puts his Spirit into his Miniſters, and makes them all with one mouth to call and cry deſolation, and when all manner of ſinnes ſo fearfully abound, and when there is ſuch diviſions in the State, then let us look for deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the fourth ſigne of Gods anger on a Nation is, when all the hearts of men faile, then it is a ſigne that vengeance is at the door; when there is a kinde of Cowardiſe through the guilt of the conſcience. Joſh. 2. 11. It was a certaine ſigne of deſtruction when the peoples hearts failed them: thus it is with every man almoſt amongſt us: every mans heart is faint and ſick. Iudges 7. 13. When Gideon was to goe againſt the Midianites, being a wonderfull Army, one dreamed that a cake of barley bread tumbled into the hoſt, and overthrew them: Then Gideon ſaid, be of good courage: for I ſee that the Lord hath given them into our hands, becauſe their hearts were feareful; ſo he took three hundred men, and put a trumpet in every mans hand, with empty pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and lamps; and they cried, the Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon; and in the twelfth verſe ſee what followed, All the hoſt ran and cried and fled. Even ſo it is with us: we faint upon every occaſion, Gods ſpirit is gone from England.</p>
                  <p>While Sampſon had the Spirit of God upon him, he was too hard for the Philiſtins: but when the Spirit of God was gone from him, he had no heart, no ſpirit, no courage; then every man was too hard for him, and then he was taken, and had his eyes pulled out. So when the Spirit of God was with this Nation, we had courage and got the day; but now alas, every ſlaviſh Nation is too hard for us, and every bug-beare ſcares us. O poore England, heavy is thy caſe, therefore we may expect nothing but miſerie one way or another.</p>
                  <p>Now I might ſet down a Comment or Theame with many teares for this cauſe, that every one may reade his own deſtruction from this point. I am not a Prophet, nor the ſonne of a Prophet: but from the word of the Lord I ſpeak this thing unto you, and upon theſe grounds I can ſay ſo; That where theſe ſignes are, deſtruction and calamities follow at the heeles of them. We having all theſe ſignes in our State, certainely deſtruction is at our heeles; therefore let me giue you ſome directions what to doe in theſe dangerous times.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let every man knock off the love of the world, of houſes, of<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> lands, and corne, and flockes; they ſhortly ſhall leave thee, or thou them. O therefore caſt them quite out of thy heart. I would to God I could bring my heart and yours to this pitch, that we could give wife
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:44191:172"/>
and children and all as loſt. I confeſſe it is hard ſo to doe: but God will fire us out ſhortly from theſe things, if we part not from them, in theſe our deepeſt afflictions. Ier. 45. 5. Baruch was ſo much glued to the world, that he began to feather his neſt: and therefore the Prophet ſaid, ſeekeſt thou great things for thy ſelfe? ſeeke them not; for behold I will bring evill upon all fleſh. So let me ſay to you as the Prophet ſaid to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi, Is it now a time to build? Therefore at night when thou goeſt to bed, take thy leave of thy wife and children, and of thy houſes and all, and ſay, this houſe may be mine enemies before the morning, or may be ſet on fire; this is not my wife: theſe are not my children: As Doctor Taylor ſaid when he was going to his execution, when he ſaw his wife and children, he embraced them and bleſſed them in the name of the Lord, and ſet them down again and made no bones of them: and ſo do you, pluck away your hearts from all theſe things here below, and give them all for loſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, get divine ſubmiſſion to the will of God, let thy heart be contented that God ſhould doe with thee what he will, and ſubmit thy ſelfe to God in the hardeſt blows, and ſay, Good Lord, if thou ſeeſt no remedy to purge this land and Church, but by deſolation, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the Goſpell, good Lord, doe what thou wilt; if thou wilt have my liberty, take it, if thou wilt have my children ſpoiled by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy and pitched upon ſpeares points, doe it: Lord, if there be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to purge a ſinfull land but by taking the Goſpell out of it, even I Lord ſubmit my ſelfe unto it: good Lord ſacrifice us, or burne our Cities; doe what thou wilt with us, onely ſave our ſoules at the laſt.</p>
                  <p>I have knowne ſome could have no quietneſſe at all, till they came to this pitch, and then they had peace in their minds. When Iſaac ſaw that he was to be bound, then he yeelded to it: and our Lord Chriſt did this in the garden when he did bear the wrath of God, then he ſaid, if it be poſſible, let this cuppe paſſe from me: and this he did three times: yet not my will but thy will be done; if thou wilt have me to drinke of the cuppe, I will ſuck off the dregges and all.</p>
                  <p>Alſo come and lay thy head upon the block, and let God doe what he will with thee, Ezek. 20. 43. They ſhall loath themſelves for all their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations; and this is the practiſe of an humble ſoule, and this will bear through all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, pray and cry mightily to God before thou dyeſt, even all the time thou haſt to live, for mercie and for the peace of the Church of God, and for the poor people and poſterity. Eſay. 62. 16. I have ſet watchmen upon the walles of Hiruſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lem, that never hold their peace day nor night. You that make profeſſion of the Lord, keep not ſilence; let not God reſt till he helpe and ſhew mercy unto our poore land, wives and children.</p>
                  <p>I am perſwaded if dumbe Zachary were here, he would open his mouth to pray and crie for this miſerable land. But, alas, poor ſoules, many of you are ſo bound in the chaines of your ſinnes, that you cannot finde any leiſure to pray; you ſave your prayers and teares till you

come to hell, and then they will doe you no good; Oh, thy Mother lies a dying, and wilt thou not mourne for her? O dead and drie-hearted wretches, me thinkes the poor Church of England is like the ſhippe of Jonas, and he faſt aſleep in it; the Goſpell and all are drawing into a ſea of troubles: and thou poor wretch art aſleepe and canſt not pray. The Church is like a ſick man upon his bed: and the Parliament is like a Colledge full of Physitians, they caſt the ſtate of the Kingdome, and then give it over for loſt. The Lord knows how ſoon the bell may ring out; and yet thou canſt not pray nor weep. Ah, the Lord be mercifull to the hardneſſe of our hearts. Haſt thou but one rear in thine eyes? but one prayer in thy heart? then ſpend them now for the poore Church of God. Make all ſound within, and get ſound faith in the bloud of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that may ſupport and hold you up as the Ark did Noah in the floud.</p>
                  <p>O my dear people of this Pariſh, a fearefull floud is come upon this land: therefore make you an Arke of Gopher, and pitch it within and without: get in it, hang not about it; but, get into your Lord Chriſt, and ſhut up your ſelves in him, as Noah did in the Arke, and never come out. This is your ſafegard, if you be in him, you ſhall be ſupported a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all troubles, and ſo ſhall the caſe go well with you. For as the Prophet ſaid to Ahab, High thee hence, for here is a ſound of much rain: and there came a ſhour indeed. So ſay I, high you away to Chriſt: for it may be you ſhall not hear many Sermons more: there is a ſound of many puniſhments and ſtormes falling downe upon us. O thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are we that have Chriſt upon good termes and good grounds: if a floud come, it doth me good to ſee how ſafe I am: for the higher trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ariſe, the higher the Arke will ariſe, and the higher your faith and comfort will ariſe, and you ſhall ſit like Noah in the Cabin. Iſai. 26. 20. Come my people and enter into the chamber, and ſhut the doores about thee, and hide your ſelves as it were for a little moment, untill the indignation be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.</p>
                  <p>What? would Noah have been hired to come out of the Arke? no by no meanes: nothing would have got him out. I may even pitty you my people, that have no Faith. What will you doe and whither will you flie? all you that have not gotten into the Arke, and have not made ſure worke, if the floud ſhould come to morrow, you muſt certainly be drowned. If you look to God, he is your Enemy, if you look within, there your conſciences dogge you; and if thou lookeſt for comfort to the Miniſter, there is none for thee in all Gods word; if thou hang on a Miniſter, he muſt ſay as Samuel ſaid to Saul, ſince the Lord hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee, I can doe thee no good. Oh thinke on this, and get all thy friends into the Arke with thee, as Noah did. Let me begge this at your hands; get a poor husband into the Ark with thee, with thy poor children, and ſhut them all up into the Arke with thee. Would it not grieve thee when thou ſitteſt in the Arke, to ſee a poore huſband or a child drowning in the floud, and going to Hell? For the Lords ſake, O my deere Brethren, ſpare no paines to doe them good.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, get a more ſtrong faith then ordinary; deep dangers
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:44191:173"/>
muſt have a ſtronger Faith; a man cannot row upon the maine ocean in a paire of ſcullers; but he muſt have a good ſhip well ballaſted, and a good Pilot; ſo doe you think to row upon the maine ocean of Gods wrath in a paire of ſcullers? therefore labour to ſtrengthen your Faith, and to get a good ſhip, wel pitcht and ballaſted, and ſubſtantia'l Faith; for the wind will trie it whether it be ſo or not; a Summers dublet will not ſerve the turne in a winters ſroſt; ſo a little ſtrength and comfort will not ſerve the turne in the ſtorms that are coming on us; but we muſt get winter garments; the Eaſt wind will try a mans clothes. Though a weak Faith may carry thee to Heaven, yet not with ſo much comfort as a ſtronger; eſpecially if it be but a little before the downfall of the Pope; for then there will be the greateſt combuſtions that ever was or ever ſhall be; and by all likelihoods, the time is now at hand. Then, thy Faith had need to be greater then ever it was. As the Angell ſaid to the Prophet, up and eat, for thou haſt a great journey to goe; ſo ſay I to thee, thou fainting ſoule, make a good meale of Faith, ſtrengthen thy Faith upon the promiſes, for thou haſt a great work to doe, and happily thou mayſt goe ſix monethes, and not ſee the face of a good Miniſter, nor talk with a good Miniſter, when there ſhall be no more Rogers, Hookers, Beadles and Cottons to talk with; and you ſhall wander about in the woods; your faith will ſupport you then, it will doe you ſome good. When all the people had loſt Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Eleazer one of the Worthies, aroſe and ſmote the Philiſtines, 2 Sam. 11. 23. So when all Gods Miniſters ſhall leave thee, and then to fight it out againſt thine own luſts, and the Divell, and his temptations, will be hard, and this Faith thou haſt need of, when thy books and all helps ſhall be taken from thee. What need haſt thou of ſtrong Faith, when thou muſt fight againſt half a ſcore Papiſts and an Army of temptations, and a world of Divils from Hell? then thou haſt need of a ſtronger Faith then ordinarie. When you ſhall take your leave of your children and never ſee them more, then thou haſt need of Faith to inveſt thee into the promiſes. Hebr. 11. 21. By Faith Jacob bleſſed both the ſonnes of Joſeph when he was a dying; ſo when thou art to leave thy wife and children, and never to ſee them more, what Faith haſt thou need of to inveſt them into the Promiſes, and to ſay, I look to ſee you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day in Heaven? the Lord be with you my deare wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I ſhall never ſee you any more here, but I beleeve that one day we ſhall meet together in a world of happineſſe, where we ſhall be together in glory for ever and ever.</p>

                     <bibl>HEB. 11. 28.</bibl>
                     <q>Of whom the world was not worthy.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the Author or Penman of this holy Epiſtle I will not now ſtand to diſcuſſe. But this is certaine who ever was the Scribe, the Spirit of God was the Inditer, and all Scripture is given by Divine inſpiration, 2 Tim. 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>For the Coherence; the Spirit of God having exhorted the Believers how to continue in the Faith, and with patience to undergoe thoſe trials which accompany the profeſſion of it; and having back it with Arguments, he cometh in this Chapter to profeſſe the ſame; And you ſhall find in this whole Chapter, he layes down Arguments to back the exhortations, which are taken from the Excellency of faith.</p>
                  <p>The holy Ghoſt diſcovers it two wayes. Firſt, by a generall deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the three firſt verſes; and after by the worthy examples of the faithful in the Church of old.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:44191:175"/>Firſt, the generall deſcription of Faith in the firſt verſe, Faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is the ground of things, &amp;c. Faith makes things hoped for ſubſiſt to a Beleever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he deſcribes the eſſentiall properties of it; It makes Beleevers to be well accounted of, both of God and man, verſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſhews that Faith makes beleevers to underſtand and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve things incredible to reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he deſcribes Faith by examples and patterns of Faith in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Church of old; and thoſe are ſet down ſeverally, one by one, from the fourth verſe to the 32, where he ſets down the example of Moſes and Abraham; and then from verſe 32. to the end of the chapter, he ſets down the example of the Saints together; and that becauſe the number of them was infinite, Ergo he diſpatches them, and paſſes by them with bare naming of them, as, what ſhall I make mention of Gideon, &amp;c? and ſo he ſhews what great things they did by Faith; and then he brings in this verſe, Of whom the world was not worthy.</p>
                  <p>To come to the words, they are brought in by the holy Ghoſt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a ſecret Objection that the holy Ghoſt did foreſee, that the wicked perſecutors of the Church would conceive againſt the godly;</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ob.</note>Viz. Why did they wander up and down? were beleevers cruelly dealt withal? yes: for alas what were they? they were and are baggage peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not worthy to live in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>Now the holy Ghoſt takes away this objection; as if he ſhould have ſaid, you are deceived in them; for the world is not worthy of them, they were and are too good to live in the world.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to the main, we will note ſomething in general.</p>
                  <p>Viz. That it hath been the property of wicked men, and is ſtill, to think what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever<note place="margin">Doctrine 1.</note> the godly have, is too good for them.</p>
                  <p>Ye ſhall be hated of all men, Matth. 24. And have not the ſaints of God found it ſo? what a hard conceit had the Iews of Chriſt? He is not worthy to live. So of Paul, Acts 22. They were accounted the off ſcouring of the world, 2 Cor. 4. 13. And as it was in the Apoſtles times, ſo it is now; and would you know the reaſon?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe God hath choſen them out of the world. John 15. 19.<note place="margin">Reaſon. 1.</note> For when Gods people were as ſhe world is, carnal and ſenſual, &amp;c. then the world gave them the right hand of fellowſhip. But when a change ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the godly, then the world changed too.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe the wicked know not the godly. (viz.) they know them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not to be Gods children; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, They ſpeak evil of the things that they know not, Jude 10. They know him as he is rich, or as he comes of ſuch and ſuch a parentage; but as he is a child of God, they know him not. This world knows him not, becauſe it knows not God. 1 Iohn 3. 1. And hence it is that Gods children are called ſirangers, yea, and are uſed ſtrangely; even becauſe they know not God, and Ergo, they know not the child.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe wicked men meaſure others by themſelves; and becauſe they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> runne not into the ſame exceſſe of riot, ergo they ſpeak evill of them, 1. Pet. 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:44191:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. Becauſe there ever was, and ever will be, contrariety between the ſeed of the woman, and the Serpent. Eſau will deale very hardly with Iacob; they that are borne of the devil, will hate them that are born of God, 1 Iohn 3. 12.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This ſhould teach the godly when they are hardly dealt with in<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> the world in any kind, not to be diſcouraged. Think it not ſtrange; it hath alwayes been ſo, neither muſt you look for better dealing with wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing the world deales ſo hardly with you, ſee that you<note place="margin">2:</note> doe not meaſure like for like; but pray ye unto God for them, to open their eyes.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the words themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Of whom the world was not worthy.</p>
                  <p>The holy Ghoſt in this place would diſcover two things;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the little worth of the world of wicked men, viz. how that they are not worthy to come into the preſence of the Godly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the great worth of the godly.</p>
                  <p>Viz. They are too good for the world.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the world, (viz.) the wicked in the world, are very little worth; not worth one godly man or woman in it; whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that</p>
                  <p>Gods Children are worthy perſons.<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I handle this point, I will give the ſence and meaning of the words.</p>
                  <p>1. This word World is diverſly taken. Sometims it is taken for the whole Fabrick of Heaven and earth, Iohn 1. 10. He was in the world and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. So Acts 17. 24. God that made the world, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes it is taken for all mankind, good and bad So Rom. 5. 12. As by one man ſin entred into the world (viz.) ſin entred into the men which are in the world.</p>
                  <p>3. Sometimes it is taken for the elect onely; ſo Iohn 1. 29. Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſinne of the world, (viz.) the elect in the world. Again, God ſo loved the world, &amp;c. Iohn 3. 1. 16. (viz.) his elect in the world. Again, we beleeve this is the Saviour of the world, Iohn 4. 42. (viz.) of the elect in the world.</p>
                  <p>But why are the godly called the <hi>world?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt becauſe the world was made for them, and it is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> yet for their ſakes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they may be called the world, becauſe they are ſcattered through the world, and that not onely among the Iewes, but even among the Gentiles alſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they may be called the world, becauſe in themſelves they are a world of people; but yet compare them with the Devils drove, they are few, even as the ſhaking of the Olive tree. Iſaiah 17. 6. yet in themſelves they are as the Starres in number. Geneſis. 15. 5. And Balaam ſaid, who can number the duſt of Iacob? Numb. 22. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:44191:176"/>Sometimes it is taken for the reprobates in the world. ſo John 15. 19. If you were of the world, the world would love its owne. It is plain alſo in the prayer of Chriſt; I pray not for the world, John 17. 9. And they may fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called the world; Firſt becauſe they are the worlds Citizens, they mind the things of the world, they follow nothing but the world. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe they are the greateſt part of the world.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the world is taken for the things in the world, thoſe things wherewith the Devill uſes to draw men from God; as the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, the pride of life. 1. John 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes for the happy eſtate and condition the godly ſhall enjoy after this life. So Luke 20 35. They which ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that world &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, of whom the world was not worthy; I take it, he means wicked men in the world, and thoſe are they that are not worthy the company of the godly. And becauſe I intend to ſhew the unworthineſſe of the world, I will ſhew firſt that the things in this world are little worth. Secondly that the men in the world are little worth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt I will ſhew you, that the things in the world are little worth; as Riches, Honours, pleaſures &amp;c. they are called deceitfull riches; and Chriſt calls them the Mammon of iniquity, Luke 16. 9. traſh. Luke 8. 14. Snares, 1 Tim. 6. 9. They are called uncertain riches. Now theſe baſe titles muſt needs argue that they are little worth; for were they worth more, God would ſet better Titles on them. And Salomon who had beſt experience of them, yet hee termes them vanity. Eccleſ. 1, 2. and 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are little worth, becauſe they are very unprofitable, they cannot pofit a man; It is plain by the ſpeech of Samuel, 1. Sam. 12. 21. Vain things which cannot profit, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are little worth, becauſe they cannot further a man in the main thing at which he ſhould aime; they may further a man in ſome trifles, but not in the maine thing. There is no true good comes to a man by all the riches in the world; neither can they free a man from the evill day; neither can they make you better either in reſpect of God or your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in reſpect of God, they cannot make you better eſteemed with God: for he regards not the rich more then the poore. Job. 34. 19. He doth not account of a man according to his greatneſſe, but according to his goodneſſe, Prov. 20. 7, 8. Better is a poor man that walks in his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, then a King that is perverſe in his wayes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they cannot better him in reſpect of God, becauſe they cannot aſſure him of the love of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they cannot make a man more mindfull of God; nay they corrupt mens hearts, they make a man more forgetfull of God. It is thus with the greateſt part of men in the world that are worldly rich; it is with them as it was with the Prodigall, who while he had money in his purſe, never did he think on his Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:44191:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fourthly, the things of this world cannot make a man more thankfull to God, but rather the contrary, ut ſupra.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the things of this world cannot draw a man neerer unto God. You ſee that the more men have, the more negligent they are in Gods ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in reſpect of our ſelves; Firſt, all the things of this life cannot in rich a mans ſoule with grace; they cannot make him humble, nor mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, nor conſtant in the profeſſion of godlineſſe and good duties; nay it rather makes them the more unmeet to any goodneſſe; where there is gaine in the cheſt, there is loſſe in the Conſcience; he that gets money apace, may loſe Faith and a good Conſcience; and they that moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for abundance of the things of this life, are moſt backward in Grace; and this argues that the things of this life are little worth, even in reſpect of a mans ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are not able to free a man from any ſpirituall evill; they may promiſe freedome, but when they come to the triall, they will be like a broken ſtaffe; nay they cannot free thee ſo much as from an ague, much leſſe will they help in the day of the Lords wrath, when the rich man ſhall be called to an account, and the Lord will recompence every man according to his wayes. So Prov. 11. 4. Riches profit not in the day of wrath. True it is, they may be as a wall of braſſe to keep off the evil of this world; yet when the houre of death approacheth, they cannot free from that; when you are affrighted with the accuſation of your owne Conſciences, and with the apprehenſion of Gods wrath, when the Devill ſhall ſet upon you, and all your friends forſake you, ſhall the things of this life then doe you any pleaſure? no, no. You wil ſay to them then, as Job to his friends, miſerable comforters are you all; this argues their little worth: For God will not examine you, how rich you have been, but he will conſider you as you have honoured him, and as you have made good uſe of your riches; if you have been faithfull, you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into your Maſters joy. He will not conſider you as you are or have been in great Offices or places in the world, but as you have been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in them; not as you had crouching and bowing to you, but as you have faithfully and frequenly bowed your knees unto the Lord in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; God will not account of you, a ſtraw the better for your wealth, but he will paſſe ſentence on you as you have uſed or abuſed your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they can give no content. He that deſires Riches ſhall not be ſatiſfied therewith. Eccleſ. 5. 9.</p>
                  <p>Object. O but, I deſire but a competent living.</p>
                  <p>Sol. It is well done. A little ſpring running from the head, runnes ſhallow at the firſt, but at the laſt, many other falling into it, it is become great; ſo you may ſay, you deſire but a competency; but the world comes on you, then there is craving and having, till your deſires are as large as hell. Habbac. 2. 5. riches make men ſick of a dogs diſeaſe; what is that? why dogs are alwaies eating, but never ſatisfied; ſo if a man immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love the things of this life, he ſhall not be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:44191:177"/>Laſtly, the things of this world are nothing worth becauſe we have no aſſurance of them: they are of no continuance, they either leave us, or we them: doe you not ſee that after a man hath riſen earely, and late, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the bread of carefulneſſe, and hath gotten a little pelfe, is he not thereof deprived in a moment of time? Prov. 12. 27. The ſlothfull man (viz.) the worldly man, roſteth not that which he tooke in hunting, (viz.) after all his travaile he is ſwept away, and taketh not the profit of them. Is not this then a worthleſſe world? but ſuppoſe it doe ſtay with you, yet one day you muſt part with it. Pſalm. 49. 6, 7. and you muſt carrie nothing with you, naked you came, and naked you muſt returne; even like a ſumpter-Horſe, which carries all the day abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Treaſure, but at night it is all taken from him, and he is put into a ſtable for his labour; all the benefit he gets by the Treaſure, is, he onely feeles the weight of it. Even ſo many rich men are Sumpter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes to carrie the things of the world, who either for ill-uſeing, or ill-getting them, are put in a filthie ſtable, (viz.) Hell, and their pay is everlaſting torment. Theſe things ſhew the little worth of this world.</p>
                  <p>Now you ſhall ſee that worldly men are little worth: Firſt it appears that they are little worth, becauſe of the names and titles that the Spirit of God laies on them; it calls them Sonnes of Beliall. 1 Sam. 2. 12. Vile perſons. Pſal. 15. 4. Children of iniquity. Hoſea 10. 9. 11. A reprobate ſtock. John 8. 44. Children of wrath. Epheſ. 2. Now if there were any great worth in them, think you that the Spirit of God would not better ſtile them?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are little worth in reſpect of their actions; their beſt actions are but glittering ſinnes, Iſaiah 66. 3. If they pray, or heare &amp;c. God accounts of it no better then the ſacrificing of Swines fleſh; they ſtink in Gods noſtrils. Iſa. 1. 13.</p>
                  <p>If then the men of the world, and the things of the world be little worth, how doth this diſcover the madneſſe and folly of men in theſe dayes who ſo much mind the world? no paines nor travaile too great, or too dangerous to get the world; nay they will hazard life and health, even to the back-bone, to get the world; goe to bed late, riſe early, not caring if they loſe both body and ſoule, to get the world: and when their conſciences are thus ſet on the tenters to get it, they ſet their hearts on it and keep it as their God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let this informe our Judgements, that ſeeing the world, and the men of the world are ſo little worth; let us judge of them no better then they deſerve; it is a falſe glaſſe, or crooked rule that men goe by, who judge themſeves men of worth if they be rich, and we uſe to ſay there is a man of good credit; let us ſee our folly in thus judging. I will diſcover it thus.</p>
                  <p>The things of the world are given to the worſt men; wicked men have many times the greateſt ſhare in them. Eſau hath foure hundred at his heeles, when Iacob had but a few; The Scribes and Phariſees ſate in Moſes chaire, when as the Diſciples of Chriſt were carried before Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:44191:177"/>
ſo for Riches, proud Dives fared deliciouſly every day, when poor Lazarus was faine to ſnap at a cruſt; ſo the falſe prophets were fed at Ieſabells table, when Elias was in commons with the Ravens. Now if the things of this life were of ſuch great worth, think you that God would keep his children ſo ſparingly with them? no, no; they are but gifts of Gods left hand. Prov. 3. 16. Length of dayes are in his right hand, and in his left hand riches and Honour.</p>
                  <p>Inſtruction, to teach us to take off our hearts and affections from<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> purſuing things of this life. You ſee they are little worth; doe not in affection love the world, nor yet in action too much ſeek the world; but when Heaven and earth are laide in the ballance, eſteem earthly things as dung in reſpect of Chriſt, and ſhew your little eſteem of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, by your ſeeking them in the ſecond place, and Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the firſt place; Let wicked men account the things of this life as their ſummum bonum; but let us be crucified to the world, let us be as dead men to the world, and the world as dead to us; not that I would have you utterly to reject the things of this life, but not to ſet your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on them; we muſt uſe the things of this life as Travailers doe their proviſion; if they have too much, it will hinder them; ſo let us be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent whether it be much or little; it is beſt to lay up treaſure in Heaven, as Chriſt told his Diſciples. Thus of the firſt point; the ſecond fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>OF whom the world was not worthy, as if he ſhould have ſaid, they are too good to live in the world; hence obſerve; That true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> are perſons of very great worth. The world is not worthy of them.</p>
                  <p>I need not ſpend much time to prove this; they are called excellent perſons, Pſal. 16. 3. Againe, the righteous is more excellent then his neighbour. Prov. 12. 26. againe, they are called the glory of God, Iſaiah 4. 5. They are called a choſen people, a Royall Prieſthood. 1 Pet. 2. 9. Now, wherin lies the worth of a godly man? not in the outward man; for alas the outward man of a child of God is the ſame with another man. Their chiefe worthineſſe lies in the inward man which after God is created unto righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe. Epheſians 4. 24. The Kings daughter is all glorious within. Pſalm. 45. 13. Now Gods people are worthy perſons, and that in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in reſpect of the worthy names they have. Doe they not, ſaith the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Apoſtle, blaſpheme the worthy name by the which ye are called? Iames 2. 7. (viz.) the name of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are worthy, becauſe there was a great price paid for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them; it adds much to the worth of a thing when there is a great price
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:44191:178"/>
paide for it; ſo this adds to the worth of all true beleevers, that the price was great that was paid for them; they were not bought with corruptible things; not with two hundred fore skinnes of the Phyliſtines, as David bought Michal; nor with thirty change of garment, the reward of thoſe that unfolded Sampſons Riddle; they were not bought with a great ſumme of Money, as the Romane Burgeſſe ſhippe was; I ſay, not with corruptible things, but with the precious bloud of Jeſus Chriſt; for in him wee have redemption through his bloud. Coloſsians 1. 14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are worthy in reſpect of the Conſciences of the wicked; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is for their worth, that they beare them malice; it is goodneſſe that is perſecuted in good men. I appeale to the Conſciences of wicked men, whether their Conſciences tell them not, that there is worth in the godly for which they beare them a ſecret grudge; but if their Conſciences be ſleepy; and tell them not ſo much, yet I am ſure their practiſes proclaime it. The grace that is in the godly, is the eye-ſore of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Gods people are perſonages of great worth, in reſpect of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Priviledges which God hath been pleaſed to dignifie them withall, which are infinite, if I ſhould name them all; wherefore as out of a Garden, where are diverſe ſorts of flowers, I will gather ſome few.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Priviledge wherein their worth is manifeſt, is their Royall deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they are not baſely borne; No, they have Kings for their nurſing Fathers, and Queenes for their nurſing Mothers; they are ſonnes and daughters of the King of Heaven, and it is uſuall in the Scripture to call them the Children of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as they are Royally deſcended, ſo they are Royally attended.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To ſpeak reverendly, God attends them, he keeps them as the apple of his eye; and Chriſt is their Captain, he goes before them to conduct them; and under God and Chriſt we have Angels, they pitch round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them that fear the Lord, Pſal. 34. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are worthy in reſpect of their places. They that truſt in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Lord ſhall be as Mount Zion, Pſal. 125. 1. which cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in reſpect of their fare; they have Benjamin's Meſſe, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is five times more then his brethren's; ſo the portion of Gods children is five thouſand times more then the wicked's; Heaven is their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they are worthy in reſpect of their Royall apparell; as a worthy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> man is richly apparelled, ſo a godly man is clothed with the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt. Rev. 3. 9</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, in this reſpect alſo, becauſe they are out of debt, they need not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> feare any Sergeant to arreſt them, no not death: for Chriſt hath cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the hand-writing Col. 2. 14.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, in reſpect they may goe boldly to the throne of grace, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that they ſhal be heard in prayer. For whatſoever we aske, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, &amp;c. 1 John 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:44191:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>Eightly, all things worke together ſtill for them to the beſt. Romans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 8. 28.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, they are Gods beloved ones, his favourites, they have an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Gods peculiar providence. True it is he ſhews a generall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to all: but Gods people have a right in a more peculiar manner; for God will dwell with them John 14. 23. and he will keep the feet of his Saints. 1 Sam. 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, they have the free uſe of all Gods creatures; the Charter that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> was given by the great Lord of all, was forfeited to him by the fall of our firſt parents. They are the ſowre grape, and we their children, our teeth are ſet on edge. But Chriſt hath renewed this charter for his: all others are but uſurpers: though a wicked man have never ſo much, and never ſo good a title in regard of the Law of man, yet in Chriſt he ſhall be condemned for an intruder. Oh what a happy thing is this then for the godly? for whatſoever they have, they are the right owners of it: all things are theirs, and they are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, they are perſons of great worth in reſpect of their preſence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> where they live, the places fare the better for them. Laban fared the better for Jacob, and Potiphar ſared the better for Joſeph. While Lot was in Sodome, the Lord could do nothing againſt the Sodomites: they keepe the judgements from the places where they live, they are the pillars of the Land.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly in reſpect of their actions: a true beleever in his praier praies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> for himſelfe and for others. Abraham prayed for Abimelech, and God heard him. Gen. 20. 17. and Moſes prayed for Pharaoh, and God remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the plagues, as you may ſee in Exodus.</p>
                  <p>Thirteenthly in reſpect of the great things which are laid up and reſerved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> of God for them in the world to come, ſuch as no eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>But are they ſuch men of worth? why, they are not eſteemed at all, neither are they at all well ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer</note>Firſt, know this: you that are godly, be not diſcouraged; this takes nothing from your worth. For who are they that ſay thus? none but a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> company of mad men and fools: and who regards ſuch?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If all ſhould ſpeak well of you, then woe be unto you.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Envie is evermore the companion of vertue. Learne then,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the more you are reviled, the more to make your light to ſhine before men that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven. No man yet ever lived, though never ſo worthy, but of ſome he hath been deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Know this in concluſion, that you that are thus deſpiſed, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is a part of your worth. For when all men ſpeake evill of you, then bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are you.</p>
                  <p>This ſpeakes terrour to the wicked, who wrong the children of God, either<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> with tongue or hands: either by themſelves or by others: either by nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naming them, or by circumventing them; this I ſay ſpeakes terrible things againſt them. Will you offer to ſpeake againſt perſonages of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:44191:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great worth? againſt the children of a King? will the King endure that thou ſhouldeſt ſpeak againſt the bloud royall? no no, he will be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on them that doe ſo; doſt thou now wrong a godly man? thou ſhalt one day ſmart for it; for God is able to puniſh thee, yea and he will doe it, unleſſe thou ſpeedily repent. When Saul Acts 8. perſecuted the Church of Chriſt, Chriſt called from heaven and ſaid, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? I ſpeake to thoſe that are wicked men, and I ſpeake in the bowels of Chriſt, if you did know them, you would not doe it; for had they knowne the Lord of life, they would not have crucified him. 1 Cor. 2. 8. ſo, if ſuch as doe perſecute Gods children, did but know their worth, and that they were his children, they would not do it.</p>
                  <p>Let us eſteem godly men and women as perſons of great worth: The Saints of God have alwaies done ſo.</p>
                  <p>Saint Lawrence being demanded by his perſecutors, wherein the worth of the Church lay; the ſtory ſaith, he gathered a companie of poor people together, and pointed at them and ſaid, there lies the worth of the Church: ſo, I have read of an ancient King, who made a great feaſt, and invited a company of poor people which were Chriſtians, and he bade his Nobles alſo, now when the Chriſtians came, he had them up into the Preſence Chamber; but when the Nobles came, he ſet them in his hall. Being of the Nobles demanded the reaſon, he anſwered, I doe not this as I am their Kyng here; for I reſpect you more then them; but as I am a King of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, I muſt needs honour theſe, becauſe God doth moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, and then they ſhall be Kings and Princes with me: ſoe doe you eſteeme of them according to their worth, and ſhew it.</p>
                  <p>If they be perſons of ſuch great worth, here you may be directed how to<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> get a name of worth in the world, to be honoured of God. This is the way; labour to be beleevers, ſerve God and cloſe with the godly, be of one minde and of one heart with them. Honour is the thing that all deſire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of Saul to Samuel, Honour me before the Elders of my people: ſo we are all ready to ſay, oh that I could be honoured in the heart of thoſe that I converſe withall: I ſay then thou muſt labour to ſerve and honour God in thy heart, let that be thine honour. It is a meere folly for men to think to get honour by ſwearing, by lying, by cutting and ſlaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drunkenneſſe &amp;c. The ſweet ointment of a good name is not compounded of ſtinking ingredients.</p>
                  <p>That ſhould ſerve to comfort the godly: that ſeeing they are of ſo great<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> worth, what though they be diſgraced here, let this ſuffice thee, God that knows the true worth of every thing, he accounts thee worthy: what though dogs bark and crie out againſt thee for thy holineſſe? let them alone: and know thou this, that the time will come when never a curre of them all but will wiſh, oh that mine end might be like his, and that they might goe as thy dogge to heaven with thee, when they ſhall ſee thee ſitte at his right hand where are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:44191:179"/>Laſtly, you that approve your ſelves to be of the number of the godly, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to walke worthy of the Lord. Coloſ. 1. 10. Doth God thus advance you? then ſtrive you to honour him with inward and outward worſhip. God hath not done theſe things for you, that you may live as you liſt: no, you are a choſen generation, &amp;c. 1 Pet. 2. 19. Ergo, you muſt ſhew forth the vertue of him that hath called you. You that are parents of children, the more you doe for them, the more you look they ſhould honour you: the more God hath done for you, the more you ought to feare him. God hath drawn you out of darkeneſſe into a marvellous light, and will you yet walke as vaſſals of Satan? This was that kept Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoph from committing adultery, even the favour of advancement, and how then can I doe this great wickedneſse, ſaith he? ſo thou art advanced to honour, from a childe of the devill to be the ſon of God, how then canſt thou commit wickedneſſe? Conſider I ſay how God hath advanced thee from being a ſlave of Satan to be his adopted ſon: and ſhall I now become a covetous perſon, ſhall I be a companion of Gods enemies? when you are enticed by the divell or wicked men to any ſin, ſay, what ſhall ſuch a man as I conſent? ſhall I flie from my colours? what, a Kings ſon and flie? Conſider this.</p>

                     <q>The Lord ſaid, My Spirit ſhall not alway ſtrive with man, becauſe he is but fleſh, and his dayes ſhall be a hundred and twenty yeares.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter is continued the Hiſtory of the decay of the World, wherein is deſcribed Gods purpoſe of deſtroying mankind; in which are theſe two parts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the meritorious deſerving Cauſe, wherein God gives an account what he doth, how inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable the world is, and how juſt God is; unto the. 14 verſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a direction unto Noah to make an Arke; where we may ſee, that God in his judgement remembers mercy.</p>
                  <p>The meritorious deſerving cauſe is deſcribed, firſt, from the quantity of thoſe perſons in thoſe evill dayes; a great many, verſe the firſt; men began to multiply in places populous; where there are ſome good, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:44191:182"/>Secondly by the quality of thoſe perſons; the Sons of God, when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſaw the daughters of men, the ſonnes of God (viz.) the posterity of them that maintained Religion, they began to be careleſſe and carnally confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; they did looke after the profits and pleaſures of this life, and then it was high time for God to enter into Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by the kind of ſinne; They lusted after unlawfull Marriages <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> &amp;c. and the root of this was originall corruption; the Imaginations of mans heart, were onely evill, and that continually. verſe 5.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words, are a Proclamation of Gods purpoſe, to bring it to an end; in which are four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Lords complaint in theſe words, The Lord ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the proclamation it ſelfe in theſe words, my Spirit ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtrive with man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the reaſon, becauſe he is but fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the limitation of the time, a hundred and twenty years; in which time if they repent, I will repent; but if they will not, my Spirit ſhall not alway ſtrive. As if the Lord had ſaid, I have tried all concluſions and uſed all means, partly by Mercies to allure them, partly by Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to terrifie them; partly by my word to recall them, and by all meanes poſſible to bring them to my ſelfe, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine incorrigible; I now am reſolved to ſtrive with them no more.</p>
                  <p>From the words thus opened there will naturally ariſe theſe two points.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the Lord of Heaven and earth doth ſtrive mightily with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> of poore Rebells; and all to bring them unto himſelfe, but on this I intend not to inſiſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſeond is this, viz. that there is a time when God will ſtrive with men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o more, and that in this life; The ſcope of this aimes at the whole world; but what is ſaid in generall, may alſo be ſaid in particular. Well then, there is a time in this life, and not when we are dead and gone; for then it is certain there is no more comming unto God; but, in this life there is a time when God will ſtrive with men no more, neither for their good here, nor for their everlaſting happineſſe hereafter. For, unto every thing there is an appointed time. Eccleſ. 3. 1. Now the Lord calls lovingly to allure us; but there will come a time of, Goe ye curſed; the good Spirit of mine which thou haſt abuſed, ſhall never come to thee more; this is a marvailous troubleſome truth: yet moſt true; for men now will have their wills, and God muſt be at their leiſure, and come (forfooth) when they pleaſe. They will live as they liſt, doe as they liſt, and God muſt ſhew mercy on them as they liſt, and when they liſt &amp;c.

 theſe faſhions, leave off cards and dice &amp;c. ſaies the Spirit of God, and whatſoever is of evill report: yea, but I will not; for what will Sir John and my Lady ſay then? Turne you unto me ſaith the Spirit of God; no I will not, ſaith the ſtubborn walker. Put him on in a good courſe, yet he will not walk therein; ſpeake the truth ſaith the Spirit of God, for all lyars ſhall be turned out: yea but not yet, I have got thus much wealth by lying, and I will not yet leave it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; Such as have a common, baſe, vile and contemptible esteem of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Goſpell and Miniſters thereof. They mocked the Miniſters till the wrath of God broke out againſt them, and there was no remedy. 2 Chron. 36. 16. A Miniſter cannot be plaine but wicked men will abuſe him in their hearts. I called and cried ſaith Wiſedome, but you ſet at nought all my counſell. Prov. 1. 24, 25. and going away they make a tuſh at it. I, ſaith one, Maſter Miniſter, you mette with mens hearts to day, but I beleeve yours is as bad as anothers, elſe how could you have hitte them ſo right? ſee what the Spirit of God ſaith of ſuch, Iſa. 22. 21. In that day did the Lord call to weeping &amp;c. the text told them of a judgement, and nothing to be expected but miſery: but they make a tuſh of it, and ſay, Come, we ſhall all die, ergo let us eate and drink and be merrie while we may; the Miniſter tells us we ſhall all to hell, then let us have the other pot and the other pipe, if it muſt needs be ſo. Oh my beloved, can the God of heaven indure to be thus diſgraced in his Goſpell and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters? Another ſayes, care I what the Miniſter ſaith? I will goe and drinke at every Ale-houſe, and ſee whether theſe judgements will come or no.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the fourth thing, which is the grounds of it, (viz.)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Why the Lord in this life doth give men over, and ſtrive with them no more. This truth is troubleſome, and curſed hearts cannot abide it.</p>
                  <p>The grounds of this point ariſe from theſe two Attributes of God, his Juſtice and his Wiſedome.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the Juſtice of God, God is a juſt God; and is it not juſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that thoſe who have rejected him, that he ſhould reject them? I have called, but you anſwered not. Jer. 7. 13. &amp;c. Now as it is juſt with God to fulfill every word that he hath ſpoken, and to fulfill all his promiſes to the faithfull, ſo is it juſt with God to bring judgement on them that have ſleighted him, and to fulfill all his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From the Wiſedome of God and his long-ſuffering; and this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is becauſe his compaſſious faile not: elſe, the firſt day of our ſinning had been the firſt day of our rejection; yea it is his goodneſſe that we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favour; but Oh our God is a wiſe God. A man that knocks at the dore, if he be wiſe, will not alwaies lie knocking, if none anſwer: he gives over and goes away; ſo the Lord knocks at our hearts by mercies to allure us, by judgments to terrify us: yet he can find no entrance. Is it not wiſdom then to be gone? Why ſhould I ſmite you any more, ſaith God? Iſa. 1. 5. As if he ſhould ſay, tis to no purpoſe: I know not what to do with you:
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:44191:183"/>
with you it is wiſedome to give over, when there is no good to be done on you: What could I have done more for my Vinyard &amp;c? Iſa. 5. There is no wiſe man that will alwayes water a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y ſtake. And do you think that God wil alwayes be ſending Paul to plant, and Apollos to water? No, our God is a wiſe God, and our mercifull God is a juſt God: you that will have your wayes and wills, take them, and get you to hell and periſh everlaſtingly.</p>

                  <p>Seeing that God ſtrives with many, and at laſt gives over, goe thou home, and bleſſe God that he hath not dealt ſo with thee; it is enough that the Lord hath brought thee home to himſelfe; many may ſay with Paul, I was a perſecutor, I was injurious, &amp;c. 1 Tim. 1. 14. but I received mercy; ſo thou maiſt ſay, The Lord knowes what a deale adoe he hath had with me; this heart was as hard as the neaher mil-ſtone, but the Lord in ſome meaſure hath mollified it; this heart was as proud as the devill, but bleſſed be Gods name, he would let me ſee it at the laſt; goe home and ſay, Who am I, and what is my fathers houſe, that the Lord hath brought me hither? Oh that God ſhould thus ſtoope to man! the Lord hath ſtood and knockt thus many yeares, and he might have given over, but bleſſed be his name, I have received mercie. I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the means, but that prevailed not with me: the Lord ſent ſuch and ſuch ſickneſſe, but that wrought not on me: at the laſt I went to hear a Minister, and methought that Miniſter ſpake nothing but what he ſpake to me: and then the Lord ſet conſcience on worke, and that affrighted mee. Looke to it: the Lord will either breake thy

necke, or thy heart: doe not thinke to goe to heaven by good meanings: no, it will coſt thee ſomewhat more before thou come there. Another time the Lord ſet on me, and then I ſet on good duties: I would have Chriſt to juſtifie and ſanctifie me, and bleſſed be his name he was not wanting unto me in any meanes; the Lord make me thankfull &amp;c. I tell thee thou wilt be in deede, and God ſhall have all: let the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous man have his pleaſures, &amp;c. what is that to thee ſo thou have Chriſt?</p>

                     </note> in the bonds of iniquity; there will come a time when God will ſtrive with thee no more; the old man thinks he hath time enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in, and the young man thinks he needs not ſo much as enter into a Parley with godlineſſe. Eſau went away when he had eat and drunk, he eſteemed not his birth-right; I have heard ſome goe away with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, when they are married then they will live thus and thus. &amp;c. Suffer me firſt to go bury my Father &amp;c. Maſter Miniſter, you ſpeak well, I like your counſell; but I have a rich Uncle, and he hath no childe, and I am likely to be his heire; but he cannot abide a Puritan of all the men in the world, and if I do not humour him, I ſhall never have a Foot of his Land: let me bury him firſt; when Father and Friends are dead, then the children muſt provide for themſelves; and then they will ſeek after God and repent; and by this time they grow old, and though they cannot make ſo good a ſhew as others, yet their hearts are as good as the beſt. But ſtay a while; all is not gold that gliſters; alas poor ſouls, they were given over many years ago; this is alſo the ſin of young men and women for the moſt part, and this is the great ſin of England, the ſin of many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Gentlewomen; God muſt pardon when they call, and that muſt not be till they be old, and then in all poſt-haſte ſend they to and for maſter Prieſt, and he muſt bring God to them, or them to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the God of Heaven and earth cannot endure this mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie.</p>
                  <p>For terrour to all wicked and ungodly men, woe, woe, woe, that ever<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> they were borne that are thus given over; and of theſe there are two ſorts;</p>
                  <p>Some are inſenſible and ſome ſenſible. The inſenſible are they who die like ſtones as did Nabal; We have many King Harry Proteſtants. Others are ſenſible, God hath opened the eye of their ſoules, and hath let them read the red letters of the Goſpell; It is a heavie thing for old friends to part, ſo Acts 20. 38. They grieved moſt in that he ſaid, you ſhall ſee my face no more; ſo when ſoule and body part, it is heavie; but when the ſoul and God part, it is lamentable; when God takes his leave never to be ſeen more, then whether thou look upward or downward, there is nothing but amazement, and aſtoniſhment. If thou look upward there is the anger of God; if downward, there is the bottomleſſe pit; if on the right hand, thou ſhalt ſee all his mercies, which could not allure thee; if on the left hand, all his Judgements which could not terrifie thee; if before thee, the black day, if behind thee, the Devils, this will be fearfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:44191:184"/>I remember a Story of an adulterate woman, her Conſcience pricking her, ſhe determined to repent, but God in the mean time did viſit her ſo ſore, that ſhe lay crying out, oh my time my time!</p>
                  <p>Another time, a covetous woman her Houſe being on fire, ſhe to ſave her goods, left her child in the Cradle; but a neighbour of hers hearing it crie, tooke it away; ſhe afterwards remembring her child, ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout crying, Oh my childe, my childe, and would not be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>So when the fire and indignation of the Lord breaks out, if not now, yet at the laſt day it will; then the parties againſt whom it breakes, will crie, Oh my ſoul, my ſoul, what will become of thee my ſoul? It had been better I had never been born; for neither Mercies, Judgements, nor the Word could allure me; oh, woe is me.</p>
                  <p>Now the condition of ſuch is miſeracle in three reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe if God forſake thee, all forſakes thee; when thou lieſt a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thou ſendeſt for the Miniſter and thou wouldeſt faine have a word of comfort from him; but alas if thou doſt not receive comfort from Heaven, how can the Miniſter comfort thee? If thy outward Eſtate faile, Friends may help; but if they faile, there is a God in Heaven, and he will help; but if he go away, then all help is gone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when God goes, reſtraining grace goes; this was Sauls caſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and you may obſerve that ſuch as have been enlightened and fall away, fall into one of theſe three ſinnes; either into the hands of the world, and that is their Maſter, or elſe into the ſinnes of uncleanneſſe, or into the ſpirit of malice to perſecute them that are holy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if God leave us, then common protection leaves us; we are left <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to the clutches of all things, both in Heaven and earth; your houſes are left unto you deſolate. Matth. 23. 38. All the creatures are up in armes againſt us; the ſtiles we goe over, look up to Heaven, and ſay, Maſter ſhall we break his neck? the Horſe we ride on, ſays, Maſter ſhall I throw him down to deſtruction? thou knoweſt that he hates thee and thine. So the aire we breath in, and all Creatures, are readie, when the Lord gives the watchword, to lay us in the goal. Conſcience will witneſs againſt us; oh what will become of ſuch men? I will tell you, either the world heales them up; or elſe ſome carnall companion ſaith, you have been a good neighbour, you have kept a good houſe amongſt us &amp;c. tuſh, tuſh, man, it may prove a lye for all this; I but the Miniſter tells me ſo; piſh, piſh, as if all were true the Miniſter ſpeakes. I but the Scripture ſays it; Is all true that is in the Scripture? the Lord have mercy upon us; and thus like fooles they build with untempered morter; therefore, I exhort all ſuch as are yet in the gall of bitterneſſe, to liſten to what I ſay.</p>
                  <p>Redeeme the time, yeild to the motions of Gods Spirit, and bleſſe God for Mercy offered unto you in the meanes, and if any affliction be laid on you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> the Lord that he will doe you good by it. If thy Conſcience ſpeake, or the Spirit work, doe as Joſeph did, who got him into a corner and there wept his belly full; ſo intreat the Lord that he will breake the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and come downe on thee to thy comfort; put not off till thou art
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:44191:184"/>
old. A gentleman will not alwayes wait at the gate; neither ſay thou as Felix to Paul, I will ſend for thee at another time, but ſay with Samuel, Speak Lord for thy ſervant heareth.</p>
                  <p>Meanes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider the fearfull condition of ſuch as are given over; Suppoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> one ſhould come from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hell with the fire about his eares, you would aske, what is the newes? the cry is, my time, my time. Oh my people ſayes the Miniſter. Oh my Miniſter ſayes the People. The young man cries, oh my time. Doe not make a tuſh at this, leſt thou ſay, the word was preached, but I ſcorned it; the ſpirit ſaid this is the way, walk in it; the means of grace was ſent unto me, but I refuſed Mercie, and now for ever I am in Hell to be tormented.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider the great danger of putting off; If thy will be ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to day, it will be worſe to morrow.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider the time, 1. Pet. 4. 3. It is enough for the time of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> life we have lived, that we have wrought the works of the Gentiles, let us live no longer in ſinne; it is too much that you have reſiſted the Goſpell ſo much; ſay then, oh that the Lord would break this heart of mine.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, though God ſhould be calling and egging you all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> day long; yet your lives are but ſhort, and therefore crie out with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, teach me O Lord to number my dayes that I may apply my heart unto wiſdome; do not ſay it is too late, as one did once ſay of Prayer, doe you thinke that I can pray now, which never prayed in my life? I am ſure it will be too late when God comes to Judgement; for then the Divell will ſtand on tip toe, and ſay, what, doſt thou now thinke to goe to Heaven? the Lord did waite on thee untill he was weary; but here is a company of Drunkards, I did but hold up my finger, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently followed me. Heaven came down to them, but they would none of it, they could not hear of that ear, and would you now go to heaven? Therefore goe now, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake, and when Mercie is offered, refuſe it not, but bleſſe God for it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle having in the Chapter foregoing ſhewed that the Coloſsians were buried together with Chriſt in his death, and that they were alſo riſen with him, maketh two ſpeciall uſes thereof.</p>

                  <p>There be many men that look for participation in Chriſt, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding mortifie not themſelves; they would fain live with Christ: yet are loth to dye to ſinne; but we may ſay to theſe men, as Paul to

the Atheiſt, Thou foole, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened, unleſſe it firſt die: ſo unleſſe the ſeed of the word be ſowen upon thy heart, thou canſt not be quickned unleſſe thou fiſt die.</p>
                  <p>The things to be mortified, are deſcribed two manner of waies; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in generall, the members; or elſe in particular, Fornication, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, evill affections &amp;c. or as in the tenth verſe, all the fruits of the old man.</p>
                  <p>The words containe in them theſe three parts, or truths.<note place="margin">Parts.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, He that ever means to have Chriſt, muſt have him with a there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As if he ſhould ſay, if you look to have benefit by the death of Chriſt, looke to have a therefore with it; for no man can have Chriſt without a condition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this condition conſiſts in mortification; we muſt mortifie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our earthly members; this is the qualification of all thoſe that partake of the death of Chriſt, even mortification.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thoſe that are made partakers of the death of Chriſt, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thereto; ſo as the Apoſtle may well put this exhortation unto them, Mortifie therefore your members &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He doth not ſay, civilize your members; many there be that civilize their earthlie members; as from mortifying to purifying of them; they come out of prophaneneſſe and enter into Civility and a formall kinde of profeſſion; but the Apoſtle ſaith, mortifie, and not civilize your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; doe not pare the nailes of your corruptions, but cut them quite off, and give them their deaths wound, that ſo your ſins may breath out their laſt breath in you.</p>
                  <p>Sin may be civilized five wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when it is laid aſleepe. Pharaohs ſinnes were aſleepe, but not dead.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Many mens ſinnes are aſleepe in them, though they ſeeme to be dead in them for a time: A man, while he is aſleepe is like a dead man, yet he is alive, yea and his ſinnes are alive in him alſo; but when tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes to awaken him out of his ſleepe, though before he ſeemed to be patient and meeke, and hardly to be provoked: yet let a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come and rouze him, then he will finde his old wrath, anger and impatiencie. So likewiſe for a covetous man, though he ſeeme to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie that ſinne, yet it is but aſleepe in him; for let a temptation come, and he will quickly finde out his covetouſneſſe again; ſo that here ſinne is not mortified; but it is with theſe men as it was with Sampſon, all the while he was laide to ſleepe, the coards and fetters held him: but when they ſaid, Sampſon, the Philiſtines are upon thee, and awaked him out of his ſleepe, the Pinne and Webbe was not ſtrong enough to hold him. Thus it is with many men, when temptations are downe, and they are not provoked, all this while they ſeeme to have their ſinnes mortified; and thus the devill is of a good temper when he is not ſtirred; ſo it is with many whom you would thinke to be good Chriſtians, while the windes are downe, and the ſtormes doe not beate: but let them heare with Sampſon, that the Philiſtines are coming upon them, that there is ſuch a gaine, ſuch a profit and reputation to be had in the eyes of the world, then all the Pinnes and Webbes are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:44191:187"/>
all their reſolutions and all the ſtrong coards of their former purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are but as fire and towe; they breake them all in pieces: ſo then they are but aſleepe not mortified.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sinne may bee ſaid to be civilized when it is laide in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſwound; a man lying in a ſwound, is dead for a while and you would thinke he could hardly be recovered; for he can neither heare, nor ſee, nor goe, nor ſpeake; and yet notwithſtanding he is not dead; onely his vitall heate is gone from his outward members unto the inward powers of the heart. Even ſo a mans ſinnes ſeeme to bee dead, when the ſpirit of his luſt is conveighed into a higher luſt; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Suppoſe here is one that is a covetous worldling, this man perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture is very moderate and temperate; he is not given to gaming, dicing, carding, wenching: he is not given to building, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious apparell: but what, are theſe ſinnes dead in him? no, but the ſtrength of them is carried up into a higher luſt: for if he ſhould follow whoring or gaming &amp;c. the luſt of his covetouſneſſe would be curbed, and his gaine would not come in with ſuch a full Carreere unto him. Now all theſe ſinnes forenamed are but attendants and ſlaves unto this one luſt: ſo, many men it may be will give over a thouſand ſinnes, yea all except this one, yet all thoſe thouſand ſinnes are not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, nay it may be hee ſcarcely thinkes upon any of them. Why? becauſe they are taken up with a higher luſt. Even ſo it is with many civill formall profeſſors: they will come to Church, miſſe never a Sermon that they can come unto; they will talke of heaven, they will not omit any holie communication, they will reade the Scriptures, pray in their families, neglect no holy duties. Why then what is their ſinne? It is not the omitting of theſe things, but the careleſſe practiſe of them in their lives and converſation; for although theſe ſinnes be in a ſwound, the ſtrength of them is gone up to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a higher luſt; for ſuppoſe he went not to Church, how ſhould he maintaine his profeſſion? and if he could not now and then ſpeake of heaven, it were impoſſible he ſhould have his depth of ſelfe-deceit; therefore wee conclude theſe ſinnes are not mortified, they onely are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sinne may be ſaid to be civilized when the ſap of ſinne is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> taken away, and no contrary Grace infuſed; as for example, Suppoſe a man give over drunkenneſſe, yet if this man be not filled with the Spirit, his drunkenneſſe is not mortified, though he live ſoberly afterwards all the dayes of his life. Again, ſuppoſe a man give over his intemperate anger, he is not touchy, nor cholericke, nor ſubject to paſſion, yet if he have not turned his anger againſt himſelfe for every one of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which breake out againſt God, his anger is not mortified. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man is not given over to worldly griefe, but hath given it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; yet if his griefe be not turned another way, as to grieve for his ſinnes, his griefe is not mortified. Again, ſuppoſe a man be not ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a merry pinne, ever jeſting or telling forth merry tales, but now he hath given them over; yet if he have not ſet his joyes on the wayes of God and learned truly to be merry in the Lord, it is impoſſible
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:44191:188"/>
we can ſay his carnall mirth is mortified. For as the ſchoole-men ſay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> there is nothing corrupted till another thing be produced; there is no diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wood until it be turned into aſhes: ſo ſinne is never taken away nor utterly diſſolved, untill there be contrary grace brought into the heart in ſtead thereof; ſo then unleſſe there be contrary graces wrought in the heart, as the contraries of all thoſe ſins foregoing, they are but onely civilized, and not mortified.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sinne may be ſaid to be civilized, when it is overwtharted by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> a higher principle: as when a man is ſenſible of the wrath of God, and hath the flaſhes of an accuſing conſcience flying daily into his face, lying under the guilt of many horrible ſinnes, it is impoſſible for him to goe on with reſt and quietneſſe in thoſe his unholy courſes wherein he uſeth to walke; he may forſake them for a while, but yet he cannot mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them: but as a ſchoole-boy that playes the trewant, while he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rodde, he will confeſſe his fault, and promiſe to doe ſo no more, and he verily thinketh ſo at that time, and deſires heartily ſo to doe: but it is a deſire that he is provoked unto for fear of the rodde, and not for love of dutie: for when once the rodde is gone, and the ſmart over, then he falls to his old trewanting courſes againe. So we reade in the firſt of Jonah, that when the Marriners were in perill of their lives, then every one of them could call upon his God: but when the ſtorme and danger was over, they quickly left off, and cared not for calling on God any longer.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, Sinne may be ſaid to be civilized by Gods giving of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> poſitive common grace; which he gives unto wicked men, as in Mat. 25. God gave unto the unprofitable ſervant a whole talent, which is ſuppoſed to be an hundred and ſixty and odde pounds: ſo the Lord gives unto wicked men many good graces, as ſoftneſſe of diſpoſition, lovingneſſe or eaſie to be intreated; and hereupon they come to Church, heare the word, and performe many other Chriſtian duties: yet all theſe be but common graces, which a man may have, and yet his ſinnes not mortified, and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, Mortify your members &amp;c. Whence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>That if wee looke to have any benefit by, or intereſt in Chriſt, wee<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> muſt mortifie all our ſinnes, and all our corruptions; As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, make all your earthly members to be as a dead corpſe: now we, knowin a dead corpſe, the eyes are there but they cannot ſee: the feete are there alſo, but they want ſtrength for to goe: it hath all the members, but it hath not life and power to fet them on worke: ſo though ſinne be in you ſtill, yet let it be like a dead corpſe wanting life, like a dead Tyrant that can no longer rage: and hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, Let not ſinne reigne in your mortall bodies: he doth not ſay, let it not be, but, let it not reigne. Sinne when it is mortified, is like a dead King that can call no more Parliaments: but a man may doe for him what hee liſteth, becauſe his ſtrength lieth in the duſt. If Chriſt be in you ſaith the Apoſtle, the body is dead becauſe of ſinne, but the ſpirit is life for righteouſneſſe ſake. Rom. 8. 9, 10. Againe if a man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of Chriſts; now if
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:44191:188"/>
Chriſt be in you, the body is dead, if you conſider the body as it hath relation unto ſinne. Again, if you live after the fleſh, you ſhall dye, verſe 13. as if he ſhould have ſaid, if your fleſh be alive in you, if your pride live in you, and if your infidelity live in you, if your hardneſſe of heart live in you, if your wrath &amp;c, live in you, and if you walke after theſe, you ſhall ſurely die: he meaneth not a temporall death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo they muſt doe howſoever they live; but his meaning is they ſhall die eternally; but if you mortify the deedes of the body by the ſpirit, you ſhall live; ſo then it is plaine, there is no life of Chriſt to bee had ſo long as you retain your ſinnes, and therefore ſinne muſt bee morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe Chriſt is a Saviour, and hence he is called Jeſus, Matth.<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> 1. 21. for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes; if therefore Chriſt doe not ſave thee from thy ſins, and if by the power of Chriſt thou mortifie not thy ſinnes, and give them a deadly blow, aſſure thy ſelfe he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a Jeſus unto thee. It is true indeed Chriſt dyed for ſinners, but it was not to let them goe on in ſinne; and therefore if thou goe on in ſinne, it is for thy damnation, and not for thy ſalvation; for he will firſt ſave thee from thy ſinnes, or elſe he will never ſave thee from hell: ſo then conſider if thy ſinnes bear ſway in thee; if they doe, then know thou art delivered up unto the power of thy ſinnes, and to everlaſting darkneſſe. For Chriſt is the true Phyſitian of the ſoule: and you know that the Phyſitian doth not bring a potion to put it unto deaths mouth to kill death, and ſo to ſave the ſicke perſon alive: no, but hee putteth it into the ſicke mans mouth to kill the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that are in his body, that ſo hee might not fall into the hands of death: ſo Chriſt came not to quench the flames of hell by his ſpirituall Phyſicke, but to let his Phyſicke fall upon the heart and ſoule of man to ſave him from hell. Therefore unleſſe the bloud of Chriſt doe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy ſinnes, and crucifie thy luſts, there is no hope ever to get Chriſt to ſave thee from hell and everlaſting damnation. This is a true ſaying ſaith the Apoſtle and worthy to be received, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners. 1 Tim. 1. 15. This is a faithfull ſaying, and wicked men like it well indeede: For ſaith the drunkard, I am a wicked man, yet Chriſt came to ſave me. The whoremonger ſaith, I am an uncleane perſon: yet Chriſt came to ſave me. The ſwearer will ſay, Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, and therefore I hope he will ſave me too. No, no: Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, that is ſuch as were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but now are none: they have and doe repent. Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave ſinners (ſaith the Apoſtle) whereof I am chiefe. I was a blaſphemer, and a perſecuter, but now I am not. Hence then is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſaying, Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, not ſtill ſinning. No, before, Paul was injurious, a perſecuter, and lived in ignorance, and unbeleefe: but now the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was wonderfully abundant through Faith and love towards him: ſo that the grace of God hath appeared to draw men out of blindneſſe and ignorance therefore to ſay that Chriſt came to ſave ſuch as live in their ſins, and will live in them, as in ſins of drunkeneſs, prophaneſs, or uncleaneſs,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:44191:189"/>
is a rotten ſaying: and this onely is the faithfull ſaying, that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners in whom the power of ſinne is broken: therefore if ever we looke to have benefit or intereſt by Chriſt, we muſt mortify our earthly members.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe it is impoſſible for ſinne and grace to live and ſubſiſt<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> in one ſubject: it is impoſſible that they ſhould ever ſtand together, and be in a man at one and the ſame time: it cannot be that one and the ſame creature can have the life of a ſwine and the life of a man: for if he have the ſoule of a ſwine, he cannot have the ſoul of a man: for they are two contrary diſtinct lives: and where the one is, the other cannot be. It is like hot water and cold: if it be cold, it cannot be hot; if it be hot, it cannot be cold. Even ſo, the life of ſinne, and the life of grace are two contraries: and therefore they that walke in their ſinnes, walke contrary to God. Now the Lord ſaith, if you walke contrary to me, I will walke contrary unto you. Levit. 26. and two contraries we know cannot goe together. He that walks in ſinne, walkes contrary unto God: but he that goes on in the waies of grace, he walks towards God. Now, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to walk towards Dover and towards London at one and the ſame time: for every ſteppe he goeth forward to the one, it carries him back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the other: ſo then if ever we will have the life of grace, we muſt forſake our ſinnes; as it was with the houſe of Saul and David, Sauls houſe grew weaker, and Davids ſtronger; ſo muſt it be with ſin and grace, as grace growes ſtronger, ſo ſinne muſt grow weaker: as grace goes up, ſo ſinne muſt go down: And as Saul told David he would not give him Michal his daughter to wife, unleſſe he brought unto him an hundred fore-ſkinnes of the Philiſtines; Even ſo the Lord ſaith that he will not marry the Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto any ſoule, unleſſe he bring the fore-skinne of every lust: hee muſt circumciſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skinne of his pride, of his covetouſneſſe, of his prophaneneſſe: this muſt bee the offering and condition of marriage unto Chriſt; even the circumciſion of the heart, and the mortification of all the corruptions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe elſe it is impoſſible to enter into heaven, if we mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify<note place="margin">Reaſan</note> not our ſinnes: a man can never be capable of glory hereafter, that doth not mortifie his ſinnes here in this life. Suppoſe a wicked man ſhould enter into heaven, it is impoſſible that he ſhould delight in heaven, if he were there. You will thinke this a ſtrange point: but give me leave to explain it a little; I ſay that a wicked man if he were in heaven, he could finde no delight there. As for example, take a beaſt, for ſo is every man by his own knowledge, in regard of the life of grace, as ſaith the Prophet Jeremy, though a man take an Oxe or an Aſſe, and bring him unto the Kings table, and ſet before him all the delicates which appertain unto Kings: let him have a dinner before him that coſt an hundred pounds, yet he had rather be in the fields among his fellowes eating graſſe: or ſet a Crowne of gold upon a beaſts head, he will not regard it, but caſt it off into the mire: for ſo long as the beaſt is not tranſformed and made capable of the honour that is in a man; he cannot conceive of the pleaſures and delights
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:44191:189"/>
that doe belong unto man: Even ſo let a wicked man enjoy all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of heaven, and what will he ſay? We may perceive a little by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the Word and Ordinances of God: tie him to the conſtant uſe of them, to meditate on heaven, and to walk circumſpectly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in his whole courſe of life, and he will ſay, this is more then needs: this he thinks is too preciſe, too auſtere a life for him, he cannot away with ſuch purity and ſtrictneſſe; but if he thinke this ſo ſtrange which is nothing in compariſon, and is but a ſhadow or poore reſemblance of the holineſſe and purity that ſhall be; what thinke you would he doe if he were in heaven, where there is nothing but continuall prayſing and glorifying of God for evermore, where there ſhall not be ſo much as one earthly thought or word pertaining to the world or the affaires of this life, but a continuall ſounding forth of the praiſes of God? there is nothing but grace and ſpeaking of heaven, all their words are heavenly, their joies are heavenly and their whole delight is nothing but ſounding forth unceſſant Hallelujahs unto God for evermore. Now if a wicked man were there, what would he ſay? ſurely he would ſay, they are all Puritans, and would never endure it. Alas, in this life there is but a little praying, a little grace, a little holineſſe, in compariſon of that which ſhall be. Here we do but as it were peepe into heaven: now then, if this be ſo tedious that wicked men cannot endure it, how will they like to be in a place where there is perfection of all graces, where there ſhall be nothing but prayſing God for ever and ever? Sure as I am the devill was once in heaven, and he caſt himſelfe out from thence: God did not though he did deſerve it, and God would have done it, had he not been gone, as ſaith the Apoſtle; Jude verſe 6. They left their first habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the originall ſaith, they flung it from them, that is, as ſoone as they had ſinned againſt God, and changed their natures, away they went, heaven was no place for them, they thruſt themſelves out, and could not endure to ſtay there any longer: for having changed their natures, they changed their delights, and therefore to praiſe and yeeld glory unto God, was death unto them, they being now corrupted through ſinne, and of an impure nature, heaven became a hell unto them. Is any man weary of grace and holineſſe? wearie of well doing? weary of praying and of hearing the word preached? Is any man wearie of good duties? of the worſhippe and ſervice of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let him know then that he can never endure the Kingdome of Heaven; for if he be weary of a little, what will he doe when he ſhall come into a place where there ſhall be nothing but continuall prayſing of God?</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that ſinne muſt be mortified if ever we meane to partake of Chriſt?<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> then this condemnes all thoſe that goe on in their old courſes, in deadneſſe and in ſecurity, in ignorance &amp;c. taking hand over head vaine hopes for true, feeding themſelves with perſwaſions of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle tells us, that the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, The Lord knoweth who are his, and let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity. A wicked man cannot name the name of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:44191:190"/>
Chriſt till he depart from iniquity: much leſſe can he look for ſalvation, becauſe he cannot be ſaved without Chriſt: nay he cannot be ſaved by Chriſt unleſſe he depart from iniquity.</p>
                  <p>You ſay you hope to be ſaved; it is well; but God knoweth who are his: God goeth by his own rule; the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure. But who then are his? onely thoſe that name the name of Chriſt, and depart from iniquity; thoſe onely will he ſave, and none other: he will be no ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d to thy ſinnes or luſts, and wicked courſes; for ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, If any man be in Christ let him be a new creature; as if the Apoſtle in more words had ſaide: If any man hope hee is a Chriſtian, let him ſee that he is a new creature; for there is no expectation of being in Chriſt, unleſſe he be a new creature. All old things are paſſed away, and behold all things are become new; if thou be in Chriſt, all thy old praying is gone, all thy old hearing is gone, all thy old receiving of the Sacrament is paſſed away, and all things are become new with thee; thou muſt hear anew, pray anew, receive anew, beleeve anew, thou muſt live after a new ſort; for all old things are paſſed away.</p>
                  <p>Inſtruction to teach us, that it is not enough for us to let our ſinnes dye<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> in us, but we muſt kill them; the Apoſtle doth not ſay, let your earthly members die of themſelves, but, mortifie them; many there be that let their ſinnes die in them; as for example, when one is an infant, the ſinnes of his Infancie naturally fall from him, when he is a child of more capacity; and when he is a youth, the ſinnes of his childhood naturally drop away from him; ſo when he is a man, his youthfull ſinnes fall from him; and when he is old and dieth, all his ſinnes naturally droppe from him: But he muſt not let ſinne die in him, but he muſt kill it. Auſtin ſaith, if thou kill not ſinne till it dyeth of it ſelfe, ſinne hath killed thee, and not thou thy ſinne It is with ſinne as with a beaſt; if an Oxe fall into a pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and die of it ſelfe, it is good for nothing (the hide only excepted;) but if it be killed, it is good meate, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth profitable unto the owner; even ſo if ſinne die of its own accord, it will doe thee no good, it is worth nothing, it may leſſen thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſomewhat; but if thou kill it, then it will bee profitable unto thee.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth Chapter of Jeremy, we have a ſimilitude taken from an Huſband-man, where the Lord ſaith, plough up the fallow ground of your hearts, and ſow not among thornes. Now, will a Huſbandman ſay, there are abundance of thornes and buſhes in my ground, but I will let them alone till they die of themſelves, ſure I am that they will one day die? no, no; the Prophet gives other counſell, plough up ſaith he the fallow grounds, and ſow not among thornes; if thou doſt not, they will grow up to that height and rankneſſe that they will ſpoile the whole harveſt. Even ſo if thou kill not thy ſinnes, but ſuffer them to die of themſelves, they will ſpoile all thy ſpirituall harveſt, and quite baniſh thee out of Heaven for evermore.</p>
                  <p>The Third uſe may manifeſt unto us that the work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> is no eaſy work, as many men in the world think it to be. The Apoſtle ſaith, mortifie your members; now can a man ſtabbe his owne
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:44191:190"/>
arme through with eaſe? can he cut off his Legg or any other member without feeling any geeat paine? no more can a man kill his ſinnes and mortifie his luſts with eaſe; It is called mortification to ſhew that there is a great deal of miſery and pain in it. The Apoſtle ſaith that thoſe that are Chriſtians, have crncified the fleſh &amp;c. Gal. 5. 24. and therfore Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is ſet out unto us by crucifiing, which is the hardeſt of all kinds of mortifying. Can a man ſet his fleſh upon the Tenter, pierce his hands and feet with nailes, laying his whole weight upon the Tenter, and yet feele no paine? Cicero a wiſe Heathen ſaith, that crucifiing was a torment that cruelty it ſelfe had invented to put a man to death, it being the ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt kind of death that could be deviſed. And the Apoſtle to ſet forth Repentance what it is, ſhews it by crucifying. It is an eaſie matter to cut off the outward act of ſinne, as of ſwearing or drunkenneſſe &amp;c. this is an eaſie matter; but to crucifie a mans luſts and to mortify daily the body of death, which be beareth about him; this is a hard thing indeed. A Father ſaith it it is the hardeſt Text in all the Bible, and the hardeſt dutie in all Chriſtianity that we can goe about; they that can do it, can doe all things; and therefore let a man reſolve with himſelfe, that unleſſe he attain unto this, there is no Chriſt for him. How ſhall we, ſaith the Apoſtle, that are dead to ſinne, live any longer therein? Romans 6. 2. The Apoſtle makes it a Paradox, and wonders that men ſhould be ſo unreaſonable as to thinke that they are crucified with Chriſt, and yet live in their ſinnes. Is it poſſible that you can be dead with Chriſt, and yet live in your ſinne? No, no, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>But ſome may object and ſay, what doth the Apoſtle meane to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the Coloſſians unto Mortification? were they not already mortified? did he not ſay a little before that they were crucified and buried together with Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note>Yes it is true; but they that have mortified their earthly Members, muſt go on and perſevere in this Mortification, and that for three Reaſons;</p>
                  <p>Firſt becauſe the very ſame ſinne that hath been killed, will live again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it be continually mortified; for ſinne is ſtrong-hearted; it is not every blow that will kill ſinne ſtone-dead; no, no, we may ſay of ſin as ſome I ſay of Cats, they have nine lives; kill ſin once and it wil revive again; kil it the ſecond time and it will yet live; kill it the third time, it will yet have life; unleſſe it be continually mortified, it will never be ſtarke dead; and therefore the worke muſt be continued, as Chriſt ſaid of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, If you continue in my Word, then are you my Diſciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: So if we goe on in mortification, then verily are we Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe the ſinne mortified doe not riſe againe; yet if wee goe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not on in the way of Mortification, there will ariſe another ſinne in the roome of it. Sinne is like the Monſter Hydra; cut off one head, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will riſe up in its roome; Even ſo it is in the body of ſinne; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt dayly mortifie it, or elſe it will grow again. There is a Hiſtory that ſpeakes of a Fig-tree that grew in a ſtone wall, and all
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:44191:191"/>
means was uſed to kill it; they cut off the branches and it grew again; they cut down the body and it grew again; they cut it up by the roote and ſtill it lived, and grew, untill they pulled downe the ſtone wall. Even ſo it is with ſinne; lopp off the branches, it lives; cut downe the body, it will not die: digg up the rootes, and it will ſtill revive, and will never leave growing untill God pull downe the ſtone wall of this our earthly Tabernacle, and lay it in the duſt, and therefore we muſt ſtill be mortifying of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe as we mortifie, ſo we mortifie but in part; as ſaith the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Apoſtle in another caſe, we know but in part &amp;c. ſo may we ſay of this duty, we mortifie but in part; as we may ſay of a man breathing out his laſt breath, he is a dying, but not quite deade; ſo we may ſay of ſinne, though it lie ſprawling upon the ground, yet it is not dead, the laſt gaſpe is not paſt. Nay, it may be ſinne is more ſtriving in the heart of a child of God converted, then it was before converſion. As an Oxe or an Aſſe when they have their deaths blow, will laſh and ſtruggle more then, then they did in all their life time before; but this is nothing but the pangs of death, being giving up their laſt breath. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the fleſh luſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh. Gal. 5. So that they could not doe what they would, verſe 17. as if he ſhould ſay, ſinne is ſo morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that it hath his deaths wound in thee; elſe thou canſt not be the childe of God; yea ſuch a deaths wound, as it cannot poſſible recover again.</p>
                  <p>If a man that hath received his deaths wound, ſhould ſend for all the Phyſitians in the world, and take all the Phyſicke hee could, and uſe all the meanes under Heaven, yet they can never recover him: So when a man is converted unto God, as ſoone as ever the worke is wrought in him, ſinne hath his deaths blow; and although the Devill come as Phyſitian with all the Cordialls, Juleps and Balmes under Heaven, and uſe all the ſhifts and deviſes in the world, yet he ſhall never be able to recover it again; all will not doe, why? becauſe it hath received its deaths blow; it may be, with his induſtrie and coſt hee may make the face of ſinne loke freſh and faire for a time, but it hath it deaths wound and it will down at the laſt.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Uſe may be of triall and examination whether ſin be living<note place="margin">Uſe 4.</note> or dead.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may know whether we have mortified our ſins or no, let us obſerve theſe markes following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they that have mortified their ſinnes, live in the contrary Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Hence it is that the Pſalmiſt ſaith, that They worke no iniquitie, but walke in thy pathes, Pſalme 119. 3. Firſt, they crucifie all their ſinnes, they doe no iniquity: Secondly, as they doe no iniquity, ſo they take up all the wayes of God, contrary to that iniquity; as they give up all the wayes of ſinne, ſo they take up all the wayes of Grace; they walke in all Gods wayes. So that here is the queſtion, if a man giving over his ſinnes doe take up all the Graces contary to thoſe ſinnes. This is a rule in Divinity, that Grace takes not away nature; that is
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:44191:191"/>
Grace comes not to take away a mans affections, but to take them up.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a man be ſubject unto anger, when he is a little moved, grace comes not to take away his anger, but to take it up from a worldly thing, and to ſet it againſt ſinne which is truly evill, that ſo he may be angry and not ſin. Grace comes to qualify his anger; and to take it from the waies of ſin, and to ſet it upon Gods wayes.</p>
                  <p>Again, a man is ſubject to be merry; Grace comes to temper him, not to take away his mirth, but to ſet it upon a right object, as to delight in God, to be merry in Chriſt, to rejoyce in his Word and Ordinances, in his children, and in all the waies of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Another is given to impatiency; Grace comes not to take away his impatiency, but to ſet his impatience againſt his ſins; ſo that when he ſees his ſins, he ſhall not be able to endure them, but his ſoule will groan for them, and his heart will riſe againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Another is given to revenge: now Grace comes and takes him away from being revenged on his neighbour, to be revenged on his ſinnes; ſo that with the Apoſtle we may call revenge a piece of Repentance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a true triall whether our ſins be mortified, if our affections be taken away from the wayes of ſinne, and faſt ſet upon the wayes of Grace and godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if a man be mortified indeed and in truth, then he is dead unto every ſin; if a man be killed, he is dead in every member; ſo if a man be dead to ſinne, no ſinne can ever raigne in him; not one luſt nor boſome ſinne, no not the ſinne of his trade; no corruption though never ſo deare, though it be the ſinne of his right hand, or right eye, yet it can never have dominion over him, if he be dead to ſinne; therefore if a man live in any one ſin or ſweet luſt whatſoever, he is a dead man and hath not one jot of Grace; if there be but one knowne iniquity in a man, that he lives and dies in without repentance, that one iniquity ſhall kill him to the put of hel, Ezek. 28.</p>
                  <p>The Schoolemen ſay, that if a Sow doe but wallow in one mirie or dirty hole, ſhe is filthy; ſo if a ſoule wallow but in one ſinne, it is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. If a man ſtab himſelfe but with one knife ſo that he die, he is as truly killed, as was Julius Caeſar, who was ſtabbed with three and twenty knives. So if a man ſhould be free from an hundred diſeaſes, and ſhould die of one, what would it benefit him to be free from the reſt in reſpect of his life? ſurely nothing at all. That man that hath his pride, his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, his uſury, hatred, malice, deriding of Gods people, all theſe being dead in him; yet if ſelfe-love and ſecurity &amp;c. be not dead in him, theſe argue his caſe to be naught; he is not yet qualified for Chriſt; for there is no mortification at all in him.</p>
                  <p>There be many ſweet meanes to allure us unto mortification, but time will not permit us to ſpeake of them; but this let every man take notice of, that ſo long as he liveth in ſin, he is altogether uncapable of Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſaith, we know that the Law is not given unto a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for the ungodly and for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for the unholy and prophane, and whatſoever is contrary to whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine, the Law is for ſuch men: But the firſt Doctrine of the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:44191:192"/>
of Chriſt, is, Repent of thy ſins, deny thine own wayes take up Chriſts croſſe, and follow the Lamb whereſoever he goes. Here the Kingdom of Heaven is laid open to all the world; Let mens miſeries be what they can be, and although their ſinnes be never ſo great, Chriſt cometh to redeem them; yea though they have a whole Hell of ſinne in them, yet if they have a heart to entertaine Chriſt, his Grace is ſo rich and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, that it will ſave every man that enterteineth him.</p>
                  <p>There is a Proclomation openly made in the Market place, Hoe, every one that thirſteth, come unto the waters Iſa. 55. 2. As if he ſhould ſay, Hoe, every one that hath a mind to Chriſt, come and have him; every one that hungers and thirſteth after Chriſt, let his ſinnes be never ſo great, and the number never ſo many, here is hue and crie after him; Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the waters; He ſaith not come unto the water, but, waters; not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle low brook or ſtream, which is not able to waſh away all his ſins, but there is an Ocean of waters ndefinitely: waters in the plural number, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the fulneſſe and ſufficiency to cleanſe the moſt leprous ſoule, be he never ſo much ſtained with corruption. It is ſaid by the Prophet O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badiah, that the Lord will ſend unto his People Saviours, verſe 21. not in the ſingular number, but Saviours in the plurall number; not that there were moe Chriſts then one; but to manifeſt the fulneſſe of Chriſt, he is a rich Chriſt, full of ſalvation for all them that come unto him; Therefore if there be any man that mourns and laments for his ſinnes, let him come unto Chriſt and welcome; for there is a Fountain laid open for Judah and Jeruſalem to waſh in: but let him know upon what terms he muſt come, if ever he meane to have Salvation by Chriſt; obſerve the ſtrict Conditions, and walke by the ſtrait rule of Chriſt: he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve with himſelfe come what will come, to ſtand or to fall with Chriſt; delivering up all his luſts and corruptions at his command, whenſoever he calls for them; he muſt not part ſtakes with Chriſt to delude him, but he muſt be true and faithfull unto him, he muſt wholly deny himſelfe, and lie down before Chriſt to let Chriſt doe what he wil with him, and, theſe onely are the termes he muſt expect Heaven upon; and thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he may have Salvation according to the deſire of his ſoule.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E ſhall find that there are two maine things in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A commiſſion the Prophet hath to doe his duty, it is from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Execution of his duty.</p>
                  <p>The Commiſſion is in the firſt verſe. Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſions, and to the houſe of Jacob their ſins; this is his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to tell them roundly of their ſinnes, ſpare not, ſaith the Lord, and it is no other commiſſion than all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God have, (eſpecially upon ſuch faſting dayes as this is) to be faithfull to the people, to make known unto them all their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Now in the execution of it, there are two things, mainely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:44191:194"/>Firſt, a diſcovery of their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A rule for reformation, ſet down 6. 7. verſes.</p>
                  <p>The diſcovery of their ſins is to the latter end of the 5. verſe.</p>
                  <p>Now in the diſcovery we find theſe ſins very remarkable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, their falſeneſſe, they were a company of ſtately Hypocrites, a company of brave people; that could pray as well as any in the world, keep a faſt from morning till night, I ſay, they were people of a ſtately carriage, but of a falſe ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond was their confidence upon their duty, as they were ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their parts, and policy, ſo they are as confident, as ſtately, when they did pray and faſt they could reſt upon their duty, as in the third verſe, Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt it not? We have puniſhed our ſelves, and thou regardeſt it not. God gives them an account for that, and diſcovers their ſins which are the cauſes of it, and they are two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſhews the unprofitableneſſe of ſuch kind of ſervices, they bring no ſoule-profit with them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuch ſervices are unacceptable to God, for ſaith God, in the beginning of this verſe, all the faſts doe but end in ſtrife, and debate: Conſider the work we are in hand withall, and let us apply this to our ſelves this day; ſaith God by the Prophet in the Text, You ſhall not faſt as ye do to day, to make the voice to be heard above; as if God had ſaid, this is not the buſineſſe that I have choſen, (as in the next verſe it follows) to hang down his head for a day; to droop in his affections, to be ſeemingly humbled, and afterward to ſprout up again, as peart, and ready to ſin as ever; it is not ſqualing and crying a little while will ſerve the turne, performe the duties of a faſt, if you will keep a faſt aright.</p>
                  <p>In the Text are three divine truths, partly in it ſelf, and partly in what is before and after it; they are theſe three, I ſhal only touch upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, though I name all, The firſt is this,</p>
                  <p>That Hypocriſy, or falſeneſſe in a day of faſting, and prayer, takes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> away the life of the duty, this ſhall be confirmed by and by. The ſecond is this,</p>
                  <p>That falſe, and ſlight Hypocrites, they will be content to be frequent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in faſting, and prayer. The third is this,</p>
                  <p>That faſting rightly improved, will put an edge upon our prayer.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall only ſpeak a word of each of theſe; for the firſt, and I name it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> againe, I ſay Hypocriſy in duties of this nature does take away the life of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; It riſeth plainly out of the Text, Hypocriſy in duty takes away the life of the duty, ſaith the Lord, I have not choſe this faſt but this is the faſt that I have choſen, to looſe the bonds of wickedneſſe, to take off the heavy burden, and to let the oppreſſed goe free, to deale thy bread to the hungry, to bring the poor unto thine houſe, this is the faſt that I look at.</p>
                  <p>I doe not looke that a Sonne of God ſhould come to guild over a day of faſting, to weep and houle it out, but the thing the Lord requires is to eaſe the burden of the afflicted, to help the poor and oppreſſed ones; this day of faſting and prayer will be the ſaddeſt that ever England had, if it doe not end in the reformation of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>An hypocrite will performe as glorious duties, it may be better then
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:44191:194"/>
you, but there he reſts, and ſpares all coſt, he joynes not charity with his pretended ſanctity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Falſe and ſlight Hypocrites will be frequently in faſting and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prayer; This ariſeth from the other part, Hypocrites will be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they can ſay, we have faſted and prayed, we have done this, they can take delight in approching to God, they will come nere the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſay, When will there be a reforming of what is amiſſe, both in Church and ſtate? they make a great ſtirre, and in meane time ſuffer manie poor ſervants of God, to periſh for want of ſuſtenance about them; In this I doe not meane, (miſtake me not) that the ſervants of God, ſhould not doe theſe duties, but all that I ſay is to prove that an Hypocrite may doe theſe duties; and this conſidered, you will finde that there are not a few ſuch amongſt us, becauſe all we doe, if rightly done, muſt ſpring from other principles, if you ſhould faſt every day in the weeke, it would not doe, unleſſe the other duties (before named) be performed. I ſay not this to diſcourage any of you from the duty, for I ſet a high eſteem upon the duties of this day. It is like great Ordnance, which will make a breach in a Caſtle, when musket-ſhot will doe noe good. Through Gods bleſſing, this hath done more then all other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, caſt out ſuch ſubtile divels, that nothing elſe could doe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Faſting rightly improved wil put an edge upon duty, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> upon prayer. The ſcripture provs this, that faſting and prayer together, a faſt cannot be kept without prayer. Now I returne to the firſt Doctrine. which is the main thing I doe intend, which is this, namely.</p>
                  <p>That Hypocriſy in duty, will take away the life of the duty. I ſay falſeneſſe<note place="margin">Doctrine 1.</note> and hypocriſy in the duty, will ſpoyle that duty. Ye ſhall not faſt as ye doe to day, to make your voyce to be heard above, here you make a great noyſe, but all the while ye are not heard, ye doe not reach the mark, and ſo you loſe the game. A Cannon may make a great noyſe, and yet come a mile ſhort of the mark, for hypocricie takes away the life of the duty, your Cannon Bore is warped, ſo your bullet goes beſide the mark, it muſt be a prayer rightly and underſtandingly made, that the Lord will heare: There is a phraſe to this purpoſe. Deut. 5. 28. and the Lord ſaid, I have heard the voyce of the words of this people, which they have ſpoken unto me, they have well ſaid all that they have ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>There is a paſſage about this, 2 Chron. 3. Then the Prieſts and Levites aroſe, and bleſſed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his dwelling place, even to heaven, their voyce was heard, becauſe their praier was made in ſincerity. Your praiers doe not come high enough, you doe not ſpeak home enough: if you did, you ſhould certainly be heard, if it be in ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>Now a Hypocrite may lift up his voice ſtrongly, and yet never be heard, never come up to Gods dwelling place, their prayers many times fall back upon their own faces, (like ſpittle againſt the wind,) and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to Gods preſence; mark I ſay, hypocricle takes away the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and life of the duty, ſaith the Lord, This is not the fast that I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; not the prayer, that I would have made, theſe prayers are but Arrows ſhot out of a weak Bow, that come not half way to the mark.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:44191:195"/>Now we proceed to open it in the particulars; I will bring two or three arguments to prove it that it is ſo.</p>
                  <p>1. You ſhall find that Hypocriſie in theſe Ordinances doth ſpoile all upon theſe two or three grounds. The firſt is this, Becauſe all this falſeneſſe, and hypocriſie, is directly againſt the nature of God: you have a ſtrange paſſage to this purpoſe, Mat. 6. 5. And when thou prayeſt be not as the Hypocrites, for they love to ſtand, and pray in the Sinagoues, &amp;c. verily I ſay they have their reward; what is that? what is the reward of a falſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical praier? he hath his praier, that is all, his work for his work, a day of faſting for a day of faſting, that is all, a poor reward. It too often falls out, that amongſt your children you have one that is a ſpend-all, a rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous perſon. Now when the father comes to make his will, he gives to each of his obedient children, ſuch a portion as he is able, but when this his leud ſonne comes to be named, what ſaith he, to him? I have given thee ſo much and ſo much time after time, thou haſt ſpent all I have, now only a ſhilling for thee; and that not out of any love neither, but to ſtop thy mouth from troubling thy brethren for any more: ſo we come to faſting and praier, well (ſaith God) you ſhall have your reward, I will give you twelve pence, you have bin falſe, and vile with that mercy that you have had, therefore look for no more. And thus when the Hypocrite comes to ſee what he hath got by all his duties, it will be juſt nothing, this is the point that I meane, I will prove it in three perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that falſeneſs, and hypocriſie in duty takes away the life of the duty.</p>
                  <p>Firſt becauſe hypocriſy here, is directly in oppoſition to the nature of God, and therefore the Lord cannot poſſibly accept of it. I doe not care for them ſaith the Lord; I will none of their ſervices, they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt my Name, Jehovah is Gods nature, which hath a being, hypocriſie hath no being, nothing in it, therefore no being. In your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you tell God you ſin, you meane not to leave it, and what tell you me of ſuch a kinde of prayer? it is a picture of a prayer, and no prayer, a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man (as we ſay) and no man. I beſeech you to conſider it, all praiers that are made in this way, they are nothing: ſee a paſſage. Mat. 15. 8. ſaith God, this people draw neere to me with their lips, but their heart is far from me, therefore he ſaith, 9. verſe, But in vaine they worſhip me: it is all to no purpoſe there is an emptineſſe in all this, a poor ignorant creature may run to Church with the Phariſee, and fall down upon his knees, and babble over his prayers, and all this coms to nothing, for I ſay all traditionall worſhip is againſt the nature of God, hence nothing: ſo all Idoll worſhip is nothing. God is a being Jehovah, Idoll worſhip hath no being, therefore nothing: you ſhall not ſee more coſt, and bodily labour, more ceremonies and ſpecious ſhew, in any religion under the ſun then in Rome, yet all this nothing, becauſe outſide ſeruice, a little fire wil quickly conſume all this. Now if you come before God this day, and doe not bring your heart in a fit temper, according to the rule of Gods word, if you mean not to be in earneſt with the Miniſter, in ſealing up your ſoules in the Covenant of grace, all will prove to be nothing, you ſhall have breath for breath, you will doe no good, to diſtreſſed Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, reformation, ſhall not be one inch, furthered by this dayes work of your faſtings and prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:44191:195"/>Secondly, Hypocriſy takes away the life of the duty upon a ſecond ground, becauſe from hence the Ordinance of God (this very Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance we are now about) gaines an heavy blow, therefore certainly it will loſe the life, and comfort of it by hypocriſie; as thus. Firſt from hence it comes to paſſe, that Ordinances uſed, (or rather abuſed) give occaſion to the enemies of God to open their mouthes, and ſpeake baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theſe Ordinances, as if they had nothing in them: the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves ſuffer much in this, they can ſay they are frequent in theſe duties, ſuch and ſuch keep whole dayes of faſting and prayer day after day, and yet returne again to their ſinfull courſes, as bad drunkards, and thiefes the next day as ever, hence ſay the Papiſts, and prophane perſons, theſe are the faſters, what amendment ſee you in them? and hence they conclude, what ſhould weeping, faſting, and prayer doe? God regards them not, they have nothing in them, noe benefit comes by them, people are not converted that uſe them, they are as ignorant as they were, no change wrought upon their ſpirits; Thus the Ordinance is ſleighted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hypocrites doe pervert the Ordinance, for they uſe it to a wrong end. They take up faſting and prayer, to get further leave to ſin, to grow ſtronger in their corruptions to morrow: hypocrites are ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened in ſin by the Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe the heart of a man in the duty is the heart of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, your hearts are the heart of the duty, therefore the Lord requires ſuch a kinde of heart of his ſervants at the time of duty, as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the duty, now hypocriſy takes the heart off from the duty; therefore the duty cannot be accepted. Now I doubt there is many a poor unprepared heart before God this day, you doe not mean to bring your ſinne to the duty, but the duty to your ſinne, you doe not meane to leave your uncle an practiſes, and evill courſes; if it be ſo, marke what I ſay, the duty is gone, the day is loſt, for the very heart and ſpirit of the duty lyeth here: the Miniſter he labours, prayes and preaches, you may weepe, mourne, and lament, yet if the heart be not in the duty, all is nothing, but as a dead carkaſſe without a Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe will be a word of reproofe, for I ſay, falſeneſſe, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cricy<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> takes away the life of the duty, 3. Arguments you have had to prove it. Now for reprehenſion, it wil reprove us for all thoſe ayrie duties, and outſide ſervices we doe performe, many come to a duty, and leave their hearts in their Cheſts, amongſt their Treaſure, many come in diſcontent, and ſtrife, they reſolve, for all this, I will when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently I may, give my brother a private wound. This now lets out the very heart bloud of the duty.</p>
                  <p>I doe confidently beleeve, if all the people of the Nation could but keep this day of faſting and praier, ſincerely from the heart, you ſhould quickly ſee the Angel ſtopped, the ſword ſheathed, and the Nation healed.</p>
                  <p>Now to reprove you of your hypocriſie, I wil ſhew you the ſapleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch duties in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:44191:196"/>Firſt, remember this, and conſider in the name of God, in what a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable caſe that man will be, that looſeth all the benefit of this duty, I have known a man, that hath bought a ſhip, fraughted it for a great voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, laid out all his ſtock upon it, gone out to Sea, daſht it againſt a Rock, and loſt all, and come home a begger: daies of faſting, and praier, are as ſhips that we put all our ſtock, and treaſure in, (mark this) if they come home empty again, if they bring noe mercies, nor bleſſings with them, you are undon, you had need to get a breif, to be gathered for in the pariſh, and all wil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be too little to get you up again; when you come to enter into covenant with God, will you deal deceitfully? what ſhip-wrack do you hereby make of your conſciences? have ye abuſed many heavenly oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, and will you doe this alſo? all the congregations under heaven, will not be able to raiſe your wants; be not deceived ſaith the Apoſtle, What a man ſowes, that he ſhall reape; ſo what you ſowe in theſe duties; that, and no other fruit you ſhall reape.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is this, a word of information, to informe us how to faſt aright.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will informe you of the reaſons of it, conſider this, if your ſoul be not bettered, your family not amended, the Countrey not refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſuperſtition not abated, the perſecuted Church of Chriſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, I will give you the reaſon.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid the hearts of men are not fitted for this great work, I doubt that many of the great men of the Nation doe not ſightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, Miniſters are not rightly qualified for it, Congregations are not throughly humbled; If you heare that things doe miſcarry in the Palatinate, that things grow worſe and worſe, that the plague encreaſeth, then remember there was hypocricy in the duties, and ſo you looſe the benefit of this day; therefore if hypocriſy takes away the life, and benfit of the duty, then look well to your ſelves, and look well what you doe this day, look well what you goe about; that ſo you may enter upon the duty as you ſhould.</p>
                  <p>Conſider of it for the Lords ſake, be true to God, and your own hearts, you know not the danger of a day of faſting ill ſpent; which that you may avoide, I will give you ſome motives and rules,</p>
                  <p>Take this for a motive, conſider your ſelves upon your death beds, (It is a ſad thing that I ſhall tell you) is it not fearfull to conſider, that when you are in great diſtractions, full of various thoughts, thoſe things that are brought for Cordialls, and comforts to your deſerted ſoules, ſhould prove troubleſome, and heart-breakings unto you? A man upon his death-bed ſends for a Miniſter, he comes unto him, and finds him in ſad diſt empers, crying, No God, no Chriſt, no mercy, no comfort, what will become of me? I know not what to doe; why man, what is the matter? you that have faſted, and prayed, and been frequent in theſe duties, you that have kept the ſabbath, regarded Gods people, releived the poor, there is no man in the Town can pray like you, you can make a praier of two houers long, what do you think there is no mercy in God, no pitty in Chriſt? Oh (ſaith he) this is my bane, my faſting, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the cauſe of my woe, for I have but mocked God in all this. I
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:44191:196"/>
have ſeen ſad experience upon a poor ſoules heart of this; prayer and faſting rightly obſerved is a flame of all other duties, all other are but one duty, but a flame of all duties are in this fire.</p>
                  <p>Now when a man ſhall ſee the grave open, the wife ſtand weeping, the child ſighing, when his eyes grow dimme, his lips pale, now for him to ſay, I have had a by-reſpect in all my duties that I have performed, I have been a deceitfull man in my trade, &amp;c. what tell you me of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and duties? I have faſted my ſoule to hell, and there I ſhall feele the ſad conſequence of my hypocriſie. Conſider of this, ye that will pray and cheat, pray and be drunk, ye that to morrow will goe to a ſtage play. Is this your faſting, and praying? when you are in hell, then it will come to your minde, how you have faſted away your God, your Chriſt, how you have ſleighted theſe; this will make a man teare his fleſh, from his bones, his ſhould move us to be ſerious in this duty we are now about.</p>
                  <p>Take an other Motive, and it is this: Bring what ever you will to God, and bring not this, all is nothing, and all the ſervices you can performe without this are nothing; if you doe not bring a heart ſprinkled with the bloud of Chriſt, a ſincere honeſt heart, all elſe will be but dung; bring all parts, and duties, you cannot ſo much as pray aright without ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: doe you remember what Simeon ſaid to his father Jacob? pray you let Benjamin goe down, no; I will not, take money, and Cammels and what elſe you will, but Benjamin ſhall not goe; but ſaith he, unleſſe, Benjamin goe, I will not, becauſe elſe I ſhall be taken for a ſpie: Soe when ever thou goeſt to pray to God, be ſure thou take Bemjamin with thee, thou maiſt carrie all thy parts, and duties, unleſſe Benjamin goe, it will not doe: Now by Benjamin, I meane ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, you may ſpend teares about the duty in hand, varniſh over the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as much as you can, all the eloquent tongues of greateſt Orators will not be heard, nay if all the Angels in heaven ſhould bring teares, and bloud, for our deliverance, all this will be nothing; unleſſe we have an honeſt ſincere heart, a faithfull heart, in which there is no guile, a man that hath an honeſt heart, when he confeſſeth ſin, it is with a purpoſe to leave it, he doth not confeſſe and ſin, ſin and confeſſe, but he is in good earneſt, which that you may doe, take a rule or two;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Ye that are come to ſeek God this day, ſtudy whether the work of this dayſpring from living principles, or no. There be painted Flowers doe not ſmell, but take Flowers out of a garden, and they ſmell by reaſon of their ſweet principles: ſo there be painted duties which ſmell not ſweet in the noſtrels of God, therefore conſider, are your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſincere? doe they ſmell? have ye not only an artificiall weeping, like thoſe women in Jeremy that could weep when they would? But doe ye weep from your hearts? you know, painted food, it ſatisfies not, ſtudy to find out that your duties come from a living principle, and not by art; labour to have it ſpring from the blood of the Covenant, and thereupon, thou goeſt to duty. I could tell you of many deceits, one is in the affections, what is Chriſt come to town? miracles wrought? well, I will goe ſee it, and all this while he hath only a little oyle in the Lamp,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:44191:197"/>
none in the Veſſel. Oyle in the Lamp, I underſtand to be ſome ſmaller work of Gods ſpirit, ſome outward principle; Oyle in the Veſſel, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be ſome inward principle, that ariſeth from the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take this for a note, conſider in all theſe actions (for in this day we are in clearing our account) whether your oppoſition to ſin be carried on ſtrongly, and unchangeably; you are now come to have ſin rooted out of your hearts, your affections; you are a dealing with a malignant party, that hath already got within you: now here are the things you ſhould look after, conſider whether the change of your ſpirits be continuall at all times, (except paſſion, and temptation, which may ecliſpe the rareſt Chriſtian) may be when the Miniſters heart is enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in prayers, and prayſing God for you, God comes in and enlargeth your heart like a land-floud, which doth not hold long, godly ſorrow for ſin, ſhould be like a womans ſorrow, that weepeth for her child, ſhe cannot but weep, the more you comfort her, the more ſhe weepeth, aske her a reaſon, ſhe will ſay ſhe cannot help it, ſo our mourning for ſin and oppoſition againſt ſin muſt be carried on in a conſtant courſe, our weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Church of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt not laſt only for a day, this day, and end to morrow, but it muſt be conſtant.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when a man fixeth his ſoule upon the duty in ſincerity, he ſhall finde ſweet comfort to his ſoul; a man in this caſe, doth not mind what God gives him, but how he accepts of his duty, that is all he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, but know aſſuredly God will fill the hungry ſoule, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the well doers, no man ſhall ſerve God for nought. Now I can tell you the reaſon, why you doe not finde more comfort by your faſting and prayers, it is for want of a dram of ſincerity, you ſhould alway, when you worke for God, when you faſt and pray for God, doe as the Joyner doth, he ſhaves, and brings his rule, and meaſures, ſhaves, and meaſures: ſo ſhould you, pray and look up to heaven, faſt and bring the duty to the word, alwayes pray by rule, never keep a faſt without a rule, and then be aſſured, you ſhall be a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed. This I have ſpoken only to prepare you for the work of the day, be ſure what ever you doe, ſee that it ariſeth from a new and living principle: let it not be like a land-floud, that is dried up aſſoon as therain is over, but let it be like a gliding ſtreame, which keeps a conſtant ſpringing courſe, that ſo you may walk in the ſtrength of this days faſt, all the dayes of your life, which grant deare Father for Chriſt his ſake.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Text is a pretious pattern of ſeaſonable counſel, by Elihu given to afflicted Job, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reſolution to be reformed under the rod of the Lord, is both commanded and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Surely it is meet to be ſaid, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſpend time to divide my text in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parts, nor to obſerve the various readings thereof, but ſhall briefly obſerve the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which naturally ariſeth from the Text, and which will be very ſutable to our preſent occaſion. viz.</p>
                  <p>Under the rod of the Lord, people ſhould reſolve to reforme. Or thus; Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> to reforme, ſhould be upon the heart of all them that ſmart under the rod of the Lord. Surely it is meet, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There are three things that I intend to ſpeak to in the proſecution of his point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:44191:199"/>1. What kind of reformation it is that we ſhould reſolve upon under the rod of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>2. What arguments ſhould prevaile with us to reſolve to reforme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we feele the Lord ſtrikes us.</p>
                  <p>3. What courſe we ſhould take for our reforming under his rod.</p>
                  <p>That we are under the rod of the Lord is evident, there are ſmarting rods upon our backs. The rod of the continuance and ſpeading of the noyſome peſtilence. The rod of unſeaſonable weather, this droughty pring, and unſeaſonable froſt; ſurely then it is meet to ſay, We wil bear cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, we will ſin no more.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt, viz. What kinde of reformation it is that God commands and expects from us, when we are under this rod? This I ſhall open in ſix particulars, and therein unbowell my Text.</p>
                  <p>1. In the work of reformation under the rod, we muſt have reference to him that uſeth the rod, goe to God, and ſet our ſelves to amend what is amiſſe, as under the eye of God, under whoſe laſh we ſmart; this lyes in the text, Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have borne chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Go to God, and ſet thy ſelfe as under the all seeing eye of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to reforme what is amiſſe. It is an eaſy thing for Miniſters to be pleaſing to a people, for Children to give content to their parents, for one neighbour to ſtop the mouth of another. But mark what contents God, the inſide reformation, as well as the outſide, when God and I am alone as well as in companie, when I am under Gods hand, I muſt goe to God, when I am reforming; that is one thing.</p>
                  <p>I could ſhew it you how the Lord Chriſt ſtruck down Paul, when he was breathing out threats, and bloud againſt poor innocent Chriſtians, who, when he was ſtruck down, ſaith, Lord what ſhall I doe? ſhall I back again to the Scribes, and Phariſees, and tell them what a blow I met withall? or ſhall I go on to the Saints, and tell them what cruelty is intended againſt them? Lord whither ſhall I goe? He looks to God that ſmote him.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more, (and this will follow from the former) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be ſure to be guided by the rule, (that is the word of God) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of that which is out of order, whether in your ſpirit, or life, That which I ſee not, teach thou me, if I have done iniquity, I will doe it no more.</p>
                  <p>Teach thou me, &amp;c. Miſtake me not, I doe not here ſpeak againſt conferring with Chriſtians, conſulting with miniſters in matters dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but alway heed this, ſtick not in the opinion, ſtay not in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any, be he never ſo wiſe, never ſo pious, but labour to ſee a word of warrant from the ſcripture, and truſt only to that, ſay, I muſt doe ſo, and ſo, I have it from Gods mouth, I may take ſuch a courſe, I have Gods word for it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ple would not be ſo giddy, in running after new and ſtrange opi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="5 letters">

                     </gap> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f they would but conſider this; alway goe to God, and ſay, Lord, that which I ſee not, teach thou me, and if I have done iniquity, I will doe it no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:44191:199"/>Secondly, In reformation under the rodde, you muſt be ſure to have your worke guided by God himſelfe, as Iſa. 2. 3. He will teach us his ways, and we will walke in his paths. ſo Pſal. 86. 11. Teach me thy way O Lord, and I will walke in thy truth: knit my heart unto thee, that I may feare thy Name.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the worke of reformation under the rodde, you muſt be carefull to reforme in one particular, as well as another; you muſt go through, ſtich with this buſineſſe; that which I doe know, and may know to be blame-worthy and have borne chaſtiſements for, in that I will offend noe more, and if any thing further ſhall be made knowne unto me, I will ſtop in my courſe, and if it can be found out that therein I have ſinned, I will doe ſo no more. For know aſſuredly, he hath not reformed in anie thing aright, that doth not reforme in every thing blame-worthy, as, Hoſea 14. 2. ſaith the Prophet, Thou hast fallen by thine iniquity, what followes? then ſaith he, ver. 3. Take unto you words, and turne to the Lord, and ſay unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us gratiouſly: Take away all, ſpare none, every eye that offends, every hand that ſins, every luſt that provokes, though never ſoe deare unto thee, foregoe all manner of profit, and credit, in regard of thy tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall calling, if it prove to be a ſinne; beare with one, and in Gods ſight thou beareſt withall; live in the breach of one of Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thou art guilty of the breach of all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in reformation under the rodde, you muſt not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, in what you your ſelves doe, or may underſtand to be amiſſe, but you muſt take direction, to know what is blame-worthy, be eager and earneſt, to underſtand wherein you doe amiſſe; ſay, Good Lord, if I doe amiſſe in relation to others, as a huſband, as a wife, as a Father, as a child, as a Miniſter, as a hearer, as a ſervant, as a Maſter, as a doer, as a ſufferer, Lord ſhew it me, Lord ſhew me my fault, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
                  <p>Make an earneſt deſire to God, and ſay, Good Lord, if any thing be blameable, let it have no ſhelter in me, ſearch me, if any way of ſinne, try me if any way of wickedneſſe be in me, and lead me in thy way for ever, as it is Pſal. 139. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>Thus make your requeſts to God, this practice will prove the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your hearts, thus praying you may know what is out of order, when you compare your life, and the word (which is the rule) together. Mark what he Prophet Jeremy ſaith, Lament. 3. 39, 40. Wherefore is a living man ſorrowfull? Man ſuffereth for his ſin, let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turne again to the Lord; Let us looke to our wayes: this hath been my opinion, my practiſe, my way, are they anſwerable to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſonant to the rule, the word of God? this we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> labour to know, when we would reforme our wayes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, a Chriſtian under the rodde ſhould be ſo wrought upon with a Reſolution to reforme, that he ſhould by ſolemne covenant binde himſelfe to God for the future, even all his life long, marke the text, Surely it is meet to be ſaid; to whom? to our ſelves? no, to be ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to God, I have borne chaſtiſements &amp;c. ſay, Lord, thou that hateſt every evill way
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:44191:200"/>
heare me, what I have to ſay, that have run out of the way, Thou that art privy to all my ſinfull affections, help me to be reformed, I reſolve (by thy help) for the time to come to be more exact in my obedience to thy law, that knoweſt my trouble, and affliction, make me reformed under the croſſe. This was Davids care Pſal. 66, 13, 14 I will goe into thine houſe with burnt offerings, and will pay thee my vowes which my lippes have promiſed and my mouth hath ſpoken, in mine affliction.</p>
                  <p>When he was in trouble, and under the rod, he promiſed ſomething to God, and now he reſolves to be carefull to pay it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and laſtly, Chriſtians under the rod, muſt ſeverally, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, (not only joyntly in companie and aſſemblies) reforme what is amiſſe according to the forementioned rules. He doth not ſpeak in the plurall number, It is meet for Cities, Countries, and Kingdomes, or Nations, but, It is meet for me, that is, for every particular man, and woman, of what degree, eſtate, or condition ſoever, this muſt be my work, my task, my care, huſband apart, wife apart, child apart, ſervant apart, Miniſter apart, people apart. For uſually that is done to beſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which is done ſingle, in a way of ſecrecy. The ſouldiers come to John, and ſay, What ſhall we doe? the Publicans and ſinners, What ſhall we doe? every one of them in particular deſired to know what belonged to them in reforming, this lieth plainly in the text.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, There is ſomething elſe that I meant as a ſeventh help, it is that Chriſtians ſhould not only looke upon their reformation under the rodde as a taſke neceſſary and as a duty commanded, but they ſhould looke upon it, as an imployment comely and lovely; meet ſaith the text, what a beautifull and beſeemingthing, is it in a Chriſtian reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be reformed under the rudde? And thus we have done with the firſt thinge propounded, viz. what kinde of reformation it is, we ſhould reſolve upon under the rod.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing propounded, is what arguments may prevaile with Chriſtians, according to the latitude of this Text, thus to reforme under the rodde. There are arguments of two kindes, that I ſhall ſuggeſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſome in relation to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſome in relation to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in relation to God, I ſhall name ſix or ſeven, whereof five I ſhall finde in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe God that calleth for Reformation under Correction, is the author of every blow, of every ſcourge, he it is, that breaketh the bones that teareth the ſkin, that bruiſeth the fleſh, this you may ſee in the 13, 14, 15. v. Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath placed him over the whole world? If he ſet his heart upon man (ſpeaking of God) and gather unto himſelfe his ſpirit, and his breath. All fleſh ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh together, and man ſhall returne unto duſt: he doth not ſay, if they will breake themſelves to pieces, or if infectious aire, or unſeaſonable times, will produce a peſtilence, to ſweepe them away; but, if he ſhall doe it, that is God, he is the author of it. Conſider that place Jer. 5. 3. where the Prophet ſpeakes thus by way of complaint, O Lord are not thine eyes
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:44191:200"/>
upon the truth? thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not ſorrowed, thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction, they have made their faces harder then a ſtone, and have refuſed to returne: ſhould not the childs care under the ſmarting rod be, to give content to the angry father? know the Lord is the author of thy chaſtiſement, Is there any evil in the City (meaning the evill of puniſhment) and the Lord hath not done it, ſaith the Prophet? Is there any breach in the Kingdom, any plagues amongſt us, any famine, or want, that the Lord hath not done? it is his hand that layes on: that is one argument.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon why we ſhould reforme under the rod, is, becauſe God afflicts us, becauſe we are blame worthy, becauſe we have ſinned, therefore his Majeſty is pleaſed to ſmite us, verſe 26. 27. He ſtriketh them as wicked men, in the open ſight of all men, becauſe they have turned back from him, and would not conſider all his wayes: Doth God lay on them, why is it? only becauſe he hath a delight to rend, and teare them, bruiſe and breake? no, nothing leſſe: for he doth not afflict willingly.</p>
                  <p>It is alienum opus, it goes againſt the heart, and minde of God, God is provoked unto it by mens ſins. Lam. 39. in that place (before quoted) wherefore doth the living man complaine? he gives a reaſon, Man ſuffereth for his ſins, and in the 40. verſe, ſhewes what uſe we ſhould make of this; Let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turne unto the Lord, ſay, I was proud, God hath met with me, therefore now I will be more humble, I was peeviſh, God hath croſſed me, now I will be more tractable, I was ſenſual in the uſe of the creature, God hath given me a bitter pill, therefore I will be more moderate, that I may not provoke his Majeſty any more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider this, (which will follow from the former,) he is exceeding juſt, and gracious in every rod he uſeth, in every ſtroke, that he giveth; in every affliction that he ſendeth, as in verſe 10. 11, 12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hearken to me ye men of underſtanding, far be it from God that he ſhould doe wickedneſſe, and from the almighty, that he ſhould commit iniquity, for he will render unto every man, according to his works, and cauſe every one to find according to his way, and 23. for he will not lay upon man more then is right, that he ſhould enter into judgement with God. God will not make the ſtaffe too heavy, the rod too bigge, God doth noe more then juſtly he may, if he teare the skin, if that will not doe, he will breake the veines, if that will not doe, he will deal more rigorouſly, and ſhall not this move us to reforme under the rod?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord well knows, and conſiders, the frame of every mans ſpirit, the carriage of every ſoule under his correcting hand, when God layes on with his hammer upon the anvile of our hearts, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders what force it hath inward, in our ſpirits, outward in our lives: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this in the 21. 22. verſe, His eyes are upon the wayes of man, and be ſeeth all his goings, there is no darkneſſe nor ſhadow of death, that the workers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity might be hid therein. Mark it, can a man run away from God, as a child many times from his father, and hides himſelf untill his anger is over? no, he knows every fault that we reforme not in, and knows every courſe that we take for the cauſing of offence, ſubmitting, and ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:44191:201"/>
to him will not ſerve the turne, we muſt reforme when under the rod. I could give you that paſſage, Amos 4. 6. to 12. I have given you cleanneſſe of teeth, ſcarſeneſſe of bread, I have withholden the raine from you, I have ſmitten you with blaſting, and mildew, peſtilence have I ſent among you, your young men have I ſlaine with the ſword, I have overthrown you, as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as firebrands pluckt out of the burning, yet in all theſe you have not returned to me ſaith the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus will I do unto thee, be reformed under all theſe croſſes, and prepare thy ſelf to meet thy God O Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Know the Lord is no reſpector of perſons, God is not like many fond parents, that will indulge cocker, and make much of one child, and lay upon the bones of another, many times they know not for what, but only as affection carries them, nor like ſome miſguided autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, where poor ragged thieves have the halter, when ſilken ones are ſpared; no no, there is no ſuch affection in God, conſider it, there is more in the proof then I ſpeak of, verſe 19 20. How much leſſe to him that accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the perſons of princes, and regardeth not the rich, more then the poor, for they be all the work of his hands, and verſe 24. he ſhall break the mighty without ſeeking, and ſhall ſet up others in their stead. God noe more regards a man worth thouſands, then him that is worth not a farthing; God no more eſteems (in regard of perſonall reſpect) the governers, then the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould move people under the rod to truſt in God and labour to be reformed, theſe are the five Arguments that I finde in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>There are two more remaining in the ſixth place, know for certaine that this is the very end that God aimes at, that by his rodde people might be reformed, as Iſa. 27. 9. By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, the taking away of his ſinne. If a childe ſhould aske the father, why did you beate me ſo exceedingly? And he and he anſwer, I would have thee to reforme, to take heede of ſinfull courſes, of ſinfull company, it might be a good argument to worke upon the child. This is the end of God in afflictions that he exerciſeth his withall, to have them be reformed thereby.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly and Laſtly, conſider, his majeſty will account himſelfe highly honoured, by the reformation of his people under the rodde; in ſort we may make God amends, (but doe not miſtake my expreſſion) it doth not make amends by way of requitall, not adding any thing to his worth, but by way of manifeſtation; but to let that paſſe. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that concerning Paul, God laid upon him, ſtruck him of his horſe, and preſently after you ſhall read. 1 Gal. 23. that they glorified God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him; What a change is here! he that deſtroyed, and perſecuted, now preacheth that goſpel, for which he perſecuted them, he that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſperſe, and ſcatter poor Chriſtians, now is zealous in incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them God-ward, ſo that the godly glory greatly becauſe of him: and what an extraordinary honour is this to God! ſuppoſe a man hath a ſtubborne Colt to break, that will ſtand upon no ground, that ſeems to be very untractable, now if this man can in a ſhort ſpace, bring him to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:44191:201"/>
the Saddle, and make him tame and gentle; what a credit will it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? So here when God puts us one way, another way, comes to worke us and winde us according to his will, he thinks himſelfe honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if we will become tractable, and yield to his commands; when we that once had Chriſt and his government, ſhall come in and ſay with Elihu, Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have borne chaſtiſements, I will not offend any more. This is pleaſing unto God, in this he thinks himſelfe much honoured. This ſhall ſerv to have ſpoken to theſe ſeven arguments in relation to God.</p>
                  <p>Now for thoſe arguments of the ſecond ſort, in relation to our ſelves, of theſe I will ſpeake under a two fold head,</p>
                  <p>Some are drawing, ſome are driving, ſome are forcing, ſome allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, my meaning is, ſome ſuggeſt ſadneſs to them that will not reforme under the rodde, theſe I call driving or forcing, again ſome hold forth ſweetneſſe, pretious prerogatives to them that will amend, and reforme when the Lord ſmites, and theſe I call alluring, and drawing arguments. You ſee I am in a large field, but I doubt, I ſhall have time, to goe over but a little ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for driving arguments.</p>
                  <p>Not to reforme under the rod, it faſtens a blacke marke of ſhamefull ignominie, and reproach upon the heart of a ſinner: how is Jeroboam markt (in this regard) with a black coale, what reproach is caſt upon the back of that man, though he was a King, and woare a Crowne, and the main reaſon of this was, becauſe he reformed not under Gods hand, Kings 1. 13. 4. he ſtretched out his hand againſt the Prophet, his hand dried up, ſo that he could not pluck it in again, yet for all this, ſaith the Text verſe 33. Yet for all this Jeroboam turned not from his wicked way. Here is a Monſter of nature, a hopeleſſe wretch, God ſmites him with one rodde after another, takes away a limbe, a hand, and yet he will not be reformed.</p>
                  <p>Here conſider two things by way of argumentation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, not to be reformed under the rodde, is a ſigne of unſpeakable fooliſhneſſe, as it is Jeremy 5. 3, 4. Thou hast ſtricken them but they have not ſorrowed, thou hast conſumed them but they have refuſed to receive corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, therefore I ſaid, ſurely they are poore, they are fooliſh, for they know not the way of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſtrange thing, that men ſhould be no more ſenſible of the rodde, then the Iron of the hammer. Like ſome ſturdy villains, that will not ſtirre at their Maſters bidding, he ſtrikes with one hand after another, till he hath wearied himſelfe, yet he is dogged, and will not goe: ſoe God is upon men in eſtate, in name, in Children, inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; Oh the rockiſhneſſe of mens hearts, when all theſe roddes will not move them to bee reformed, herein they ſhew egregious folly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not to be reformed under the rodde is a ſigne of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bruitiſhneſſe. Pro. 27. 22. Though thou ſhouldeſt bray a foole in a morter amongſt wheat brayed with a peſtle, yet will not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him. Marke, he is like a bruit, beate him, ſtrike him, he amends not,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:44191:202"/>
like a foole, he will not be reformed. We uſe to ſay, Children ſhew themſelves fooliſh, for they might ſave many a blow: the father calls, he regards not, againe, come, he comes not, goe, he goes not, untill he comes himſelfe, beates him, and makes him goe. Oh fooliſh Child, might not this have been ſaved? So God calls from the world, from our pleaſure, we will not hear him, he pulls away bleſſing after bleſſing, and gives us blow after blow, yet we will not regard him; oh fooliſh people and unwiſe, (marke it) thoſe people that will not reforme under the rod of the Lord, they do expoſe themſelves, (poore ſoules) themſelves know not, to what an encreaſe, and augmentation of miſery: Doe but obſerve it in Pharaoh, let my people go, ſaith God; no not he, therefore God is upon him with one plague after another, one judgement after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, yet not reformed, then the firſt borne in every family dyeth, yet when he had let the Iſraelites goe, he purſues after them, and will not leave till he ſinke (as the text ſaith) like a ſtone in the mighty waters. You know what God threatens, Levit 26. If ye will not hearken, and be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto me, yet ſeaven times more, yet ſeven times more will I plague you: ſo Amos 4. yet have ye not returned, I have afflicted you time after time, yet have you not returned, therefore I will doe thus unto you: How is that? I will bring ſome unexpected, and miſerable-making judgement: If I ſhould ſay that incorrigibleneſſe under the rodde, cauſeth God in wrath to give up people, as in a condition hopeleſſe, I could eaſily prove it; know for certaine, that God will ſay, why ſhould I ſmite any more? the more I ſmite, they more they ſinne, therefore I will take no more paines with them: juſt as many a father will ſay of his incorrigible childe, I will ſpend no more ſtripes upon him, no more time about him, I will packe him out of dores, let him be gone, and trouble my ſelfe no more with him, ſo will God ſay to thoſe that will not be reformed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rodde: this is a ſad thing to be conſidered: Hoſea alſo will prove this. Further conſider, this is that that provokes the Lord (what ſhall I ſay) for to remove his ordinances from amongſt us. Iſa. 13. bring no more vaine oblations, incenſe is an abomination unto me, I cannot ſuffer your new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moones, nor ſabbaths, nor ſolemne aſſemblies: All this was becauſe ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed not, for ſaith the Lord ver. 15. Your hands are full of bloud; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what Chriſt ſaide, Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh. Theſe are the driving conſiderations: and why ſhould we not all (from hence) learne to be reformed under the rod?</p>
                  <p>Now followes thoſe that are drawne from the gaine, that you and I may get by labouring for to attaine unto this frame of ſoule, when the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to accept of us.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay? this is the way for to gaine the comfort of the Lord, the tender bowels of his compaſſion, when wee are under the bittereſt calamity, that can befall us, Oh beloved, doe but ſuppoſe a father had torne the fleſh of his child, or broke a vein, and the child ſhould ſobbe, and ſigh, oh would I had not done ſo, or ſo, to provoke my father, I will be better as long as I live, how would the father, and mother, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and even weepe to heare him? So it is with God, Jer. 31. 18, 20. I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelfe, Thou haſt chastiſed me, and I
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:44191:202"/>
was chaſtiſed as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoake: you know, offer to yoak a Bullock, and ſhe ſtrikes one with her horn, another with her foot, ſo it was with me ſaith Ephraim, yet then the Lord loves him, ſee v. 20. Is Ephraim my deare ſonne, is he a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake unto him, I doe earneſtly remember him, ſtill therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Again, know that if you endeavour thus to reforme under the rodde of the Lord, you may be confident, that the worſt things you may or can ſuffer for God, and his cauſe, they ſhall (according to the riches of his grace) turne to your joy, and everlaſting comfort.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord threatned the Captivity, Jerem. 24. he compares them to two baſkets ef figges, whereof one one was good, the other naught; by the good figges he ſets out thoſe that ſhould be reformed by their captivity, verſe 6. I will ſet mine eyes upon them for good, and I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>
                  <p>They ſhall be happy, though under the power of them that hate both them, and their profeſſion, they ſhall enjoy me for good ſaith the Lord, becauſe they have turned to me with all their hearts. Will you ſee what heapes of comfort, heape upon heape, the Lord hath provided for them, in reading that place, Job 22. 22. to the end. You know in what a caſe Job was, his eſtate was waſted, his Children killed; his wife become a cold comforter. Now mark 22. Receive I pray thee the Law of his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 23. If thou returne to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, thou ſhalt be built up; and thou ſhalt put iniquity from thy tabernacle. See further the reſtauration of his eſtate, and the ſupply of his want, ſo far as abundance may be for thy good, thou ſhalt have it, if under the rod, thou returne, 25. The Almighty ſhall be thy defence, yea, thou ſhalt have thy delight in the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why we have ſo little communion with God, is becauſe luſts ly unſubdued in our boſome, we take delight in our riches, and pleaſure, and this hinders us of the ſweet joy we might have in Chriſt: He goes on, Thou ſhalt lift up thy face to God; what is the reaſon a man runs, and hides his head? it is becauſe he hath ſinned: he goes on, Thou ſhalt make thy prayer to him, and he ſhall heare thee: he will ſo heare that he will grant thee thy requeſts, and thou ſhalt have to pay thy vowes that thou hast promiſed, thou ſhall decree a thing, and he ſhall eſtabliſh it unto thee, thou ſhalt alway ſpeed, and proſper in thine undertakings, and the light ſhall ſhine in thy wayes, God himſelf ſhall direct thee, when others are caſt down, then ſhalt thou ſay, I am lifted up. See what a company of comforts is here, for them that will be reformed under the rod.</p>
                  <p>What need I name particulars? when as Jeſus Chriſt (in whom is all the promiſes of this life, &amp; a better) is made over to them, that are careful to reforme, both in their ſpirit, and wayes, in reference to that God that caſts them down; the redeemer ſhall come unto Zion, and unto them that turne from iniquity in Jacob, ſaith the Lord, Iſaiah 59. 20. Is not here ſtrong arguments to move you? therefore take the Place of the text, and ſay, we will beare chaſtiſements, we will not offend any more, that which we ſee not,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:44191:203"/>
teach thou us, and if we have done iniquity, we will doe it no more.</p>
                  <p>The third thing was, what courſe we ſhould take to be wrought upon to attain unto this frame of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Throuhly from ſcipture light, informe your ſelves, concerning the ſinfulneſs, and the uglineſſe of this courſe in regard wherof you muſt reforme ſaith the Prophet, After I was inſtructed I repented, and ſmote upon my thigh, and ſaid, what a thing is this that I have done? that which I ſee not, teach thou me, may be I doe not ſee it, if I doe ſee it, may be not ſo ugly, baſe, and abominable as it is, therefore oh teach me. If men did but think, what it is to be a naturall man, for a man that hath an immortall ſoule to lye ſtinking in a puddle, to goe to the trough with the Swine, and under the table with the dogge, there is noe man but would think this to be a very deformed, and unſeemly ſight, how much more, to have your ſoules, your immortall ſoules rooting in the dirt; this is the condition of a naturall man. Conſider, is it not a horrible thing, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt God, to pluck God out of the chaire of ſtate, to pull him out of the throne of majeſty, to wring the Scepter out of Gods hand? this is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſon indeed! A proud man doth it, he reſiſts God, he ſets himſelf againſt God, God againſt him, if you did but conſider this, you would down with your proud hearts. Again conſider what it is to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, to give God the lye, as every unbeliever doth, to let the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt meities of God to fall into the channel: rather then I will put out my hand to reach them, this every unbeliever doth. Now we ſhould conſider the danger of theſe ſins, and labour to avoyd them, and we ſhould ſtrive to ſee the latitude, and utmoſt extent of the bloudineſſe, and baſeneſſe of our own hearts, that ſo we may keep the better watch againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes when a Father would have his child aſhamed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he fetcheth a glaſſe, and ſhews him, what a deformed face he makes himſelf. Oh that you did but ſee the ſinfulneſſe, and deformity of this courſe, whereof God would have you to reforme, you could not but be aſhamed of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you muſt be deeply humbled for what ever it is that under the rod you doe diſcover to be out of order, both in your heart, your minde, and actions; the way of reformation is by weeping croſſe, I ſmote upon my thigh, and was aſhamed. Rich Manaſſes, who was a King, humbled himſelf greatly before the Lord God of his fathers, this indeed is repentance not to be repented of; what feare, what indignation, what zeale have the ſaints of God ſhewed in their reforming under the rod? ſaith God, my people that are called by my name, ſhall humble themſelves, and turne from their evill wayes, noe turning aright, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humiliation: when a child once ſees wherin he hath offended, and the haynouſneſſe of his offence, he falls down upon his knees, and cryes out, pardon, pardon. So muſt we labour to ſee the greatneſſe of our ſins, and the hainouſneſſe of them, that ſo we may be the deeper humbled for them, and then the ſoule (at the apprehenſion of ſin growing upon the heart, in regard of the root of originall ſin that feeds it, and in regard of the weakneſſe of his own nature to withſtand the world, the fleſh, and the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:44191:203"/>
divill,) will ſeek after Chriſt, get Chriſt, hugge Chriſt, then he will know the worth of a Saviour, and will eſteem of a Saviour, for he knows that God hath ſet him apart that he may give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſſe of ſins, Acts 5. 31. To bleſſe you in turning every one of you from your iniquities, as Acts 3. 26. he knhws that Chriſt hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to bind the ſtrong man, caſt out devils, if he ſpeak but the word, the waves and winds ſhall all be quiet. It was foretold, Iſa. 11. 6. 7. that in goſpel time, the Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lambe, and the Leapard ſhall lye with the Kid, and the Calfe, and the Lion, and the fat beaſt together, and a little child ſhall-lead them, and the Cow and the Beare ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lye together; and the Lyon ſhall eat ſtraw like the Bullock, and the ſucking child ſhall play upon the hole of the Aſpe, and the weaned Child ſhall put his hand upon the Cockatrice hole. This is the mighty work of God, therefore goe unto Gov, and ſay, O God thou that canſt thus change the naturall diſpoſition of beaſts, change my beaſtly diſpoſition, thou that couldeſt call a Lazarus out of the grave where he lay rotting, Oh deliver me from a dead heart, that have laine a long time rotting in ſin, thou that dideſt make the lame to goe, make me to run the way of thy commandements, which thou haſt ſet before me, thou that didſt open the eyes of the blind, open my eye that I may ſee to runne the race that thou haſt ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; thou that didſt cure the deaf, bore my eares, that I may heare, and learn to feare thee.</p>
                  <p>Thus goe to God, and pray unto God, waite upon God, and expect deliverances from him, for there is none in Heaven or in earth that can give a deliverane but he alone, intreat the Lord, according to your need, to work on your ſoules this grace of reforming under the rod, goe to God, and ſay, father if thou wilt, thou canſt alter me, and change me, oh, turne me, and I ſhall be turned, convert thou me, and I ſhall be converted, ſay, Lord thou canſt take away all tranſgreſſion, all ſin and iniquity, doe it for thy mercy ſake, ſay, Lord, thou canſt pull out my right eye, ſin, cut of my right hand, ſin, there is no power, but the power of an omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God can doe it, that can thus pull me out of ſin, and make me refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, doe it fot thy Goodneſſe ſake.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Are you all willing to enter into a covenant with God? ſeeing we are all under the rod, I doe not ſpeak of any particular covenant, but of a generall covenant, will you now promiſe the Lord that you will reforme, and ſin noe more? this is that, that the Lord expects of us, now we are under the rod, this it is that the Lord doth both command, and commend unto us, this let us all bind our ſelves to performe, that ſo we may with ſome boldneſſe put up our prayers to God, as well for others, as our ſelves.</p>
