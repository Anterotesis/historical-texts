         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat which we ſhall now write to you,
(my beloved Brethren) is concerning
the hope of the <hi>Seed of Jacob,</hi> which for
many Years hath been looked for, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by us all; but now is the time near at hand,
for the Great <hi>JEHOVA</hi> hath raiſed up a Great
Prophet, one <hi>Shilo Sabathi,</hi> a man whoſe birth
and education hath been hitherto unknown to
the Jews. But for your further ſatisfaction I
have here ſent you the Copy of the Two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                  <p>WE have a great rumor concerning a Prophet
lately diſcovering himſelf in South <hi>Tartary</hi>
at the head of a conſiderable number of
People unarmed, whoſe manners, habits and language,
differs from the people inhabiting in or near thoſe parts;
the name of this Prophet or Leader is <hi>Shilo Sabathi,</hi> he
is of a very tall ſtature, of a comely and majeſtick coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
the hair of his head is as white as ſnow, and
long, reaching down to his waſt, and parted on the
crown after the manner of the <hi>Nazarites;</hi> his beard of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38459:5"/>
the ſame colour covering all his breaſt; he wears a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
looſe Garment, a Coronet wreathed with boughs
of trees upon his head, and carries a white wand in his
hand: in fine he is adorned with all that comelineſs, as
due color, order and proportion of parts can make, that
his body might be a fit Palace for his divine ſoul. When
an Army of the Tartars came to oppoſe them as inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their Land, his majeſtick countenance did ſtrike
ſuch a terror into their hearts, that they immedi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tely
threw away their weapons, and fell down at his feet,
crying out <hi>Jeru, Jeru Tartari<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> which in their language
ſignifies <hi>O Jeruſalem, the Remnant of Jeruſalem!</hi> Then
<hi>Rabbi Shilo</hi> held up his ſtick towards them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to riſe: ſaying, My Brethren, you are of
the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> as well as we; and though the Great
JEHOVAH hath diſperſed us throughout almoſt all
parts of the habitable World, becauſe our Fathers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed
his Commandments, and worſhipped other
Gods: yet that you may be aſſured that his anger will
not laſt for ever, he hath ſent me, <hi>Shilo Sabathi,</hi> to be
your Captain or Leader to conduct you to the Land of
promiſe, where you ſhall enjoy all thoſe mercies and
priviledges as was enjoyed by our Nation in the Reign
of King <hi>Solomon.</hi> For I am that <hi>Shilo</hi> you ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and now is the fulneſs of time come, that I
ſhould appear to you, be therefore of good courage &amp;
follow me, and I will bring you to the Land of your
Fathers, I will lay the Foundations, of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
raiſe the Walls thereof, rebuild the Temple of the Lord
and make it more glorious then that of <hi>Solomons,</hi> which
was but a type or ſhadow of mine. Fear not your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
none ſhall oppoſe you. He told them likewiſe
that about ſeven years ſince he had ſent one <hi>Saba Sabathi</hi>
to prepare his way, but he was inhumanely murthered
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38459:5"/>
by the Turks; for which they muſt expect ſome ſevere
Judgments to fall upon that Nation. He travels very
ſlowly, but he daily encreaſeth his Company; and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
none to wear any offenſive weapon proclaiming to
them nothing but Love and Peace.</p>
                  <p>What the product of this will be we cannot tell, but

Rabbi Shilo; <hi>he hath put out a Declaration,
wherein he gives the world an account of h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, Birth, Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the ſeveral paſſages of his Life, which, I ſuppoſe
will come ſhortly to my hands, and then you ſhall be ſure to
have a Copy of it by the next poſt; In the mean time take
this ſhort account of it, as I had it from a very good hand.
He tells the world, that his Birth was about the year of the
world, 5547. And that as ſoon as he came of age to travel,
he wandred about all the habitable world, ſeeking and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
after the Twelve Tribes, that were carried into
Captivity by</hi> Salmanaſar <hi>but could not find them, till ſuch
time as it was revealed to him in a Viſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how he ſhould
come to the knowledge of them, and that he ſhould conduct
them to</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>The manner of it was as followeth.</hi>
Rabbi Shilo <hi>wearied with his tedious and unſucceſsful
travels, being in the Deſarts of</hi> Arabia, <hi>reſolved now to
live an obſcure and holy Life, and not to converſe any
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38459:6"/>
longer with Men, but with God and Angels, and to this
end ſought out ſome convenient place to inhabit, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
providence ſoon favoured him with, for he had not
gone far before he ſpi'd a a very handſome Cave, paved with
Stone, and arched with curious Workmanſhip: Into this
place he entred, fell aſleep, and ſaw a Viſion; An Angel ſtood
before him, whoſe countenance was brighter than the Sun;
and ſaid unto him,</hi> Rabbi Shilo, <hi>Beloved of</hi> Jehovah, <hi>Ariſe
and follow me; and immediately ſmote him with a white
Wand; at which</hi> Rabbi Shilo <hi>awaked, and followed this
celeſtial Meſſenger, who led him through many Countries,
and at laſt brought him to the ſide of a hill, where was a
Cave, whoſe mouth was ſtopped with Stones of a very large
ſize, cemented together ſo faſt, that one might more eaſily have
entred a Rock than the Cave: But the Angel gave him a
white Wand, and bid him ſtrike the ſtones with it, which he
did, and immediatly the ſtones tumbled down, then they
both entered the Cave, and in the midſt of it they found a
marble Cheſt, the Angel bids</hi> Rabbi Shilo <hi>strike the top of
the Cheſt with his Wand, at which it immediatly flew open;
then the Angel bid him peruſe the Writing he found in the
Cheſt, and ſo left him.</hi> Rabbi Shilo <hi>being troubled at the
Angels ſo ſuddain departure, ſate muſing, conſidering what
to do; but recalling himſelf, and remembring the words of
the Angel, read the Writings. He looked into the Cheſt, and
there found a Book, a large roule of very ancient Vellom,
and two Tables of Stone; the Book was the Cabal that
was given to</hi> Moſes, <hi>by which he was informed of all things
done from the Creation till his time; and by it he writ the</hi>
Penteteuch, <hi>but it was again loſt, and brought again to</hi>
Eſdras, <hi>and then loſt again, being conveyed into this place,
where it remained till this time: The roul of Parchment
contained the Genealogy and Succeſſion of the Tribes to this
preſent time, and in what Countries they are, and how they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38459:6"/>
are diſperſed and mixed with the Gentiles. The Tables of
Stone were the ſame that</hi> Moſes <hi>brought down from the
Mount: After he had peruſed theſe Writings, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Angels command, the Angel again appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him; and told him that now he had ſeen the Cabal, he
might write a true Hiſtory of all things done ſince the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And by the roul of Vellom he might write the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of all the Twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and bid him go and
gather together the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael <hi>from the four Corners
of the Earth, and bring them to the Land of their Fathers;
He told him that none ſhould reſist them, but they ſhould
have free paſſage to the Holy Land, and King's ſhould be
aſſiſtant to them in their Journeys, and contribute largely to
the rebuilding of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the Temple of the Lord.
Having ſaid this, the Angel again left him. This is what
I have hitherto heard of his Declaration, Be of good chear,
we hope to ſee a jeyful time; In the mean while, I am,</hi>
