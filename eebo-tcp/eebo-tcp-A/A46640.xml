            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable, The EARL of DUNDONNALD, <hi>Lord Cochran,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AS, my Lord, amongst the innumerable precious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Blessings, which God hath graciously vouchsafed to Mankind, or to any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, His Word, Statutes and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles infinitly surpass, excel, and, so to speak, obscure all the rest by far, more than the Sun doth eclipse the lesser Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries: so according to that common saying, <hi>Corruptio opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, pessima</hi>; Nothing by many
<pb facs="tcp:95059:3"/>
degrees is so mischievous, noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and deadly as the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Depravation of these lively Oracles; For thus, tho by a cursed accident, The Wine of our Fathers Kingdom is turned into Wormwood, and that Heavenly and unpressed Honey into Gall; whereby the greater part of the visible Church hath perished! For the Poison hath this most unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py advantage above all others, that it is of an <hi>hydropick nature,</hi> making the infected, the more they have drunk, so much the more desirous to drink. Hence that sagacious Spirit, the grand
<pb facs="tcp:95059:3"/>
Enemy of Mankind, judged this the choicest expedient and mean, for restauration of his falling Kingdom: For to speak nothing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> the first 4000 years of the World, he hath ever, since the very infancy of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to his outmost, put this in practice, always raising up such as were most famous, or rather infamous, through their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, abusing, and detorting the Word of Life, and Charters of our Salvation: Of which kind, in the early days of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, were <hi>Cerinthus, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi> the <hi>Cataphrygians, Samosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus, Arrius,</hi> and a multitude
<pb facs="tcp:95059:4"/>
beside. But these first Essays, by reason of their palpable and direct overturning of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Fundamentals of Christianity which rendred all their sophistry, tho never so subtile, most suspected, proved inefficacious to do the Business, tho in some respect, infectious enough. Therefore the Lord having by many Means, and in special, by the first four Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, blown away these pestife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Mists, and cleared up to mens minds, these grand <hi>Truths</hi> of the Holy Trinity, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Christ, the Unity of his Person, the Distinction of his
<pb facs="tcp:95059:4"/>
Natures, and the like. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was altered, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing opposers of Truth acted by the same Spirit, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were, went more subtilly to work, not only forbearing to oppose these Fundamentals, but, in shew at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>st, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to defend and assert them: By which it came to pass, that they were more easily believed in all they said, by the too sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people. In the mean while they secretly and slily sowed their Tares under the specious pretext of Unity, Order, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, Ornament, and antient Tradition. Under the covert of
<pb facs="tcp:95059:5"/>
these &amp; the like, was the whole Mass of Paganism introduced, guilded only with the varnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Title of Catholick Doctrine. For thus in stead of the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Gospel-Ministry, was brought in a Prelatick Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, in imitation of the Pagan Protoflamines, which at length procreated to the World the Man of Sin, to head this dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating Church in their Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness: And so they had Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which was worse than Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and an Order, that became the cause of the most horrid Confusion the World hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto seen. Thus also the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<pb facs="tcp:95059:5"/>
of the Gospel was turned into Heathnish Pageantry; and the glory of the Church of God did degenerat into a meer worldly pomp and grandour. But at length how sad and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable became the case of the Church, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> through the power of humane inventions, delivered under the name of Tradition, &amp; the Dictats of the <hi>Romish-depute</hi> of the old Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, such poisonous dregs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the best part of the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of their Religion! Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God, ascribed to the belief and practice thereof, and Justification by Faith in the
<pb facs="tcp:95059:6"/>
Son of God, decried and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned! Thus were the same fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truths, which had been more openly assaulted by the former Hereticks, now no less powerfully, but more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly almost overthrown. But so soon as the Lord, as it were by the dawning of a second-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-day, had discovered <hi>Romes</hi> Abominations, and rendered her hateful to all good Men; the old Artist &amp; his associats chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their method, tho not their design, impugning again more openly, these fundamental Truths they had assaulted in the early days of Christianity;
<pb facs="tcp:95059:6"/>
But that the Weapon, already blunted, might yet cut, behold a new Artifice! For these at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were not made, for the most part, by these who persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the company of the now deservedly hated Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but by these who were in appearance the Deserters and Opposers thereof: Under the covert of which, they far more securely infected many, who were in communion with the reformed Church, impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asserting, that the chiefest points of Christianity we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, on this account that the Papists had not expresly denied
<pb facs="tcp:95059:7"/>
them. These were known by many names, as <hi>Servetians, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-trinitarians, Socinians,</hi> and the like. But more general was that of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> comprising in it self all these, and many other such Vipers. The true progeny of these <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are these, now known by the Name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> the men with whom Ideal, who for design and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, are all on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> with the bulk of both antient and modern Hereticks. Two Artifices were alternatively used by the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hereticks: and by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued succession derived unto our present Adversaries, the one
<pb facs="tcp:95059:7"/>
of which was to abuse the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; as if one should mould a Bushel of Jewels, into the shape of a Dog, Toad, or the like hateful Creature. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when in spite of all these shifts, they were Convicted out of the Scriptures, to turn upon the Scriptures themselves, as being not free of their own Errors, nor of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. How exactly the <hi>Quakers</hi> write after their Copy, none acquainted with their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, seeth not. I hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it shal not be unprofitable, if the following Discourse shall unfold more particularly these
<pb facs="tcp:95059:8"/>
practices of our Adversaries, which I with a humble confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can averr; and moreover I make some Discoveries, in particular of this more spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Mystery of Iniquity, by none I know hitherto directly undertaken. Moreover, this my Treatise can be judged by none altogether superfluous, who considereth, that the whole Land is ready to be overspread with the Hemlock o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> now known by the name of <hi>Arminianism,</hi> with which the bulk of the Prelatick Clergy is already infected, for with this Heresie I have several Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters.
<pb facs="tcp:95059:8"/>
But I will not trouble your Lordship with a further account of this my small Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; Yet this I crave leave to say, that whatever I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of this kind, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for your Lordship, not for instruction; for to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pitch, and that not without ground I presume your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to be arrived, but only for a testimony of my gratitude to your Lordships most Noble and Munificent Grand-Father, whose large bounty to the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Learners, did liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extend it self to me also, tho most undeserving. Wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:95059:9"/>
if there were any worth in this my small Essay, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship by right of succession may challenge a propriety therein. Neither were your Lordships Vertues unknown to me, while I had the honour of receiving my Education under the same Roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, and at the same time with your Lordship. But the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial motive of my ambition to prefix your Lordships Name to my sheets, is, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship by undoubted arguments hath proved your self, to be a sincere lover of the now much deserted and maligned Truths of GOD, and a true favourer
<pb facs="tcp:95059:9"/>
of his afflicted Church, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on these many years by oppressing Lords, that never had lawful Dominion over her: whose Prelatical Yoak and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchy, as it hath proved the stair, by which, beside many other Tyrants, the Pope hath got to the unmeasurable height, at which he is now arrived, so it is ready to become the bridge, and pave the way for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction into <hi>Britain,</hi> with this much I thought to have troubled your Lordship seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Months ago, but then could not, for <hi>May</hi> last, my Papers not being admitted to the Press
<pb facs="tcp:95059:10"/>
without the allowance of the then publick Inspectors, were given to Doctor <hi>Munro,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto appointed by the Prelat of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> by whom I was prohibited the publication thereof, unless I razed out of them, all mention of Popery whatsoever. So great hath the zeal of these good men been against Popery, that so far as they could, they would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it so much as once to be named. Yet do I not complain of any wrong done to me, but only show to your Lordship, and the World, to how sad a pass things were then brought!
<pb facs="tcp:95059:10"/>
Go on therefore, my Lord, espousing the Cause of the true Protestant Interest, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to Popery, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath a tendency thereto: Thus shall your Lordship add the truest lustre to your Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by causing the Heart of the destitute, and widow Church to sing, and bringing the blessing of her that was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to perish upon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And however matters shall succeed, your Lordship shall be Feasted with the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies of a good Conscience, in respect of which, the choic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Banquet of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> with
<pb facs="tcp:95059:11"/>
her <hi>Anthony,</hi> are far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to the coursest of Commons. In which, that the Lord may prosper your Lordship, and bestow upon your Lordship and Family, his choicest Blessings, is, and shall be, the earnest Prayer of, my Lord,</p>

            <p>THou will perhaps say, that this Treatise is but an <hi>Illade</hi> after <hi>Homer,</hi> or a thirteenth <hi>Enclo;</hi> So much already to so good purpose being written on this Subject: I therefore hold my self obliged to answer this Objection, by rendring thee an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Reasons that moved me to this undertaking; which were, the dangerousness of, though but the least infection, by this deadly Disease. The Proximity, or nearness of the Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The wonderful readiness of its Patrons to broach Books, and Papers, bearing the Names of Answers of whatsoever is said, or written in opposition to it. That Quakerism is most dangerous, and the embracing thereof, of a lamentable and dreadful Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; none that seriously compare its Principles with those of Christianity, can be ignorant. <hi>I</hi> say, that compareth seriously, for others who have their Eye only, <hi>ad verum corricem;</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an overly view of the outside of things, may perhaps judge this difference not so great, and the Consequence of the Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Quakerism not so dismal. And apprehend that the worst things of Quakerism are only some ridiculous Stoicisms, and antick Toys, which, notwithstanding requite all the want of Civility, and good manners with sport and laughter, which thereby accreweth to the beholders. But by this their sloth, and neglect to compare the Doctrine of this Party with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they render themselves more capable to swallow down their poisoned wills, and eat out of the Pot filled with nothing but death. For as <hi>Ignoti Nulla Cupido,</hi> as a man cannot greatly love that which he knoweth not, though it be good, so neither can he sufficiently hate it, be it never so evil. Indeed their carelesness, and negligence meriteth no less. For certain it is, that bitter is no more contrary to sweet, darkness to light, than the Doctrine of <hi>Quakers</hi> is to that of <hi>Christ;</hi> being no other thing but a hodge-podge of the damnable Heresies, with which Christianity hath been from its infancy assaulted, and wrested, with to so good success, that few, though otherwise most audacious, have ventured to Patronise them, under their proper names, and genuine colours; but only under a mask and vizard, and new names and titles; all which are to be found in their Doctrine mixed, and compounded together, as if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Mankind, mindful of that common saying, <hi>Ut quod non

            <p>The truth of this could easily be evinced, were this a place convenient, and the Sequel will afford many instances, by which the Reader may judge of the rest. Moreover, supposing that <hi>Quakerism</hi> were far less noxious than it is, seing in every corner of the Land, there be many of its Defenders swarming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all people, it cannot be judged unnecessary to give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidot against it, more than to write Rules against any infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Even although many things of this kind were already extant; especially seing these Papers, with which I present thee, are both without Prolixity, and also discover some things of great concernment, which, for any thing I know, were never so fully, or directly handled by any others, which, I hope, may in part justifie my undertaking. But the thing most moving me to trouble the World with any Treatise of this kind, was, that no sooner did any Piece in opposition to <hi>Quakerism,</hi> see the light, but presently there came forth another, bearing the name of <hi>a Refutation thereof.</hi> At this I did not a litle wonder; for after a most impartial, and serious weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Principles, in the ballance of the Sanctuary, I found them (to say no more) directly opposite to the holy Scriptures. I therefore, with all seriousness, perused severals of the most ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured Pieces, which had not been as yet answered; comparing them with these, against whom they wrote. After all which, my thoughts were quite altered; for I left off to admire their promptitude of answering, and fell to wonder at their impudence, seing in every point, they in stead of Confuting, Confirm what their Adversaries say against them. In short, all the best of their answers, are either a quite omission, and passing by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what is brought for the overthrow of their Doctrine, or at best meer shifts, or else a most audacious asserting of these things <hi>In Ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

His Symbolizing with which he adventureth not to deny: Which although at other times he doth, yet groundleslie, as these Papers will in part, and more fullie, an entire Colation of Quakerism with the Principles of these Sects, will demonstrate to any, who hath but the least Spunk of ingenuity, and Candour. I forbear to say, although I could, that our Vindicator is no novice in the very Crime, of which he so oft accuseth his adversarie.

               <hi>GOOD Name is better than precious ointment,</hi> saith the Preacher, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.1. Whosoever therefore intend to bring either Persons, or Things under Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem and Contempt, labour in the first place to Spoil them of any <hi>Good Name,</hi> or due <hi>Titles</hi> belonging unto them, to the end, They may the more easily Effectuate their Purpose; This Method the <hi>Quakers</hi> have thought very fit and apposit, whereby to discredit, and finally to overthrow the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> For in the first place, they endeavour to rob them of the chiefest <hi>Titles,</hi> and most famous <hi>Elogies,</hi> with which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath adorned them: among which, that of being called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> is not the least.

               <hi>They are not the Word of God, but the Words of Men that spake them freely</hi>: Yea generally, All the <hi>Quakers</hi> unanimously deny, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are, or ought to be called the <hi>Word of God:</hi> But in so
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95059:14"/>
doing, they flately contradict <hi>God</hi> speaking in the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; For there they are most frequently called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> As <hi>Num.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.5. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.2. and 6.10. and 20. 8. <hi>Hos.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Amos.</hi> 8.12, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.61. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.13. compared with 10. These Scriptures, and many others that might be Cited, unanswerably prove that the Scriptures are, and ought to be called the <hi>Word of God.</hi> Several of these Passages with many others calling the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or a part thereof the <hi>Word of God</hi> or of <hi>the Lord</hi> in the singular number, are adduced by <hi>Mr Brown</hi> Chap. 4. N. 2. To all which <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s reply <hi>Vind</hi>: pag. 31, is a flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of these Scriptures, saying, <hi>That the thing which the Prophets spake, was only the words which came from the Word of God.</hi> Judge therefore, Reader, if such replies as these can either help the Author, or hurt his adversaries.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these Men have something to say for themselves, and so had they who denyed the fire to be hot, or the snow white.</p>
            <p>Their first Reason, why the Scriptures are not the <hi>Word of God,</hi> is, Because Christ is called the <hi>Word of God</hi>: but this reason sayeth nothing, but upon supposition that one word, or phrase cannot undergo divers acceptations, which is most false, yet <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> in the Vindication of his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy <hi>Pag.</hi> 31. to strengthen this Reason, sayeth, that <hi>one epithete</hi> (or attribute) <hi>cannot be predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi> (or affirmed) <hi>of two things</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95059:14"/>
But in this he only bewrayes his own ignorance of the Laws of a Contradiction, and his desire of contradicting the Scriptures with a shew of Reason: For whether by <hi>the Word of God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Christ or the Scriptures are to be understood this <hi>Elogie</hi> is still ascribed to either of them, with a peculiar eminency; But by the diversity of the acceptation the Contradiction is removed, which diversity may be easily Perceived by any that read or hear the Scriptures, or other Discourses, in which mention is made of <hi>the Word of God</hi>: As for Example, who could read these two Texts of Scripture, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.13. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.13. but they would presently see, that in the latter of the Texts, by <hi>the Word of God, Christ</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and in the former, <hi>the Scriptures</hi>? except he were altogether stupid, and so there is not the least appearance of a Contradiction. Therefore in short, where by <hi>the Word,</hi> Christ is understood, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Word</hi> is taken improperly, <hi>viz.</hi> For a Person, the essential and substantial Word of God, in so much as Christ is the Principal Declarer of the Mind of God, or upon other such accounts, such improper Attributes being frequently ascribed to Christ, as a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> and the like. But on the other hand, where by <hi>the Word of God,</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Scriptures, there <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Word</hi> is taken in a more proper acceptation, for a discourse composed of Letters and Syllables.</p>
            <p>The same Author hath yet another Reason, <hi>and</hi> it is a rare one, <hi>viz. That there are moe words in the Scriptures than one, Therefore they cannot be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95059:15"/>
called</hi> the Word of God. Behold, Reader, with what ridiculous Shifts, these men endeavour to uphold their impiety, and oppose themselves to God! Who but he that desired the Fools Coat, would thus reason? It is a lie to name an Epistle sent from one Person to another, a <hi>Letter,</hi> because in it there are moe Letters than one. Not only the Jews who were Christs Enemies, but even the Apostles themselves, had done right in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Quaker, if when <hi>Christ<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Mark</hi> 7.13, called the Scriptures the <hi>Word of God,</hi> they had flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradicted him, and said, this is a lye, seing there are moe Words in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> than one. Here is ridiculous folly and impious <hi>Blasphemy</hi> mixed together. And yet worse, (if worse can be) unavoidably followeth this their Doctrine, even that the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was not from Eternity, For according to them, when it is said, Hos. 1.2. <hi>The Beginning of the Word of the Lord,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must be, the beginning of Christ.</p>
            <p>With the like sacrilegious audacity they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bereave the Scriptures of that sweet and heart-melting <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>the Gospel,</hi> saying, <hi>Matthew, Mark Luke</hi> and <hi>Iohn, are not the Gospel, but the Letter.</hi> The Defence of this wicked and bold Contradiction of the Scriptures, <hi>William Pen</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh in his <hi>Rejoinder</hi> to <hi>Iohn Faldo, Pag.</hi> 117. His Reasons, whereby he would prove it, are, 1. Because the Gospel is called <hi>the Power of God to Salvation,</hi> so are not the Scriptures. To which I answer, That the Scriptures may as well be called <hi>the Power of God</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> as the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95059:15"/>
seeing it was the same <hi>Doctrine</hi> which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> both preached to the People, and committed to Writing: And the <hi>Righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith</hi> by this Doctrine, when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing, as well as when it was Preached by the Apostles. 2. By <hi>the Power of God to Salvation,</hi> no other thing can be understood but the Mean, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, or Instrument, whereby God exerteth, or putteth forth his Power to the saving of Sinners: Which kind of Metonymie is frequent in Scripture.</p>
            <p>The next Reason to prove that these Books ought not to be called the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which the Mans copious invention brancheth into two, is, <hi>That the Gospel is everlasting, and was Preached before the Scriptures were,</hi> therefore they are not the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Principles of Truth are everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and were before any Quakers Books were extant, Therefore a <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> which the Quakers have entituled, <hi>The Principles of Truth</hi> carrieth as a token of what is within, a lie in the Frontis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece thereof, which I believe <hi>William Pen</hi> will hardly admit. <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. The Doctrine contained in those Books is the same with, and therefore no lesse everlasting than the Gospel proclaimed by the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. cited by <hi>Pen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His two last Reasons whereby he would prove those Books not to be the Gospel, are that <hi>the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is but one</hi>; and that it is <hi>glad Tidings, but the Books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Iohn are four, and but Narratives, and not glad Tidings,</hi> are of the like nature with the former: For he knoweth well enough that <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95059:16"/>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> deliver not a contrair Doctrine one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only divers Narratives of the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; All which Books contain the glad Tidings of the Birth, Life, Death, and Resurrection of our <hi>Lord</hi> Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the World: And this I assert in opposition to this Quaker, who here discovereth himself in his own Colours, in that he denyeth that the Books of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> contain glad Tidings; what could the <hi>Devil</hi> himself utter more black and Hellish than this? Behold, Reader, with what ridiculous Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry these men can cheat their own Souls, which is so blunt, that a school-boy would be ashamed to bring it forth, and what black, and Hellish Impieties they not only swallow down themselves, but with open face avouch before the world. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if these Books, as for example, <hi>Mark</hi> ought not to be called the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and by the <hi>Gospel</hi> ought alwayes to be understood the <hi>power of God,</hi> or <hi>the essential Attribute of Gods Power</hi> (for thus they with abominable <hi>Suenchfeldius</hi> understand Rom. 1.16.) then the meaning of <hi>Mark<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> 1.1. must be <hi>the Beginning of the Power of God, of Iesus Christ the Son of God</hi>; which place, if it have any Sense thus understood, must have a black one, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Power of God. i. e.</hi> God Himself was not before <hi>Mark</hi> wrote his Book, or else, that the first Verse is a lie; let them chuse which of them they will admit.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95059:17"/>
If that Divine Counsellour preceeded not, what as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance have our Anti-revelation-adversaries of their Doctors Choice, and granting, that they have not rejected any Writing given forth by the Holy Ghost (which is a great Question) and that which they have given us, was in the main Writ by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration (which I believe) Yet how we shall be assured that in above</hi> 300 <hi>years, so many hundred Copies as were doubtless taken, should be Pure, and Vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Considering the private Dissensions, the readiness of each Party to bend things to their own Belief, with the growing and succeeding Faults of leaving out, adding, transposing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers might be guilty of, perhaps more through Carelessness than Design, is beyond Iohn Faldo</hi>'s <hi>Skil upon his principles to inform us.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By this time I have abundantly justified my Charge, having set down already so much of this blasphemous Doctrine, as I am confident, hath filled my Reader with Horrour and Indignation, if he retain but the least spark of <hi>Christianity,</hi> or love to the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> And O that while we consider these Abominations, we could mourn and tremble in Contemplation of our heavy Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, that have provocked the Holy God in his just Judgment, to let loose and permit these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical Spirits to rage abroad, and pollute the very Air with their poysonous Breath, and pestiferous Blasphemy! This last passage I should not have set down, were it not that <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> in his <hi>Vindication of his Apology,</hi> of the many scores of passages, quoted out of the <hi>Quakers</hi> own Books by <hi>Mr. Brown,</hi> to prove the blasphemousness, and absurdity of their Doctrine, in the Defence of this only, adventureth to say somewhat, I shal therefore set down what he sayeth, and refute the same: His words are. <hi>Vind. Pag.</hi> 37. <hi>But what he urgeth of this further.</hi> Pag 57. <hi>and</hi> 59.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95059:19"/>
               <hi>from the saying of some Quakers, affirming that it's not a Command to them which is given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, albeit</hi> I <hi>might justly reject it, as impertinent till he prove it, for the Reasons above Declared upon this occasion; yet because he mentions</hi> Benjamin Furley <hi>in</hi> Rotterdam, <hi>having some Knowledge of that Matter, I answer, whether will he say, All the Commands in Scripture to every Person therein mentioned, are binding upon every individual</hi> now. <hi>If he dare not, say they are, as I know he dare not, how must I then distinguish betwixt what binds me, and what binds me not? must it not be by the Spirit,</hi> (suppose it were only subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, as he will confess) <hi>enlightening the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to make the Distinction: Then it seems it is the operation of the Spirit that makes them know their Duty, and sure they cannot obey before they know.</hi> But if he say, <hi>that tho they should want that operation of the Spirit, and did not know nor acknowledge them to be their Duty, yet that they are binding upon them, neither</hi> Benjamin Furley, <hi>nor any Quaker will deny. But even the Commands of Gods Spirit, and the Precepts of the Scripture, which now concern all, are binding upon all, so that they shal be justly condemned for not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, albeit by the perversness of their hearts and Wills, they either refuse to obey, or will not acknowledge them; so that his urging of that</hi> Pag. 60, and 61. <hi>And his pleading for it, is unnecessary, and needs no Answer; yet who could say, they could obey to any advantage of their souls, without this operation of the Spirit, since whatsoever is not of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95059:19"/>
Faith is sin? But as to these words said to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by</hi> Benjamin Furley, <hi>he is challenged to prove they are his without adding, or diminishing (and it is very well known, the adding or diminishing of two or three words in a few lines will quite alter the Sense) and before he has answered this Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and freed himself from the just Censure of a Callumniator, albeit he take the help of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> Hicks, <hi>he will find his folly in accusing men at second hand proofs, and upon the Testimony of their Adversaries.</hi> Thus he. All the Reasons he gave above, why he ought not to vindicate the blasphemous Passages cited out of several <hi>Quakers</hi> were, because these Passages were cited by these that are adversaries to Quakers, such as <hi>Hicks, Stalham,</hi> and the like, who still cite Book and Page of the Quakers, where they are to be found, so truly, that this Vindicator hath not one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to give where they have dealt unfaithfully; Hence this Reason according to him proveth his Vindication unworthy of an answer, seing the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Passages is enough to Vindicate these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors from an unjust charge. Therefore let it be observed, that the whole multitude of Passages which are fraughted with Blasphemies and Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, even to the begetting of an utter detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the Principles of this party, in the hearts of all the Lovers of the Holy Scriptures, which are cited by <hi>Mr. Brown,</hi> remain without any Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Mollification, except that which rendereth the Author of this Vindication ridiculous, and the Principles of his party more abominable. But
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95059:20"/>
let us come to the Matter of <hi>Furley,</hi> of which he sayes, he has some Knowledge, we may therefore expect a sufficient Resolution about it (as for other passages of this Nature, he insinuateth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ignorance concerning them) wherefore he meriteth a sharp Censure from his <hi>Brethren,</hi> for undertaking that of which he was altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and they the note of folly, for the permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publication of the same, for in Reason we ought to suppose that they revised it. In the first place, The <hi>Dilemma</hi> wherewith he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Protection of his Brother, is altogether impertinent, and helpeth him not a whit, for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he insinuateth, that there are no subjective Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, and elsewhere clearly denyeth, that there are any, this <hi>Dilemma</hi> if it can do any thing, it will only be <hi>Argumentum ad hominem</hi>: And so according to the Quakers, men shal not be bound to obey any of the Commands of God: As for Example, to abstain from Murder except the Lord by an immediat objective Revelation, such as he gave to <hi>Moses</hi> or the rest of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> enjoined this unto them. Behold, Reader, the dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion! The abominablenesse of which maketh this Vindicator use many Shifts, and Tergiversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to varnish the same, notwithstanding of which it inevitably recurreth, and sticketh fast unto him. 2. Neither doth this <hi>Dilemma</hi> involve his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or any of the Reformed in any thing like the absurd <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> for although the subjective illumination of the Spirit be very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the true Understanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95059:20"/>
yea and of absolute necessity for such a knowledge of them, whereby we know God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in them, so that we have true Love and Fear, and Faith in him as the Effects, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of this knowledge; yet he that shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that any Reader of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> tho endued with sound Reason, only can distinguish between Commands given to a particular People, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, such as <hi>to offer Sacrifice,</hi> or to <hi>abstain from Swines-flesh,</hi> and these who bind at all times, as for example, <hi>Not to prophane the Name of God,</hi> or to <hi>honour Parents,</hi> must have abandoned the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of <hi>Reason.</hi> 3. While he alledgeth, That neither <hi>Benjamin Furley,</hi> or any other Quaker will deny, <hi>that Scripture Precepts, which concern all are binding upon all,</hi> he openly contradicteth <hi>Furley,</hi> who denyeth, <hi>that he ought to receive any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, from any man, or thing without him, yea or from the Scriptures themselves; And further denyeth without any limitation,</hi> that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ought to be called a Rule. And all this, tho most blasphemously and absurdly, yet most consonantly to the <hi>Quakers Principles</hi>: Our Vindicator, in stead of doing Service to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, notably prevaricateth their Cause, not sticking to give away their great Principles, while other shifts for defence thereof fail him. 4. What he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>without the operation of the Spirit men cannot obey to the good of their own Souls,</hi> is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, as if one should in answer to a Man enquiring, <hi>what Duties he ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to such a Superiour,</hi> tell him, what for the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95059:21"/>
time he was in case to perform, so as to reap any Advantage thereby, which would be, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb goes, <hi>falcem pro ligone dare.</hi> 5. He quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly slideth over, without so much as naming these words of <hi>Furley<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> (viz.) yea it is the greatest er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the World, that ever was invented, and the Ground of all error, to affirm, that the Scriptures ought to be a Rule to Christians</hi>: which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as it rendereth any Lover of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Word</hi> secure from being tainted with <hi>Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme,</hi> so that the palpableness of the Blasphemy is an <hi>Antidote</hi> to the Poison; in like manner, it hath rendered our Vindicator speechless, denuding him of his Shifts of <hi>Primary and Secondary Rule,</hi> under the Protection of which distinction the Quakers would fain shroud themselves: For in these words of <hi>Furley</hi> there is no mention of a <hi>Primary, or Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Rule,</hi> which without doubt <hi>Furley</hi> had made, if he had believed the Scripture to be a seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rule, seing certainly he was not ignorant that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were branded, with the name of being Enemies to <hi>Scripture.</hi> 6. In the last place our Vindicator declareth, that <hi>all he hath hitherto said,</hi> in D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>fence of <hi>Furley,</hi> was, but the patroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a very bad and indefendible Cause, in that he would fasten upon his Adversary, the Falsification of <hi>Furleys</hi> Words: For if they were falsified, why attempted he to defend them as they were, while the sense was quite altered and perverted, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth; Moreover, if those words of <hi>Furley</hi> were falsified, he was bound to have vindicated, and delivered them, as they were written by <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95059:21"/>
which doubtlesse he was in case to do, if there had been any such thing, seing he professeth that he hath Knowledge of the Matter, which he doth not professe concerning any Quaker, mentioned in his Adversaries Book: Hence it is evident that his Adversary is not at all guilty of the ignominious Epithets of <hi>Fool</hi> and <hi>Calumniator,</hi> but whether or not they light upon the Author, I leave it unto men of Judgment to consider.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From what is said, it is most evident, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> according to the Judgment of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> are in no sense, to be counted a Rule, and lay no obligation upon any to believe, and walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them. Hence <hi>William Pen</hi> sayeth, <hi>that the Spirit of God, who is God, is the alone Rule of a Spiritual Christian</hi>; (viz.) of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Life</hi>; for of that he is handling <hi>Rejoin. Pag.</hi> 76. And this the most of their Arguments, if they prove any thing, intend. As for Example, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Topick of the Quakers (viz.) <hi>That which was the Rule of the Patriarchs Faith, before the Scriptures were written, is the Rule of ours now:</hi> But I subsume that the Scriptures of the old, and New Testament were in no respect the Rule of the Patriarchs Faith. <hi>Ergo</hi> according to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, the Scriptures in no respect can be called the Rule of Faith and Manners: but finding that the grossnesse of this Doctrine bewrayeth it self, and too palpably unmasketh its abettors, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented several distinctions, under the Covert of which they might shroud themselves, and elude all the Arguments whereby the Scriptures are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95059:22"/>
proved to be the Rule of Faith and Manners: As that <hi>the Scriptures are the Verbal and Histicori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rule of Faith, which is the Devils Faith, but not of saving Faith.</hi> Thus speaketh <hi>William Pen Rejoin.</hi> Pag. 71. But that wherein they place their <hi>Sacred Anchor,</hi> or main strength is that of <hi>Adequate</hi> and <hi>Primary, inadequate or secondary Rule,</hi> asserting that <hi>the Scriptures are not the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate or compleat, and Principal Rule of Faith and Manners, but only an inadequate, in-compleat and secondary Rule,</hi> That is, that the Scriptures contain not all that we are bound to believe, or do, and that we ought to believe or practise nothing, tho never so clearly holden forth, or commanded in the Scriptures, as for example, <hi>that God sent his Son into the World,</hi> or that we ought to love God or our Neighbour, <hi>except by a miraculous Revelation from Heaven,</hi> (as <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> in his Reply to <hi>Sherlock</hi> speaketh) we be told the same thing over again: By which Revelation we ought, say they, to examine the Scriptures: And because we deny this Doctrine, and abhorre it as the Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of all errors, They cry out, that <hi>we are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Enemies to the Spirit, void of Light</hi>; upon this ground also, the Ministers that make the Scriptures the Rule of their Doctrine they call by the Names of <hi>Baals Priests, Thieves, Devils, Enemies of God,</hi> with a thousand of the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, wherefore that the State of the Controversy may appear, and our Adversaries be deprived of their lurking places, I premit this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, in order to the production of true and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95059:22"/>
saving Faith two Principles are required, First, The Declaration of the Object, or thing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or practised, which is commonly called in the Schools <hi>Objective Revelation.</hi> This may be either immediate, as it was of old to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets, and Apostles: To whom God himself immediatly did speak, and dictate his will without the Intervention of any thing; as a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> or mids, Declaring that <hi>Revelation</hi> to the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> or it may be mediat, as it was in respect of those, to whom the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> delivered it, and as it is in respect of us, for whose sake the Prophets and Apostles wrote it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. The other thing necessary for the Production <hi>of Saving Faith,</hi> is the operation or influence of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whereby the vail of natural blindnesse is removed, and the eyes of the soul, or the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are opened to know, and believe the wonderful things contained in <hi>Gods</hi> written Law, and to see these divine <hi>Characters</hi> that are imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Scriptures, and to understand the Scriptures from the Scriptures themselves: so that the Person thus savingly illuminated, attendeth to, and heartily closeth with what is delivered in the Scriptures: And this is ordinarly called <hi>Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Revelation,</hi> or more properly, <hi>Illumination,</hi> or an application of the Revelation made already, <hi>hactenus factae,</hi> as <hi>Dr. Baron.</hi> speaketh.

For the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician knoweth by his own reason, that such a Book is sound, containing true Reason, and not fallacies. This he can demonstrat by his own Reason, as the mean, and yet doth not thus argument, my own reason teacheth me so, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is so, but from reason <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> and the nature of the things contained in the <hi>Book,</hi> which by means of his own reason he seeth to be clear Truths. And again by the <hi>Book</hi> he knoweth what is sound reason, and what not. By this time, I hope we are fully freed of the Circle; in which the <hi>Romanists</hi> would fain have us entangled; being covetous of company: for I could requit them with two unextricable Circles, if time did permit.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

And indeed so it was foretold by Isaiah, for when he sayeth, my spirit which is in thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shal not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed for ever; he doth not tie the people of the Iews to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Doctrine, as if he taught them the first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but rather, that it will be the true, and ful felicity of the Church in Christs Kingdom, to be ruled no less by the voice, than spirit of God.

                  </gap>err, if there be a God in Heaven, the Books of the Old and New Testament may be evinced to have proceeded from him even to the silencing the most profligat, though sharp witted <hi>Atheists</hi>; if any such merit this epithet, whereas on the other hand <hi>They</hi> deny any <hi>Characters of Divinity</hi> ingraffed in the Word, as hath already and shal yet more appear, and thus they expose the jugular Vein of Christianity to the Heathens, and indeed the whole tendency of all their writings, and discourse, is to decry, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify these sacred Oracles, and though they deny this, to the end they may the better cheat silly Souls, I care not, for out of their own mouths and Books they shal be judged, and found guilty. These abominations are not committed in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It can be made out by the unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all the reformed Churches, which is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sufficient in the case. But many other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I could give, but these may suffice for answer to the second Objection. From all which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that between the extreams of the <hi>Papists Church,</hi> and the Quakers Spirit, <hi>medius tutissimus ibit,</hi> the midway by resolving our faith ultimately in the Scriptures, or in God speaking in them, is the safest way: And as two extream Vices never agree more in the nature of Vice, than when they reced most from Virtue lying in the middle, and therefore seemingly or physically reced from one
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95059:29"/>
another; so the greater odds that seem to be between <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> they are the more nearly relyed in error: for the Papists have gone too low, resolving their faith ultimately in men; the Quakers on the other hand, attempting to go too high, have contracted a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> hence they Ixion-like thinking to find the fair <hi>Iuno</hi> of divine Revelation, but lighting upon a cloud of their own brain, in stead thereof have procreat the strange <hi>Hippocentaurs</hi> of their monstrous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; at which the World now admires, and is amazed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our Assertion, that the Scriptures are the adequate, compleat, and primary, or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Rule of Faith, and Manners, we build on these following Arguments and first,</p>
               <p>That which was dictate, or given out by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>fallible God, and containeth the whole Counsel of God, may well serve to be our compleat, and principal Rule; but the Scriptures were given out, and dictate by the infallible God, and contain the whole Counsel of God, <hi>ergo,</hi> they may well serve to be a compleat, and principal Rule. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> is most evident, for what further certainty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we, need we, or can we seek, for what we believe or do, then the words of the most vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and unerring God? and no other thing can be understood by <hi>a compleat Rule,</hi> but that which containeth all things to be believed, or done. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove by parts, and first, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were given out, and dictat by God, is clear
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95059:29"/>
from 2 Tim, 3.16. <hi>All Scriptures are given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of God.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. <hi>Prophecy came not of old time, by the will of man, but holy men of God spake, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over our Adversaries, at least the more learned, and cautious of them have not yet adventured to deny it, but in words at least grant it. The second part is no lesse evident from Act. 20.27. Where <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth, that <hi>he had not shunned to declare to his hearers all the Counsel of God,</hi> compared <hi>with</hi> Chap. 26.22. where the same <hi>Apostle</hi> sayeth, <hi>that he taught no other things than those that were in Moses, and the Prophets</hi>: Hence it is clear, that even a part of the Scriptures, and by a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, all the Scriptures contain all that God hath willed us to believe, or do. The second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is,</p>
               <p>That which was the principal Rule to the Jews, is the principal Rule to us.</p>
               <p>But the Scriptures were the principal Rule to them.</p>
               <p>Therefore, they must be the same to us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi>; for which he pleadeth at large <hi>Apol. Cap.</hi> 2. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus, That from which the Jews might not swerve, to the right hand, or to the left, and to the decision of which they were ultimately bound to stand, in all Doubts and Controversies, and that upon highest pains, was the principal Rule. But from Gods written Law, they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to swerve, or stray to the Right hand, or left, and were bound ultimately to stand to its
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95059:30"/>
Decision in all doubts, and Controversies, and that under highest paines: Therefore to them it was the primary Rule; the <hi>Major Proposition</hi> is incontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible, The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from two most pregnant places of Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.31, 32. and 17, 9, 10, 11. In both which places by <hi>the Law</hi> is to be understood, that which God gave unto the <hi>Iews</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> in writing, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to any, that read the Texts. Which Texts have been egregiously vindicat by our Divines writing against <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and the rest of the asserters of papal infallibility: with whose shifts I am certain all that the <hi>Quakers</hi> can say will be found to co-incide. 2. This <hi>Minor Proposition</hi> is clear from <hi>Is.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law and to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: If they speak not according to these, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no light in them.</hi> The first Shift that the <hi>Quakers</hi> use to elude the force of this <hi>Scripture</hi> with, is, that by <hi>Law &amp; Testimony,</hi> is meaned <hi>the light within.</hi> So sayeth <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> in both <hi>Apology,</hi> and <hi>Vindication</hi>: but for this expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we must take their word, for none of them gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the least colour of Reason for it: But that by <hi>this Law</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are to be understood these following Texts evince, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.15. <hi>and</hi> 34.29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.24, 26. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.8. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.5. Again God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that even the King himself (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the rest of the people) <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. <hi>Should live according to this written Law, to the end, be might fear the Lord</hi>; under which all the Duties of Religion are ordinarly comprehended.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95059:30"/>
Now shal any be so stupid as to believe, when a doubt arose, that the King was not bound to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himself, to this written Law, for the discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thereof? or that, tho the Kings doubt had been most clearly discussed by the Law, he was bound to wait for a miraculous Revelation from Heaven to determine him? I say, who in his wit will believe this? yea, to think so, is to deny the immutability of <hi>God.</hi> Moreover this is by far the more frequent acceptation of the Word, <hi>Law or Testimony.</hi> Hence when the saving Work of <hi>Grace</hi> is understood by the Word <hi>Law,</hi> there is something added, whereby we may understand that the Word <hi>Law</hi> is to be taken in a more unusual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. and 8.2. But we need say no more, for they sufficiently overthrow this their Exposition, in that they give nothing for the proof thereof, except it be their own most absurd Hypothesis. But <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> hath yet another shift: he granteth that this place may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the Scriptures, and asserteth that this is only spoken to the Jews, and therefore that to them the Scriptures were a more principal Rule, than to us; and that as they were to try all things by the outward Law, so we are to try all in the first place by the word within, and accuseth his Antagonist of base disingenuity, for leaving out these words <hi>in the first place</hi>: And granteth only that the Scriptures were a more principal Rule to the <hi>Iews,</hi> but denyeth that they were the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rule. <hi>Ans.</hi> Whatever be understood by <hi>Law and Testimony</hi> in that place, whether it be the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95059:31"/>
or <hi>Spirit</hi> it must be the <hi>primary Rule,</hi> for to this Law they were ultimately bound: for the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Testimony</hi> spoken of here, was the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and Principal Rule, because whatever was spoken not according to these was to be rejected, as the product of darkness. 2. It is evident that this <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Testimony,</hi> here spoken of is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>principal,</hi> and <hi>ultimate Rule,</hi> because to seek to it, is all one with seeking unto <hi>God</hi>: The Text is, <hi>Let a people seek unto their God,</hi> viz. speaking in the Law and Testimony, which is put for one and the same thing. Hence we see that this <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Testimony,</hi> here spoken of, was the absolutely principal Rule to the Jews. In the third place, the Charge of <hi>disingenuity,</hi> that he layeth to his Adversary, is altogether groundlesse: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he, or any man else of Sense, and Reason, was bound to understand those words, <hi>In the first place,</hi> in the one branch of the Parallel, as well as in the other, otherwise his <hi>Parallel</hi> will not only hault, but prove wholly lame, and without sense; now seing as I think, he will not deny that his Adversary ought to suppose, he had to do with a Man of sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this he earnestly pleadeth: but if they were not a primary and principal Rule to them, and so but a secondary Rule only, and yet have not such a high, and principal place under the New Testament, as under the old, then they shal not be so much as a secondary Rule to us, and therefore but a tertiary only. And if this be not beside a Contradiction to the <hi>Quakers</hi> own concessions, who grant the Scriptures to be a secondary Rule, a complex of most horrible impiety, most wild and absurd nonsense that can readily be imagined, I leave to the whole Christian World to judge: from which many other wild dottages clearly flow, such as, The <hi>Spirit it self is but a secondary Rule,</hi> even altho it be a Rule; or else, that <hi>although the Church have a tertiary, yet it wants a secondary Rule:</hi> with these and many other such horrid, and most nonsensical Consequences is this Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers</hi> inseparably attended.

I answer 2dly, that the words of <hi>Christ</hi> spoken both before and at that time, were binding on the Jews, he having given sufficient proofs of his Deity; Notwithstanding of which Christ referreth them to those Writings about the divinity of which they were beyond all doubting<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:95059:34"/>
and had abundance of subjective, as well as obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive certainty: To these, <hi>I</hi> say, he referreth them as the <hi>Principal Rule,</hi> and <hi>Test,</hi> whereby to determine the great <hi>Controversy</hi> then in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I say, in a Word that the words, <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> spake, and now recorded in Scriptures, were of themselves no lesse binding on the <hi>Iews,</hi> than these spoken by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> tho the <hi>Iews,</hi> throw their wilfull <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi> which was their own great fault [the great Cause of which, was the neglect of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> which testifie of Christ] did not believe the Divinity of the one, as they did that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; hence one of the horns of this <hi>Dilemma</hi> is broken, and his consequence a meer <hi>non sequitur.</hi> He here grants, that if <hi>Christs</hi> Doctrine ought to be tried by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> then much more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Enthusiasms</hi>: But denyeth, that it will hence follow, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the primary Rule, which I prove; for if the Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> be subject to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> trial, then no man can deny, that even these things, which are divine imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat Revelations, may be brought to the Scripture trial, that we may know, whether they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or not, as well as the Jews ought to bring the Doctrine of Christ to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that they might clearly see, whether it was divine or not, seing whatever can be said for exemption of these Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from trial, with good ground; might be said for exeeming of the Doctrine of <hi>Christ.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over by granting, that privat <hi>Enthusiasms</hi> ought to be tryed by the Scripture, he yieldeth all he

Hence he would infer, that the discoverie, the <hi>Apostles</hi> had made to them upon the mount were really surer, than the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> but not so sure as the Spirit. <hi>George Keith, Truth Defended pag.</hi> 63. hath a long discourse, which resolves in this, that the Apostle is making a Comparison between Gods outward Word to the Ear, and inw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>is more sure to a man, than Gods immediat speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if it be heard with the outward ear.</hi> But such reasoning as this is as easily everthrown as invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for it presupposeth that there cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat <hi>Revelation,</hi> where the Testimony of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses goes along; And so their spirit is an enemy to sense: Otherwise why should this glorious vision made to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> of the Truth of which they had divine, and infallible evidence, to whom God spake as immediatly as to <hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount, be accounted uncertain, and suspected in respect of the <hi>Spirit?</hi> 2. To talk at this rate is to presuppose, that wherever God revealeth himself unto any person, some other way, than by speaking into his ear; that this <hi>Revelation</hi> bringeth along with it its own evidence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth the soul to embrace, and close with it, as divine, which is both groundlesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore false and contrary to their own principles, who assert, <hi>that unlesse the understanding be well disposed,</hi> Revelation, tho immediat is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. 3. It insinuateth, that the Apostle in this comparison, gave out that one of the things compared, was in it self really more uncertain than the other, which is most false, seing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in themselves, both real immediat Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Scriptures, have all certainty pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, therefore this is only to be understood in respect of us, to whom the Scriptures are more sure, in that they are lesse subject to be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, or wrested by either the Devil, or our own sancy, than immediat Revelations are. The
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95059:36"/>
                  <hi>Apostle</hi> hath also his eye upon his Countrey-men the <hi>Iews,</hi> to whom he speaketh, who tho they were now Christians, gave in special manner cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the old <hi>Testament,</hi> as <hi>Act</hi> 17.11. and else where. 4. Tho by <hi>this more sure word of Prophecy</hi> were understood <hi>immediat Revelations,</hi> the advantage that the Quakers could reap there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by could not be great: For this <hi>Word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> being studied and attended to, is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> as that whereby we may come to the genuine interpretation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Hence it will follow, even according to the Quakers exposition, that the Scriptures are the principal Rule of our Faith<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> seing that if any of the two be it, the Text to be explained, much rather than the means or helps, whereby it is to be explained, ought to have this Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; we have seen the invalidity of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as also the small advantage, tho it had been valid. We shal in the next place shew, why by this <hi>more sure word of Prophecy,</hi> we understand the Scriptures: And first, because any phrase of the like import (as for this <gap reason="foreign">

Are always taken for the Scriptures, so that when any did utter such expressions, but especially, while they discoursed of a guide in Faith and Manners, they were still understood, as speaking of the Scriptures, who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95059:36"/>
                  <hi>(I pray)</hi> ever understood that phrase <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Moses and the Prophets</hi> any other way than that Joh. 6.45. <hi>It is written in the Prophets.</hi> And indeed, if our Adversaries were not e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Who but one that would adventure u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any thing, would make this phrase, <hi>Word of Prophecy</hi> in the 19 <hi>v.</hi> to speak any other thing, than the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in the 20 <hi>verse,</hi> or simple <hi>Prophecy</hi> in the 21 <hi>verse,</hi> seing to do this, destroyeth the whole Connexion of the Context. 3. The same is evinced by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of this with the following Words, for the Apostle giveth his Reason in the 20 Verse, why in the 19 he had admonished to study the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>viz.</hi> that unlesse they diligently search, and study them, they would be ready to miss the genuine, and fall into a private meaning of the Scriptures, that is one which the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> if well attended to, would not yield. 4. The same is evinced from the general commendation given by the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to the searchers of, or attenders to the Scriptures. as <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. With many other places, which are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Commentaries to this Text: Whereas on the other hand, these our Adversaries, no lesse void of Reason, then fraughted with audacity, cannot bring one Text commanding us to search or take heed to the Light within: Add to all this, that these our Antagonists contradict the stream of

But we need not insist, for how clear soever the matter be, little Justice, Truth, or fair dealing is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at the hands of those who call Scriptures compared, <hi>Scriptures perverted,</hi> and deny that as false, the Truth of which themselves cannot but see: for I query, what difference can be imagined between these two phrases, <hi>able to make Timothy,</hi> which was a man of God, <hi>wise unto Salvation,</hi> and <hi>able to make the Man of God perfect:</hi> To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the Scriptures at this rate, <hi>I</hi> think is gross

and impious enough, and yet no better all along doth this Author treat them: Of which a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Example followeth, for <hi>Vind.</hi> pag. 41. in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to <hi>Mr. Brown,</hi> proving the sufficiency, and perfection of the Scriptures from <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.31. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.70.

                     </gap>ks written after such a time were superfluous.</hi> If this answer be sufficient, many a superfluity there shal be in Scripture, for if the writing of a Book after there are so many written as contain all things necessary for Faith and practise, (if we say) the writing of another Book, which may be either explicative of the Books before written, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain many things for the <hi>bene esse</hi> of a Christian, be superfluous, how much more then shall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the same things, in the same words, and the same method be superfluous? but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him the former is true: well then the Quakers Conclusions are, <hi>that the scriptures are Battologies.</hi> Lastly, (for we love rather to plead by the weight, than by the multitude of Arguments) we evince that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are a compleat, adequate, and primary Rule of Faith, and manners; by the Testimony of our Adversaries themselves: And first, that they are an adequat and compleat Rule is granted by R. <hi>B.</hi> who <hi>Vind. pag.</hi> 36. speaketh thus, <hi>next he carps at my saying, the chief Doctrines of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are contained in the Scriptures, asking where we may find the whole Doctrine of the Christian Faith?

And again R.

The other Branch <hi>(viz.)</hi> that they are the <hi>Primary Rule,</hi> our Adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also at unawares grant, for <hi>Rob: Barclay, in his second These,</hi> sayeth, <hi>that the Spirit is not to be subiected to the outward Testimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as a more noble Rule,</hi> where it is clear that according to him the Spirit may be subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>the Scriptures, tho not as to a more noble and certain Rule.</hi> Now this being granted, the Cause is yielded, for it is certain that a <hi>primary rule</hi> is in no case to be subjected unto its <hi>secondary,</hi> or the Rule which is ruled by it. For I think the Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> are not at all to be subjected to these of an inferiour Court. Now if the Quakers would hold by this, and grant that a man swerveth not from his duty, tho he subject all suggestions, and motions to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as a sure Tryal, and <hi>Test</hi> thereof, let them call it <hi>a more noble Rule,</hi> or what they will, they might the more easily be born with. But it is evident, by their pleading for the Spirit as <hi>their primarie Rule,</hi> that they will in no Case subject their impulses and Motions to the Scriptures.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95059:40"/>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95059:44"/>
relating to that, come particularly to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and whereas he thinks this is absurd, and not making for my Design, because God Himself is the Fountain, and yet not the Rule, he mistakes the matter as urged by me: For I argue, that the Scriptures are not the Original Ground of Knowledge, but God, not simply considered, but as manifesting himself in divine immediat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations in the hearts of his children, which being the new Covenants Dispensation, is the primary and adequate Rule of Christians: For I was never so absurd as to call God simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, or the Spirit of God, <hi>(in abstracto)</hi> not as imprinting Truths to be believed, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed in mens hearts, not contrary but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture (for he cannot contradict himself) the Rule of Christians, and this may serve to answer all his Cavills upon this Theam. Thus he. Answer, in his <hi>Apol.</hi> he thus reasoned, the Scriptures are not the Fountain, but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Fountain, therefore they are not the principal original of all Truth, nor the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate or primary Rule of Faith.</q>
Now this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, which is all one with, <hi>fallacia pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um interrogationum,</hi> hath a consequent made up of two parts, and therefore there are to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered here two consequences, of which the first, or the consequence as to the first part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference his adversarie calleth <hi>a demonstration of the Authors folly,</hi> as proving that which never man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scriptures are not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: I add that this is also a demonstration of his Malice, for in this his ridiculous argumentation he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95059:44"/>
would perswade the world, that the Reformed Churches (for against them in that place he ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his weapons) assert, <hi>that the Scriptures are God himself</hi>: Upon this account I say his Adversary accuseth him of folly; now in stead of a better off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, he giveth out that his adversary first deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Antecedent, and then again presently confessed it; whereas he never impugned the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, but blameth him for his consequence, of which (as we have already said) the first part is very ridiculous, proving the thing that never one denyed; and malicious, belieing the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, and the second part, <hi>viz. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Scriptures are not the Fountain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not the adequat and primary Rule of Faith, a Rope of sand.</hi> The coherence of which will be made out <hi>ad Calendas Graecas.</hi> He sayeth, that the second Branch of his Deduction will appear, when the Arguments, and objections relating to that, come particularly to be mentioned, which is nothing to the purpose in hand; for unless he prove, that the Scriptures are not the primary and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate Rule of Faith from this one Topick, that they are not the Fountain, but a Declaration thereof, the argument is gone. Hence all this wrangling is but a further proof of his Weakness and Malice. In his following Words, he confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the <hi>Principal Rule,</hi> and the <hi>Original Ground</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which are things most distinct; and therefore these words are altogether void of good sense, or at best they are ridiculous, in that they speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose: For he might well have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95059:45"/>
known, if he had pleased, that by <hi>the Primary Rule,</hi> is understood that which is now among the hands of Christians, according to which they ought to examine ultimately all sort of Doctrines, and opinions of men, or yet suggestions from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in concerning divine things, and reject, or receive as they disagree, or agree with this Rule. If in this sense, he had understood <hi>the primary Rule,</hi> he had not given such mysterious Niceties. But the Question is not, if <hi>God</hi> be greater than the Scriptures? for as man is above the word of a man, so is he above them; But the Question is, whether or not the Scriptures contain all things necessary in order to Faith, and practise, and whether or not we ought to see that every Doctrine we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace be according to them? and if swerving from them we ought to reject it, tho an Angel from Heaven should teach it? Thus we understand the primary Rule; and while he doth not so, he but mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh the Question. 2. This Acyrology, or improper speech, to call a person a Rule, is a grand inductive of Confusion, for who ever called a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a Rule, for only the dictats taught are the Rule. Here we see that these new Teachers are contrary to all men, in their acceptations of Words as well as in Doctrines. But whereas he sayeth, <hi>that he was never so absurd as to call the Spirit of God, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or</hi> in abstracto <hi>a Rule, but as he imprints Truths in the hearts of Believers,</hi> he doth not answer these things which he calls Cavills; for these <hi>Rules im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the Soul,</hi> are not God, under what noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on soever he be taken: a Declaration of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95059:45"/>
is not the fountain it self. Hence the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers grand principle that <hi>immediat objective Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> are the primary Rule of their Faith, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the Ground, and these imprinted Rules are but only secondary: <hi>Ergo</hi> even according to what is here gained from the Quakers, the Scriptures are equal even in their primariness, to immediat Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, for the one can no more be called the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Rule, than the other, and that by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker his own Concession. Moreover seing these <hi>immediat Revelations,</hi> imprinted on the Soul, are not the primary but secondary Rule, then certainly they ought to be examined according to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Rule. Now to assert this is most impious: Seing these Revelations must be supposed to be self evident, and their Divinity already undoubtedly apparent. For this is to maintain that we ought to doubt whether or not there is veracity in God, and <hi>(horresco referens)</hi> Judge, that the God of Truth may prove the lyar, and deceive us. But once more, how shal these imprinted secondary Rules be examined! not by other words or dictats of whatsoever kind, for to do this will cost the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer a journey to <hi>in finitum,</hi> to which he will not come in haste, seing these other Dictats or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations are not the Fountain, but a Declaration of the Fountain, more than the first; and to assert, <hi>that these Revelations may be examined according to God himself, and not by the Word of God,</hi> is to go some stages beyond the wildest of nonsense, and again there is very good Reason to wonder, why a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Revelation should be more primary than the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95059:46"/>
Scriptures, both being given by the same Spirit, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the primarinesse is not the immediatness, but the chief binding power, &amp; the prerogative to be the touch-stone of all Doctrines. Now this notion of a primary Rule being had, there is very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to wonder, why the Dictats of the Spirit should be preferred before the Scriptures, seing God hath told, (whether mediatly or immediatly, it's all one: the Quakers themselves dare not deny that God hath indeed said it) that they are <hi>able to make the Man of God wise unto salvation</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17.

Which Argument <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> attempteth to solve <hi>Vind:</hi> pag. 17. which is this,
<q>
                  <p>If since the Apostles fell asleep, and the Canon of the Scriptures was closed, all that have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to immediate Revelation, as a primary Rule, have been led by a Spirit of error, then it is not the way of Christ</p>

            </p>
            <p>To this he answers 1. <hi>that Mr. Brown begs the Question, in his presupposing, that there are no Apostles now, and that the Canon of the Scriptures is closed</hi>; against which exception I reassume the Argument thus.</p>
            <p>If since the Apostles, whose Names are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, fell asleep, and <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote the Revelation, all that pretended to this kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation have been led by a Spirit of error, then this is not the way of Christ;</p>

And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth an instance of the contrary, which is the only way to answer an Induction; In stead of which he sayeth, that he is bound to prove, that there was never one pretending to immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but he was also led of the Spirit of error, which he hath done unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

doth thus answer <hi>Dempster</hi> the Jesuite: which is an impudent falshood, for neither the Jesuits <hi>medium</hi> nor probation of his Minor, is in the least like the Argument which we now vindicate; for the Jesuits Argument was this, <hi>That Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true Religion which hath no peculiar ground, or principle to prove that it is a Religion, and conform to the true sense and letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Word of God</hi>; and <hi>he subsumes, But the Protestant Religion hath no peculiar ground,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo it cannot be a true Religion.</hi> Hence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that these two Argumentations have nothing of consanguinity; For if these two Argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had stricken alike at the two parties, against which they were framed, then the Jesuits Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should have run thus; Whosoever since the Apostles fell asleep have pretended to, or pleaded for the Scriptures as their principal Rule, have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into palpable errors and open blasphemy, so that they became marks of Gods heavy judgment. Now where should the Jesuite have found such a long Catalogue of these, as <hi>Mr. Brown</hi> hath found of deluded <hi>Enthusiasts.</hi> But which is the main thing and quite refutes the most falsly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously alledged coincidence of these Arguments, how easy should it have been to have adduced not only one instance to the contrary, but whole volums thereof, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first is, if the Scriptures through the Corruption of men, may be wrested and abused to the Patrociny of Errors and corrupt Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then altho men clearly understand, and firmly believe them, and square their Practice exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to them; Yet they are no more able to be a Rule unto them, than these Revelations can be which <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> held. The second is, He that will not admit of such Revelations as cannot be distinguished from these which led their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into the most Blasphemous Opinions, and most wicked Practices imaginable, He (I say) that will not admit of these for his principal Rule, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth unto them the Scriptures, which can both be invincibly demonstrated to have proceeded from God, and also call themselves sufficient to make one wise unto Salvation, provideth an Argument for <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Scepti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For that his Adversary called the Revelations of the Apostles &amp; Prophets uncertain; Is a most palpable Untruth, the least shadow of which cannot be found in all his Writings, except they deduce it by such unreasonable Inferences as these. And now, Reader, speak thy mind in good earnest; Thinkest thou that this man was in his wit, or to be numbred amongst Rationals, when he made these Deductions, by which their palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impieties are indeed antidots against seducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But these men have an ordinary Trick of comparing their own Revelations, of the Divinity of which they can give no Signs, to these of the Apostles, and Prophets, that were to the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Opposers, proved to be Divine; and thus give away, and betray the Christian Cause; in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to defend their own Dottages. In the

next place therefore, let us take a short view of the <hi>Quakers principal Rule,</hi> compared with ours, that it may more fully appear, which of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties provide an argument for <hi>Atheists</hi> &amp; <hi>Scepticks</hi>; And 1. We cannot know whether they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> any Revelations at all, they may be lying unto us for any thing we know, we have only their naked Word for it; whereas on the other hand, it is beyond denyal that we have the Scriptures. 2ly. It being given that they have Revelations of some kind, from whence are they? from Heaven? their own fancy? or from Hell? This we cannot know, they neither do, nor can give any mark to distinguish them from these Revelations, which all the world are perswaded to have been from Hell, or at least from a Vertiginous Fancy. Go to then, let them speak their mind, and attempt the retortion of the argument (if they dare) upon the Scriptures. They yet more fully prove, that their Revelations are not from Heaven, while they affirm that they are common to all men, which (if the experience of the World, yea, of the word of God may be judge) is most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>alie. 3ly, Making a Supposition, which will never come to a solid Position, that they have divine Revelations, we yet cannot know for what end they are given; whether to be a principal Rule or not, or whether or not through their own corruption, they do not wrest and misunderstand, or tho they do understand them, if they walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them (nothing of which can be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This Spirit, inward Light, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> for I take all for one, can never be able to determine Controversies; Seeing two different parties may both of them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce these Revelations to prove contradictory Assertions. Now Seeing neither of the parties, is in case to Evince that his Revelations are from God more than the other, the Controversie must remain for ever undetermined, Seeing they have no common principle in which they can concenter and meet. And thus standeth (for Examples sake) the case betwixt <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Ranters,</hi> agreeing in this principle of immediat Revelations, and yet (if their books be to be believed) bitter E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to one another in several points, for which both of them alledge Revelations as their grand Principle, and neither of them can evince their Revelations to have proceeded from God, more than the other. Hence we most rationally conclude that the Controversies betwixt these two parties are indeterminable, so long as they stick to this Principle. Now this Argument in no ways <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

can say, that this is through default of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, seeing our Adversaries cannot deny, but that they speak both Sense and Truth; and that when there is a real Contradiction between two, disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cocerning any Doctrine, or Sense, and meaning of any text of Scripture, this Text speaks for the one, and against the other, tho the one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, either through Ignorance cannot, or through prejudice will nor see it; and that the sense thereof may be brought forth to the light, so that there shall follow a mutual Agreement between the two dissenting parties, and consequently that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of their own Nature, are apt for the removal of differences about things contained in them. We have heard their retortion, let us now hear their direct answer, which is, that <hi>their fruits declare them to have the Spirit of God</hi>; Thus its answered in their <hi>Quakerism confirmed,</hi> to the Students of <hi>Aberdeen</hi>; For which forsooth they bring Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proof from <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15, 16. where fruits are made the Test for trying whether one be a true or false Prophet. But what fruits these thorny prickling Plants have brought, and do daily bring forth, the world is not ignorant. If to deny the Holy Trinitie, the <hi>Person</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, the resurrection of the Body, and to assert the Souls of men, yea and devils to, to be <hi>God Almighty,</hi> (of which abominations we shall ere we end this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, undeniably prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be guilty) and in a word, to vomit out their Malice, so as to endeavour the overthrow of whatsoever God in his Sacred Word hath commanded us, either to believe

               <p n="11">11ly. These Anabaptists asserted, that the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel ought not to be tyed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of Scriptures; that all in the Church ought to speak by turns, that which they judged the Spirit offered unto them</hi>: that <hi>the Ministers ought to have no certain Stipend,</hi> and many other things of this sort, <hi>Bulling.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 8. which is at this day the known Doctrine of <hi>Quakers.</hi>

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:95059:58"/>12ly. These Anabaptists denied <hi>that a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to be a Magistrat, or in any case make war; to take or administrate oaths,</hi> to trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man upon the account of his Religion, or to prohibite any kind of Religion; In all which points, the Quakers exactly jump with them; for tho they do not in words deny the lawfulness of Magistracy, yet seeing they expresly deny the lawfulness of all Wars, and Oaths, and maintain an unbridled Liberty, to do whatsoever is right in a mans own eyes, all which is their known Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, by most clear consequence, they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all use of Magistracy and Magistrates.</p>
               <p n="13">13ly. <hi>Anabaptists</hi> with <hi>Servetus</hi> and the <hi>Socinians</hi> spake contemptibly of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and denied <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi>; but the <hi>Quakers</hi> have gone a further length, not only denying, but railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst both <hi>Sacraments,</hi> labouring by might and main, to abolish these pledges of the Love of God out of the World, I could easily prove the sameness of the Doctrine of the <hi>Muncerian Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> with that of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars: But at present these may serve to shew, that both of them are acted and guided by the same Spirit; which is that at present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by us.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. If the Spirit, or the light within every man; were the Supreme, and principal Rule, then those who persecuted to death the Apostles, and Saints of God did not sin in so doing; but I am sure the latter is false, <hi>Ergo</hi> the former. The
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95059:58"/>
Consequence of the Major is most evident, for they followed their light within, thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they did God good service, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.2. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they say, that then the day of all these persecutors visitation was past; for <hi>Paul</hi> himself was one of them, whose light taught him, that he according to all that he had for light ought to do many things against the Professors, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts.</hi> 26.9. whose day of visitation <hi>I</hi> think the <hi>Quakers</hi> themselves will not say was expired.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Divine light, or that light which is of God is alwayes consonant to it self; but so is not that which the <hi>Quakers</hi> call their spirit, or the light within every man; for nothing is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than that the light within one man, is quite contradictory and opposite, to that within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that even in the most weighty, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and soul-concerning things in all the world; as the many and great controversies in all ages, do but too too well make out: neither can it be said that every one of these who oppose the truth, either act against their own judgment, or that sometime before they knew and embraced the Truth in their heart, and afterward did not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to that light: this we say cannot be said; for it is clear from the earnestness, and zeal of both <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> for their own erroneous Principles, that they really think as they speak: yea have not many sacrificed their lives, to their own fantastick and damnable Opinions, which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions from the very beginning of their use of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95059:59"/>
Reason, they did still hold; but not to multiply instances, all this is clear in the Person of <hi>Paul,</hi> for certain it is, that when he persecuted the Church, he both acted according to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that he always was of that judgment, and never counteracted his light within, and tho he confessed that he did it out of ignorance, yet this will not help them, for certainly this was all the light he had, if we may believe himself, and therefore he never had a true light within, until the day of his miraculous conversion.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. This Principle viz. <hi>That if every man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his light within, he cannot stray from the Truth,</hi> overthroweth the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are many Nations in the world, of which I believe, the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> will not say, that they have now more than sufficient Grace to bring them to Salvation, <hi>Ergo</hi> if all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had lesse under the Old Testament, than these nations have now, they had not sufficient Grace<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 3ly. The context evinceth our purpose, for the witness of God there spoken of, is only the common benignity of Providence, <hi>viz.</hi> fruitful seasons, food and gladness, from which indeed they might have gathered, that there was a God, but was this grace alone sufficient to bring them to Salvation? this, <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> must either say, or else that the Apostle had not wit enough to speak to the purpose, for he might have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned this sufficient Grace, and Light, as a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God in their hearts, and told them that this Light within would have led them to Heaven, if they had pleased, whereas contrariwise, he telleth them no such guide, but that they were permitted to walk in their own wayes, and the same Apostle telleth the Gentiles, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.12. That they were without Christ: And yet in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to this, the <hi>Quakers</hi> maintain, that these Gentiles had the <hi>Light of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> within them. This Answer of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> I have set down and refuted, because it is all one in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95059:60"/>
with that which the <hi>Quakers</hi> use to give to this and the like Texts.</p>
               <p n="7">7ly. Our next Argument we deduce from Ephes. 2.12, and 4.8. Thus, <hi>These who are without Christ, aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel, strangers to the Covenants of Promise, have no hope, are without God in the World, have their understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings darkened through the blindness that is in them, being alienated from the life of God, and have blind Hearts, and are past feeling</hi>; add to these, 2 Tim. 2.26. That some are taken captive by the Devil at his will. Now these that are in this case, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have Grace and light sufficient to Salvation: But the Gentiles are said here to be in this sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; <hi>Ergo</hi> they had not sufficient Grace and Light. The <hi>Major,</hi> which can be only questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Spirit of God hath in these places invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly corroborat, by rejecting all the Shifts, and quibles that <hi>Iesuits</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> are able to feign.</p>
               <p n="8">8ly. This Doctrine of the Quakers is clearly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown by these Scriptures. Amos. 3:2, <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He sheweth his Word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iacob, his Statutes and Iudgments to Israel, he hath not dealt so with any Nation: as for his Iudgments they have not known them; Praise ye the Lord.</hi> What can be more clear, than that these to whom God did not give his Word, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Judgments, never had a light sufficient to guide them unto Salvation? &amp; yet the <hi>Quakers, Quakerism confirm</hi>: pag. 2. who without all shame

or conscience, care not what they deny, or what they affirm, providing they can find words to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or not to the purpose, all is one, have the confidence to deny it: Their reasonlesse Reason is because in John 1.5. its said, that <hi>the light shined in darkness</hi>: For who but a <hi>Quaker</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from these words, in which the <hi>Evangelist</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth, that Christ is the true God, who in all ages manifested himself in some measure to the world, by which manifestation of God in the Works of Creation and Providence, the world might perceive indeed that there was a God, but could not notwithstanding comprehend God, so as to see and perceive that God the Creator, should in the fulness of time, cloath himself with mans Flesh, and become the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> for to this kind of Knowledge and Comprehension, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and divine Light was necessary; now (I say) who but a <hi>Quaker</hi> will from this in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in order to Salvation; the Knowledge of which can never be evinced that all men had, or have, therefore it is most groundlesse to assert, that all men have a sufficient light to guide them to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, to which Robert Barclay replyeth, that <hi>the knowledge of these things is only necessary</hi> necessitate praecepti, <hi>that is, because they are commanded us; not</hi> necessitate medii, i. e. <hi>in plain English, That Faith in Iesus Christ, the knowledge of the Distinction of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or that Christ is God and Man</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is not needful in themselves to be known, or believed in order to Salvation</hi>; but how little soever respect he hath to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he ought to have had some care and consideration of his own Doctrine, for his first These is, these words John 17.3. <hi>this is eternal life</hi> &amp;c. where it is plainly asserted without any distinction, or limitation, that the Knowledge of the Father and the Son, as one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and one that is sent, and therefore distinct the one from the other, is called <hi>eternal life</hi> it self, i. e, (if any thing) a mean so necessary to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, as that without this knowledge it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained. Moreover, the very Notion of Faith (without which none can be saved) implyeth nothing lesse than a closing with God through Christ, and therefore necessarily, and of its own nature, and not with a respect to a command only, presupposeth the knowledge of the distinction of Father and Son, and of the Divine and Humane Nature of Christ, held forth under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as one to be incarnate in the fulness of time;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95059:62"/>
and in the New Testament as actually incarnate, and really and in due Time come in the Flesh.</p>
               <p n="9">9ly. Before I come to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Objections, I will overthrow one other of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, upon which the whole Fabrick of <hi>Quakerism</hi> is builded; which is, That <hi>in fallen man, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no reliques of the Image of God, and that by the fall, his understanding is so darkned, that he cannot by all the Light of Conscience, reason, and common notions, perceive or gather, from all or any of the works of creation and providence, that there is a Sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="10">10ly. The falshood of this Doctrine, we evince by these following arguments; and 1. It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable how one can be rational, and yet not be in case to infer from all the works of Creation, that there is a supream cause and beeing; we say this is not imaginable except to a <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Quaker,</hi> who can imagin, at least say, they can imagin what they will. Now the <hi>Quakers, Quakerism confirm</hi>: pag 3. Grant that <hi>Conscience and Reason, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the saving Light of Christ, in all men, and the Revelation thereof as a natural and super-principle natural, are distinguished.</hi> Well then, seing reason is natural, and man is rational, how can he, if he but contemplat these admirable Works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Providence, and exercise his reason in so doing, not conclude that these are the Product of an Infinit and Omnipotent Creator, who is to be Loved, Feared, and Adored? which thoughts of themselves or as to the substance of the Action are certainly good, and more Laudable than the <hi>Quakers silent waiting,</hi> which differeth nothing from sleeping, although they place a principal part of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship therein.</p>
               <p n="11">11ly. Secondly, whatever is in man, and common to all Mankind, is natural, but some sparks of the knowledge of a Deity, as also some thoughts and desires that are good in themselves, as for example, the desire of self-preservation, are in man, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all mankind; <hi>Ergo</hi> some Relicts of the knowledge of God, and thoughts that are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95059:63"/>
really good, are natural. The Major is most evident, for I defy all the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> in the world, to give one Instance to the contrary: the Minor is no lesse undenyable, seing there is no nation in the world, tho never so barbarous and inhumane, who hath not some notions of a Deity, and desire to preserve themselves. But I know the <hi>Quakers</hi> dare not deny it, otherwayes they will overthrow all their <hi>universal Grace,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> by them pleaded for.</p>
               <p n="12">12ly. Thirdly, that which is originally born with every one, and groweth up to more and more maturity, as he in whom it is, groweth up, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly natural; But some remainders of the knowledge of God are Originally, i e. in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and inclination (as they speak) born with man, and grow up to more and more maturity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the growth of him, in whom they are, <hi>Ergo</hi> they are natural. The Major is beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie: The Minor therefore they can only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which yet is no lesse clear than the major; for they grant that some things that respect natural Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the prudent management of the affairs of the world, are not supernatural; See the fore-cited Vindication page 52. But certain it is, that some sparkles of the knowledge of a Deity, are as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and appear as early as these things which they deny not to be natural.</p>
               <p n="13">13ly. Fourthly, That which is common to Devils, is not supernatural; but to know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there is a God, which is of it self a good thought, is common to devils. To this <hi>Robert
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95059:63"/>
Barclay</hi> Vind <hi>pag</hi> 51. answers, That <hi>once the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils had this knowledge from a spiritual nature, and tho they have fallen, yet they mey retain the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it: for that their Fall and mans is every way alike, none will affirm.</hi> But surely if he had not willfully closed his Eyes, that he might not see the Truth, he might have clearly perceived this to be a most pitiful prevarication, for what tho the fall of Angels, and the fall of Man, were not in all respects alike, can any man not altogether void of reason, conclude thence; that the thing which is common to devils with men, can be supernatural, or Grace in the one more than in the other? Again, Surely there is no reason in the world to say, that the devils retain their Memory, more than their understanding; For certainly the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is altogether as essential, if not more, to the rational creature, as the memory. Moreover, to say that the devils retained no knowledge of God, but the bare remembrance that they had knowledge of God, is compleatly to contradict the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> asserting chap 1.19. that <hi>the devils believe that there is one God and tremble</hi>; for to believe a thing, in the judgement of all men, presupposeth some knowledge thereof, and can be no more called an Act of the memory, than tasting can be called seeing, which is performed by the Eye; or Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that which is performed by the Ear. Again, presupposing, which is possible, though not true, that the Devils had no memory of their knowledge of God, It is beyond all doubt, that these active, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious, and skilful Spirits in the works of Nature,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95059:64"/>
can easily conclud from these admirable Effects, that there is <hi>a Supream Cause, first beeing,</hi> the Creator of all things: Now to say, that they can know that there is one God, and conclud from the works of Creation and Providence, that this God is most powerful, most wise &amp;c. and yet to say that they have no principle of knowledge, whereby they can know this, is to assert that there is a Sream without a Source, or a Tree without a Root, or a Beam without the Sun. Lastly, If the Devils have only the memory of their knowledge of God, and yet believe that there is a God and tremble, then we may infer, that our first Parents, before the promise of the Messiah was made unto them, had no Divine Light, or Seed left in them, contrary to <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s beleif <hi>Vind pag</hi> 49.

much concerned, let them use what Arguments they will to prove it; we being certain, that whatever arguments can prove this, will equally serve to prove whatever entereth into any mans fancy; yet I will propose, and enervat these of their arguments which seem to be most strong, and plead most for them. One of which is proposed by <hi>George Keith, Truth-defend</hi>: pag 87. <hi>A Divine Law in all men is an in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward immediat Dictat, but there is a Divine Law in all men.</hi> Of this Argument singled out of all that ever <hi>George Keith</hi> wrote, as the choicest Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peice, to uphold <hi>Quakerism,</hi> and overthrow the authority of the Scriptures, he is so confident, that by it alone, he thinketh to strike the Cause dead; But he is hugely mistaken<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for if by a divine <hi>Law,</hi> he understand any other thing beside Conscience, and Reason, which he himself, together with his Brother <hi>Rob: Barclay: Quakerism confirm</hi>: pag 3. acknowledgeth, to be only natural. We deny his Minor, the proof of which we expect <hi>ad Kalendas Graecas</hi>; And thus the great Argument of one of the greatest Champions of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> evanisheth into smoak at the very first handling thereof. 2ly. <hi>Rob: Barclay. Vind</hi> pag 39. thus reasoneh, <hi>what if I should say, is not God a Light? And is not he in every man? and is not this Light within the increated Spirit?</hi> The Reader may here observe, that this Author is diffident of this Argument, and fearful to bring it forth; and good reason he hath; for by this reason he only evinceth, that which he elsewhere by all means endeavoureth to evite, <hi>viz,</hi> that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Grace, and Light, is common to

Devils and damned Souls,, for God can no more be said to be in every Son and Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, than in these wicked Spirits, if he think othewayes, let him essay the proof of it. 3ly. For the sufficiency of their universal Light, they thus argue: <hi>That which we sin in not obeying, is sufficient to Salvation; but in not obeying the Light within, we sin, therefore it is sufficient to Salvation.</hi> But this Sophism is too palpable, and gross to take with any that is not altogether willing to be deceived; for the Major proposition thereof is most false, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the lawful commands of every Parent, Heathen, as well as Christian, should be a sufficient guide to Salvation, for disobedience to these, is as really a sin, as disobedience to our own Light. 4ly. To prove that there is a Divine Light purchased by Christ, in every man, they adduce <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>That was the true Light, which enlightneth every man that cometh into the world</hi>: for Vindication of which place it shall suffice to overthrow what <hi>Rob: Barclay</hi> hath said in the <hi>Vindication</hi> of his <hi>Apology</hi> pag 91. For the confirmation of the <hi>Quakers</hi> gloss on this text: of which Mr: <hi>Broun, Quaker: path way to Pagan</hi>: pag 151, 152, 153, 154. had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven diverse expositions, as 1. <hi>that Light may be here taken for the Light of reason,</hi> 2ly.

Christ,</hi> be supernatural, and the incomprehensible God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet these little Beams or Sparks of Reason and Conscience which are the Effect and Gift of this great Ligh, Christ the Son of God, and Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Trinity, no lesse than of the Father and Holy Ghost, are altogether natural and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Many places of Scripture beside this they detort and deprave, to the end that by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselves they may destroy the Scriptures, and prove that the light within, (which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pitifully deluded, take for the Spirit of God,) is the Supream Rule of Faith and Manners; all which glosses fall to the ground, tho upon this one Account, that they have couched in them, this

most dangerous and blasphemous falshood <hi>viz.</hi> that the dim and dark Light of nature, is not only suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to guide us to Salvation, but (which ought to be heard with horror) is God himself. One of which Scriptures is John 14.26, 27. and 16.13. whence they would infer that all Believers are led by immediat objective Revelation, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were, because (say they) <hi>the way that the Apostles were taught, which is by immediat Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is there holden forth as common to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Answ. true it is that even in these dark times, there was in some respect viz. of immediate Revelations, more of God, than there is now, and yet lesse in another sense, viz. in respect of more large propagation of the Truth of God, and of the large Measure of Grace dispensed unto Believers under the <hi>New Test</hi>: But what say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this to the probation of the <hi>Quakers</hi> tremulous consequence? how doth it prove, that because some few had these Revelations, all and every one within the Church had them? this is <hi>a baculo ad angulum,</hi> neither are we bound to prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>affirmanti enim incumbit probatio</hi>: It is enough for us to tell him, that it is a groundless fancy to assert it, for how will he prove; ex. gr. that ever <hi>Abel</hi> had immediate objective Revelation? and thus the

But we need add no more, seing <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> in the place just now cited, after several serpentine windings and turnings, to the end he may (tho he retain the thing yet) evite the Name, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejecteth <hi>Augustin,</hi> and therefore give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h up the Cause, ridiculously enquiring at his Adversary, <hi>if he will assert every thing that Augustin said,</hi> ridiculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (I say) seing the question is, if <hi>Augustin</hi> did not hold our Doctrine anent Original Sin, as the <hi>Antithesis</hi> to that of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> in this point, which <hi>Pelagians</hi> have had many successors, tho known by other Names, as <hi>Socinus,</hi> and his School, and holy and pure <hi>Anabaptists</hi> (as they called themselves) and were by contrariety of speech, called by others, the Fry of a deluded <hi>Enthusiast, Thomas Muncer</hi>; The horrid abominations of which Sect, and this their Doctrine of Original Sin among the rest, that famous reformer <hi>Bullinger,</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:95059:77"/>
hath by Scriptures and Reason, so hammered, that one in reason should have thought, that it should never have had a Resurrection, as may be seen Lib: 1. <hi>cap</hi> 11. <hi>adversus Anabaptistas,</hi> where he also to purpose vindicateth <hi>Zuinglius</hi> from the calumny of the denyal of Original Sin, wherewith first the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> although contrary to their own Light, as judicious <hi>Soave</hi> observeth, and of late <hi>Rob: Barclay,</hi> both in his <hi>Apology and Vindication,</hi> hath traduced him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Altho this Doctrine hath by many Ages been assaulted most fiercely, by corrupt men, both of subtile wit and earnestness of Intention, yet the providence of God hath sufficiently pre-occupied, what they have said or can say, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified all who truly believe what God hath said in His Word, where there is good Store both of Sword and Buckler, for managing of this War; and of these many I shall here excerpt and vindicate a few. And First, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>For in the Day thou Eatest thou shall surely Die,</hi> or Dying thou shalt Die, where is a clear proof of our Doctrine, whence we reason, as well against <hi>Pelagians, Anabaptists, Socinians</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> as against the <hi>Papists,</hi> who deny Original sin in Infants after Baptism; Thus: Infants Die, <hi>Ergo</hi> they are guilty of Original Sin, seeing according to this present Text<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Death is the punishment due to the breach of the Command. To this the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> as <hi>Augustin</hi> in several plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and particularlie <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 899-tom 4. colum. 666. And the <hi>Socinians,</hi> as <hi>Pareus</hi> on the place sheweth, with other Enemies of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95059:77"/>
and at this day the <hi>Quakers</hi> answer, <hi>that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death is not included in this Threatning</hi>; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> were anathematized for this doctrine by one Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 224 Bishops <hi>Photius Biblioth. Colum.</hi> 42. This answer is evidently false, seeing that by this word <hi>(Death)</hi> frequently in Scripture, Bodily as well as Spiritual, is understood, and by the Phrase, <hi>to die the Death,</hi> the separation of Soul and Body is frequently holden forth: Moreover none can deny that Bodily Death of it self is an evil, and no evil could have befallen Mankind persevering in the State of Innocency; But <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.19. Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundantly dissolve all doubts about the meaning of the text to any unbyassed Men: Where God himself, describing the punishment of Adams trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, denounce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>h and foretelleth his return to the dust, as not the least part thereof. But we need not multiply reasons for the vindication of this text, seeing none, except <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Pelagians,</hi> oppose our meaning thereof, and the reason ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by our present adversaries, common to them with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and in particular <hi>Crellius,</hi> for its overthrown, in strength excelleth not a cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web, although they pitched upon it, as the only weapon, which had any Teeth or keenness therein<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> The reason is, <hi>Adam died not that day that he did eat, therefore</hi> (say they) <hi>Bodily death is not Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the threatning</hi>: Neither hath this reason any stronger nerves than the rest used by <hi>Pelagians</hi> &amp; <hi>Socinians,</hi> which yet for ought any thing I can find, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not use, judging them (as it seems)

unfit to serve their turn; Therefore <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> tho he had <hi>Apolog:</hi> chap 4. Fought with this Reason as the only prop of his cause; his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary chap. 5. num. 8. Having hewed it in pieces) in his <hi>Vindication</hi> essayeth not the reinforcement thereof, only Sect. 5. num. 3. In stead of a Vindication hath its repetition, adding, that death as it is now circumstantiated with Sickness and the like miseries, is a consequence, but not a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, which distinction is most Blasphemou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, as here it is made use of, seing it insinuateth that God Transgresseth his own Law, by inflicting more miserie on fallen man, than was denounced in the Threatning. Either this he must say, or else that Sickness, and Death, as they are now circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, are not inflicted by God, which <hi>I</hi> am sure is little better than the former. But to shut up all, he sayeth, <hi>that his Adversarie hath not said enough, to proselyte him to his Opinion,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he had so d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>shed his reason, upon which it was builded, that the <hi>Quaker</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Restauration thereof: He addeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a reason why his Adversary had not said e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to proselyte him, <hi>that death to Adam in the state of Innocency should have been a pleasure &amp; not a pain</hi>; which reason is altogether reasonlesse, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reason why death is pleasant to any, is its being the port to free Men from all evil, &amp; especially from Sin, without which Adam should have wholly remained, if he had persevered in his integrity; but it is too evident, that the <hi>Quaker</hi> is of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> mind who <hi>de Statu primi Hominis,</hi> alledgeth that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95059:78"/>
               <hi>man during his Integrity was not free of concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and evil inclinations</hi>; which doctrine maketh God the Author of sin. But I leave this matter, only I cannot but here observe, which I might do in most places and weightiest points of <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay's Vindication</hi>; that <hi>per fas aut nefas</hi> (as they say) the <hi>Quakers</hi> must have the last words<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for who will think it requisite to write after one, who can tell his Adversary that he hath not said enough to proselyte him, and yet never so much as essay to vindicate his own, or remove his adversaries rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> doth here, and yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes his book to the world, as a sufficient answer or refutation of what his adversarie had said, living in the mean time without so much as an attempted vindication, these points with which the whole frame of <hi>Quakerism</hi> standeth and falleth; for if Bodily death was included in the threatning, then our doctrine of Original sin is proved, which doctrine once being evinced, all the pretended absurdities and blasphemies, which <hi>Socinians, Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and others infer from our Doctrine of Original sin and Reprobation, fall to the Ground, and they are, if they be Christians, obliged to remove these themselves. Further its clear from Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of sin is Death,</hi> where death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception of any kind of death is called the wages, not the consequence only of sin, as the <hi>Quaker</hi> both in his <hi>Apology</hi> and <hi>Vindication</hi> Sect. 5. num. 8. in contradict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>on to the express Text, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it; neither is his reason more weightie, than his exposition is sound, which is, <hi>that the whole
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95059:79"/>
Creation received a decay by Adams fall, and yet Herbs and Trees are not to be called sinners,</hi> seeing the Apostle is not here speaking of herbs and trees, but of Men Women who are capable of receiving the wages of sin, as being the workers thereof, and certainly one may with the like reason, say that H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rbs and Trees are capable of eternal life as that they may be capable of the wages of Sin. His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shift which he hath <hi>Ibid:</hi> by which also he destroyes the former, viz. <hi>that by death is not to be understood Bodily Death, because Eternal Life is put as the Opposite of the death here spoken of, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ Iesus, and yet natural death is not avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> is not much better then the former, seeing that after the resurrection, the Bodies of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, shall live as well as their souls, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of both doth belong to Eternal Life, and so natural Life is comprehended in Eternal Life, as well as Spiritual Life; and tho believers die a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Death, yet it is not a punishment to them, on this account that the Sting and Bitterness thereof is removed by Christ, who did bear the same, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise death is in it self a punishment, being the separation of Soul and Body, the most strictly united friends and companions in the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3ly. Our Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin</hi> is clearlie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from Rom. 5.12. <hi>As by one Man, Sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the World and Death by Sin,</hi> &amp;c. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the following verses; whence diverse strong arguments may easily be collected, for 1. The Apostle that he may prove justification not to be by works but by Faith, or the imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95059:79"/>
of Christ; maketh a comparison betwixt the two common Heads or Representatives, Adam and Christ, in this, that both of them represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the parties related to them, the same way, so that Adam was a Type of Christ in his standing in the room of one partie as Christ did in the Room of another, <hi>by bearing of their Iniquities</hi> Isa<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 53.11. By <hi>being made sin for them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. (i. e.) by Imputation thereof unto him, for no otherwise this text can be understood without Blasphemie; <hi>that they may be made the Righteousness of God in Him,</hi> i. e. by imputation of it to them, as their Sin was imputed to him; Therefore Adam the Type, stood in the name and Room of Mankind, so as his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or failings were imputed to them. <hi>Robert Barclay Vindication,</hi> Sect. 5. numb. 7. Alledgeth that this comparison spoileth all our doctrine, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if the Righteousness of Christ is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to men for Iustification, untill they actually joyn with it apprehended by Faith, so neither is the unrighteousness and disobedience of Adam, imputed to Men for Condemnation, untill they actually joyn with it.</hi> But I wonder not to see a man intending by right or wrong to Stick to his preconceived o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, make use of Fig-leaf defences, when he can find no other: For may not Children before they come to the use of Reason, be justified and Saved by the Righteousness of Christ imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and by consequence, others before the use of reason stand guilty of Adams sin imputed to them, which is the Conclusion he fain would evite. Moreover he may as well say, that Adams Sin doth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95059:80"/>
not at all hurt any of his posterity, untill they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the use of reason, actually joyn with it, which yet he no where sayeth, but granteth the contrary in several places of this Section. 3ly. <hi>Omne simile claudicat,</hi> this parallel ought not necessarily, to be stretched to every particular mode and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, but only to the particular which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here, viz. the Imputation of what the two common representatives did or suffered, unto the parties represented by them; but the <hi>Quakers</hi> have Learned <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> Art, who by racking of this Parallel thought to overthrow our Doctrine of Justification by faith. 2. The Sin of Adam is such, that if this Text have any sense at all, by this Sin of his, all have sinned, and by it Death without exception is brought upon all Mankind. 3. It is such a sin of which they are guilty who have not sinned after the similitude of Adam, seeing death reigned over them, for death can reign over none but Guilty persons, but Infants are subject to Death, tho they have not sinned after the similitude of Adam, i. e. by actual transgression, Ergo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are guilty of Adams sin. 4. This Offence of Adams was of such a nature, that the Guilt of it, or judgement flowing therefrom, came upon all the partie represented by him, to the condemnation thereof, i. e. (if it be any thing) so that this party stood really condemned thereby. v. 18. But all Mankind were represented by Adam, Ergo all Men are condemned by the sin of Adam imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them: To this <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> answereth Vind. pag, 101. <hi>That Iudgment or Guilt is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95059:80"/>
in the Original,</hi> which is true, but while he sayeth, <hi>it ought not to be supplied,</hi> one would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he should give a better answer, which <hi>I</hi> looked for; but all that he giveth, <hi>is an individuum vagum</hi> [Something] which supplement denudeth the Text offense, making a <hi>Welshmans</hi> hose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; therefore certainly there can be no other thing understood, but either <hi>Iudgement,</hi> as our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath it, or <hi>Condemnation,</hi> as the version of Tremellius out of the <hi>Syriak,</hi> or <hi>Guilt,</hi> as <hi>Beza:</hi> Seeing the effect thereof was the condemnation of the whole party represented by Adam, as the Text clearlie sheweth. But to declare his Harmonie with <hi>Rome</hi> he followeth the <hi>Versio Vulgata,</hi> which in this place hath non-sense supplying nothing. From all that is said, I argue thus, that sin which is described to us by the Apostle, that he saith brought death upon all Men, that men Sinned by it, and were made Sinners, even they who could not as yet actually sin, that they all became Guilty of Death and condemnation; that Sin by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the sin of the whole Nature, included in Adam, and rendreth the whole nature obnoxious to death and condemnation; but the first Sin of Adam is thus described to us by the Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ergo, that sin is the sin of Nature, <hi>&amp;c. Robert Barclay</hi> denyeth the Major of this argument, and that to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all <hi>Logicians,</hi> seeing no connexion can be clearer in the World, as might easily appear to any that consider it; for who can deny (not to mention other Members of this Argument) that if these who had not actually sinned, are made sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95059:81"/>
by this Transgression of Adam, then this is the Sin of the whole Nature, or imputed to it, which is our Doctrine of Original Sin; who I say will deny this? Seeing there is no other thing in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence then in the antecedent, except a variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of words and Phrases holding forth the same thing, which yet cannot be counted a <hi>Tautology</hi> in strict Syllogistical a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He may as well say, that these received hurt and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by the sin of Adam, who could receive it, i. e. actually join themselves to it, for there is alike reason for both.

That Adam was a publick person, standing and falling in the Room of his posterity, in whose name and behalf, the Covenant of works was made with him as their representative, so that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95059:82"/>
his first sin was not personal, but the sin of the whole Nature: To this <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> replyeth num<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 6. requiring Mr. <hi>Brown to prove by plain Scriptures, that Adam ceased to be a publick person after he had committed his first sin.</hi> Answer, he denyeth not, if this be proved, but that our Doctrine of Original sin will stand, for so much he here insinuateth; I therefore with the more chearfulness prove, that Adam did cease to be a publick person, which is evident from this, that he died in that day he did eat, and therefore made the Covenant void and null, now certainly no Man with reason can say, that a Man dead in Law, as Adam was after the breach of the Covenant by eating, can in his future actions be a publick person, in respect of the same Law broken by eating; Therefore seing the day he did eat, did put a term to this Covenant of Life (as no man with reason can deny it) and a period to this common headship, for the one of these standeth and falleth reciprocallie with the other; it is clear and manifest to all, that Adam after his fall was no more a publick person. Moreover the sin of Adam whereby we were damnified, is still holden forth as one, and not as many sins; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample Rom. 5. All along in the comparison betwixt Christ, and Adam.</p>

               <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> replyeth, <q>that we may as well hence conclude; that we are only justified by the first act of Christs obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and so have nothing to do with Christs death and sufferings.</q>

Where he granted <hi>Augustin to be of the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his Adversary, acknowledging that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mind of Augustin, Infants even before their birth are Guilty of Eternal Death, and the pains of Hell.</hi> Thus he either speaketh self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,

or would make <hi>Augustin</hi> to do it. 2.
The words of <hi>Augustin,</hi> from which he would conclude this self contradiction are these <hi>Serm.</hi> 7. <q>
                  <hi>Ex verb. Apostoli,</hi> what do ye think to say? And whose eares can hear it? Did they sin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? Where I pray you did they sin? When and how did they sin? They know neither good nor evil. Shall they sin that are under no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Prove that Infants are sinners, prove what is their Sin, is it because they weep, that they sin? Do they Sin, because they take pleasure, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell trouble by motion, as dumb Animals? If these motions be sin, they become greater sinners in Baptism, for they resist most vehemently. But I say another thing.

Thus <hi>Augustin</hi> in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who to evite the force of the arguments of the Orthodox proving Original sin, did assert, <hi>that Children presently after their birth become actual Sinners.</hi> And yet from this the <hi>Quaker</hi> will conclude that <hi>Augustin</hi> in these words contradicteth his own doctrine of Infants being guilty of Original Sin; of which there is not the least appearance, seing this will be admirable <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> to inferr from <hi>Augustin</hi> his proving of Infants not to be guilty of actual sin, therefore he denyed them to be guilty of Original sin: Now what wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is the Person of some other, and so of the rest, which is absurd, to the which Argument, not as mine, but really</hi> Augustin's, <hi>I leave</hi> Joh. Alexander <hi>to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> Thus <hi>George Keith. Ans.</hi> It seemeth that the Intent of the <hi>Quaker</hi> is, to fasten a false Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction on <hi>Augustin</hi>; for none ever used the word <hi>Person,</hi> in Application to the Holy Trinity, more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than <hi>Augustin</hi> hath done, as is obvious to any, that hath but a little acquaintance with his Works. And <hi>de Trinit. Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap</hi> 8.
He as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth <q>that the Latine Fathers, yea, and these of greatest Authority among them, still used the word <hi>Person,</hi> as the most fit that could be imagined, for the expressing of this Holy Mystery.</q>
To whom he assenteth both in this place, and else where, in the same Books, Cited by <hi>George Keith.</hi> We may hence see, what the drift of the <hi>Quaker</hi> is, even to render both the Persons and Doctrine of the choicest Champions of Christ, odious and contemptable, by making them speak self-contradictions, and that in these very points, anent which, if the Body of the Christian World be not grosly deceived, they were of all men, most Orthodox. 2. This same Father, <hi>de Doctrina Christi.</hi> Lib 1. Cap 5. Alledgeth, that the word <hi>Causa,</hi> cannot sufficiently enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to God. And Cap 6. That the word <hi>Deus,</hi> is not fit enough, whereby God can be expressed. Sure <hi>I</hi> am, that in both these Books, mentioned by the <hi>Quaker,</hi> he saith nothing whereby we may conclude, that he is more disliking the word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> than the word <hi>Causa,</hi> or <hi>Deus.</hi> But shall I think, that <hi>George Keith</hi> judgeth, that according to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95059:95"/>
the mind of <hi>Augustin,</hi> God is not the Creator, or first cause of all things? And that we sin in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing him by the Name of God? <hi>I</hi> do not think that the <hi>Quaker</hi> will assent to this, and yet no more Reason hath he to say, that according to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi> it is dangerous to say, that there are three Persons in the Trinity. For the main Reason why he thinketh that there is some inconsistency in the word (Person) for the full expressing of that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible Mystery, he giveth <hi>de Trinit. Lib</hi> 7. Cap 4 In these words,
<q>When they enquire of us, what Three? or how these Three shall be called? we set our selves to find some special or general Name, neither can we find it, because the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency of the Dei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>y exceeds the strength of our Eloquence, and God is more truely Comprehended by the Mind, than expressed by the Tongue, and more truly existeth, than comprehended in the Mind.</q>
This I say, is the Reason, why <hi>August<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> thinketh the word (Person) not sufficient enough, for the Declaration of this incomprehensible Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But the same is the Reason why, <hi>de Doctrina Christ. Lib</hi> 1. <hi>Cap</hi> 5. He thinketh that the word <hi>Cause</hi> cannot agree to God: Hence it is apparent, That an Atheist might as well, and with as good ground alledge, that <hi>Augustin</hi> in the forecited places did patronize his Atheism, and publish to the world that God is not the Supream cause of all things, or that there is not a God. 3. I have with care perused these Books of <hi>Augustin,</hi> but could not at all find this Argument which <hi>George Keith</hi> fathereth upon him: I Answer therefore the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95059:95"/>
not as <hi>Augustin</hi>'s, but as a sinnowless Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>George Keith,</hi> drawn from a simily of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, which hath little or no proportion to that which is Infinit. Hence I say, that it can have little or no weight. But again the Argument is false, and Ridiculous, on this Account, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> make every Father, the Person of his Son, which I am sure is absurd enough. For as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Father of another, and yet a distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from another, so God the Father, is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God the Son, and yet a distinct Person from God the Son.

               </gap>ies, whereby to cover their blasphemous Doctrine. Thus their best refuge is to broach Lies, in Hypocrisies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I shall prove that according to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine, <hi>God is the Author of sin,</hi> which I thus Evince.</p>
            <p>God is the Author of every Substance, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine, Sin is a Substance. The Minor I prove, Grace is a Substance, which is their Common Doctrine, therefore sin is a Substance also. The consequence <hi>Rob: Barclay Vind: pag</hi> 49. denyeth, which I thus prove, the Antecedent <hi>viz.</hi> that Grace is a Substance, they endeavour to prove by these Reasons.
<q>First because it is in and by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95059:96"/>
this inward, and substantial Seed in their hearts, as it cometh to receive nourishment, and to have a Birth, and Geniture in them, they come to have these Spiritual Senses raised, by which they are made capable of Tasting, Smelling, Seeing, and Handling the things of God.</q>
Thus reasoned <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> In his <hi>Apology</hi> pag 95. This is also the Doctrine of <hi>George Keith</hi> in his <hi>Immed. Rev. That this Light, or Seed, or Grace, is a Substance, because it may feel, hear &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Barclays</hi> second Reason is, <hi>because it subsists in the hearts of wicked men, even while they are in their wickedness.</hi> Now if Sin may hear, feel, and perceive, as well as Grace and Light, and if it may feel, or perceive the things of Satan, as really as Grace feels, or perceiveth the things of God, and if sin may be in the. heart of a real godly person, then sin is a Substance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Quakers; Otherwise these Reasons are reasonlesse: But the former is true, therefore the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ter. The Consequence of the Major is most firm. For sin in the heart of one that is truly godly, is the same way to be considered, as Grace, and Light in the heart of the ungodly in this point. For I judge this be the Reason, why the Quakers Judge that this is the Reason, that the Beeing of Grace in the Heart of a wicked Man, while in his wickedness proveth it to be a substance <hi>viz.</hi> Because it can be where its contrary is, and strive, and wrestle with it, which is as evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning sin in the heart of a godly man, as is clear from Rom. 7. Gal. 5, 17, and also from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95059:96"/>
which I believe our Adversaries themselves would hardly deny, seing they grant that all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that have real Grace are not at all times, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conversion free of sin, and wrestling with it. Hence the Charge that they most maliciously lay to the Reformed Churches <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they make God the Author of Sin,</hi> is justly returned upon themselves, seing God is the Author of every Substance. Which is yet more clear from the twelfth <hi>Query,</hi> sent <hi>to Mr Iohn Alexander</hi> viz. <hi>What is Original Sin? Whether it be not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?</hi> yea <hi>or nay? For doth not the Original sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Beginning? What did Christ come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy? Was it not the Devil and his Works?</hi> What is more clear, than that in those <hi>Queries</hi> of the Quakers, God is made the Author of Sin? seing that unlesse they professe, and avow <hi>Manicheism,</hi> God created the Devil, and this is yet more clear, if clearer can be, by <hi>George Keiths</hi> Defence of this Querie <hi>Truth defend:</hi> pag. 177.
Where he can find no better Defence of this blasphemy, than to call it in effect a <hi>purposeless heap of words without all scope,</hi> saying, <q>that the Devil may be called sin, in a certain sense by a Metonymy, as Christ is called Righteousness, or sin, called the old Man.</q>
And thus <hi>George Keith</hi> acteth like himself, that is playeth the ridiculous babler, for pag. 59. in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that Query viz.
<q>If every Title in the Bible be the word of God?</q>
he sayeth,
<q>that to query a thing, will not conclude, that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionist doth positively affirm, or deny what is queried.</q>
The same way he dealeth here with his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95059:97"/>
Antagonist. For if the <hi>Quakers</hi> understood no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, then the Devil may get the Name of sin, as any cause may get the name of its effect: Then both they, and he in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, prove themselves to be pitiful, purposeless wranglers, making a stur in the World about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: And of set purpose involving their Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies, that none shal know the meaning thereof: Hence we may see, that it is but vain Labour to give any Answer to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.

For what is more clear from the Words of the Query than that the Devil is sin it self? seing I think no Man, except <hi>George Keith,</hi> will desire us to believe that all these Questions are given out for needless a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musements of the World, importing only these things; about which there is not the least shadow of a question, or doubt, for who ever doubted that the Devil was the cause of Sin?

Again <hi>Great Myst.</hi> p. 100. The Quakers are accused for saying, there is no Scripture that speaketh of a Humane Soul: And for affirming that the Soul is taken up unto God; Hereunto <hi>George Fox</hi> thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth,
<q>God breathed into Man the Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul.

For none will deny that both the Souls of men, and the Devils themselves are spiritual substances. Hence it will follow, that God, or a part of God (as they most blasphemously speak) committeth sin, which confirmeth that which we said before <hi>viz.</hi> that according to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine, God is the Author of sin.

From all which, beside other most horrid absurdities and blasphemies which follow upon this their Doctrine, this is a clear consequent, That Christ hath three Natures. To this they answer <hi>Quak.</hi> Confir: <hi>p.</hi> 33<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding hereof, this confession serveth only to prove these Men guilty, of most wicked hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, lying, and self Contradiction to put a cheat upon the World, and cover their abominations: For whosoever taketh but an overly veiw of the passages above cited of <hi>George Keiths way cast up</hi>; he may clearly see, that if these passages be true Doctrine, the greatest arguments, for establishing the Divinity of Christ are for ever gone. For <hi>I</hi> appeal to the writings of all who have refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed the Doctrine of <hi>Arrius and Socinus,</hi> if <hi>prov.</hi> 8.23.

Neither is there a greater argument, than <hi>that by him all things were Created</hi>: And yet if these forecited passages be true, the denyers of Christs Divinity have an easie answer, that all these things are verified of Christ as man only; And so the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est arguments for the Divinitie of Christ fall to the Ground. Now let any man judge if the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not what in them lye to overthrow the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ, seeing they endeavour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and destroy all the arguments by which it is underpropped. Moreover this Doctrine robb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God of his incommunicable attributs, in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing Omnipresence, or Ubiquitie to a Man. But before I leave this point, <hi>I</hi> propose this dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma to the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:95059:104"/>If all things were created by Christ as Man, then either the Manhood of Christ is created or not; if created, then it is created by it self, than which there is nothing more absurd; If uncreated, then there is an uncreated man, and a man that is coeternal with God. Which Blasphemie its hardly able to equalize, far lesse to outdo. From all which it is most evident, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> doe what in them lyeth, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the fundamental Doctrines and basis of the Christian Religion <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Godhead of Christ.</hi> And in this they are more wicked, than the professed <hi>Arrians,</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> that they add deep dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, and hypocrisie to their horrid impiety, whereas the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> more ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than they, profess in words what they really believe. It is also clear that in stead of their Christ, they embrace a meer chimerical non<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> entity: seing there is nothing more contradictiorie, than that either the Soul or the Body of a man, which is a meer creature, can be every where, or from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie. Lastly observe that the <hi>Quakers</hi> put no distinction betwixt their Christ, and their light within, and that the light within is nothing but the smal dark Relicts of the Image of God, or the dimm light of nature, as we have already e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. And so their Christ, their God, and all that is dear unto them, resolve at length into this almost quenched spunk, in which, all who have trusted, in stead of finding the safe port of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happiness, have alwayes met with certain Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.</p>

And again <hi>Edward Burrows p.</hi> 33. To that query of <hi>Philip Binnet</hi> viz.
<q>Whether none be accounted righteous in the sight of God, in whom is any Corruption, or failing, or who do not fulfill the Law, and answer every demand of Justice?</q>
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth thus,
<q>Here thou polluted Beast makes it manifest what thou hast been driving at all this while; which is that thou would have thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and filthiness to be accounted righteousness in Gods sight. that so thou mayest wallow in filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but <hi>Iohn</hi> sayeth, he that commits sin is of the Devil, the Son of God was manifested that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95059:106"/>
he might destroy the works of the Devil, and thou Man of Sin would have it stand. God do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not accept any, where there is any failing, or who do not fullfill the Law, and answer every demand of Justice. And <hi>Will. Pen Reas</hi>: against <hi>Rail. pag</hi> 80. We must not conceive that his, <hi>viz. Abrahams</hi> personal offering, was not a justifying righteousness, but that God was pleased to count it so; nor was there any imputation of anothers Righteousness to <hi>Abraham</hi>: but on the contrary, his personal obedience, was the ground of that just imputation, therefore that any should be justified by anothers righteousness imputed, and not inherent in him, is both ridiculous, and dangerous.</q>
               <hi>Edward Burrows pag</hi> 32.
<q>Thou Beast to whom the plagues of God are due, and upon whom the wrath of God must be accomplished, who would have another righteousness than that which Christ worketh in the Saints. <hi>Pen. San: Fund: pag</hi> 25. Justification is not from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of anothers Righteousness, but from the actual performing, and keeping of Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous statutes, <hi>Ibid. pag</hi> 25.30. It is a great abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to say, God should condemn, and punish his innocent Son, that he having satisfied for our sins, we might be justified by the imputation of of his perfect righteousness. Why should this horrible thing be contended for by Christians.</q>

               </gap>cility I could shew, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is in every point contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the Doctrine of Christ; contradicting, and vilifying all his Ordinances, and denying all

I shall content my self with one great instance viz. <hi>Of the Resurrection of the dead.</hi> Concerning which point, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Sadducees</hi>: For, in the hearing of many witnesses <hi>Geo: Whitehead</hi> said, <hi>This Body shall not rise again.

<q>Such a Resurrection is inconsistent with the Scripture Reason, and the belief of all Men right in their wits. And <hi>Ibid: pag</hi> 34. For shame, Let us not make such stirr against the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> for the absurdity of that is rather outdone, than equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this carnal Resurrection:</q>
And the same <hi>William Pen</hi> in his <hi>Invalidity,</hi> (I should have said his Validitie, seeing he all along Justifieth his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries charges) of <hi>Mr. Faldos Vindication,</hi> hath a Chapter prolix enough to defend his down right <hi>Sadducism.</hi> Yea what is more clear in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than Christs visible appearance to judgment: And yet <hi>Geo: Whith.

            <head>CHAP. VI. Of Perfection.</head>
            <p>ALthough we have already given several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the damnable Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> together with their miserable defence thereof: We shall notwithstanding for the more abundant evicting hereof, trace the Footsteps of one of their cheif Authors <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi> in his Vindication of one or two of their cheif principles.</p>
            <p>The first of which shall be that of Perfection<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this point, is,
<q>In whom this pure &amp; holy birth is fully brought forth, the Body of death, and sin, cometh to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and removed, and their hearts united, and subjected to the truth, so as not to obey any Suggestions, or Temptations of the evil one, to be free from actual sinning, and Transgressing of the Law of God, and in that respect, perfect, Yet doth this perfection still admit of a growth. And there remaineth alwayes in some part a possibility of sinning; where the mind do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not most diligently, and watchfully attend unto the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:95059:108"/>These are the words of his eight These; And afterward he sayeth, that, <hi>there may be a State in this Life, in which a Man cannot sin, it is so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural unto him to do Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us in the next place consider how he vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth this Doctrine, which is our main purpose. Having <hi>vind: Sect:</hi> 9. Spent a while in accusing his Adversarie as guilty of railing, and in rejecting his own Brethrens books; such as <hi>Sauls errand to Damascus.</hi> In which they maintain themselves to <hi>be equal with God.</hi> Which is also asserted by <hi>Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorn against Sherl: pag</hi> 30. I say, rejecting these, or denying that they have said them (for he still insinuateth that <hi>Hicks</hi> only said these things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be evinced by particular citation of book and page, where they are;)
In the next place he giveth away the cause wholly, by saying, <q>that he pleadeth for no more than Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> sayeth N 6. <hi>viz.</hi> That by perfection in this life, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood a change in the whole man, so that he yieldeth impartial obedience to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, though in a small degree,</q> yet that he may seem to say somewhat, he enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>How</hi> this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is <hi>reconciled with that of day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaking the Commands in thought, word, &amp; deed?</hi>
In answer to which question, it is enough to enquire how he evinceth them to be contradictory: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he may know if he will, that the Law of the Lord requireth a perfection of degrees, as well as parts, and that it is a disconformity to the Law of God, and consequently a sin, to be deficient in the one, as well as in the other.
And whereas he enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<q>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:95059:109"/>if to break Gods Commands dayly, in thought, word, and deed, be the way to grow in grace? To put off the Old Man, and on the New.</q>

He but only useth his old Custom. viz. maliciously to calumniate. For who said such a thing? Or from what point of our Doctrine will he prove this? We shall attend his proofs of it. Which untill we hear, we cannot but in reason Judge that he delighteth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious lies. For though we say according to the Scripture, that even the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate carrie about a body of death with them until death, which defileth all their actions: Yet where did any of the reformed teach, that to endeavour to break Gods Commands is the way to grow in grace, as this Man insinuateth they do? What kind of light is this he has, that teacheth him such a facultie of lying?</p>
            <p>He goeth on saying, <hi>but he addeth that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, rendereth gospel commands useless, but are the Commands useless, if men obey them?</hi> But certainly He that is above the breach of the Law, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> say, many may be, has no more use of the Law, or need of it to learn any thing from it, in order to the obedience thereof. And where is his vain subter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>uge now? But that he may yet. further contradict himself and his Brethren; He sayeth, He has <hi>shewn in his Apology, that all have<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> need to repent, and pray for forgiveness.</hi> For if some be equal with God, above the breach of the Commands, want a bodie of death: The most that they have to do, is to give thanks, and not to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95059:109"/>
pray, or repent. For I think he will not say, that they pray, or repent which are in heaven. These duties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supponing sorrow, of which they are incapable, And far lesse (<hi>Horresco referens</hi>) these that are equals with God.</p>
            <p>In opposition to his Adversary shewing that this Doctrine tendeth to the fomenting of pride, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity he sayeth, <hi>but where freedom from sin is, where can Pride and Security have place?</hi> Ans. This answer had been as fit to the Apostles Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 27, as to this Argument. For he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that boasting might follow upon Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works. It might then have been as well replyed? If a man be perfectly Just, and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin, how can he incur the fault of boasting? 2. How will he shew, but this Doctrine of his doth bring many under a mistake, as if they were secure from sinning, when indeed they are not? Whereas he sayeth, <hi>that according to our Doctrine denying the perfection of degrees in this Life, the wicked Villains do lesse make uselesse Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands than others, because they afford more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to exercise Repentance, and prayer for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of God</hi>: We only refer him to Rom: 3.8. where he may have the like Objection with a fit Answer. And here he promiseth alwayes to cry down the Ordinances of Christ Jesus. And why? <hi>Because,</hi> sayes he, <hi>they must be made useful in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commands, in thought, word, and deed.</hi> His reason is a Calumnie, if it have sense at all. What Ordinance teacheth, which we maintain,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95059:110"/>
that it is ones duty daylie to break the Commands of God, that the Ordinances may be the more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>l to us? If this be not of the same nature with Cavil wiped off by the Apostle <hi>Rom</hi> 3. then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two, and three, are not five. But such malice the Church must resolve to be the Butt of, so long as she is militant.</p>
            <p>He goeth on, to remove this Absurdity from their Doctrine of <hi>Perfection viz. that then none that are regenerat, could sin at all, but would be beyond the possibility of it.</hi> Which inference is very clear, for the ground which they give for their Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>He that is born of God, doeth not commit sin.</hi> Which place they abuse, taking it without restriction; not attending to the context, speaking of a Tread and Custom of sin, and of a commission of it from Malice, like the devil, and the wicked, his Children. Which absurdity, that he may evite: He assureth, <hi>that a man is not regene<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> rat, and born again at once, or at one instant of time.</hi> His ground of which we shall now examine. And it is those two places of Scripture, <hi>viz. Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>He which hath begun a good work &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 5.7. <hi>Ye did run well, &amp;c.</hi> Now these Scriptures say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him. For the <hi>Philippians</hi> were Saints in Christ Jesus, when this Epistle was writ, V 1. Now I think, none can deny that such are born of God. For the other Place it saith as little for him, except for it he would infer the Saints falling away, which is false.</p>
            <p>Next that the new Birth of Regeneration, as such doeth not admit of degrees, but that every one of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95059:110"/>
the Children of God are really converted, or born again; so that of the Children of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rath, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Children of God, at one time, or Instant is clear. For as soon as a man hath true Faith, he becometh a Child of God. But that all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Essence of true Faith is infus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d in the Soul at once, (although some legal work in order to it necessarily preceed) I think none will deny. And the manifold Examples in Scripture, shewing that men in a most short time, were made to turn from Satan to God, prove it. I would fain know if the Thief on the Crosse, and Jailor were not born again? And if they were not perfectly born again? But to speak of any imperfection in his new Birth as such, that is to say, that one may be brought from Nature to Grace, and yet but half born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or not fully born again; Because he hath not attained unto the ful measure of Grace which is attainable, is no less absurd than to say, that one is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ully born, because he is but a little Child. Now this Absurdity is not a little remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because what ever they can say, the like reason holdeth for the one, as well as for the other. These to whom the Apostle writeth, were perfectly born of God, and yet there were some little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren among them; 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.12. Now they were perfectly born; Because they had the Seed of God, or the <hi>Vnction</hi> chap 2.27. which is all one with the Seed. Now the abiding of the Seed, is given as a reason of the perfection of the New-birth, so that they cannot sin. <hi>Ergo</hi>: If little Children; as well as Fathers, had this <hi>unction,</hi> or <hi>Seed</hi> abiding in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95059:111"/>
them, they had this New-birth in the highest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection pleaded for by <hi>Quakers.</hi> 3 The Apostle, 1 <hi>Ioh</hi> 3.9. speaketh without distinction, <hi>(Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever &amp;c.)</hi> and so taketh away the elusion of our Adversaries.</p>
            <p>Next, he thinketh here to free himself of <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianism,</hi> of which he was proved to be guilty, by saying <hi>he alwayes denyed that men might keep the Commands by the power of nature,</hi> which ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ledgeth also, that because the Fathers say, <hi>That none by the strength of Grace did live all their days without sin; and the perfection ascribed to some in Scripture, was not from nature, but from grace, therefore they thought men might be free from sin by Grace.</hi> What miserable manking and clipping is this? Is it not added in the very following words immediatly? <hi>That none attained that measure of holiness in this life, that he could live any long time without sin, and that this perfection was not full, and absolute, but which might encrease, and was mixed with evil deeds, so was a perfection of parts only, not of degrees.</hi> These are the very words of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis</hi> of the Orthodox, in opposition to the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians. Vos. Hist. Pel. Par. Prim: Thes,</hi> 1. pag 146. Now I would desire any to shew me, what this Doctrine differeth from that which the reformed Churches hold? Let the Reader see <hi>Mr. Broun</hi> himself pag 333, N 12, 13, where he may see this matter handled at large. I add these words of <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Apol. Cont: Pel: I do not undertake, I presume not, I dare not say that I shall be without sin, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:95059:111"/>
long as I shall be in this Corruption, which we have.</hi> And again, <hi>The man that can be without sin is Christ.</hi> He saith here, <hi>that what his Adversary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the Fathers arguments against Pelagians, and</hi> Socinians <hi>It is not his work to meddle with, or to heed what these Sects say.</hi> But it is not best to do so. For in so doing, he should fight against himself. For they must divide him from himself<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that divide him either from a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> or a <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> I was about to admonish the Reader, to read especially this fourteenth chapter of <hi>Mr. Broun's</hi> Book: But I need not, seing he granteth all we plead for, by saying on the matter, he doth not care though he be proved a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and a <hi>Socinian.</hi> And whereas he sayeth, <hi>he considereth the matter as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in Scripture.</hi> The only way to know the truth of this, is to examine his Doctrine, which we have done in part. And through the Lords as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, shall yet further do it. We value not his Recriminations, which he hath here, but nameth none, since nothing that he can say can be of weight against us: As these Charges of <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> and <hi>Socinianism</hi> are against him, except he bring the fathers as much fighting against the Doctrine of the reformed churches, and the reformed Churches against their Doctrine; as these fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and his Brethren.</p>
            <p>Again he cometh to the Vindication of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are answered by his Adversary pag 337 N, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. And for urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the first, which was, <hi>That this Doctrine is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wisdom of God,</hi> he only insinuateth that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95059:112"/>
there are means given to the people of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be free from all sin, if they use them well. This I say he insinuateth, for here he mumbleth as one in a confused haste: But this is with as great facility denyed, as any thing he hath hitherto said; For we assert, that it is the will of God, that perfect freedom from sin, be a property of the Church Triumphant only. And for proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our assertion, it is enough to challenge him to give any example of one, thus freed from sin in the world, except Christ Jesus, who never had it, but by imputation. To me his following words are nonsense. He would fain insist over his Adversary, because he sayeth <hi>pag.</hi> 339. N 19. <hi>That the heart, &amp; the renewed part of the man being for God and God only, and directly against Satan, and all his wayes, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and designs, there is no formal service perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Satan, Saying, That then there is some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial service performed to the devil.</hi> But this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection militateth as much against the Apostle, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, <hi>That with his flesh he served the Law of sin.</hi> Which I think the <hi>Quakers</hi> will hardly distinguish from the Law of Satan<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 2. If this instance do any thing, it will overdo. For it tendeth to prove that no Action of any that have gotten saith, though in the least degree, can be at all tainted with sin. We mean their gracious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: He is angry because his Adversary saith; <hi>that it is the will of God, that his people be under a warfare so long as they are here,</hi> saying, <hi>But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

that they may be called service to Satan, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be said to be overcome.</hi> Ans. They are not alwayes overcome. Because sometimes the man as Spiritual, prevaileth against himself as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. And alwayes overcometh at length, and at the end of the War, though oftentimes foiled in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Battels. The none consideration of which distinction, is the ground of this Cavil, his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words stand, and fall with this Doctrine of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal sin, and universal Grace, according to his own confession, we shall therefore passe them.</p>
            <p>Pag. 123<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
He repeateth his Argument, which is <q>that our Doctrine is injurious to the Sacrifice of Christ. But he forgetteth to shew how. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he sayeth in opposition to his Adversary, saying, that the Guilt of sin by by this Sacrifice, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: And also he taketh away the stain thereof piece and piece, till in end he give full Victory.</q>
They refer that to another Life. The Question is concerning this.</p>
            <p>Ans. If he were minded to make a Difference betwixt Heaven, and Earth, he had not made a Question about full Victory in this life. 2. How profane a Heart must he have, that counteth all the attainments of a Child of God in this Life, as good as nothing: For notwithstanding of them all, he will still have the Sacrifice of Christ to be useless, except a man in this Life, become as sinless as an Angel. He was concerned to have proved this, otherwise not belied the World, by giving out that he had fully answered his Adversary. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially he lieth here, in that he sayeth he hath
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95059:113"/>
fully answered his eight Chapter. In which of all places, he most failed. Of which I shal give the Reader a touch in my <hi>Appendix.</hi> And may be more fully seen by these who compare the Books themselves. He will not be content, that his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary sayeth, that the godly, and the wicked differ; In that the one sinneth with full Purpose of Heart, and the other, viz. the godly mourneth over, and repenteth of his sin, and shortcomings, but sayeth, <hi>seing he supposeth the godly to remain in sin, all their lifetime the similitude remaineth.</hi> Ans. And is it so? that there is no difference in sinning, between him that sinneth through Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and him that sinneth through Infirmity, let him prove this. For until he do it, we account it an abominable Assertion. For the Scripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a clear difference, between the shortcomings of the godly, and wicked departing from God. And is it no difference, that the one repenteth, and the other not?</p>
            <p>Next he mentioneth another of his Apologetick Arguments viz. <hi>that our Doctrine in this Point, maketh the Ministry uselesse.</hi>
But in stead of ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, what his Adversary answered, which was, <q>that upon this very head the Necessity of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry appeareth. 2. That it cannot be proved, that this ultimat end of the Ministry mentioned Eph. 4, 13. is attained here, and 3. That there is a Perfection of Parts and another of Degrees.</q>
I say in stead of urging of all this, he only sayeth, "but the Question is, whether, or not that perfection is attainable here? Ans.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95059:113"/>
He ought to urge his Argument: And not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone Questions, seing he knoweth well enough that his Adversary, as alwayes, so here denyeth that a sinless perfection is attainable in this life. Now let him prove this from the place, and he may be considered. But in stead of this, for as short as his Book is, he must make a Digression to tell us, <hi>that though Christ was sinlesse, yet he admitted of grouth,</hi> which is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, seing Christ is not said to grow in the Love of God, and such moral Perfections, about which the Question is; but only in that kind of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the <hi>pura nescientia,</hi> or want of which, is no sin, or culpable Ignorance.</p>
            <p>Next he sayeth <hi>it will not follow from Col.</hi> 4.12 <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3, 12. <hi>that it is impossible that men should be free of sin here, by the Grace of God.</hi> These were the Places, from which he deduced an Argument, for sinless perfection in his Apology. And now being answered, he thinks it enough for urging of them, to bid us prove the contrary, from the same places. Judge Reader, if this man be not pithy. And yet he hath all the pith, that <hi>Socinus,</hi> and <hi>Crellius</hi> had, from whom he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Argument.</p>
            <p>His following Quibles are already answered. Only I must take notice that in this pag. 129. he enquireth,
<q>How these can be said, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Works of darkness, who have need to be washed from their dayly Defilements?</q>
Ans. Let him read the 12, and 13. of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> and there he may find that these two are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent.

               </q>
He doth not deny but they had once sin. Now, seing he asserteth that at another time they were free of it altogether, he ought to prove it: And that by another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than saying <hi>If they had not been altogether free of sin, they would not have been called per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Seing that perfection is variously taken in Scripture, and not only for being free of sin, as himself confessed above; seing he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what his Adversary said, about the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of the Signification of the Word.</p>
            <p>He cometh in the next place to remove our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. The first of them is drawn from 1 Joh. 2.8. <hi>If we say we have no sin &amp;c.</hi> and here he sayeth first, <hi>that this will no more prove, that the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95059:114"/>
Apostle Iohn himself sinned dayly, than what is said Iames</hi> 3.9.10. <hi>can be affirmed of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Iames himself.</hi> Ans. There is no parity. For James speaketh of grosse outbreakings, from which the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rds People are ordinarly kept. But here the Apostle speaketh simply of the Nature of sin. 2. Certain it is, that the Apostle John, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in his best frame, had sinful Actions, and his own Errors. Which none will deny that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Rev. 19.10, 11, and 22, 8, 9. and <hi>I</hi> think no Quaker will deny that John was perfectly born again if any ever was. Now let them quible what they will, these two Texts are enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e them. He alledgeth next, that his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only proveth from this place, that men may sin in the present time, not that they do really and actually sin in the present time. Which is false. For he from the Context fully refuteth the <hi>Socinian</hi> Cavil, see among other places; v. 9. he den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>eth here that the Seed of sin, maketh its Subject sinful. But we know no Seed of Sin, but that which is really Sin, neither doth the Scripture make any Mention of it. But this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is all one with the popish Doctrine of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence <hi>mutato nomine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alledgeth pag. 126. <hi>That it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from Eccles.</hi> 7.20. <hi>That men sin dayly, or that all their Actions are imperfect through sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> But he forgetteth to apply that Law to himself, which he would impose upon others. For though the Text speaketh absolutly, without exception: yet he will not give a Reason of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95059:115"/>
And here again he talketh of his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Regeneration. But to as little purpose as before. He leaveth the Consideration of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Text, which he thought made for him, to the Reader, therefore I considered it, and found it in the Indicative mood. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nothing for him.</p>
            <p>He cometh next to vindicate the meaning of the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> of Rom. 7, 17, which is, <hi>that the Apostle there speaketh of another, in his own person.</hi> But he passeth all his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries Reasons of our Meaning, with one blunt scoffe, saying <hi>he giveth us a Preachment.</hi> Which effrontedness I Judge can hardly be parallelled. Next he sayeth, <hi>except he prove that Paul was a Carnal man; in respect of sinning at that time, he sayeth nothing.</hi> But his Adversary hath done it, from this present Text already, so that he durst not so much as present one of his Reasons, to his Reader, though never so manked, and clipped (as his Custom is) but thought it safest, to pass by them whole sale: Otherwise perhaps some of the Vulgar Quakers, who deluded by this Emissary of the Jesuits, might have seen how absurd their <hi>Rabbies</hi> are in explication of the Scripture, and so looked about them; before they had been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther involved. 2. All this effronted, and false dealing will not do the turn; For the Reason why they reject such a plain meaning of the words, and admit such a strange figurative meaning. The reason I say, moving them to this, is because they think the Apostle Paul was above sinning, and that they may have him to be an Example of sinless perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95059:115"/>
but this helpeth him not a whit, For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Iohn,</hi> was one of the chief Apostles, as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet his sinning in his choicest Frame, and under the greatest outlettings of Grace, is so manifest, that all the Sophistry of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath not yet invented a Shift, for the Elusion thereof. The like may be said of Peter. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and many others which we passe.</p>
            <p>Next he cometh to answer <hi>Mr. Browns</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is this.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If we find no instances in Scripture of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as were so perfect, as that they did not sin, then to imagine such a Perfection, is but a groundless fancy, and dream.</p>
               <p>But the Former is true.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Consequence he denyeth. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he denyeth that we ought to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the guidance of the Scripture. And where is his holding by the Scriptures now, which we lately heard of? Let <hi>Quakers</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more cheat the World, with saying, that they walk according to the Scriptures, while with open face they assert, that they ought not to be a guide to us, or that we ought to believe points of Faith not contained there. 2. He sayeth that the Argument concludeth not in the Terms of the Question. But the Conclusion is, that such a Perfection, as the Quakers maintain, is but a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and a Dream. And if he will admit this, we are agreed. And if he will not, he must deny some of the proposition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>. Neither let him object to me, that this is not the Argument; which he answered unto (for the Argument was proponed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95059:116"/>
three different wayes, the first of which he choosed to answer unto,) For either it is it, or another; if it be it, it is well: the same Argument then is now urged, if it be not it, then let him confesse he skipt over, that which did cut this point of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerism in the jugular Vein.</p>

            <p>THis Author, in the 12 <hi>Section</hi> of his <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> of which the first part is opposed to <hi>Mr. Broun</hi>'s 22 Chapter of <hi>Silent waiting,</hi> maketh a none such clamour, as if he were without paralel traduced. We shall therefore in the first place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the chief of these things, which he calleth Calumnies and Perversions. Whereof the first is, <hi>That he would have us to understand that Christ's Resurrection was never till now, whereas</hi> (sayes he) <hi>I only spake with reference to the time since the Apostacy.</hi> Ans. 1. Any may judge by his 11 <hi>Proposition,</hi> or yet by his chapter annexed thereto, if this be a Calumny; for whatever he there sayeth, may be as well applyed, to Heathnish, as Popish
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95059:116"/>
superstition, especially if the Quakers salvation of Heathens be considered. 2. He is unhappy in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pretended Calumny: For the Apostacy was working in the Apostles time, and consequently he sayeth nothing. 3. Make the best of it ye will, this is but only what <hi>Munser,</hi> or <hi>Iohn of Leyden</hi> said, that they might obscure these burning and shining Lights, the reformers, and marr the work in their hand. 4. Their direct opposition to the Orthodox primitive Christians, in the most weighty points of Religion; such as the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity, Free-grace,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and the like sufficiently demonstrats, that they esteem none before themselves, except <hi>Arrius, or Pelagius,</hi> to have been at all in the way of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hitherto there hath been no spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. His second Calumny so called, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Quakers plead only for Enthusiasms, and abstract from means,</hi> we have above evinced to be a truth, in the first and second Chapters. Moreover, he here denyeth, that studying of Sermons from the Scripture, which implyeth reading, prayer, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and the like exercise to be means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God. And thus he only confirms what he even now denyed, viz <hi>that the Quakers plead only for Enthusiasms,</hi> and abstract from means. His third Calumny, viz. <hi>that the Quakers Spiritual life is nothing but Nature</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> proved above Cap. 2. to be a truth, where we shewed that all the <hi>Quakers</hi> grace and light is nothing but the small remainders of the once bright shining Image of God in man. His fourth Calumny is his own,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95059:117"/>
and not his Adversaries: For his Adversary only inquireth, <hi>If this Life be common at all times to them?</hi> Hence he inferreth, that he supposeth it to be so, the contrary of which, for any thing I can learn, he supposeth, as his Query <hi>pag</hi> 414. insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth, His 5 Calumny. as to what truth it hath, dependeth upon the controversie of <hi>perfection,</hi> to which he referreth his Reader, and I do the like to my survey of his Vindication. His next nominal Calumny is, that his Adversary <hi>supposeth it to be their Doctrine, that there is no setting about prayers, or other duties, without a previous motion of the Spirit.</hi> Now of all things, I wonder most, that he calls this a Calumny, seing this very thing is assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by himself, in his eleventh proposition: How he will reconcile himself with himself I know not well. Yet sure his following words are so far from mending the matter that they make it worse, which are, <hi>That they speak not of a previous motion in order of time, but in order of nature</hi>; Neither his proposition, nor any part of his Doctrine, for any thing can be learned, insinuate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>h any such thing. 2. This motion must so far preceed the setting about duty, as that the persons perception of the motion must be interja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, according to them. For they teach that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore duty, we must not only be acted by the Spirit, but know that we are acted: Ergo the motion must be previous in order of time. And yet the man is so fraughted with a desire of altercation, that he must say some what, though he have not much advantage by it: otherwise he had not challenged his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, as a Calumniator, while by the same very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95059:117"/>
taxed by himself, he is forced to a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unheard of heretofore as I think in this matter; and in reality a real contradiction of his own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And again he alledgeth he is wronged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Antagonist inferreth from his words, in his eleventh Proposition; That according to him Gospel-worship putteth away all external Actions. But he needeth not grudge at this, for their practise helpeth us to expone their words. Some other things he hath which he calleth Calumnies. One thing he taketh very ill, and that is, that his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist pag 418. compareth the <hi>Quakers</hi> to the old <hi>Pythonicks,</hi> because of the strange and unusual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among them, Antick fits, and strange Pranks. I alwayes compared them in such fits to the <hi>Cume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Cybil,</hi> as she is described by <hi>Virgil</hi> in his 6 Eneid. To this he retorts <hi>the extraordinary working of the Spirit of God, mentioned in the fulfilling of the Scripture, called the Stwarton sickness</hi>: challenging us to assign a difference, between this and the strange influence of the <hi>Quakers</hi> spirit upon them, which we can with great facility do; for beside that these out-lettings of the Spirit of God, made them to cleave more closly to the Scriptures, as the only Rule, and Star, to guide them through the sea of this world, to the safe port of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rest. And endeared more and more unto the Ministers of Christ Jesus, his word, and Sacraments, we mean that which the <hi>Quakers call Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, &amp; the Communion of the Lords Body, in Bread and Wine,</hi> as sure pledges of the Love of Christ<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> commanded by him to be used until his coming to Judgment, which are openly contemned and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95059:118"/>
vilified by the Quakers; We say beside this, these outlett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngs were far from leading them into such strange and unheard of fits, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> are put into: of which I could instance a Legion of sure Examples, see a late piece written by a new <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Minister <hi>Mr. Increase Meather.</hi> See also <hi>Paget's Heresiography,</hi> where he bringeth among other strange Pranks of theirs, to which they were moved by the Spirit, One <hi>Susanna Parsons</hi> a zealous <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> attempting to raise one of their number, who had murdered himself, from the dead, but in vain. And this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> attested by all the Magistrats of a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable City in <hi>England, viz. Worster</hi> Anno 1659. See also a little piece called <hi>Foot out of snare,</hi> of the strange and antick influences of this their Spirit on one <hi>Iohn Toldervei.</hi> What shall we say of <hi>Iames Naylor,</hi> who following the Light of this Spirit, did arrogat to himself divine honour at <hi>Bristol.</hi> Now though they say, he recanted this again, it is all one matter: For this Antiscriptural Spirit, which is their principal Rule, can no doubt change it self, as it seeth occasion: And having too much bewrayed it self with the grossness of its Delusion, can easily turn it self to a more subtile way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture. So that we may in a word say, that the difference between the workings of the Spirit of God, on his people mentioned in Scripture and these of the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>her of lies, and deceits on the <hi>Pytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> or <hi>Cybills,</hi> was no more palpable, than the difference between the working upon these mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, and that upon the <hi>Quakers.</hi> He sayeth moreover, <hi>that the story of Gilpin, who as Paget
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95059:118"/>
sheweth us,</hi> was mad through Quakerism, <hi>is refuted long ago.</hi> But forgetteth to tell by whom or where. Next he cometh to wipe off the absurdity of their silent waiting, that this their abstracting of their mind from all thoughts, so that the soul doth not at all act upon any kind of Object. Which post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure they say prepareth them for the Spirits motion. And this is the result of their asserting, that a man ought to do nothing of the Service, or Worship of God, except they know that they are moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Spirit. Now such an inturning (for he counteth it a great wrong in his Adversary to call it introversion) is not possible unto a man, except he be sleeping, as the experience of the generality of men witnesseth, who still perceive their Souls acting upon some Object, either good, or evil, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be sleeping, or in an extasie<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And so this is a direct following of the Heathens, who went and sleeped at the Temples, or Groves of their gods, that they might have conference with them in dreams. But they used to take sheep-skins and ly upon, as <hi>Virg.</hi> in his 7 Book, speaking of <hi>Latinus,</hi> which if the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, or not, I am uncertain. Now in his defence of this pag: 147 being challenged as guilty of this absurdity by his Antagonist, among other words, he hath these viz. <hi>If he would understand it of the old man, the man of sin, that is corrupted, we wil say with the Apostle, that it ought to be crucified, and die.</hi> And again he sayeth, <hi>that albeit in one sense, they are said to die, yet they more truely live, and exist,</hi> citing <hi>Gal.</hi> 2, 20. And this is the substance of what he sayeth, on this point.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95059:119"/>
To which I answer, it is well that at length, they forsake their prime Opinion, or Characteristical note. Hitherto he with his brethren, were defending the relinquishing of all thoughts whatsoever, in order to the Spirits Motion, and our setting about of duty, now he only defendeth the leaving of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thoughts. But he doth not consider, that this Cheat will easily be perceived: For there is a time to be presupposed, in which the Spirit is not mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For I hope he moveth when, and where he listeth.

            <p>The first is, <hi>If there be times appointed by God, then according to them the Spirit is limited.

Either these times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by them which recur weekly, are appointed by God, or not: If they be not, then how dare they keep them, as a thing inviolable? Seing the Lord determineth the time, as well as the nature of the worship to his people. And <hi>Ieroboam</hi> 1 Kings 13. Is condemned for appointing an Anniversary day, not appointed by God, as well as for changing the Religion. Ergo they limit the Spirit in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a day, perpetually recurring, or else they have a previous motion, in order to the appointing of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very meeting; which he doth not assert, or grant.

But if this in turning were an abstracting from worldly things only, and looking unto God, and considering our own sinful state and frame, and the necessity of holiness, in order to approaching unto God, he would say well: But seing in the same page, and with the same breath he reasoneth against this also, ridiculously saying, <hi>that then there should be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressus in infinitum,</hi> he only confirmeth that which we have proved before, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Quakers silent waiting is a meer Extasie, or all one with sleeping: And contradicteth what he said even now above.

And it's like there be too much truth in this.</p>
            <p>Because his adversarie sayeth <hi>pag</hi> 424. <hi>That watching is not a turning inward, but a looking out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

For well he knew that his adversary understood by looking outwardly, minding of God, and our distance from him, and the like.

               <p>The contempt the <hi>Quakers</hi> vent against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments is so well known, that it will be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to tell the Reader in the entrie, that they deny them.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95059:121"/>
against these Sacraments in general, viz. <hi>That the many controversies among Christians about them, prove them to be a real pharisie. To which when his adversary replyeth that if this argument hold, it will overthrow all the parts of the Christian Religion.</hi> He answereth <hi>that he should not have used this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment except he had other weighty ones.</hi> And then he cryeth out upon his adversary, as <hi>shewing a malicious genious.</hi> Judge, Reader, if he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so to cry out, and yet no better is the ground of his complaints through the whole of this Treatise. But to the main purpose, <hi>Iulian,</hi> or <hi>Porphyry</hi> might as well have used this instance, as he; for they thought they had weighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the Christian Religion. And he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but meerly think, that he hath weighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the Sacraments, as in the Sequel shall appear. However in the mean time we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that this argument, as the most part of the rest, is borrowed from the <hi>Pagans.</hi> For this very Argument drawn from the division of Christians, they improved what they could to overthrow Christianitie. From them the Papists borrowed it, wherewith to impugne the Protestants. And lastly the Quakers from them, and hath placed it where it was again at the first, to be a battering piece against Christianitie in general. So it hath gone from hand to hand <hi>in Circulo.</hi>

                  </gap>at another argument borrowed from the <hi>Papists,</hi> in their pleadings for traditions against the Scriptures, viz. <hi>that the word (Sacrament) is not to be found in Scripture,</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:95059:122"/>
(take heed to the consequence, Reader,) E. The thing is not in them. Is not this valid? But this Argument in its very defence, he is forced to let go, while he sayeth, he denyeth not the thing truly imported by the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Very well then he can say no more of the Sacraments. For the thing signified is in the Scriptures, and the words (Sign, or Seal) by which (though he denyed) we very ordinarily express that which we mean by (Sacraments) is very frequent in Scripture. And yet before he want something to say, he will cavil; though he grant all we plead for before the close, as here. Pag 163 He cometh to vindicate his meaning of some places of Scripture, brought in his <hi>Apology</hi> wherewith to overthrow Baptism,
And first <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. where he taketh notice that his Adversary Pag 469, sayeth <q>that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no where sayeth, there is but one only Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. To which he replyeth, that it will as well prove, that there is but one only Baptism, as there is one only God.</q>
Ans: First true it is, that this Phrase <hi>(one only Baptism)</hi> is not found in Scripture. 2. The one cannot be so well proved as the other. For these (ones) must be expon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the subject matter, seing it is beyond debate, that it cannot be proved from this place, that there is but one only Faith, or no kinds thereof but one. The Phrase therefore (One Baptism) will no more prove, that there are not diverse kinds thereof, than the phrase (one Faith) can do it in respect of diverse kinds of Faith. If he think otherwise he ought to prove
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:95059:122"/>
it, seing he is the opponent. Next he sayeth
<q>That his adversary understandeth the extraordinary gifts of Tongues, and the like by Baptism of the Holy Ghost, and of fire.</q>
And hence saith he, <hi>concludeth, that this Baptism is ceased. Ans.</hi> This is most true, which to prove, let him compare <hi>Act.</hi> 1.5. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. For he cannot deny, that the Apostles had the Spirit of God before this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which is together with its fulfilling, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. an explication of the like phrase in <hi>Matth,</hi> 3.11. For the clearing of which I assert, that <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptism, was no figure of the New Testament Baptism, in opposition to <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> who say it was only a figure of the New Testament Baptism. Otherwise if the sign, which <hi>Iohn</hi> could, only administrat, be opposed to the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, we may understand the Baptism, with the Holy Ghost, and with the fire spoken of <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. of Sanctification and Mortification.</p>
               <p>Next he sayeth, <hi>It is a lie that the Quakers would have none to be baptized, with the Spirit, but such as have extraordinary Gifts.</hi> But do they not still boast of their Revelations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations, comparing themselves to the Apostles, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themselves perfect? and I think these are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary things. And as for others beside them, they call them only carnal, and say, they are in darkness, these are the most modest of their Expressions, and yet enough to prove the thing denyed. When his Antagonist telleth him in Opposition to his saying, <hi>that if this Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism were to be accounted a true Baptism, then
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95059:123"/>
there should be two Baptisms, contrary to Eph.</hi> 4.5. I say when he telleth him, <hi>that it might as wel be said, that there were two Circumcisions under the Old Testament, one in the heart, another in the flesh</hi>; he granteth the Consequence, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth his Adversary of Levity in using such an Argument. Well then with as little absurdity, we grant his Consequence: <hi>viz.</hi> That in some sense there are two Baptisms in the Church, though in another Sense, there be but one; <hi>viz.</hi> considered complexly of the Sign, it is understood in the place in hand; and indeed one might as well have reasoned to presse Unity among the Jews, that there was but one Circumcision, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth from the one Baptism. And for any thing I know, the Word Circumcision is not used in the plural Number in the Scriptures. And if he say, that it is spoken of as twofold Rom. 2.28, 29, I answer: so is Baptism spoken of. 1 Pet. 3.21.</p>
               <p>Another Reason of his Antagonist, against his meaning of this place, is, <hi>that he may as well conclude from this place, that there is but one Faith, as that there is but one Baptism.</hi> And yet there are diverse kinds of Faith mentioned in Scripture, as sometimes, for the Doctrine of Faith Gal. 1.23. And for the outward Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Faith. 1 Tim. 1.19. The Faith of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, or the like. To which he answereth, <hi>that all these are included in the one Faith here spoken of. And to say that Baptism with water is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that one Baptism is a begging of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:95059:123"/>
Ans. It is no more a begging of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, than that all these kinds of Faith are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this one Faith. If he think otherwise, let him prove it. But he thinketh it rather fit to shift, and give naked assertions. For what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is there why the Baptism with water is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this one Baptism, more than that these other kinds of Faith, are not included? He may shew this if he please, for this is that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent to him to prove: That Baptism with Water is not included, as well as these various Kinds of Faith. 2. How will he prove that the Faith of Miracles is included in this one Faith? I do believe this will trouble him. And when he has done these two, then he may bring up his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chillean Argument, viz. <hi>that such as were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with water were not baptised; Therefore baptism with water is not the baptism of Christ.</hi> Which Sophism might have been as well made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Circumcision as Baptism, as we have but even now shown. He is angry at his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist for telling him, that he hath stollen his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>Socinians,</hi> saying, <hi>he never read three lines of him.</hi> Answer, neither did ever I hear one line in <hi>Socinus</hi> his own Book, yet I have heard an hundred of <hi>Socinus</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He miserably bewrayeth his genious: For if he without reading of their Writings, still fall upon the Socinian Arguments, then how near of kin must he and they be. But this he still doth, as the whole Series of his Adversaries Book declareth, still citing the Book, and page of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95059:124"/>
the Socinian Writings, where his Arguments are to be found. Which he dare not deny, whereas he should vindicat pag. 164. his Doctrine built upon 1 Pet. 3.21. he sayeth meer nothing. But only <hi>that his Adversary giveth meer Assertions.</hi> But he doth not attempt to impugn them. And is this urging, and Vindication of his Arguments. How desperat must his Cause be! When he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the very place, upon which they found the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogation of Baptism, without attempting to prove his own meaning of it. Next I say that whatever I can build upon this place, against Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism with Water, the same Argument might have still holden against Circumcision in the flesh: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still it was true, that he is not a Jew, that is one outwardly, and that that is not Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which is outward in the flesh, but that he is a Jew that is one inwardly, and that is Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision that is of the Heart, and Spirit, and not of the Letter <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29. In a word whatever they shal say against Baptism with Water, from this place of <hi>Peter,</hi> there is still as much to be said against Circumcision with hands, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven during the Law, flowing from the perpetual Truth of this place of Paul to the Rom: But I think themselves will not say, it militates any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Circumcision made with hands, during the Law. Ergo they ought to conclude nothing from this place of Peter against Baptism with Water. Here he sayeth <hi>that his Adversaries answer to this
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95059:124"/>
Argument from this place of Peter. and Gal.</hi> 3: 27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 12, <hi>is built upon the Supposition, that Water-Baptism goeth to the making up of Christs Baptism.</hi> And then sayeth, <hi>he will expect his proof of his exposition of these places,</hi> is not that fair arguing, Reader, to frame an Argument from a place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and when the Defendent denyeth such a thing followeth from this Scripture, to tell him he has lost the Cause, unless that he prove that it will not follow? But seing he is the impugner in this place, if he had not intended to expose himself, and his party to scorn, he had certainly at least attempted to prove his own Expositions of these places, and urged his two Arguments, which in his <hi>Apology</hi> were <hi>in modo &amp; figura.</hi> But this heat of dispute was soon allayed; For so hath his Antagonist combated with him, that he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayeth not to reinforce them. See pag. 473.479. How seared must these Mens Consciences be! when they endeavour to put a cheat upon the World in so weighty a business. 2. It's most groundless to say, that there is any <hi>petitio principij</hi> here, as the Quaker insinuateth.</p>
               <p>Next he cometh to reply to his adversaries 9. <hi>Num</hi>: Where he had evinced that <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptism was not a figure of Christs. And passing the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of what he had said, he only compendizeth his Apologie, saying, <hi>that Iohns Baptism was a washing with Water, &amp; that the Apostle ascribeth the putting on Christ to the Baptism of Christ, as washing with water Typifieth or signifieth the washing of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so doth Iohns Baptism that of Christ.</hi> But
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95059:125"/>
all this was obviat before, while his adversary an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered his Argument, wherewith he intended to prove his third proposition, denying, that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Christ is only the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, and with fire: asserting also, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good grounds, <hi>that the Baptism with water is Christs Baptism instituted by Him,</hi> see the Forecit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Numb.</p>
               <p>Next <hi>I</hi> say that <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptism, as being institute by Christ, and comprehending the thing signified, is not only Baptism with water, but Christs whole true Baptism, and so this quibling is groundless.</p>
               <p>Neither is that which followeth any solider, where he sayeth because his adversary denyeth, (<hi>he must encrease, but I must decrease</hi>) to be meaned of the abolition of <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptism, <hi>that then if this be meaned of their persons, Iohn grew more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit, and Christ more tall, Spectatum admissi risum teneatis</hi>? Was there not another member of the disjunction? I answer therefore to this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable cavil, that the meaning of the place is, that the person of Christ was to grow more and more in honour, and glory, so that within a little the fame, and repute of <hi>Iohn</hi> was to be eclipsed through the brightness and splendour of Christ.</p>
               <p>Next he sayeth, that <hi>though Iohn had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for baptism, it will not follow that it was no legal rite.</hi> Ans. It will well follow, for all the legal Rites, such as held forth Christ, and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by way of Type, to the whole Church, which each Member was to practise, were either insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute by Moses, or before him. The design of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95059:125"/>
which was that the people might see Christ, though darklie as in a Glass, untill the time of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore this could not be a legal Rite, which was commanded directly at the coming of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, and at his verie appearance, preaching to the world, when there could be no use of legal Rites, but these which were within a little to be abolished. 2. All the Legal Rites are abrogat in the New Testament, but no where is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given to John recalled, and his Baptism ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogat: Otherwise let him show me the place of Scripture, (But not 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. which they ordinarilie use.) Either immediatly given by God, or the Apostles contrary approved practise equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a Command. 3. That the Baptism of John was a Gospel Ordinance is clear from <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.12, 13. Where it is said, <hi>that the Law and the Prophets prophesied until Ioh.</hi> To which place, <hi>I</hi> know they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily answer, that (untill) doth not exclude John But this is refuted abundantly by the former vers. For in the time of the Law the Kingdom of Heaven cannot be said to suffer violence, and yet it suffered Violence in the dayes of John. And certain it is that this particle, if it be not taken exclusively here, can be so taken no where else in Scripture, as the collation of this with other places will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. 4. No legal thing, person, or Rite was prophesied of in the Old Testament, but John was clearly prophesied of, as a sweet Gospel Minister<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> E. There is no reason to Judge, that John was a Legal Minister, or had Legal commands.</p>
               <p>Next he cometh to vindicate what he deduced
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95059:126"/>
from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. Where he only seeketh to shift, neglecting whollie what his adversary sayeth, see <hi>Pag.</hi> 476. N. 12.</p>
               <p>The first of these shiftings are, That because his Antagonist sayeth, <hi>why did Paul baptise, if he had not a Commission?</hi> He answereth, <hi>that this a quarrelling with the Apostle.</hi> What strange dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuitie is this? To say, he quarrelleth with the Apostle, when he only quarrelled with the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers exposition. And upon the supposed truth of this inferred this absurditie, that the Apostle did that which he ought not to do, which being false, his exposition cannot be true. Thus a Man might say still, when one inferred an absurditie from his exposition of a place of Scripture, that he were fixing absurdities upon the Spirit of God. For he knoweth that we expone Pauls words (that he was not sent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>o baptise) for the lesse principal part of his errand, according to <hi>Hos</hi>: 6.6. <hi>Matth</hi>: 9. <hi>Ier</hi>: 2.23. and many other places, even though there be no explicative clause following, as he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth is in <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.6. providing that there be no absurditie following upon this gloss. And beside this, there are good reasons why we should so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone the phrase here. For first the Apostle insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth clearly, that all these Corinthians were Baptised, without reproving them for it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he still reproveth the Gentiles for using of, and tenaciously sticking to Jewish Rites, or any man that imposed them upon them, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or doctrine, as the body of the Epistle to the <hi>Gal.</hi> doth declare. 2. he doth not say, that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95059:126"/>
his Fellow-Apostles were not sent to baptise, but nameth himself alone. 3. He still did administrat this Sacrament to the Gentiles, upon their embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christianity, as his recorded practise doth declare, which <hi>Mr. Brown</hi> hath shewed, but the <hi>Quaker</hi> most disingenuously passeth over; let him not therefore object, that to expone the like phrase, where the thing is said <hi>not to be,</hi> for to be <hi>less principal would make wild work</hi>: Seing we give sufficient reasons for our explication of this place, and do not plead for the phrase to be still so exponed, but only where the Nature of the subject matter will permit it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He cometh <hi>pag</hi> 166. to answer our argument from <hi>Matth</hi>: 28, 19. And first he denyeth that the Apostles while Christ was with them, baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Christs warrand; and sayeth, he will wait his adversaries proof of it. Ans: He hath done it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> already from <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.26 and, 4, 3. Of which places the <hi>Quaker</hi> durst not adventure to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. We shall therefore wait what he sayeth the next time against them. 2. He sayeth the Apostle did eat the passover with <hi>Christs warrand, yet it followeth not that we ought to do it. Ans.</hi> There is no paritie between these two practises; will he say that ever the eating of the passover was imposed upon the Gentiles as they did Baptism, as a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie consequent of their embracing of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as the whole Tenor of the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles declareth? 2. The Passover was a Legal Custom introduced many hundreds of Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Baptism was but in its verie rise and beginning.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:95059:127"/>2. He sayeth, <hi>that though it be joyned with Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as Circumcision was joyned with it among the Iews, it will no more follow that Baptism, is to be continued, then that Circumcision is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</hi> Ans: that the Baptism here spoken of, is to be continued, I think himself will not deny. We speak now of the institution of an ordinance given to the Christian Church. Therefore this his consequence of Circumcision is vain, and without the least appearance of Reason.</p>
               <p>Lastly this Reason is wholly non-sense, for none can perceive what it levelleth at.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He denyeth that the Apostles constant practice can declare, that Baptism with water is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Command. <hi>For,</hi> sayeth he, <hi>the practice and testimony of the Apostle Paul declareth this to be false.</hi> Ans: 1. That this which he sayeth of the Apostle is false, we have proved above. 2. All things practised by the Apostle must be reduced to three sorts, either commanded, permitted, or simply sinful. This last <hi>I</hi> think they will not say their practice of Baptism was, neither do they say it, but only that it was an indifferent Jewish Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e, permitted for the time, as Circumcision, or the like. But this is false. For either such Rites were not at all imposed on the Gentiles, Or if they were, they were after abrogated. As for example, abstinence from blood, and things strangled, enjoyned <hi>Act</hi> 15. This I say was again abrogat 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 10. and in the Epistles to the <hi>Gal.</hi> and <hi>Tim.</hi> (2.) That it is not an indifferent Jewish Rite, clearly appeareth from this, that the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95059:127"/>
reason why they impose Jewish Rites upon any Christian, whether Jew or Gentile, was to bear with the Jews for a time, and to condescend to their weakness. But the condition of baptism, was still their embracing of Christ; and the ground of it, their receiving of them into the Church. In a word Condescension to the Jews weakness, is in Scripture ever holden forth to be the ground of the imposition of Legal Rites upon Christians. So that there is mention made of this ground for every particular Rite imposed; but this condescension is never said to be the ground of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Baptism, but a quite other ground given, which we named already. 3. If this had been a thing only permitted for a time, and to be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat afterwards, then either the Apostles unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed practice, which they exercised toward all Christians indifferently, and that as such were not sufficient to walk by: Or else this was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat afterward, but the last they cannot shew from Scripture? Therefore it is false, and the first ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd. From all which it followeth, that this was a Commanded practice. And <hi>I</hi> desire any man of Reason, to Judge whether all the Apostles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual unrepealed practice, or these mens naked assertions, be the best Commentarie on this place. 4. He denyeth that the word Baptism, as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone it, is taken in its proper signification, and sayeth, <hi>that it is not necessarie to take it as we do, for Baptism with water, in so many places, as it must be taken for baptism with the spirit.</hi> Ans. This a meer assertion. In opposition to which I say, that he shall not be able to give one place of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95059:128"/>
Scripture, where this word is undoubtedly taken in their sense; but <hi>I</hi> shall give him two, where the word is taken in the sense, which here we plead for, and that undoubtedly. And so there is a double improprietie in the <hi>Quakers</hi> exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>sition of the word, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st against the Grammatical, and 2. the Scriptural propriety. We expect therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own <hi>Postulatum,</hi> that he will give some more weighty reasons the next time of this expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Next I reason thus. To Baptise with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not in all the Scripture applyed to Men; Therefore it is not safe without verie solid reasons, to expone it so here.</p>
               <p>Again, all that they understand by this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Baptism, is sufficiently expressed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. Er. There is no necessity to flee to this strange exposition.</p>
               <p>Lastly This exposition is the product of the brain of Diabolick <hi>Socinus,</hi> as its first Author; which I think will make it be suspected; and (seing it wants all ground) abhorred of all the Lovers of Christ Jesus, seing this arch-enemy of his invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the shifts and sophistry, the Devil and he could, to destroy both the God-head of Christ, and all his Ordinances. His following words are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered above.</p>
               <p>Next as for what he sayeth in opposition to the 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> of this chap. in his 168 pag. it is so miserable, that I only desire the Reader to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare these two places together. Whereas he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth in this page, that <hi>Peter</hi> Commanded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95059:128"/>
the Gentiles to be circumcised, which he buildeth upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 2, 12. is most false. For the reason why <hi>Paul</hi> reproved him, was his dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation mentioned in that chapter, and no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Command, if he will give us Leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone Scripture by Scripture. He sayeth, as if <hi>Mr. Brown</hi> had denyed it, that <hi>Iosephus</hi> writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 200 Year of Christ. Whereas he sayeth, that the first which wrot the Jewish <hi>Alcoran,</hi> or <hi>Misanioth,</hi> with a tendencie to destroy Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was <hi>Rabi Iehuda Hakkadosh,</hi> about the 200 year of Christ. As now the <hi>Quakers</hi> do.</p>

               <head>SECTION II. Concerning the Lords Supper.</head>
               <p>IT is most notour, that as the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny Baptism, so they deny the Lords Supper. See his 13 proposition, with his <hi>Apology</hi> annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, where he maketh this only to be a Legal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
               <p>It will be needless for me to take Notice of what he sayeth <hi>pag</hi> 170. <hi>viz. That his Adversary pag</hi> 489, <hi>maketh a Preaching to the Devil,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he only inferreth from their Doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Salvation to every Creature, that they may preach to the Devil according to their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Hence we may learn how impudent these men are! Just as if because <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> had
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95059:129"/>
challenged a man of murder; he that is challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, should conclude that Robert Barclay called himself a Murderer. As false, though not so ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, is that, of which he challengeth one Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near <hi>Lawther.</hi> viz. that <hi>he prayed to the Devil.</hi> But he dare not name the man who did it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these who heard it; Therefore let him bear the just censure of a Calumniator (to say no more) until he name the man, and prove it.</p>
               <p>When he cometh to the matter it self, he is as weak, as before he was wicked. For in stead of pressing his Argument against the Lords Supper, viz. <hi>That if there were a relation between the Body, and Blood of Christ, and the Bread, and Wine in the Sacrament, then it would either flow from the nature of the thing, or the Command.</hi> And while his Adversary denyeth, that an institution, and promise is all one with a Command. All his probation is his meer assertion, that they are in all respects one, neglecting the reason that his Adversary gave for his denyal. But why should I take notice of such a shameful Vindication, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very shew and appearance of reason. To the rest of his 11 <hi>paragraph,</hi> in which by many weighty Arguments, this duty is proved from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. he sayeth only, <hi>that he speaketh not to the purpose,</hi> without so much as attempting to wipe off his reasons.</p>
               <p>He cometh to answer his 12 number, and first sayeth, <hi>that the Blessing, and Eating, spoken of Mat</hi>: 14, 19. <hi>will as much prove a Sacrament, as these places of the Gospel, and the Epistle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95059:129"/>
ordinarily brought, can do it.</hi> But this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary never inferred any thing of this kind, from simple blessing: But from other things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But we must excuse him, seing he doth as well as he can. His next words are a meer Compend of what he said against our meaning of 1 <hi>Cor</hi>: 11. in his <hi>Apology,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so much as attempting to answer his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries 14. Num: to which I referr the Reader. He sayeth indeed, which is as good as nothing <hi>that the Institution of the Sacrament,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>was a Permission; and therefore the practise thereof was not will-worship.</hi> But upon the same account he may elude any Command in Scripture. For that there was a Command for this practice, he granteth; and that the Apostle correcteth the abuse of this practice, he granteth also, without so much as mentioning its indifferency. Neither can he shew in all the Scripture, where this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was abrogat, or the practice prohibited, as other things indifferent were. What <hi>Titanian</hi> boldness must this then be, to say this was by meer Permission!</p>
               <p>In Opposition to his 16 Num: where his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary sheweth the disparity, between Christs teaching his Apostles Humility, by his Example of washing their feet, and his Command and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of this Ordinance, he sayeth meer nothing, but calleth him a Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:95059:130"/>In Opposition to Num 17. he sayeth he should prove from Scripture, how they are safe in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the one part (ridiculously calling the whole Duty one part) and not the other (meaning the occasional Circumstances of time, and place, and the number of twelve, and the like, which he as foolishly calleth another part of the Institution) But his Adversary sheweth from many places of Scripture in the forecited Num: such as Act: 26: 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 18. and 20. That these Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not to be observed, but left indifferent. But this man still intendeth to cheat his Reader, by passing over the Marrow of what his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary sayeth.</p>
               <p>What he sayeth in Opposition to N: 18, Is a meer denyal that <hi>Act</hi> 2, 42, is meaned of the Lords Supper, without so much as the least attempt, to answer his reasons, or to Vindicat what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self said in his <hi>Apology,</hi> in opposition to our meaning of this place, Neither is he more happy in answering his 19 Num: where he proved that in <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. Is understood publick and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Eating. For he, according to his Custom, slighteth his reason; as the Comparer may see (what he sayeth in opposition to the follwing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> is of the same Nature. <hi>viz.</hi> meer Assertions, false Suppositions, such as, <hi>that the Corinthians were superstitious, in that they at all practised this Duty of the Lords Supper.</hi> Yet one thing I will take notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> how he vindicateth his Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer given to that argument, drawn from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 26. <hi>Ye shew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:95059:130"/>
Which is, <hi>That by Christs coming, is understood his inward, Spiritual coming.</hi> Which answer his Adversary so happily impugneth, that he on the matter sayeth nothing, except ye will call this something, viz. <hi>That Babes in Christ may have these indulged unto them</hi>: But his Answer still cutteth off Babes with the rest, seing to them Christ is come in the Spirit already. But it is needless at all to Impugn this distinction, its own groundles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sufficiently doth it.</p>
               <p>He cometh next to answer his 21 and 22 Num: and there he asserteth,
<q>That that which the Christians were enjoyned to Observe, <hi>Act,</hi> 15, 29. was no part of the Ceremonial Law, but an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Command and thinketh that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can plead for the abrogation of this Injunction, will also plead for the abrogation of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</q>
But taketh no notice, that his Antagonist shewed that there is no little Vanity, and impiety in his adducing <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. To prove this; and therefore he shamefully passeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what he sayeth on these places, and so giveth up this his <hi>Socinian</hi> Cause. For he that is a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> in this point, he doeth not deny, he sayeth,
<q>That this Command seing it was given after the out-pouring of the Spirit, hath as much of a Gospel Institution, as any thing commanded before by Christ can have.</q>
Ans. Well then I see, we will be no more troubled with quaking preachers, seing this Command <hi>Act.</hi> 15. according to himself is repealed, and yet hath as much of a Gospel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, as preaching hath <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95059:131"/>
it will as well follow from Col. 2.20. that preaching of the Gospel is abrogat, and not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now by Christ, as from v 16, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 17. that the Lords Supper is now abrogat, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Christ. Now, let both old and new <hi>Socinians</hi> (I mean the <hi>Quakers</hi>) try to infringe this if they can. And I shall still infer the one upon as good ground, as they can do the other.

            <head>AN APPENDIX. IN which the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, and in special of the Reverend assembly at Westminster, in their Confession of Faith, Chap. 3. deduced from the Ninth chap: to the Romans defended, and the Text Vindicated from the Corrupt Glosses and Depravations of Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Parker, and his pretended examination of the Westminster Confession, which Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay hath made his own by referring us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as sufficient solutions of all our arguments for our Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, deduced from that place.</head>
            <p>AMongst the many and damnable Errors which the Quakers have raised out of their Graves, that of their denying Eternal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or at best making it whollie condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, uncertain, and depending upon the will of the Creature, so that notwithstanding the Decree of God to the contrary, it might so have fallen out, that none should have been saved, is not the least: In which they conspire with the grossest of Pelagians, but the downright and most palp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contrariety of this their Doctrine of the holy Scriptures, which they sometimes would fain seem to follow, hath made the more knowing among them to conceal so far as they are able, their thoughts anent the Doctrine of Election; Thus dealt <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> who in all his Theses and Apology, tho in his account <hi>an entire System of Religion,</hi> never delivereth his minde therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95059:132"/>And <hi>Vindic. Sect.</hi> 6. In defence of this non-such Omission, he sayeth only, 
<q>
                  <hi>that all do at times Confess, that it is not safe, nor proper too curiously to inquire into the Decrees of God,</hi> which he proof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly alledgeth his adversary to have done: and that it is only needful to say, God calleth every Man every where to Repent, and be saved through Faith in Jesus Christ:</q>
Neither doth he any where directly Impugn our Doctrine of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And yet he feircely falleth upon our Doctrine of Reprobation, and thus declareth to the World his self-repugnancy, seing none can be ignorant, that our Doctrine of Reciprobation is Reprocally and inseparably linked to that of Election. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he thus publisheth his Mind concerning Election, altho he by all Means endeavours to conceal it; for whoever denyeth Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by an Infallible Consequence downright deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Election: And thus, Nill he, will he, we have his mind positively anent Election, and also Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intimated, that his Judgement about Election cannot abide to be tryed by the Scripture Bench. And yet <hi>I</hi> think few will say, That his Doctrine of positive and dounright denyal of Reprobation is much better founded; seing he with a Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical silence, passeth over all his Adversaries ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, proving all our Doctrine there anent. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>num:</hi> 10.11. These Arguments I say, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty in Number, he doth nor so much as mention, and far less attempt a Solution thereof, altho he knew well enough, that except these be untyed, the whole frame of Quakerism is entirely
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95059:132"/>
dissolved. But in stead of Resolution of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries arguments, as he doth all along, he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the World a meer Contract of his Apologie, under the cheating Title of a <hi>Vindication.</hi> But when his adversarie saith, <hi>That the Quaker can no more Impugn our Doctrine, than he can Impugn what the Apostle saith, Rom.</hi> 9, 19. The Quaker <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>pag</hi> 67. answereth two things; 1. That this is all one, as if a Quaker should say, <hi>confute all the Scripture which contain our Doctrine, and therefore dispute no more, untill Thou first do that.</hi> But the Man is good, where there is little to do: But if he had not intended to play the shifter, he had condescended upon some particular place, as his adversarie did, otherwise he no less declareth his own fear than <hi>Darius</hi> did, when he objected to his pursuing Enemie, That he could not be subdued, because of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pacious Countries, thorow which it behoved Him to follow him. 2. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his Antagonist to the Examination of the <hi>Westminster Confession, chap</hi>: 3. Where saith he, <hi>he may have his misapprehensions corrected.</hi> But How cometh it to pass that the Quaker hath taken no notice of many Authors, as <hi>Twiss, Rutherford, Dickson,</hi> to whom his Adversarie in this very point did refer him. 2. But his care is not very great of Commutative Justice.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding of which, <hi>Ex abundanti</hi> we will make a particular and impartial enquirie into all that he bringeth against the meaning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches upon that place. The Author is an Enthusiastical Arminian, called <hi>William Parker</hi> who

            <p>I Reply, this commentarie (I shall not say a comment) is founded upon some Scriptures vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie detorted; for none of them doth in the least insinuat, that these of whom they speak were chosen to grace only, &amp; not to glory (which ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less distinction was invented of old by the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and condemned and refuted by the Orthodox, as is evident in the <hi>Epistles</hi> of <hi>Prosper,</hi> and <hi>Hilarius Arelatensis</hi>) and tendeth to the overthrow of the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the promises of God the Father to Christ, viz. that he should see his seed, and the travel of his soul. Isa. 53.10, 11. and many such like, for if this Doctrine were true, it might so fall out, that none should come to Glory; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, the gift of perseverance is bestowed upon none, and so the Apostle's perswasion, that <hi>None could separate him from the Love of God, Rom</hi>: 8.35. Should have been vain and groundless. And the promise to cause the <hi>Israel</hi> of God to keep his Statutes and his Judgments, to do them, <hi>Ext</hi> 36, 27. Should be meer words of deceit; these and six hundred beside of such absurd blasphemies are unseparably linked to this Doctrine. As for the Scriptures cited by him, they hold forth a Character of such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95059:134"/>
but they do not at all hold forth, that these graces, and perseverance therein are in Mans own power, so that he may reject or refuse them, according to the inclinations of his own will, and that God doth not make Men irresistibly, yet sweetly of unwilling to become willing. All which this Neo-<hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> through the Violence of torture makes these Scriptures to speak, but the verse it self doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently refute this exposition; for according to it, the word or promises of God, might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect, seing it might fall out, that tho all were elected, none might be saved. Now seing this Exposition cannot Stand, the other, which this <hi>Arminian</hi> would fain reject, of its own accord follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That not all, and every one is from all Eternitie elected, and chosen to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as the whole Scope and series of this Chapter doth demonstrate, as we shall evince, while we reply in particular to the Answers he makes to the objections, which he frames from this place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He goeth on thus, Rom: 9.7.
<q>Neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the Seed of Abraham, are they all Children, but in Isaac shall thy seed be called. Where the Apostle alludeth to <hi>Gen</hi> 17.18, 19, 20, 21. It may seem then, that only Isaac and not Ismael was chosen. Ans. Isaac was chosen alone to be the representative seed of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Type, first of Christ, in whom God hath made his Covenant. 2. He being a seed born by Sarah, represents Faith out of the promises, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by the Strength of Nature: So is a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95059:134"/>
Figure of the Spiritual Seed of Abraham, which are begotten or born by vertue of the promises. For so the Apostle explains himself v. 8. That is, they which are the Children of the Flesh (of whom Ismael carried the Type) These are not the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, but the Children of promise are counted for the Seed: As for Ismael, who was begotten by the Strength of Nature, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Flesh of Hagar, which represents the the Law, Gal. 4.21, 31: He figured forth these which should be saved, not by the grace of the promises, but by the works of the Law, a people, with whom God has not erected His Covenant, that they should be saved in that way, but tho Ismael carried the Figure of such, it was without any prejudice to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Election or Salvation: For Abraham pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus for him, Gen: 17.18. O that Ismael might live before Thee, or in thy presence. v: 20 As for Ismael, I have heard thee. His being such a Type, was no more prejudicial to Him, then that Moses and Aaron were debarred entrance into Canaan (They therein being a Figure of those, that should be shut out of Gods Kingdom for unbelief) without any hazard to their own Salvation, as hath been said before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In order to our Reply to this and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Objections, we premit. 1. That this and the following Verses of this Chapter, are brought in by the Apostle, as Arguments, to prove his Proposition laid down, v. 6. viz. <hi>That all are not Israel, that are of Israel,</hi> therefore whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95059:135"/>
floweth from these Verses, as their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Consequents, is the meaning of the sixth Verse. 2. That the convincing clearness of this place hath forced all to acknowledge, that the Apostle is here speaking of Predestination of men, in order to their eternal estate, and not as to the things of this Life only, as <hi>Bellarmin de Grat et Lib. Arb.</hi> L. 2. <hi>C.</hi> 15. <hi>Stapleton Ant, pag.</hi> 526. And among the modern Lutherans, <hi>Hunnius</hi> upon the place in hand, <hi>who confesseth that the Apostle digresseth into the large field of Predestination.</hi> Yea <hi>Arminius</hi> himself, in his Analysis of this Chapter, dareth not deny it, tho he fain would. Having premised these things, we come to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, The Substance of which is<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>That Ismael</hi> was not himself rejected of God, but only a Type of these that are not the Children of God, which we shal refute, by evincing these two Things. 1. That tho Ismael be considered here as a Type only, this place gives good ground for the Doctrine of our Confession of Faith, against which he here fighteth. 2. That Ismael himself was not ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. As for the first of these Propositions, it is evident; For otherwise there should be no Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence betwixt the Type and the Antitype, and so a Type should not be a Type. I prove it: If Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael was excluded from being counted the Seed of Abraham, only by the meer good pleasure and absolute Dispensation of God, and not conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, so that Ismael himself could have caused it to come to pass, that he should have been counted the Legittimate Heir and Lawful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:95059:135"/>
Son of Abraham, of whom the Church and Christ according to the Flesh was to Spring, then there are some passed by in the Eternal Decree of God, and that absolutely, to whom God from all Eternity determined to give no Saving Grace, but punish them for their sins; But the Former is true, yea and so true, that (<hi>I</hi> am sure) none acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Scriptures will deny it. The Major is no less clear, except (as we said before) any shal be so absurd, as to deny a Correspondency or Analogy betwixt Type and Antitype, and so deny a Type to be a Type, for in this Ismael was a Type, in that he was not reckoned to be the Seed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and a Child of the Flesh, not a Child of Promise, all which came to pass by the absolute Dispensation of God, and not conditionally, so that Ismael might have brought to pass, that he should have been the Legittimate Heir and Seed of Abraham, and born by Vertue of a special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: Neither on the other hand was the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Isaac unto these Priviledges, from which Ismael was excluded, conditional, but by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Dispensation of God: For <hi>I</hi> think none will say, that Isaac could have hindered himself to be born by Vertue of a special promise, and so coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the only Son, as we see he is called Gen. 22. 2. Therefore, if there be any Correspondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Type and Antitype, the Lord from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity did pass by some, that is, decreed that he would not give them Grace, but permit them to remain Children of the Flesh, whom he did not give unto Christ Jesus, to be his Seed by Vertue
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95059:136"/>
of the Promises of the Covenant of Redemption.</p>
            <p>We come now to the second Proposition viz. <hi>That Ismael himself was not Elected,</hi> This by any thing we can learn from Scripture, is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For 1. He was by Gods own Command thrust out of the Church, Gen. 21.12. And that upon the Account of his persecuting the Heir of Promise, and the Church and Image of God in him. Gen. 21.9. Gal. 4.29. Now in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we find no mention made of his Repentance, or Re-admission into the Church: Hence there is no Ground of Charity concerning his Salvation. 2. We find nothing that Ismael exercised all his Life, except Robbery and Blood-shed, as appears from Gen. 16.12. and 20 v. Which Lessons the Saracens his Posterity have exactly learned from him. As for Gen. 17.18, 20. It speaks of nothing lesse than the Salvation of Ismael: for as it appears from verses 19.20. compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Lord clearly intimates, that he will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther establish his Covenant with himself, nor with his Seed, and clearly asserts, that the things in which he heard Abraham for his son Ismael, was only these pertaining to this Life: From all which it is clear, that Ismael lived and died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace, or special Favour of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was no Elect Vessel; for I believe that none will deny, that the making out by Scripture, that Ismael lived without the Special Favour of God, will abundantly clear this place from all the mist, whereby our Adversaries endeavour to darken it; That which he sayes of <hi>Moses and Aaron, their
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95059:136"/>
being Types of these who were to be excluded from Gods spiritual rest, who notwithstanding were god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly themselves,</hi> is so far from saying any thing to the Purpose, that I am certain he considered not what he was saying: For who did ever infer sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, because he was a Type of those that were passed by in Gods Eternal Decree, therefore he was passed by in it himself, we make no such Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as may be seen from what we have already said. I might here take notice of many other things, such as his forming the Objection, so that he dissimulates no small part of the strength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not at all taking notice of the Analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Type and Antitype, he knew to be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not a little by our Divines, notwithstanding that he himself asserreth Ismael to be a Type, and so considered in this place, 2. I might take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that he clearly intimates, that there is now a possibility of Salvation by the Works of the Law and Strength of Nature. If it be Replyed, that he qualifieth what he saith by the following words, viz. <hi>that God hath not made a Covenant that men should be saved this way.</hi> We return, That if his Principles stand, these words and the former must of Necessity compleat a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for all these that were to be born (to use his own Words) by Vertue of the Promises, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac represented them, but Ismael represented not these, but others; now seing these represented by Ismael, might be saved, as well as these represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Isaac, according to the Principles of the Universalists, it inevitably follows, that they must be saved by the Works of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:95059:137"/>His next Objection he gives in these Words to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his answer, is Rom. 9.10, 11.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It is said there is a Purpose of God, according to Election, not of Works, but of him that calleth.</p>
               <p>Ans. Altho Election there seems to import nothing but Gods Grace, as the Explanation following (not of Works, but of him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth) will in some sort evict, yet we grant there is a Purpose of God, both according to Election of Persons and Things, and that either General or Special, as hath been by us already often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and the Eternal Election of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in Mankind now fallen, whether General or Particular is out of Grace, and not by their own Works, wrought by the Strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, howbeit in that Special or Particular Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on arising out of the special Foreknowledge of God; Works of Grace and perseverance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are looked upon as Means and the way to Life, yea as a Condition, and a Motive both in that and the final Election of the Saints, which we call the Election out of the Furnace, Rev. 3.4. Thou hast a few Names in Sardis, which have not defiled their Garments, and they shal walk with me in white, Rev. 3, 8. Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it, for thou hast a little Strength, and hast kept my Word, and not denyed my Name. Read more at large, Rev. 7.13, 14, 16, 17.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Reply, This answer, tho I will not say the best, is the rarest that any man could have readily light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on: for to assert the cause of Election to be Grace,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95059:137"/>
and yet to be some stages behind good works, as he doth here, while he acknowledgeth Election to be of works, not wrought by the strength of Nature, as saying somewhat more, then when he granted Election to be of Grace, is certainly so absurd, that one can invent nothing more absurd, tho he bend his wit to the very purpose, for then it were all one to say, that works done by the strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are the cause of Election, and Grace is the cause of Election: or Election is of Grace, and Election is of works, done by the strength of Nature were Equipollent. 2. That Election is Grace, or rather to speak with the Apostle, <hi>Rom</hi> 11.5<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> of Grace, is most certain, but he takes again his Confession, and soon repents that he hath spoken the Truth, while he maketh Election to be of Works, tho not wrought by the strength of Nature, and maketh these to be Motives moving God to Elect some rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, quite contrary to the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. who makes a clear Opposition betwixt Grace, and Works, of whatsoever kind in the point of Election. But 3ly. He is yet more blasphemous and absurd, in that while the Apostle telleth us, that by these words, <hi>but of him that calleth,</hi> work; in general, or without limitation are excluded, he will in spite of him, force this very same Phrase to include Works. But 4ly. That the Apostle here excludeth all kind of Works from being the cause of Election, is clear from the Connection of the Words with what go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before and followeth; for these words (<hi>that the purpose of God &amp;c.</hi>) cite the consequent of the Apostolick En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>hymem, of which the words going
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95059:138"/>
before in this verse, and the following is the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent: which two propositions the particle <hi>(that)</hi> coupleth, obtaining the place of the Particle <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>; But this Antecedent, or the Apostle by it most carefully excludes all kind of Works, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause of Gods preferring <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Esau,</hi> Therefore no kind of Works can be the cause, why God elected some, while he rejected others. Now it is to be observed, that even giving, and not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> to be considered here only as Types, that this our conclusion will well follow, seing without respect to their future Works, it was determined, That the younger should have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, Lordship and Dominion, and the elder contrary to the custom of Humane Laws, only for the good pleasure of God, was to be excluded from them. Now we say, seing there must be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy betwixt Type and Antitype, of necessity some must be appointed to the heavenly Canaan, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Dominion, without consideration of their doing good, as the cause moving God to this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And some must be excluded from this Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Canaan, Inheritance, and Dominion, without the consideration of their evil deeds, as the cause moving thereunto; If any should say, tho the Children had done neither good nor evil, yet the Lord foreseeing the good deeds of the one, and the evil of the other, did so and so decree concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they can say nothing more absurd, and antiscriptural; For 1. then there can be nothing made of these words, <hi>(neither having yet done good or evil)</hi> neither can any reason be shewed,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95059:138"/>
why they were here cast in by the Apostle. But 2. and more particularly, these words of necessity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude some kind of works from being the cause of Election or Rejection; Ergo they exclude works of whatsoever kind, seing they exclude without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the doing of good or evil, and so render that distinction of Works, done by the strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by the help of Grace, of which he here talketh, altogether groundless; yea according to this distinction of his, one might say, that such good works are here only excluded, which tho good as to the substance of the Action, yet are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with no kind of sincerity and singlness, but are intended directly for a sinful end: But good works accompanied with any kind of sincerity, and having no sinful end directly intended, tho they be notwithstanding wrought only by the strength of Nature, are not excluded; I say, according to his distinction, this might be said. For the Text affords a like ground for both; which assertion he that denyeth, is bound to give a ground for the one, more than for the other, from the Text. 3ly: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles conclusion drawn from this Text, which is, as hath been shewed, his Antecedent, excluding works without limitation, from being the cause of Election, convinceth all these of contradicting the Scriptures, who will notwithstanding pertinaciously assert, that only some kind of works is excluded. And now from what is said, this his distinction of special and general, that is, certain and uncertain Election falls to the ground; For if the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be not works, but the grace and good-pleasure
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95059:139"/>
of God, then no part of Election can be uncertain, except <hi>(Obstupeo, surgunt que comae, vox faucibus hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret)</hi> they make the good pleasure of God, that is, God himself changeable; and then all Election shall be uncertain, and so this distinction shall fall to the ground however. Behold, Reader, the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy and absurdity, into which these universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists run themselves; For Election, which is the cause of good works, they make to be the Effect of good works, and so something which is eternal, to be the Effect of that which is in time, destroying all kind of order (This Argument <hi>Augustin</hi> useth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Doctrine.

As for the Scriptures brought by him here, we have nothing to say, but only deny, that they make any thing for his vagrant Election, seing he doth not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say to infer any thing in its behalf from them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himself barely to act them, which when we have diligently considered, we cannot find the least appearance of their Doctrine to flow from them; we shall therefore passe on to his ensuing Objection and answer.</p>

Moreover, the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi> clearly intimats, That he is speaking of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> at least rhat he is not speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Seeds, so as to exclude their Persons, <hi>Was not</hi> Esau Jacob's <hi>brother?</hi> which Phrase must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

Hence we conclude with <hi>Junius,</hi> that noble Interpreter of Scripture, on the words, <hi>That in this</hi> 4 <hi>v. is contained a Decument, that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to confirm</hi> Israel, <hi>now brought back from Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, to defend the Land, and to magnifie himself in all things; but on the other hand, that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deprive the</hi> Idumeans, <hi>whom he had Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>He doth not only say, I loved <hi>Jacob</hi> before he was born, but also I hated <hi>Esau</hi> before he was brought forth; But I also have reserved my love and hatred for their Posterity. The other is <hi>Luther, De servo Arbitrio,</hi> Cap, 161<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> who sayes It is not therefore the temerity of the <hi>Idumeans</hi> which is reproved, but the ingratitude
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95059:141"/>
of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> who see not what God bestoweth upon them, and of what he depriveth their Brethren, the Idumites, for no other cause, but because he loved the one, and hated the other.</q>
In which place <hi>Luther</hi> largely demonstrats, that the Prophet here speaks of these things which he did to <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> as the Effect of his eternal love and hatred, in opposition to <hi>Erasmus,</hi> who by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Command of the Pope, did undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctrine, in his <hi>Diatribe de Libero Arbitrio.</hi> Add to all these the History of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> as a good Commentarie on both places, now in hand, which declareth that <hi>Esau</hi> was a profane Person <hi>Heb</hi> 12.16. and elsewhere, and that <hi>Jacob</hi> got grace, and so was saved, which is more than a demonstration, that the Lord deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined from all Eternity, to save the one, and passe by the other, which is the thing we plead for; That which he sayes in the fourth place is true, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his purpose. Seing the Question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not the Apostle in this place handleth the matter of Eternal Election and Reprobation: In the fifth place, he taketh the place of the old <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> who denyed that any godly man ought to be subject to any Magistrat, tho never so just, if he want true Grace; by reason of which Doctrines huge Confusions were raised in <hi>Germany,</hi> as also by <hi>Venner,</hi> who with his Complices began to raise great Tumults in <hi>England,</hi> while he minded to make this Doctrine of our Author practicable.</p>
            <p>He goeth on to deprave the 14. and 15. verses; The substance of what he saith, we shall faithfully
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95059:142"/>
deliver in so far as he militats against our Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Having inferred from these verses by way of an Objection to himself, <hi>That it seems there are some to whom God will not shew mercy.</hi> He answers, <hi>That the Apostle pre-occupies an Objection, which some might make out of the Continuance of Gods Mercy, still to the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>but withdrawn from</hi> Edom, <hi>as before; What shall we say, is there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness with God? Next that</hi> Exod. 33, 19. <hi>here cited by the Apostle, speaks not of Gods first Grace, which he gives to all alike, but of the second which he continueth to these that walk humbly, and answerably to the first, as</hi> Moses <hi>had done.</hi> To which I reply. 1. That he makes his Objection, pre-occupied by the Apostle, to be no Objection: For from the Lords continuance of his Mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Humble-walking under it, and his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the same from <hi>Esau,</hi> upon the abuse thereof, none could infer with any colour of reason, That there is unrighteousness with God, seing the abuse of good things deserveth the Depravation thereof: And so according to him, the Apostle was triffling all the while. Again any that runneth not into willful prejudice, may see that the Apostles objection hath more apparent Strength in the judgement of Humane Reason, by far than our Author maketh it to have; for it is an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence drawn from what the Apostle had said in the former verse, of the absolute rejection of some, while others were Elected, which Doctrine car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reason, as it doth yet, knew too well how to wrest; And from this Doctrine according to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95059:142"/>
Reason no little absurdity seemed to follow: Wherefore the Apostle appeals from its Tribunal to that of the Scriptures, yea even to such a Text as speaketh of the absolute Dominion of God over the Creature. Yea the most absolute imaginable. Now if the objection had been such an one; as this Arminian professeth it, there had been no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Apostles betaking himself to this place of Scripture. 2. What he talketh here of his twofold grace, stands and falls with what he said of his twofold Election, which distinction we have already rejected; for this Distinction of Grace in first and second, it is groundless, for it is not in the least insinuated in this Text, <hi>viz. Exod</hi>: 33: 19. That <hi>Moses</hi> had gotten in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from God some kind of Grace, which had not the Divine power of God coming along there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, causing <hi>Moses</hi> irresistibly, yet sweetly walk in Gods Statutes. But leaving him to use well, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the grace gotten. Now he must prove this from the Text, if he would conclude any thing from it; moreover, If <hi>Moses</hi> speak only of a second grace here, which a first must in Faith and humble walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessarily preceed, then this Text holds forth the Dominion of God to be no more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute over his Creatures, than that of a Magistrate towards his well or ill deserving subjects, whom he ought to reward or punish, according to their desert, and not to whom he will only: And so this Text shall destroy it self. Lastly, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of this universalist were sound, then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Conclusion, which he gathereth in the next verse should not follow, but rather the quite
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95059:143"/>
contrary thereof. For if God give a first grace to all, and that so sufficient, that it lyes only in Mans will to come, or not to come unto God, and that Man hath power either to will or nill, at pleasure, either to turn, or not to turn to God: and yet notwithstanding, some come, and some come not, then all that makes the one to differ from the other, is certainly of him that willeth. The Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of our Antagonist to this 16. verse is rare viz. <hi>Tho our Salvation be meer of Mercy, yet Man can both will and run in some sort, as this Scripture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi>; because he could have said nothing less to to the purpose: For the Argument which may be framed from this verse, and it is not of him that willeth, Ergo Election, or the purpose of God, (one of which words must of necessity be supplyed from verse 11. Otherwise the Apostles words would want a cohesion, and the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> which of necessity must be understood here, shall want a Noun) is not an effect of the will of Man, or of his good works moving God thereunto. Now this Argument is not touched by the answer, as is of it self apparent: He therefore here deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the cause, and endeavoureth to cheat his Reader. 2. This place imports no more a power in all men to will, or run in the way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, than these words in Ezek. 36.22, 32. <hi>Not for your sake,</hi> and leave in all Men a power to merit at the hand of God. He goeth on to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the 17. and 18. verses. And 1. He desires us, <hi>To note that here the Lord doth not say, for this purpose I have created thee, but raised thee up
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95059:143"/>
or brought thee upon the Stage.</hi> But this is the vainest of evasions, for none but an Athiest can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that God from all Eternitie did decree to raise up <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for that same end, for which in time he raised him up: and consequently, that he decreed to create him for the same end, otherwise God failed of his first end, and was forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himself to the next best: Which to affirm is to make God a Man, and so to profess atheism with open face; yea this Doctrine bringeth the wisdom of God below that of a Man, seing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it the omniscient God, did creat <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for an end, which he knew he was never to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But 2. That <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not only brought on the Stage, but also created to the end, that God might manifest His Power and Justice in His Destruction, is clear from Pro<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 16.4. Where it is said, that God made, wrought, formed, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, for all these will the word <hi>Pagnal</hi> bear, all things for Himself, yea even the wicked, the Spirit of God holding forth, that this is a Paradox, unto the day of evil. 2. He sayes, <hi>That Pharaoh was known unto the Lord to be a proud and obstinate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, as is evident, Exod:</hi> 8.2. But what he would hence inferr is not evident, except that <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> ill disposed will was unconquerable by the grace and power of the omnipotent God: To repeat which Conclusion is more than to refute it. That which he sayes in the third place, viz. <hi>That God shewed Pharaoh the danger of disobedience before he sent his Plagues upon Him</hi>: As also his fourth observation, viz. <hi>that he makes him of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95059:144"/>
willing to let his People go, is meer nothing</hi>: For himself here on the matter grants, That from Gods Exalting <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the Throne of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, He was destinat to destruction, and his day of grace gone, otherwise his first note upon this Text is nonsense: Therefore it follows, That all the warnings antecedent to the Plagues are not Declarations of the mind of God to save <hi>Pharaoh</hi>: And that his causing of him to let the people go, was no infusion of grace in him. His 5. note viz<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>That God did not harden Pharaohs heart, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing any hardness into it, but rather used means to soften it, and bend his heart to obedience,</hi> we imbrace withall our heart, as to the first part; for the second part thereof, it is ambiguous; For if we understand these words of a real design in God to soften the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by these means, it is false, seing God himself declareth, <hi>Exod:</hi> 4.21. Even before these were used toward <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he had no such intent, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie thereof. He sayes 6ly. <hi>That the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed him not, untill his heart byassed and willfully revolted from that inclination of letting Israel go, to which the Lord had brought and wrought him: So that the Lords pleasure in hardening, must out of this example be understood of such as are first or last refractory against his grace and gracious requiring Motions.</hi> Reply, upon as good a ground he might assert, that Dives in hell had such inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and workings of grace, together with power to use them aright, if he had pleased, which if he had improved aright, he might have passed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95059:144"/>
thorow the impenetrable gulf, to the place where <hi>Lazarus</hi> was. For Dives, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.27, 28. Had an inclination and a vehement desire, that his five Brethren might shun the place of torment, in which he was: And surely this inclination and desire was as good in it self as <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> of letting <hi>Israel</hi> go; and surely the Motive that prompted <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to yield to the peoples departure, was not a whit better than the motive of this desire in Dives, for both were acted by the fear of punishment: Hence let the Universalists be ashamed of their first grace, seing it is common to these in Hell as well as to these in the World. 2. If this his Doctrine (viz. <hi>that Pharaoh and every Man else had a sufficient Measure of Grace given them, and power to use it well or ill at pleasure, according to the good or ill improvement of which, they might have been saved or damned</hi>) be true, and this <hi>Arminians</hi> exposition of <hi>Exod:</hi> 9.16. Here cited by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle be to be received, then the Apostles Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion <hi>vers,</hi> 16. is a meer <hi>Non sequitur</hi>; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his exposition, the Lord should not have mercy on whom he will, and harden whom he will, but these only who will, or desire to have Mercy, or to be hardned; seing this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versalistick Doctrine makes the main and Chief difference, betwixt these that are actually saved, and not saved, to flow from the will of Man, which they say has a power to receive or reject Grace, and so to be mollified, or hardned absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at pleasure; now <hi>I</hi> say, to say this, and yet to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that God hath mercy on whom he will have
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95059:145"/>
mercy, and hardneth whom he will, is no less ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouslie contradictorie, than if one should say that such a judge had absolute power over such a guilty City, to save alive or put to Death all the Citizens at pleasure, and yet in the mean while that there were such and such Conditions proposed to this City, which they could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace or respect as they listed, upon the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which Conditions, this judge could not, nor might not put to death any, nor save the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors thereof.</p>
            <p>He goeth on to comment upon the 9. verse. <hi>Why doth he yet find fault? Who hath resisted his will! Thus, it seems then that his will in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the wicked is irresistible. Answer, the will of God is manifold. First voluntas Signi, that which he would have done by Men, and that may be resisted or dissobeyed.</hi> 2<hi>ly. Voluntas Beneplaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, that which he is pleased to effect, and that either absolutly, to be done by himself alone, or with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which cannot be withstood; or conditionally in case the Creature act his part, this Conditional will may also be repugned; So that wicked Men can not excuse themselves by the irresistibilitie of the first or last mentioned will of Gods irrevocable decree, at length past upon the obstinat and incorrigible sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which like his powerful and efficacious will, is inexpugnable: But it is the obdured Mans refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and inflexible will, that hath now made this will or decree of God so peremptorie against him. So that God hath just cause to fault and blame the Man that perisheth, but not Ã¨ Contra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:95059:145"/>Reply in the framing of his Objection, he should have inferred that it seems that the Will of God, in passing by some, while he from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty elected others to Glory, and of hardning them in time, is irresistible, or unchangeable, for of these two the Apostle here speaks: But let us come to his Answer, in which we may observe, that this distinction of <hi>voluntas Beneplaciti,</hi> in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and conditionat, is a meer fiction, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth even by the Testimony of <hi>Arminius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who in his Book against <hi>Perkins,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that <hi>voluntas beneplaciti is without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation effi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>acious.</hi> But 2dly this Distinction of <hi>voluntas Beneplaciti</hi> in absolute and conditionat, makes God as changeable as a man; for if the Lord have a real Will and Intention, that such and such things be done by some men, in order to obtaining such and such Priviledges, v. g. Eternal Life, then there can be nothing imagined, able to hinder the bringing to pass of this desire, but two things, <hi>viz.</hi> either the want of Power, or a real Change in the Will of God; but both those are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly absurd: neither let any say here, that this will of God is only conditionat in respect of the ends only, and not of the Means and Conditions thereof: For whosoever willeth any thing, he willeth and desireth all the Means and Conditions, in order to its bringing to pass, and will give a Beeing to all those Conditions, if it be in his Power, which Power none dare derogat from God. 3dly. This Objection, as this Arminian propones it, is no Objection, for in Substance it is this, If the Lord
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95059:146"/>
hath proposed such Conditions, as men can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and so obtain Salvation, and yet obstinatly refuse them, so that at length the Lord after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection thereof, decreeth their Eternal Ruine, then he hath no Reason to find fault with Man, but the Blame thereof lieth upon himself. Now I say to propose the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>jection thus, is to render the Apostle ridiculous, for there is no more appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Reason here, than a Subject should have to grumble and repine, when he is punished by his Prince, for denying Obedience to him, which to have performed was in his Power. 4ly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> If the Objection had been of no more seeming strength, than this Arminian or Pelagian (for all is one) alledgeth it to be, the Apostle had easily found out another Answer, than that which he doth in the following Verses, where he stops the Mouth of the Objecter with the absolute Power of God over the Creature, shewing that the Creature hath no more Reason to complain that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, to pass by some, and condemn them for their Iniquity, than the clay of the same lump hath to complain of the Potters Unjustice, because he did not destinat it for as honourable an use, as another part of the same Mass. In short, if the Objection could be so framed, as that there could be an Answer thereto found out, suiting the Genius of Humane Reason (which is the Scope of our Author here, and all the rest of his Brethren) then there should be an indissolvable, and more than Gordian knot cast to any that were perswaded of the Divinity of the Scriptures, for considering
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95059:146"/>
the Apostles Answer in the following Verse, they should have but too much Ground, to suspect most vehemently, that the Apostle was not assisted with the Divine Spirit, who betook himself for Sanctuary to the absolute Power of God, in the case wherein he, or any man else might have sweetly satisfied Reason, and not thus stopt its mouth, by imposing as it were an imperious si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and left it far less quieted, than they found it;
That which he commenteth upon v. 20 is not a whit les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> vain than the rest: the Substance of which is, <q>that the Apostle in this v. stops the Mouth of these, who complained, that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with Liberty of will, and so with power of falling, to which saith he, it is answered, that this Faculty might be improved to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Creature, as well as to the glory of Gods grace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which we Reply, that no such Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be gathered from the Text, for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection proposed in the former v, doth not in the least intend, from the Liberty of Mans Will, to do Good or Evil, to conclude that Man is not guilty, but rather God. But from the Immutability and Irresistibility of Gods Will and Decree of passing by and rejecting some, (as he did with Esau) the Objecter endeavoureth to free Man from Guilt, and fix it upon God, neither is he a whit happier in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of the Apostles Answer; for the Apostle doth not flee to the Liberty of Mans will, that he may draw his Answer hence, but the absolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of God over the Creature, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

an one as he hath, who possesseth wood, Iron, Clay, or such Materials, and is wilfull to make various Kinds of Instruments, which may serve either for honourable or dishonourable uses; but these Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials that are appointed by the Owner and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist thereof, cannot be said to be wronged by him, or to have any Ground of Complaint, and that by Reason of the absolute Power, that the Owner and Artist hath over them; even as any of Mankind that from all Eternity are passed by and rejected of God, and destinat to Destruction for Gods own Glory, as it is said Prov. 16.4. have no Reason to complain. Now in this Analogy lies the Strength of the Apostles answer, which who ever denyes shal never be able to find the Sense of this Text. Hence it appears (whether ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or maliciously, I know not) that this Arminian hath come short of uptaking either Objection or Answer: But most of all absurd is what he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in his Commentary (rather depravation) of the 21 v. viz. <hi>That as the Potter makes no Vessels of set Purpose to be broken, tho he makes some for dishonourable uses: So the Lord makes none of the Sons of men of Purpose to be destroyed, tho he makes some Superiours and Inferiours in the Church and Common-wealth; I say this is most</hi> of all absurd, for it is as clear as if written with a Sunbeam, that the Apostle is here speaking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of high and low Degrees in Church or State, but of these who perish, and these who are saved Eternally; according to this Explication, every one that is in low Degree should be a Vessel
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95059:148"/>
of Wrath, fitted for Destruction: Seing none can deny, that this is all one with a Vessel of Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: as also every one that is in high Degree in Church or State should be a Vessel of Mercy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime prepared unto Glory, and one of Gods called Ones, as the Apostle was, (whose calling I think was effectual, and so certainly a Saint) such a mark of Believers and Unbelievers was never heard before.</p>
            <p>To Corroborat what he sayes on this Verse he gives us his notes on Jer. 18.3, 4, 5. among which one is, <hi>that the Lord expostulates with Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael for not suffering him to mould them a new.</hi> To which we answer, that it will no more follow from this place, that the Heart of corrupt man is stronger in resisting than the Power of God, and that God cannot make men of unwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come willing, which is the meaning of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries Words, than real ignorance of what was to come, may be concluded to be in God from Isa. 5.4. and 59.16. Other notes he has upon this place, such as, <hi>That the Lord forms men a new by Force or Violence, but works with them as free Agents,</hi> serving for nothing except to declare this Authors maliciousnesse; for he here insmuates, that the Reformed Churches judge, that God deals with a sinner in his Conversion, as if he were a Stone or a Bruit, the contrair of which appeareth from their Confessions, and in special in the Confession, which he here impugneth. Ch. 10.1.</p>
            <p>He goeth on to comment upon the 22 verse where
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95059:149"/>
he says,
<q>That it is not so much as implyed, that these Vessels of wrath, spoken of in this verse, by the Apostle, were fitted by the Lord to Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea saith he, the contrary is imported, where the Apostle sayes, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> endureth them with much long suffering; For if God created them, or designed them of purpose to Destruction, things had succeeded according to his hearts desire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In Reply to these Cavils we find no difficulty; for God may be as well said to fit men to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, as he is said to harden some. verse 18. For I think none will deny, but hardening is a fitting to Destruction. 2. I think none dare deny, that even while God was hardening <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, he was exercising his long suffering patience, in permitting him to fulfill his course of sin. <hi>Augustin</hi> de <hi>Civit. Dei Lib.</hi> 16. sayes.
<q>God of the same Mass, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned through Original sin, did as a Potter make one to honour, and another to dishonour: Our Author sayeth moreover, That it is not said, they were created but fitted for Destruction <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> 
               </q>Reply, Altho our Adversary loves alwayes to pass over the Connection of the verses of this Chapter, as indeed he hath good reason to do, he notwithstanding may permit us to consider it:
In which we shall find, that men may be said to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to wrath, even as some part of the lump of clay is fitted by the Potter, for Vessels of Dishonour: But it is appointed for this dishonourable use as soon as it is appointed to be vessels: But so it is, That the Lord so ordereth of men as the Potter of his Clay, as the Apostle here shewes. It is clear
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95059:149"/>
therefore, That by this word Fitted, must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood among other things, Appointed or Decreed.</p>
            <p>He goeth on to Comment on the 23 verse, where among some other things, which he hath not to the Purpose that he intendeth, he asserts, <hi>That this preparing of the Vessels of Glory, is not attributed to Gods Eternal Decree.</hi> And in this he is but like himself, who, as we have heard above denyeth on the matter, that there is any Decree of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Salvation or Damnation of men in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular before death: Altho at another time, as we have also heard, he sticketh not to contradict this; But that this preparation is Attributed to the Decree of God, is clear, not only from the Scope of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, and the Energie of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> but also from no few other Scriptures, such as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>A length to shut up this Discourse, Let the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Observe with me. 1. That tho men bring full Wain-loads of Arguments, in appearance like Goli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For in so far as we are shaken from it through the force of these Reasons, We yield to these great Adversaries of Christ Jesus, the Socinians, that grand Principle of all Orthodox Christians <hi>viz.</hi> that Reason as well as the rest of the Scriptures Rivals, ought to strike fail, and yeild preheminency thereto, as being the entire and ultimat Rule of the Faith and Manner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95059:150"/>
a Christian. This I have good reason to note here; For there be many that though they cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Text to be, without the highest violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and detorting thereof, utterly incapable of any other sense, than what the Reformed, and in espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial our Reverend <hi>Westminister Assembly,</hi> give upon it still, notwithstanding alledge, that on the account of their most powerful Reasons to the contrary, This our meaning is not to be received, seek ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where we will. 2. That if there be a Doctrine in all the Holy Scriptures, out of the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ch of, and far above the Line of Humane Reason, contrary to Corrupt Reason, and in its Estimat repugnant to all Reason (as certainly there is) then no man will deny, but that this Doctrine of Eternal Election, and Reprobation, is one of the chief o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That this place of Scripture, is one of the chief Seats of the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation: Hence we most rationally infer, that in agitation of this great Controversy; If any Scriptures be brought, which seemingly (for none do it really) speak contrary to this Text, Light is to be brought from this place, for expounding and clearing up the meaning of these seemingly repugnant Scriptures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
