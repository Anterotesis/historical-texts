         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Little thought there would have been any Need of Defending the short <hi>Essay concerning Critical and Curious Learning,</hi> &amp;c. which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I did not consider how tenderly some People are affected with any thing that looks like a Reproof. It was no sooner published, but out comes an acute <hi>Answer</hi> from <hi>Oxon,</hi> and pronounces it a down-right Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and impudent Libel, and the Author of it an Atheistical <hi>Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wit.</hi> Whether this dreadful Charge is made out or not, shall be my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Inquiry; and because I am not much in love with the La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pooner's method of Railing in general, and talking at random, I will beg your Patience while I take every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Paragraph into a distinct, but short, Examination. Not that I think there is any thing in this Trivial Paper worth the trouble; for on the other Hand, <hi>Pudet recitare, &amp; nugis addere pond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Besides, I may possibly do him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103098:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himself no disservice, in shewing him how unfit a Champion he is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Defence of a Publick Cause. There is a vast difference betwixt the Qualifications, which may make a Man appear advantagiously enough in an University, and those which will render him acceptable and Eminent in the World. But I do not, <hi>Sir,</hi> pretend to undervalue an University<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Education; for I know, the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t considerable Personages of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have always been those, who had their first Institutions there. I would only urge, that a Man must have a more diffused and mixed Conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than is to be met with in a College, before his Learning will sit agreeably upon him, or he can hope to become a finish'd Scholar; such a one I mean as this Gentleman takes himself to be.</p>
            <p>I can Observe no Method in what I am about. You must take it as it comes, in the Confusion he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it. And therefore without any more Preliminary, I will begin to Transcribe. <hi>Viz.</hi>

               </gap>st occurred to me, without any manner of Correction; for truly I did not think it worth my while to make any.</p>
            <p>This Introduction you see affords nothing Remarkable, but that our Friend is very good at Writing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and may be depended upon by his Correspondents for a speedy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, let the Business they employ him about be never so Disobliging to him, or Insignificant in it self; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less perhaps we are to understand by the particular Character of the Words Condition and Gift, that there is some pretty double Entendre couched in them. I suppose his Meaning (if he has any) must be to inform us (by way of Lawyer) that some Gifts are upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103098:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Condition, and some not; and that where there is a Condition, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition must be performed before the Title to the Gift can be good. But let the Distinction lye where it will, I wish for my part he had not thought this small Gift worth his Acceptance, upon the Barbarous Condition of persecuting his Unknown, Humble Servant, as you shall hear he now and then does.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First then,</hi> It is obvious to remark, that the Author, whoever he is, has given his Essay a wrong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>itle. If he had had a Mind to deal honestly with his Reader, it should have run thus: <hi>An Essay, &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n which are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained several False and Scandalous Reflections on</hi> Christ Church <hi>in</hi> Oxon. But to turn over the Title Page. In his Preamble (where I assure you he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends abundance of Modesty) he cannot forhear making open Proclamation, that he and his Friend, to whom he addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses this piece, have resolved to censure and damn all Books, that shall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after Published: To which purpose they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103098:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have established a Critical Correspondence between them. Wo be to all poor Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the future! But he has given the World no reason to hope well of this Grand Design. For in the present case (which it seems is the first he has medled in) he is far from b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ing so fair and equitable a Moderator as he ought, or indeed as he himself would pretend to be. For he has every where shewed that Dogmatical Humour and Arrogance he blames in others; and has taken a most intolerable Freedom, where he ought not to have done it. I have but two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to think that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did not write this Treatise: One is, that the Matter is infinitely too Polite, and the Style too Smooth and Flowing for him. The other, that I hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Self-love and Pride, would have suffered him to have dealt so freely and justly with his own and his Friend's Characters; tho' it was the most likely way to do him a real Service at the bottom. For these Reasons I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Doctor, and tell you, that I rather believe the Author to be an Esquir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, (as he calls himself) and one
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103098:5"/>
of those mighty Wits amongst you in Town, that set u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> for the Overthrow of Religion; who the better to gain their En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s, lay hold on all Occasions, of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Universities, and undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Dignity and Character of the Clergy. And tho' I have said this of him, yet it is no Wonder that he is Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Friend and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Here I have several things to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for. The first is a <hi>Misnosmer.</hi> But I cannot agree with him in it, since I am by no means guilty of the <hi>False</hi> and <hi>Scandalous Reflections</hi> he talks of. For what I have said of <hi>Christ Church</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> is so far from being the <hi>false</hi> or <hi>scandalous</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation of an Enemy, that their best Friends have frequently and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly owned the Truth of it; and (to quote <hi>Horace</hi> once more) <hi>Dicere verum quid vetat?</hi> I appeal to you, or any impartial Person, whether I have not left many things unmentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that might easily have been brought in, if I had had a Mind to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103098:6"/>
shew my Malice. But I thought my self Obliged to touch upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what lay immediately within the Argument. I did not so much urge my own single Opinion, as deliver the Sense of every Body that knew them, which I could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily make appear, was it not too invidious a Task. But if I could not, this Gentleman has effectually done it for me. He has given the World a fresh and unquestionable Evidence, that there is as much Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at least, as Learning in that College, as I shall prove by and by from his own Words. If instead of making Amendments in my <hi>Title Page,</hi> he had given me some Useful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and Grave Advice, and told me, that it was a Rule in Satyr, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere personis dicere de vitijs,</hi> that <hi>Truth was not to be spoken at all times,</hi> &amp;c. I might very probably have stood Corrected, and never have troubled you nor him with this Defence. But he is pleased to be scurrilous, and I must go on with him to the next Accusation; which is for erecting a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103098:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Critical Tribunal,</hi> and making you and my self the Arbitrary Judges of it. Could this be made out, I must confess, he would have great Reason to complain of me, for removing that Court of extream Justice from his Residence, and for wresting the Authority out of their Hands, who have more leisure and assurance to put it in Execution. But I cannot imagine what brought the Whim into his Head. There is not the least Ground for it, in that Sentence he seems to point at in the Essay; where, after professing my own Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Unwillingness to venture upon so Nice a Topick, I say, <hi>In order to begin that Correspondence betwixt us, which your Letter so kindly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and which is so much for my own Benefit, I will here give my imperfect Thoughts upon,</hi> &amp;c. He might as well have found out the Doctrine of Transubstantiation in these Words, as any such Meaning; but when a Man is resolved to say what comes next, who can help it? Hitherto the <hi>Essay</hi> and the <hi>Essayer</hi> (as he calls

It seems, he is never to escape the Gaul of their acute Pens; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I cannot conceive, why he is named here, only to tell the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, that he had nothing to do with this Treatise. The same Argument would have brought in the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> and many other great Men, that never dreamt of turning Authors; unless he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon it, that he has but two Reasons to believe the Dr. did not write it, and perhaps there may be two and twenty, to think the <hi>Czar</hi> did not: But then he must consider again, that one of the Reasons he has given is as good as one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, and in such a Gase a little <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> with the Help of as much <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi> would have taught him to conceal his private Resentments.

dealing so very freely with Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> and himself. For I cannot see what <hi>Real Service it could do him at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,</hi> to wound his Enemy through his own sides. The other Reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I doubt was thrown in unawares, or with a Design meerly to mortifie the Doctor. For he no sooner says, that I write a better Style than the Doctor, but you may perceive he immediately recollects himself, and least I should grow proud upon it, calls me in the same Breath a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer of the University, a Reviler of the Clergy, an Underminer of the Church, and an Overthrower of Religion:</hi> And which is still more notorious (for I was to expect no better Language from him) he bestows the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments upon the Doctor too, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard at all to his Character. One would have thought Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Sermons against <hi>Atheism</hi> (for I must suppose our Student has read them) would have secured him in partic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

No body that had had any Notion of Honour or Good Manners, would have been guilty of it, when it had no relation at all to his Subject. So much for my Morals. In the next place you have an Account of my Learning.</p>
            <p>But I would gladly know what there is in this piece, that should make it gain so mighty a Reputation, as you say it has; and particularly how it comes to deserve your Esteem, notwithstanding the aversion you are pleased to say you have to the <hi>Satyrical Stuff</hi> in it. It is indeed called (I should say miscalled) <hi>An Essay concerning Critical and Curious Learning:</hi> Which, I must own, is a very promising Title, and one might reasonably expect som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thing new and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate upon so nice an Argument. It came to my Hands with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Advantage, in that it had your Recommendation. I durst not pass any Censure upon it. I suspended my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and read it again and again; but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103098:9"/>
I liked it worse every time I did so. I cannot indeed but acknowledge, I had some little reason to be byassed, when I found the Worthy and Reverend Dean of <hi>Christ Church</hi> so undecently treated; and the Reputation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>is whole Society arraigned in a most imperious and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Manner.</p>
            <p>This Paragraph is civil enough in Conscience from a professed Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and if I manage it to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I shall be able to pick up a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment or two at least out of it, which may make some little amends for his former Rudenesses. First then, he tells me, the Essay has gained a good Reputation in General; that his Friend in particular, was pleased to pass a Favourable Censure upon it; and that truly for his own part, he is by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed upon the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Christ-Church</hi>'s account. After this frank Confession of his Partiality, I can easily forgive his calling what is said upon his College <hi>Satyrical Stuff.</hi> I am not concerned neither at any other Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Expressions; because I know
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103098:9"/>
they are extorted from his good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I do not much care too, if I resign him my <hi>Title page,</hi> since he will needs insist again upon it, <hi>viz. It is called, (I should say miscalled).</hi> There is no withstanding such an unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed flower and turn of Speech: <hi>

               </gap>s part of this Piece is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Farrago of common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, put indeed into tolerable good Language: But the Author talks so very abruptly, and has so cramped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon every Head, that what he says of his Performance in jest, may very well be applyed to it in good earnest; <hi>viz.</hi> That by endeavouring to say a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103098:10"/>
why did not our <hi>Essayer</hi> take a wider Compass, and a longer Time for this mighty Undertaking of his? What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation had he to speak to any Subject, unless he would have done it to purpose? Was it a Task imposed upon him, which he was willing to get off his Hands as soon as he could, and was he at the same time obliged to print it? When he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his own Opinion, and gives the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing turn to any Argument, he does it in as positive decisive a manner, as if Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> himself had done it. He bears all down before him, and when he is going to prove some ordinary known thing, puts himself into as great a Sweat and Tumult, as if he was about some of the knottyest Points in all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,</hi> and was doing no less than <hi>squaring the Circle.</hi> To make a shew of much Learning (a Qualification not very common amongst such <hi>Wits</hi>) he runs through all the Sciences, but after a very odd manner: For when the Reader ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects some handsome Account of them, he baulks him with lame and imperfect Definitions. He pretends to have pressed his matter very close, but it is still so

Pate,</hi> talk as roundly over a Glass of Wine, of all kinds of Learning and Languages, as our Author, without ever suspecting him to have any clear or full Notions of what he was about. There is a sort of Common-place, which any Man that keeps good Company may easily be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with; and yet at the same time, be no more a <hi>Scholar,</hi> than the <hi>Pope's Parrot,</hi> that could repeat the Creed, by keeping much Company with his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, was a Christian.</p>
            <p>The first Sentence here, is a flat Contradiction to what went before. Before he affirmed in Cool Blood, that <hi>my Matter was polite, and my Style smooth, and flowing:</hi> Now his Passion gets the better of him, and it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>Farrago of common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> which is as much as to say, that the same thing is <hi>white,</hi> and is not <hi>white</hi> at the same time: For a <hi>Farrago of common Notion,</hi> and <hi>polite Matter,</hi> are no more akin than Light

               </gap>nd Darkness. However, since he still owns, that these <hi>Common Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are put into Good Language,</hi> I have no reason to contend with him about a small Contradiction. For by this Concession, he gives me no less a Character, than that which the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> have made the Propriety of the Divine <hi>Horace,</hi> viz. <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>xpressing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Things in Excellent Words;</hi> (which by the way is the reason that Poet can never be well translated; for no other Language is sufficiently expressive of the Delicacy and Fulness of the Latine Phrase.) But in the following part of this Paragraph he seems at first sight to offer several weighty Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but they are put in such loose and general Terms, that I can make nothing of them. Instead of giving a Reason for what he says, he asks two or three impertinent Questions, of no more Consequence than if he should have said, <hi>What is your Name, Sir? What does</hi> T. R. <hi>stand for?</hi> Nay, they are hardly so much to his Point. For if he could but once have learned who I was,

the most generally knowing of all Antiquity; yet he is suspected to have copied some of the Books ascribed to him, and to have burnt the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals from whence he had them.

Presently he forgets this, and talks as loudly for all the other Sciences one after another; only <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks and Metaphysicks</hi> have the hard hap not to be of the number of his Favourites. When he comes to talk of his beloved Argument, <hi>of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Learning in the Modern Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is taken for a thorough Understanding of Classick Authors, and an exact Knowledge of all those Rules, by which Men judge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine nicely of all the finer Parts and Branches of Humane Literature;</hi> he displays all his force, and is most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully instructive. He informs his Reader, <hi>that</hi> Aristotle <hi>was the first that drew up these Rules into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, and made Criticism an Art;</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103098:15"/>
               <hi>that</hi> Horace, Longinus, <hi>and all the Criticks both Ancient and Modern, drained most of their Knowledge from him.</hi> This is just as much and no more, than has been said an hundred times in Dedications and Prefaces to Plays. Not only Mr. <hi>Congreve, Dennis,</hi> &amp;c. but even <hi>Settle</hi> and <hi>Durfey</hi> have often said it before him; and most of them in their present Controversie with Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> make nothing of talking of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> as familiarly as this Gentleman, without ever having read one word of him. But he goes on victoriously, and says, Criticism is without all douht a very good thing, notwithstanding what some People say of it; and hath a pretty similitude about <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> nothing to the purpose; from whence how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he infers as fast as Hops, the great Advantage of Critical Knowledge.

often is ill defended. After having muster'd up all this, he leaves his Argument for a while, and makes a digression upon the use of <hi>frequent Compositions.</hi> Here he crowds his fine Notions very thick upon us, and to single out one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many, he tells us, <hi>that all the Faculties of the Mind, whether Active or Passive, are mightily heightened and improved by Exercise.</hi> This proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is certainly true; and so it will hold, if I should affirm it of the Faculties of the Body, and illustrate my Position with the Famous Story of <hi>Milo,</hi> who first tryed his Strength in carrying a <hi>Calf,</hi> and by constant Application, was at last able to do as much for an <hi>Oxe.</hi> But who could I hope to inform by it?

There is yet another notable piece of Criticism, and it is that <hi>Tully was a better Poet than an Oratour.</hi> This is true too, and I have nothing to say in Answer to it. But to return with him from this digression. The next thing he presents us with, is a terrible description of the Modern Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, <hi>That they are byassed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and in spight of all their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pretences, a strong Tincture of ill Nature unhappily appears in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Line. They tell us indeed in their Prefaces, that they have dealt very handsomly and candidly with the Authors they Comment upon: But when we come to the Remarks themselves, we are entertained with nothing but continual Snarling and Insolence.</hi> This will prove as true as the rest of his Axioms and wise Sayings, if rightly applyed, that is to himself.</p>
            <p>One would imagine by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise <hi>in short</hi> at the Head of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103098:16"/>
that he had before put himself quite out of Breath with Reasoning, and was now come to make his <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> from the whole. But it is at last only to say over again, what he has said several times alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that he could if he would, prove my Essay to be <hi>inconsistent</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory.</hi> If I thought this forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his was pure good Nature, I should be mightily Obliged to him. But I am of their ill contrived Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who suspect every Kindness from an Enemy to be the effect of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity more than Choice; and think he does not do me Harm, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot. But, when a Man is at a <hi>Non plus,</hi> 'tis a pretty Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Turn, to pretend he will not trouble himself and the Reader, with heaping up all that might be said upon the Occasion. The true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Silence in such Cases is, that what is left behind is not worth speaking.

As to the <hi>Crying up Experimental Phylosophy, and then talking as loudly for all the other Sciences,</hi> it is unfairly alledged against me, and I may say without any breach of Modesty, that I have not Confounded my Opinions: I have been at least consistent with my self.

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:103098:17"/>
But the Mischief of it is, he suspects at the bottom I know nothing of the Topicks I am upon, and therefore takes it for granted, that I betray my ignorance every now and then, especially of <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicks.</hi> If I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to use the same freedom, and guess at his Skill in these Matters by his manner of Refuting an Essay, I fancy they are a little too Crabbed for his Head too, as well as mine.

best Arguments. In the next place he examines my Knowledge in <hi>Classick Learning,</hi> and here to my Eternal Shame he finds me no better a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient than in the <hi>Severer Studies.</hi> He finds nothing but common and trivial things, but what has been said in Dedications and Prefaces an hundred times. I own I say <hi>Aristotle</hi> was the Father of Criticism, which for any thing I know may have been said not only an hundred, but a thousand times before me. But what then? I do not advance it as a New Discovery. I only make use of it as a necessary Introduction to a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon that Subject. If I had talked of <hi>Criticism,</hi> and not named <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> I suppose I should have been as much to blame on the other hand. And there would have been a great deal more reason for suspecting me not to have read any part of his Works than at present there can be. 'Tis true, I have quoted no Greek out of him, which I ought by all means to have done, had I foreseen my acquaintance with that Language
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103098:18"/>
had been likely to come in question<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But whether I understand it or not, the <hi>four Poets</hi> (who are here as awkardly brought in and traduced as <hi>Will.

None of them, I dare say, have ever made honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in their <hi>Prefaces,</hi> without a Greek Citation or two at the same time. And in <hi>their present Controversie with Mr.</hi> Collier, some of them have plentifully quoted La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and Greek Authors in their own Tongue; the <hi>Fathers</hi> themselves have hardly escaped. But I have enough to do to defend my self. It seems I have not only dealt too <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly</hi> with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but with his <hi>great Pupil Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and I must give an account of it.

One would think it impossible for a Man of common Sense, to write such incoherent irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Trash. But sometimes Peoples Malice perverts their Understanding, and transports them to a strange degree of Folly and Impertinence. But I may think, and say, and prove

what I will; he is so well satisfied with the justness of his Reflections, that he pursues me with equal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour through the <hi>Digression upon the use of frequent Compositions;</hi> and to my great Comfort he does it just with equal success too. Here he is again disgusted at my Trumping common Notions upon him for <hi>fine Things;</hi> which (says he) are by no means proper for an <hi>Essay,</hi> where all should be <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Entertaining,</hi> (which he makes two Synonimous Terms). But with his good leave, (since he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In his first Attack upon the College, he takes Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Method, and says peremptorily, Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Name is falsly set to the late Answer to the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation against</hi> Phalaris's <hi>Epistles,</hi> &amp;c. and that he is sure he had no hand at all in it.

For when a Gentleman has affixed his Name to a Book, and owned it, shall any one that dares do neither, give him the Lye, and pretend Civility at the same time? It was a Clownish bold Piece of Freedom at first in Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> and now the same in this Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscado Writer. Such rude Treatment would have been abominable to any of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Quality, had he been a Man of no Note, had he never given any Proofs of his extraordinary Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and great Learning to the World; and as the Case is quite otherwise, you and the Author must pardon, if I say it is downright impudent. But this is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

a Sample of some more Behaviour of the same kind. He has plenty of such Civilities in store for the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Students of Christ Church,</hi> who he takes to be the true Authors of the Book. But he does not trouble himself to answer them in any thing material; but without the least Provocation, takes their Manners most severely to Task, puts a mark upon them, and assures his Friend, that <hi>they distinguish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the rest of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, not by their extraordinary Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but their abominable Arrogance.</hi> He wonders how they can have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to condemn <hi>Pride</hi> in another, when they have so great a share of it themselves.

And I alledge it (in Kindness to him) as another Reason, that he did not write the <hi>Peice against Dr.</hi> Bentley, because it puts the Dr. more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Mind of his Distance, than became any Man of never such high Birth to have done in the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Wit and Argument, where all must be allowed to be equal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> I deny that I have inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently abused the <hi>Reverend and Worthy Dr.</hi> Aldrich. 'Tis true, I have taken Notice of his <hi>Smoaking</hi> and <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ociable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and he has no Reason to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at me for it. He is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Clergy-man that takes Tobacco, nor
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103098:26"/>
the only Academick that <hi>puns.</hi> I must confess, he is a <hi>Punner</hi> of the first Rate; For the Town has been often obliged to him for good <hi>Catches,</hi> whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>h are the highest flights of that kind of Wit. But this is not all, I have called him a <hi>Proud Man,</hi> and abused his <hi>Logick.</hi> As to his Pride, I will say no more than what I hav already done; for my Design is not to brand his Reputation in so Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a part. And as to his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of Logick,</hi> I am sorry I men tioned it; for to decide whether there be any thing new in it, but the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and whether that Language is better for being labour'd and full of Elegant Phrases or not, is a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that concerns only the <hi>Fresh Men</hi> in the Universities; and I will now assign it over to them, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ask their Pardon for invading their Province before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Lastly.</hi> I deny, that I have ignorantly undervalued the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Answer to Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> and the <hi>Christ-Church</hi> accurate Editions of Old Authors. But I will not here so
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103098:27"/>
much as recite any of those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Witticisms</hi> and Passages, which displeased me when I perused this ingenious Celebrated Book; because I hear Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Vindication is in the Press, and I am resolved not to interfere with him. It is sufficient for my present purpose, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at first View to any Reader, to be done by several Hands. The Style and Matter is almost in every other Page of a different Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. One while you have something that looks a little Modest and Grave, and the Quotations managed to the best advantage. Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ently the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour changes, and there is nothing to be met with, but Buffoonery and Unmannerly Jests with nothing in them. But it is Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (not mine) to detect and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all their Errors. I have already exceeded the Limits of a Letter, and must hasten to the next thing; I must account for my speaking ill of their Editions of Old Authors, which (says my Friend) are <hi>Famous not only here at home, but are much approved by</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:103098:27"/>
               <hi>Forreigners abroad.</hi> If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his was true, what is the Meaning of the present Dispute with Dr. <hi>Bentley?</hi> But they are so far from being Books of any standing Value amongst other People, that they themselves are not long pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them. For many Authors, that were Published in Dr. <hi>Fell</hi>'s Time, have been again Revised, Collated, Printed, Index'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Dr. <hi>Aldrich</hi>'s, and for any thing I know may undergoe the same Fate in the next <hi>Dean</hi>'s too. <hi>As for the late Edition of</hi> Aesop's <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>bles,</hi> I am told Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has Examined it very particularly, and proved it to be of the number of those, that neither deserve <hi>a good Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at home nor abroad.</hi> So that the same Reason, which made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal my Observations on their <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Book, will oblige me to be silent here too; unless I would make my self a Party in the Quarrel; which I do not design to do, for all I am Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s dear <hi>Friend and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Here, <hi>Sir,</hi> I thought to have released you; for I was in hopes all had been pretty well over. But his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103098:28"/>
Wit is inexhaustible: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so barren, which he cannot be fruitful and copious upon. Who else could have applied the Tale of the <hi>Dutch Commentators</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi>'s <hi>Mother</hi> to two Epigrams? Any other Man would have told me bluntly, that if I had not been certain of what I said, I should have forborn my idle Conjectures. But to return him one ill Jest for another, I assure him, the Father of the Two Epigrams is not altogether so much unknown to me, as it seems <hi>Horace</hi>'s Mother was to the <hi>Dutch-Commentators;</hi> and I did not only guess, when I laid them at a Doctor's Door. The Pretence of the Author's not being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the abuses in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were Printed without his Knowledge, is ridiculous, and of a Piece with the rest of his Arguments. They were not I hope Composed, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and Dispersed without his Knowledge, which (had they not been harmless, inoffensive things) would have made them as much <hi>Libels</hi> as the Printing of them. Indeed it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103098:28"/>
is an unfair Practice to betray a Man into Print. The Collectors<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> of the <hi>Examen,</hi> &amp;c. should not have inserted them without leave, had they been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so Excellent, much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ss when they hardly deserved a place in their Book. But one may guess by it (with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the conjecturing <hi>Dutch Commentators</hi>) that they were no great Friends to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> neither, any more than the Author; and I some times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, that we are secretly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to <hi>Christ-Church</hi> it self for that <hi>Miscellany,</hi> notwithstanding this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman for some private Reasons pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly disclaims it. But, whenceso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it came, if it has given you any Divertisement in your Solitude, I have had my Desire, and there is an End of it.</p>
            <p>There is yet another Paragraph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and so it is like to remain. For, besides that it has nothing in it but <hi>Your humble Servant Sir,</hi> I begin to blush almost as much for Examining, as the Author ought to do for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this <hi>Pragmatical Rhapsody.</hi> Give me leave, <hi>Sir,</hi> to call it what I think I
