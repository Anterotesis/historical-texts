            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing the other day in your company, you told me of your being the fifth inſtant at the morning Lecture, where (as you ſaid) a great company of well diſpoſed people were aſſembled to hear: I was glad to hear it. Then you gave me to underſtand that one Mr. <hi>Ferguſſon</hi> there preached at that time from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. And you alſo gave me in writing an account of his Sermon, deſiring me to peruſe it. Sir, your Paper I return with many thanks, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo a few Animadverſions upon the Sermon, which you may read when your leaſure permits you.</p>
            <p>There are three faults inexcuſable in a Preacher, as all do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, for it is in it ſelf moſt evident.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To propoſe a Text out of the Holy Scriptures, and thence to draw Doctrines which are true in themſelves, but which the Text affords not. This is one way of prophaning the Word of God, and of doing the Work of the Lord negligently. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a greater fault, and much more to be lamented, when ſuch Doctrines or <hi>Theſes</hi> are grounded upon a Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are ſo far from being rightly drawn from that Text, that they are deducible from no other Text, being ſuch Doctrines as contain not the truth in them, but are falſe, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures of Truth. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The fault is then greateſt and moſt of all to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when the Doctrines or Articles propoſed as from a Scripture, are not meerly falſe, and errors of a mean import, but are falſe in matters of high concernment in Faith or Manners.</p>
            <p>Theſe three things, Sir, came to mind by the unhappy occaſion of your Preachers Sermon, whom I may charge, though not with the firſt of thoſe faults, (for he was not ſo little unhappy, as to preach Truth from a Text that reach'd it not to him) yet I may charge him with not onely the ſecond; but the third alſo: For alas! (I <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33714:3"/>grieve to ſpeak it) he preach'd ſuch a Doctrine, which greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects diſparagement upon Almighty God, in reſpect of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Wiſdom, and Power, and therefore muſt needs have much of malignity in it, how devout ſoever the Preacher may ſeem to be.</p>
            <p>Now that you may not think me to be raſh and inconſiderate in thus charging that Gentleman, give me leave to evince by a few words the truth of the Charge.</p>
            <p>I pray conſider his Text, and his Doctrine grounded thereon.</p>
            <p>The words of the Text are theſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons unto Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through ſufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Doctrine was this;</p>
            <q rend="margQuotes">That there was no other way imaginable or poſſible, whereby God might forgive ſins, but by a full and plenary ſatisfaction made to his Juſtice by the death of his Son.</q>
            <p>He branches this Doctrine into three Propoſitions; which are theſe,</p>
            <q rend="margQuotes">
               <p n="1">1. That it is not poſſible for God to pardon ſin and ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, without ſatisfaction to his Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was impoſſible to obtain ſatisfaction by any other way but by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Chriſt hath given God a full and plenary ſatisfaction, and thereby made way for the bringing of all thoſe Sons to Glory that the Father and he agreed about when he undertook this work.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now conſider (I pray you) ſeriouſly whether any man but one that is firſt prepoſſeſs'd with ſuch an Opinion, could have drawn ſuch a Doctrine from that Text. The terms I am ſure are at a vaſt diſtance. The Text ſaith, <hi>It became him for whom are all things,</hi> &amp;c. Now ſuppoſe that to be in the Text which is not, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt made ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for mens ſins, in Mr. <hi>F's</hi> ſence; it will not follow from this, <hi>It became God, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, That it was impoſſible to have been otherwiſe; for Mr. <hi>F.</hi> knows well enough, that though God cannot chuſe good or evil, yet he may chuſe this or that good; ſo that when it is ſaid, That ſuch or ſuch a thing becomes God, it doth not follow that the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33714:3"/>omiſſion of that, and the chuſing of another, might not alſo have become him. It did well agree with the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, to make the Captain of our Salvation perfect through ſufferings; But what are we, poor ſilly Worms, that we ſhould hence conclude, That the Wiſdom of God could have found out no other way for his goodneſs to appear unto us in! Let us be thankful for this that he hath done, and admire his Wiſdom in it; but let us not by our wiſdom ſet bounds to the onely wiſe God. However, let us not do it, grounding upon a Text that will not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us therein, as this Preacher doth.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, How doth it ariſe from this Text, That Chriſt made full ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God? The Text ſaith, — <hi>To make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through ſufferings.</hi> As if for God to make Chriſt perfect through ſufferings, and for Chriſt to make ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God were all one. Whereas, for God in bringing many Sons to Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through ſufferings, ſeems plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to imply no more but this; To make the Captain a perfect and compleat Captain or Leader. 1. By making him to be to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers or Followers, thoſe Believers he was to bring to Glory, a Pattern in doing, in ſuffering, and in receiving of Glory. 2. By making him to have pitty and compaſſion towards them in all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and ſufferings, through having experience of the ſame himſelf. 3. And laſtly, By giving him power to ſupply them in the way, and give them glory at the end, inaſmuch as by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings he came to ſit down at the right Hand of God. If any man of a more refined wit than ordinary, can draw any thing more from theſe terms, yet I perſwade my ſelf, That no man will ever be able to convince an impartial hearer, that Chriſt's being made perfect through ſufferings, is, Chriſt's making full ſatisfaction to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God. But if this Propoſition be not to be found in the Text, much leſs the other two; that it was not poſſible for God to pardon without a ſatisfaction, and that no other could do it but Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now having ſhew'd you, that his Doctrine is not in his Text, nor deducible from it; I ſhall ſhew you in the ſecond place that it is falſe, and therefore not deducible from any Text, but contrary to the Scriptures. But to make good this charge, it would behove <pb n="6" facs="tcp:33714:4"/>me to write a large Volumn, if I ſhould diſprove all the frivolous Arguments that are wont to be brought for the maintaining it, but I intend only a ſhort Letter, and therefore ſhall content my ſelf, 1. To ſhew you the contradiction of this Doctrine to it ſelf, and to the holy Scriptures. 2. To vindicate thoſe Scriptures, or the chief of them he brings for proof, from giving countenance to his Doctrine. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is contradictory to it ſelf and the Scriptures, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two clauſes in it; one is, Making full ſatisfaction to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God; the other is, God's forgiving ſins. To make full ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for ſin, is in this Preacher's ſence, <hi>To bear all that puniſhment which is due to men for their ſins in their ſtead.</hi> To forgive ſin, is, according to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> (Rom. 4. 7, 8.) <hi>Not to impute ſin,</hi> or to deal with the ſinner as if he had not finned. But now every one may perceive that theſe two are contradictory; as, to bear all the puniſhment due to ſin, and to bear none of the puniſhment due to ſin. To exact of the ſinner or his ſurety (as they ſpeak) all the puniſhment which he owes; and, to exact neither of the ſinner nor his ſurety any thing that he owes: For whether the ſinner himſelf or his ſurety bear the puniſhment of his ſin, ſin is in that caſe imputed. If theſe be not flat contradictions, I know not what are; for the terms in the affirmation and negation, are taken in the ſame ſence and latitude: So that for any one to ſay, That God could not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don mens ſins till Chriſt had made full ſatisfaction to his Juſtice, is alike as to ſay, The King cannot pardon a Rebel without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Law requires; foraſmuch as to pardon, is, not to puniſh as the Law requires. And this is ſo clear and evident, that in all other caſes ſave in this, even the Aſſerters of this Opinion do eaſily perceive the abſurdity: Which of them having committed an offence, deſerving death by the Law of the Land, would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himſelf pardoned, if all that puniſhment were exacted that the Law required? In debts of money, which may be transfer'd from one to another, which of them would account himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given a debt of an hundred pounds, if he himſelf, or any other paid it in his name? What an empty vain word would Forgiveneſs be at this rate? Pay me all you owe me and I will forgive you, is either a ſenceleſs or cruel ſaying. What! muſt we be abſur'd onely in <pb n="7" facs="tcp:33714:4"/>our Faith? Muſt Abſurdities there be reputed for Myſteries? Why not believe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> then, when they aſſert the Bread to be Fleſh, and ſay it is a Myſtery? Nay, much rather believe them than theſe, for they have the words of Scripture on their ſide, but theſe have not, ſave ill-forg'd premiſes. Thus you may ſee this Doctrine is contradictory to it ſelf, as much as puniſhing and not puniſhing, exacting a debt and not exacting it, are flatly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory.</p>
            <p>That it is contrary to the Scripture, is proved by the ſame la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for every thing abſurd, and contradictious to it ſelf, muſt needs be contrary to the holy Scriptures. But more particularly, 1. It is contrary to all thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of God's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, or pardoning, or remitting our ſins through Jeſus Chriſt, or through his Blood. And I think I need not tell you, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are full of ſuch. Will it not be impertinent to name a few among ſo great a number? Nay, is it not the main purport of the Goſpel, to ſhew that God forgives us our ſins by Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> the fore-runner of Chriſt, — <hi>Preaching the Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Luk. 3. 3. Chriſt himſelf taught us to pray, <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we alſo forgive our debtors,</hi> Mat. 6. 12. &amp; v. 14, 15. <hi>For if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father will alſo forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi> Will any man be beholden to us for forgiving his treſpaſſes, when we have receiv'd full ſatisfaction, as much to a tittle as the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? Or, dare we ſay, We immitate God, when we do not pardon them any thing, except we have our due to a doit? Might not the Servant in the Parable <hi>(Mat.</hi> 18.<hi>)</hi> have excus'd himſelf for his ſeverity to his fellow-ſervant by this Doctrine? For his Lord ſaid, v. 32, 33. <hi>O thou wicked Servant, I forgave thee all that debt, becauſe thou deſiredſt me; Shouldſt not thou alſo have had compaſſion on thy fellow-ſervant, even as I had pitty on thee?</hi> Might he not have replyed, Lord, thou didſt receive a full and plenary ſatisfaction for me, but I received no ſatisfaction for him, and therefore thy example is no Argument in this caſe? Is not this to clude the moſt plain and excellent Precepts and Arguments in the Goſpel? Chriſt ſaith in the inſtitution of his laſt Supper, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>For this is my Blood of the New Teſtament</hi> [Marg. <hi>Covenant</hi>] <hi>which is ſhed for</hi>

               <hi>many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> He doth not ſay, for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of divine Juſtice; for the bearing the puniſhment of your ſins: for what hath a Covenant or Teſtament to do with ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or puniſhment for ſin? And after his reſurrection, <hi>he ſaid unto them,</hi> [the Diciples] <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remiſſion of ſins</hi> [not ſatisfaction for ſins] <hi>ſhould be preached in his name</hi> &amp;c. accordingly the preachings of the Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts are full of this Doctrine of remiſſion of ſins. See a few, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 31. <hi>ch.</hi> 10. 43. <hi>ch.</hi> 13. 38.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Doctrine of Chriſt ſatisfying the Juſtice of God by bearing the puniſhment due to their ſins, is contrary to all thoſe Scriptures, that attribute our Remiſſion or Salvation to the Grace, Mercy and Kindneſs of God: for what is more contrary to Mercy than puniſhing the miſerable to the utmoſt? what is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Grace, than to give nothing but what one is paid for? what more oppoſite to Kindneſs or Goodneſs, than exacting all that ſtrict Juſtice may require? Now the Name of the Lord is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <hi>Exod. 34.</hi> 5, 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering and abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, keeping mercy for Thouſands, forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſſion and ſin</hi>; (Here it follows, that I may take notice of it in my way, becauſe the Preacher urges it to prove that God cannot forgive ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſatisfaction) <hi>and that will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> I pray Friend, conſider this Text that is cited by us both, and that upon a contrary account, and ſee if it can poſſibly be meant by the Lords not clearing the guilty, after his being merciful, gracious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he will indeed pardon ſin, when he hath taken as much puniſhment as the Law requires, but he wil by no means bate any thing of that. As if the Lord were very gracious and merciful, becauſe he takes no more than the Law allows. O wonderful Mercy, that this Preacher attributes to the moſt merciful Lord God! ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 8, 10. <hi>The Lord is merciful and gracious, ſlow to anger and plentious in mercy. He hath not dealt with us after our ſins, nor rewarded us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our iniquities.</hi> But according to this Gentlman, God muſt reward every one according to his Iniquities; for every one muſt bear the full puniſhment of his ſins, either in his own perſon or in the perſon of another. See <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Like as a Father pityeth his <pb n="9" facs="tcp:33714:5"/>Children, ſo the Lord pityeth them that fear him.</hi> That is, if the Lord can get any body to be puniſhed in their ſtead, and make full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his avenging Juſtice, then they ſhall go free. See alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Jona.</hi> 4.2. or ſhall I tranſcribe a great part of the Bible to this purpoſe. I cannot omit to mind you of our Lords precept, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.35, 36. where he ſaith, <hi>Love ye your enemies, and do good and lend, hoping for nothing again: and your reward ſhall be great, and ye ſhall be the Children of the Higheſt: for he is kind unto the unthankeful and to the evil. Be ye therefore merciful as your Father alſo is merciful.</hi> Is God kind to the unthankful and evil? how comes it to paſs? according to this Gentleman, either Chriſt or ſome other made ſatisfaction for them, or elſe I know not how it could be. 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 1. 3. God is called <hi>the Father of mercies.</hi> In that Propheſie, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1. <hi>77,</hi> 78. <hi>To give knowledge of ſalvation unto his people by the remiſſion of their ſins, through the tender mercy</hi> [marg. <hi>Bowels of mercy</hi>] <hi>of our God.</hi> The great reaſon of the bleſſings of the new Covenant is this: <hi>for I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> Heb. 8. 12. I would ſain paſs from this matter as obvious to every one, but that text in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13. will not let me go. <hi>For he ſhall have Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Mercy, that hath ſhewed no Mercy: and Mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth againſt Judgement.</hi> Where you may obſerve that Mercy is oppoſed to Judgement or ſatisfaction of Juſtice, and that gloryeth againſt this. Whereas were this Gentlemans doctrine true, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would glory againſt Mercy.</p>
            <p>That this Doctrine of full ſatisfaction to avenging Juſtice (I ſay) is contrary to all thoſe Sriptures that attribute our remiſſion or ſalvation to the Grace of God: me thinks I ſhould not need to cite texts in this caſe to ſuch as profeſs to live under a Covenant of Grace, and commonly ſuſpect every thing that is but ſaid to leſſen the Grace or favour of God. But give me leave to mention one or two among a multitude. And that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> (<hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>7.</hi>) doth firſt preſent it ſelf, <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his Blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins according to the riches of his Grace.</hi> Here forgiveneſs of ſins is aſcribed to the riches of Gods Grace, though it comes through the Blood of Chriſt. Would it have bin any ſuch rich Grace for God to let men alone after he had puniſhed their ſins to the utmoſt? See <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 14. a parallel place <pb n="10" facs="tcp:33714:6"/>to this in <hi>Eph.</hi> I. In both which you may note that redemption is expounded by remiſſion of ſins. See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> How juſtified by Grace or ſavour, if by a full ſatisfaction? O, you will ſay; Becauſe God gave Chriſt, and procur'd him to make this ſatisfaction. But ſuppoſe that could be; How then juſtified <hi>freely or gratis</hi> by his grace, if he received a ful ſatisfaction? Can a man be ſaid to deliver his impriſoned Debtor <hi>freely or gratis</hi> by his Grace out of priſon, and from his obligation, though he procure another to pay him the mony? ſure Mr. F. would not think ſo, if he were that captive Debtor and ſo deliver'd. And this Apoſtle in the next <hi>Chap. Rom.</hi> 4. 4. and 11. 6. argues the oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Grace and Debt, and Grace and works, ſhewing that they mutually deſtroy each other; ſo that if God received full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he is obliged in Juſtice, as this Preacher ſaith, to take no more; and our Juſtification accordingly will be no longer of Grace, but of Debt. — Thus this Preacher doth unawares deſtroy the Grace of God, while he preaches up a penal ſatisfaction of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Now I might proceed to other Scriptures and Arguments to which this Doctrine of ſatisfaction is contrary: but I am writing a Letter, and perhaps I may have occaſion to produce ſome of them by way of Anſwer to ſome of his Argumentations. And I ſhall as I go along, prove againſt him that which I propoſed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as the third and greateſt fault in a Preacher, namely, That his Doctrine is not only falſe, but falſe in a matter of high comcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the faith of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And firſt I take notice he argues from Gods threatnings that there muſt be a ſatisfaction: but he allows this ſatisfaction to be made either by the Criminal or by his Surety. But I would fain have him to ſhew me that threatning of puniſhment, that may be ſatisfied either by the party offending or his Surety. To <hi>Adam</hi> he ſaith, <hi>In the day thou eateſt — dying thou ſhalt die,</hi> Gen. 1. 17. and, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, &amp;c.</hi> Deut.27.26. &amp; Cal.3.10. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die,</hi> Ezek.18.4. Here is no mention of a Surety. Let him that addeth, <hi>or its Surety,</hi> take heed of the Curſe denounced againſt him that adde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> or diminiſheth &amp;c, but perhaps he hath a Surety that can and will bear it for him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:33714:6"/>2. He argues <hi>from the congruity of it to the Righteouſneſs, Wiſdom and other Attributes of God, to pardon ſin upon a full compenſation.</hi> He cites Rom.3. 25, 26.—<hi>that he might be juſt.</hi> But we have ſeen already in the 24. <hi>verſ.</hi> of that <hi>Chap.</hi> that the Juſtice there meant, is ſuch as conſiſts with juſtifying <hi>gratis</hi> and therefore without a full compenſation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He argues from <hi>the Holineſs, Purity and Righteouſneſs of the Nature of God to the neceſſity of the puniſhment of every ſin.</hi> But he doth here again take the boldneſs of adding <hi>a ſurety,</hi> for the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this puniſhment. I beſeech you my Friend, make a ſtand, and tell me, ſuppoſing ſuch a nature in God as obliges him to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh every ſin, whether that Nature can be ſatisfied with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of another that is innocent inſtead of him that is guilty? And again, whether that Holy Nature of God doth not oblige him as much not to puniſh the Righteous, yea though he be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as to puniſh the guilty? He ſaith, <hi>He cannot ſee how it was conſistent with the Righteouſneſs of God, to puniſh an innocent, if he could have ſaved ſinners without it.</hi> O wonderful Righteouſneſs of God, that obliges him to puniſh an innocent perſon, becauſe he cannot pardon freely the leaſt ſin! An innocent perſon did I ſay? You muſt ſuppoſe that this perſon is of equal worth to a whole World of innocent perſons; and then you muſt ſuppoſe that God is neceſſitated from his Nature to puniſh eternally this whole World of innocent perſons, if he will ſave from eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a few guilty perſons. This may ſeem ſtrange, but if you conſider it, you will find it full of Truth; For it is ſuppos'd, even by this Preacher, that Chriſt did as much in the bearing of the puniſhment of mens ſins, as if the whole World of ſinners ſhould have been puniſhed eternally. Now it follows clearly, that if you ſuppoſe the Surety to have been Righteous Men, and not Jeſus Chriſt; there muſt have been a whole World of ſuch Righteous Men to have ſuffer'd eternally, to have done that which Chriſt did in ſatisfying for mens ſins. I know, they that receive this Doctrine from the Pulpit, are wont to conſider the ſufferings of Chriſt as the ſufferings of a few hours, but they ought to conſider them as equivalent to eternal ſufferings: They ought alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them, not only as the ſufferings of a ſingle Perſon, but of as many perſons as it is poſſible may be ſaved by him, or rather, of as <pb n="12" facs="tcp:33714:7"/>many as they are of worth to ſave, which are, they ſay, all the World, and more if more there were: And then let them if they can aſcribe ſuch a nature as this to the moſt merciful and juſt God. O, whither doth Error drive men? Here perhaps they will argue, That it was the ſingle manhood only that ſuffered, it was the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head that ſupported it, and gave weight and vallue to the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but the God-head cannot ſuffer. But what is that to ſay, but either to confeſs the charge I have laid againſt that Doctrine, or elſe to make the ſatisfaction childiſh and ludicrous. For if the ſatisfaction given by Chriſt be real and ſomething diſtinct from what God had before, then it contains all that horrible cruelty I have ſpoken of; if it be not real nor diſtinct from what God had before ſuch ſatisfaction given, then it is childiſh, giving with the one hand, and receiving with the other, or putting the thouſands of pounds of his own Godhead into the ſcale with the penny of the manhood, (as I may ſo ſay) to make up a full ſatisfaction or payment; Who that conſiders it can bear ſuch a Doctrine?</p>
            <p>He goes about to prove <hi>the neceſſity of puniſhment of all ſin from two conſiderations; firſt, From the nature of ſin to which puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is due without any determination of God. That he that doth ill ſhould ſuffer ill, is not ſo much</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from the Will of God, as from the Nature of ill.</hi> But then, 1. How comes it to paſs that this puniſhment is not inflicted upon him that doth the ill, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another? Doth not his bringing in a Surety here, overthrow his reaſon? If ſin require to be puniſhed, it is in him that doth the evil, not in another? But, 2. ſuppoſe ſin doth in its own nature deſerve puniſhment, yet this doth not neceſſitate God to puniſh every ſin: For we men, although we have a natural right to our limbs, and he that maim's us deſerves puniſhment for ſo doing, if there were no poſitive Law to that purpoſe, notwithſtanding he that is ſo maimed may forgive him that offence. So he that ſins, gives God a right to puniſh him, but God may diſpenſe with his right, if he pleaſe, or elſe he were more impotent than we contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible worms.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, <hi>We may obſerve throughout the Bible that the Principle by which God puniſheth ſin, is the Righteouſneſs of his Nature, ſo that it is againſt Juſtice in him not to puniſh:</hi> And he cites, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1, 6, 7. <hi>It is a Righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to <pb n="13" facs="tcp:33714:7"/>them that trouble you, and to you that are troubled, reſt.</hi> Here we ſee it is as wel righteous to recompence to them that are troubled, reſt, as to recompence tribulation to them that trouble. But is that alſo from the neceſſity of God's Nature, and not from his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Will, and merciful Determination? Again, ſaith he, <hi>The neceſſity of ſins puniſhment is argued from the Heathens having a ſenſe of it without Divine Revelation.</hi> But did not the ſame Light in the Heathens teach them, that God was Merciful and Gracious, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning ſin without a ſatisfaction or full puniſhment? The <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> did not believe that God either by the neceſſity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Threatning was oblig'd to puniſh. <hi>Who can tell</hi> (ſay they, notwithſtanding an abſolute threatning) <hi>if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not?</hi> Jonah 3.9. And in verſ. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>And God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid that he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> What? Did he inflict this evil upon ſome other that ſhould bear it in their ſtead? Where is this neceſſity of his Nature, or veracity of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, obliging him to puniſh every ſin?</p>
            <p>He ſaith, <hi>It would render all Laws ludicrous, if the breach of them ſhould not be puniſhed.</hi> And will not all men hate and abhor that Government as cruel and tyrannical, where every the leaſt breach of the Law muſt certainly be fully avenged? Do not all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors forgive offences which they might puniſh, and that with great applauſe of their clemency, and as that wherein they do moſt of all reſemble God the great Governour? But are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Laws in the World ludicrous? But he will make us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for this intollerable ſeverity, by an execrable cruelty, and that is, by ſubſtituting one who is in reſpect of his worth aequipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to ſo many, or ſo many hundreds rather of innocent perſons as are needed for ſureties, to ſuffer this puniſhment inſtead of the Offenders. But how contrary is this to the reaſon of puniſhment, and to Scripture? which though it ſayes that Chriſt <hi>was made a ſurety of a better Teſtament,</hi> (Heb. 7. 22.) yet never our ſurety, much leſs to bear puniſhment in our ſtead. And here he cites (indeed in a quite contrary ſence to its true meaning, ſo ſtrangely impertinent are his proofs) <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 25. <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> For <hi>Abraham</hi> urges this againſt God's deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="14" facs="tcp:33714:8"/>the few Righteous with the many Wicked; but Mr. <hi>F.</hi> urges it for the many righteous, or of one equivalent to many that a few wicked may go free. This is the natural Righteouſneſs of God the Judge of all the Earth, which he Preaches. The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſacrificing a few men, or ſome of their Children in the behalf of the whole people, ſeems to come ſhort of this in cruelty and unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now he comes to his ſecond Propoſition, <hi>That it was impoſſible for ſatisfaction to be made any other way but by Chriſt.</hi> But having made it appear that the ſatisfaction he talks of is inconſiſtent with the Nature of God, with his Righteouſneſs, Mercy and Grace, as they are ſet forth in Scripture, this Propoſition falls to the ground, and is impertinent. Onely I may obſerve, that in rejecting of Sacrifices, new Obedience and Sufferings, though he cites <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51. 16. for the defectiveneſs of Sacrifices, yet he takes no notice of the next verſe, where the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> So he cites <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50. 12. to the ſame purpoſe, but waves that which follows in verſe 14, &amp; 15. <hi>Offer unto God thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and pay thy vows unto the moſt High. And call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> He doth not reject ſlain Beaſts, and burnt Offerings, that he may have ſlain men, or ſuch as may be eternally or infinitely puniſhed and tormented in the ſtead of the guilty; but he requires in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſincere and hearty obedience in things morally and truly good, in place of things ceremonial and only poſitively good.</p>
            <p>Here he tells us, <hi>That the ſufferings of men cannot ſatisfie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not infinite in weight, for men are not capable of that. They are capable of infinite ſufferings in reſpect of length and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but that is to be alwayes ſuffering without ever compleating ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</hi> Thus we ſee that the puniſhment laid upon Chriſt, is according to him equal to the ſufferings of men for evermore. But theſe men if they had been ſit ſureties, muſt have been righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men; ſo the ſufferings of Chriſt are equal to the ſufferings of millions of righteous men for evermore. But how dare we ſay, That God, who loved his own Son more than millions of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, much more than millions of ſinners, ſhould yet lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the puniſhment due to ſinners, and that which is equal to <pb n="15" facs="tcp:33714:8"/>the eternal ſufferings of millions of righteous men, for the ſaving of a leſſer number of ſinners? would it not even grieve a man of Ingenuity to be ſaved (if it were poſſible) at this rate?</p>
            <p>He ſaith <hi>the Satisfaction is alwaies spoken of, as having been done to reconcile God.</hi> But it will be very hard, I think impoſſible, for him to ſhew but one Scripture that ſaith ſo, nay that ſaith but that Chriſt dyed to reconcile God to us, which is far leſs. How ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is it for men to think the Scriptures ſpeak what they would have them ſpeak? It ſaith indeed, that—when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. And that God <hi>hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19. what need of reconciling him that ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son? <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>We come now to his proof of the main matter, <hi>(viz.) That Jeſus Christ hath given the Father a full and plenary ſatisfaction, &amp;c.</hi> Here by the way, he ſaith, Chriſt hath given the Father Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I deſire therefore to know who ſatisfied the Son and Holy Spirit. Or is the Son and Holy Spirit of a more merciful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious nature, ſo that they will pardon ſin without a ſatisfaction, though the Father cannot?</p>
            <p>For the clearing of this propoſition he ſaith, 1. <hi>That Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went what we ſhould have undergone. And this, he ſaith, was in point of feeling Death and the Curſe, an infinite puniſhment as to weight, though it was but ſhort as to time: as Hanging is ſhorter than ſitting in the Stocks two or three hours. He did not only undergo the Death which the Law curſed, but all the Curſe which God could put into his Death.</hi> Thus far he. Here he cites <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 37, 38. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46. <hi>Joh.</hi> Now my Friend, I pray read all theſe texts conſideratly, &amp; as many more as ye pleaſe, and ſee whether all or any of them ſay, that Chriſt underwent an inſinite puniſhment, or all the Curſe which God could put into his Death. Whereas he ſaith, Chriſt ſwett great drops of Blood, <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, — <hi>as it were great drops of blood.</hi> But I would ask him a queſtion or two hereupon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether it be not part of the curſe that men muſt bear, to know clearly and to be deeply ſenſible that they have no intereſt in <pb n="16" facs="tcp:33714:9"/>Gods favour, and that they never ſhall have any, and that God hates them with an everlaſting hatred?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether a ſtinging and guilty conſcience, as having juſtly deſerved the Curſe in their own perſons, be not a main Ingredient in the Curſe which men muſt bear? And if theſe be parts of the Curſe, then let him tell me whether Chriſt when he was in an Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Garden, or when he was on the Croſs, or at any other time underwent either of theſe? for did he not pray to God in the Garden, and call him Father? Did not God ſend an Angel to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him? Did he not upon the Croſs invocate God, ſaying, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> though he had forſaken him in giving him up to the power of his enemies? and did he not then comend his Spirit into his Father's hands? <hi>Luk.</hi>23.46. Are theſe the Actions, and this the ſtate of a man under the greateſt Curſe that God can lay upon him? Then be comforted ye damned, for it will not be ſo hard with you, as is imagined? Did Chriſt think that God hated him, when he knew he was his wel-beloved Son? and that this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his in dying, ſhould be rewarded with eternal Glory? what Doctrine is this, that brings in the Holy One of God, deſpairing of Gods favour, hated of God and tormented in his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with ſenſe of unpardonable guilt! as it neceſſarily follows from his aſſertions.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, it would be <hi>to leſſen the courage of Chriſt, if his Agony proceeded from a foreſight of his Death:</hi> not conſidering what his Text ſaith, that, <hi>It became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons to Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through ſufferings.</hi> How ſhould Chriſt be a compleat Captain, if he did not experience as great trials, as any of the Souldiers are like to meet with? And do not many of the Souldiers his followers, meet with ſuch a ſenſe of ſufferings that are before them, as put them into an Agony? But what if he being to break the Ice, to go firſt, to be a glorious example, met with with greater Hardſhips and difficulties, than any of thoſe that are to follow him? Is he not thereby the more fit to be their Captain? may there not from hence be given a good account of all the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and the death of Chriſt, that he was to be the Captain of our Salvation? Did it not well become the Wiſdom and Holineſs of God to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins through ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33714:9"/>as ſhould obtain this Glory and Power by an obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with the hardeſt ſufferings?</p>
            <p>He now goes on to tell us <hi>that Chriſt underwent this Curſe in our ſtead.</hi> And here he cites <hi>Dan.</hi>9. 26. <hi>Rom.</hi>4. 25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. which in my Judgment are not the moſt probable prooſs he might have brought for that purpoſe. But it being ſalfe that Chriſt underwent the eternal Curſe, there is no place for his doing it in our ſtead. Neither did he undergo, that which he did undergo, in our ſtead, but on our behalf, for our good, and that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps. So ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter: Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi> 1 Pet.2.21. He that doth any thing in another's ſtead, doth it, that the other may not do it; but Chriſt ſuffered for our Example, not to free us from ſuffering the like. Chriſt ſuffered for us, ſo he <hi>entred into Heaven for us</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi>6.20.) not in our ſtead, but for our good, to be a Prieſt, and to interceed for us that we may come thither alſo.</p>
            <p>Under this third particular, concerning what Chriſt hath wrought for us, he talks of <hi>a price for Grace,</hi> and that <hi>all Grace is given by vertue of the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He cites to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>To them that have obtained like precious Faith — through the Righteouſneſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Whence he collects that God is bound in Juſtice to give Grace and Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath bought it. It's ſtrange he ſhould be unmindfull of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s making <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Debt</hi> ſuch oppoſites as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy each other, and cannot have place in the ſame matter, Of which I have ſoken ſomething before. Again he conſiders not the words he utters; for Faith is ſaid in this Text to be obtained by us, not only through the Righteouſneſs of God, but alſo through the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Is Chriſt obliged to give us Faith becauſe he bought it? It is in the Greek, <hi>Faith in the Righteouſneſs of God, &amp;c.</hi> ſo Righteouſneſs may be taken for the Object of Faith, and denotes here the ſaithfulneſs of God and Chriſt, promiſing to us eternal life. Theſe are the men that cry up the Grace of God, the free Grace of God: bat my dear Friend, if you will be but at the pains to weigh the matter throughly, (which alas few will) you will perceive that their Doctrine of Grace rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, doth quite overthrow Grace. I have ſhewed you here how his Doctrine of Satisfaction is diametrically oppoſite to the <pb n="18" facs="tcp:33714:10"/>Grace of forgiveneſs of ſins, which God did deſign before the World, to magniſie by Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel. But he hath a pretty ſetch here, whereby he thinks to free himſelf of this charge; and that is by telling us, (as he doth in his Application) <hi>That the great Mercy as well as Juſtice of God, appears in this Satisfaction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Friends</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though God will have a Satisfaction, yet he will procure it himſelf, be will be at the cost of it himſelf. O the wiſdom of God in finding it out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that men would but conſider what this means! But men are mighty idle and popiſhly credulous in matters of Faith. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then is this: That God Almighty is neceſſitated by his Nature to execute the puniſhment due to all the ſins of men; for ſo he ſaith that <hi>by ſin puniſhment became due, and being due, it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be executed</hi>; So that God can no more pardon one ſin without due puniſhment, than he can lie or deny himſelf. Now it ſeems this neceſſity of his Nature gave him liberty (I know not how) to execute this puniſhment upon others that were righteous, in caſe they had been Sureties (if any ſuch there had been) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the guilty. But there being none ſuch, but only one, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt his wel-beloved Son, who was of ſo excellent a Nature, that he could bear as much puniſhment in a few hours, as all the World deſerved, and was not able to bear to eternity; Therefore he commands this Son (who would not diſobey him) to take upon him a humane nature, and therein to bear this infinite puniſhment, that ſo his avenging Juſtice being ſatisfied, he might then juſtifie ſome part of thoſe that had finned. This is God's procuring the Satisfaction himſelf; this is being at the coſt of it.</p>
            <p>But let me argue with him a little: How can that be a true and proper ſatisfaction, which the Creditor is at the coſt of himſelf? It is but a ſhew of ſatisfaction, when one receives but what he himſelf gives, or is at the coſt of. And ſo this ſpecious Doctrine of ſatisfying Juſtice, will be but a meer repreſentation of a thing that is not real. If the Creditor did receive what he did not give, then his Mercy is juſt ſo much diminiſhed. If he receiv'd all that was due, his Mercy is nothing at all. You will ſay his mercy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, that being at liberty to puniſh the ſinner himſelf, or a righteous perſon in his ſtead, he choſe to puniſh the righteous perſon and to let the ſinner go free. This ſeems to have ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <pb n="19" facs="tcp:33714:10"/>weight in it, but conſider it narrowly. Here is indeed ſome kindneſs ſhewn to the perſon of the ſinner: but there is juſt as much unkindneſs ſhewed to the perſon of the Righteous: but in reſpect to the ſin, there is no mercy at all, for whether he puniſh the Sinner or the Righteous, the ſin is fully avenged. And what good Governour I pray, would not rather in ſuch a caſe puniſh the ſinner than the Righteous? But you will ſay, <hi>he rewarded the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous for bearing this puniſhment.</hi> I anſwer, that is juſt as if one did owe me a Thouſand pounds, and I ſhould procure another to pay me the money in his ſtead, and for his encouragement I tell him I will give him a Thouſand pounds value in ſomewhat elſe.—I ſay this is no real, but an imaginary and repreſented ſatisfaction. So that let him turn himſelf which way he will, he ſhall never be able to make full ſatisfaction to Juſtice, and Mercy in forgiveneſs to ſtand together. By all this it appears that his doctrine is falſe in a matter of great concernment, as that which obſcures, leſſens, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parages or overthrows the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, Mercy and Grace of God in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Having now finiſhed what I intended, wherein I pray excuſe me if I have been too long, and pardon the errors of haſte, I will take my leave; beſeeching you to be very careful of receiving any Doctrine you do not underſtand, eſpecially if it ſeem to darken the Wiſdom, or any way leſſen the Grace of God: but cheriſh ſuch Principles as repreſent God and Chriſt full of Wiſdom, Grace and Goodneſs, and ſo beget in you humility, love, and conſidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Suffer not your ſelf to be impoſed upon by the bare name of <hi>Myſtery,</hi> nor by the multitude of thoſe that profeſs any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but look whether you can find it in the holy Scriptures. Conſider the great Vanities, Superſtitions, yea and Idolatries that have crept into the Church, ſo that it is no great marvel if many err in this point alſo. Let us pray that God would be pleaſed to vindicate the Truth of the Goſpel from the Inventions of men, that it may appear in its native beauty and lovelineſs. I hope you will not ſatisfie your ſelf with only reading what I have wrote, but will weigh it ſeriouſly as a matter of great concernment. I ſhall much rejoyce to be ſerviceable to you in it, for I am, Sir,</p>
