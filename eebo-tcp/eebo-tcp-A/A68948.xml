            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout a ſeauen yeares ſince, I <hi>Iohn Bilbrough</hi> the ſon of <hi>Richard Bilbrough,</hi> Citizen and Marchant Taylor of <hi>London,</hi> toke my aduenture to the ſeas, where in ſhort ſpace afterwards I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into the enemies hands by the treacherie of a renegat Engliſh, not worthy the name of my Countreyman; which villanie of his extended not to mee alone, but to ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other of my companions; amongſt whom, my ſelfe and a Skot, remaining aliue, were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed captiues to the towne of <hi>New-hauen</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie:</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:23097:3"/>
where being condemned into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes in the moneth of September, 1584. and there hauing remained the ſpace of ſixe yeares, enduring exceeding miſerie, as hunger, colde, ſtripes, with many violent torments; bereft of all hope for euer to behold my parents, friends, or natiue countrey againe; by reaſon that hauing foure times in my captiuitie attempted the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of my chaines, I was foure times croſt with contrarie fortune, my purpoſe diſcouered, and being taken, my ſorrowfull wretchednes aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated.</p>
            <p>Thus increaſing cares with dayes, euery daye being ſharper than the ſharpeſt ſting of death; it chanced that Duke <hi>Mercurie</hi> the gouernour of <hi>Naunts</hi> in <hi>Britaine</hi> cauſed the Galley Royall of that Citie to be rigged and victualled to the ſeas, with commiſsion to take all thoſe that held with the League, aſwell Engliſh. Scots, Flemmings as their owne nation on the Kings part. Thus floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the ſeas, and rowing on the ſeas, now he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now thether, expecting ſome prize worthy the attempting, it chaunced that the firſt daye of October 1590. being at anker in the Iſle of <hi>Vſe</hi> attending ſome ſhips paſsing either from <hi>Rochel, Burwage,</hi> or <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> we diſcouered early in the morning a great hulke of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which tooke her courſe for the Bay of <hi>Bornefe,</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>Poytours,</hi> not far from the riuer of <hi>Naunts,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon rowing to the windward of the ſaid hulk,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23097:3"/>
wee did beare after her: againſt whome our Gunner made diuers ſhootes, but could neuer hit her.</p>
            <p>Then I aſhamed at the vntowardnes of the ſaide Gunner, ſaide openlie, hee was vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of his office, and that I durſt lay my life to hit her the firſt ſhot, which the Captaine hearing, demaunded if I would vndertake to ſhoote at her, I anſwered him, that albeit I was a ſtranger, and had long continued in miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble captiuitie, yet if hee would accept of my ſeruice, I would performe the beſt that in mee lay. The Captaine vpon my anſwer, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my chaines to bee taken off, promiſing if I did hit her, to giue mee my libertie.</p>
            <p>Being in hope of freedome from this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſeruitude, I tooke the Gonners charge in hand, and did my endenour ſo well (through Gods aſsiſtance) that of eleuen ſhots, which I did make at her, I hit her with nine, but the hulke by the greatnes of the winde, eſcaped from out our danger.</p>
            <p>The next day the Captaine called mee vnto him, ſaying, if I would willinglie ſerue as a Gunner, for the ſpace of one whole yeare in the Galley, I ſhoulde, vpon his credit, haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: which (ſeeing no remedie) I condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vnto.</p>
            <p>Being thus at libertie, I was by the Captaine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23097:4"/>
vrged often to goe to Maſſe, of whome I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted pradon; proteſting that if I might bee perſwaded by ſufficient reaſon, and proofe from the Word of GOD, that the Romiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were the true doctrine of Chriſt, I would gladlie embrace it: in the meane time (ſeeing I was yet vtterlie of another opinion) I beſought him to haue patience, for that a ſettled Religion, could not ſo ſlightlie bee remoued; which hee in hope of my conuerſion (as hee termed it) in the ende granted.</p>
            <p>Within three dayes after, wee met three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſhips to the ſea-boord of <hi>Bel-yle,</hi> hauing in our companie a Man of Warre, ſo wee bare both of vs after theſe three ſhips, where I was commanded to make a ſhot, but perceiuing, that I went vnwillinglie to worke, they came about mee with their ſwords drawne, threatning if I would not ſhoote, they would kill me preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; ſo I ſhot at them, but neuer hit them, and the Engliſh ſhips diſcharged ſo couragiouſlie at vs, that they compelled vs to recoyle.</p>
            <p>After that time, abhorring to bee made the butcher of my natiue countreymen, I attempted all poſsible meanes of eſcape, either to the Kings ſide, or into <hi>England,</hi> but fearing to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I diſcouered my intent to a Captine, being before his thraldome a Captaine, called <hi>Le pine,</hi> deſiring him to lend mee his boy for my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23097:4"/>
conduct to the Caſtle of <hi>Blyn,</hi> ſeauen leagues diſtant from <hi>Naunts:</hi> but <hi>Le Pyne</hi> anſwered, that his father would ſhortlie bring his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and then promiſed to conuey mee with him: otherwiſe (ſaith hee) if you ſhould eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape by the conduction of my boy, my mize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhould be encreaſed, and my ranſome dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; with whoſe perſwaſions, for that time ſatiſfied, I waited fitter opportunitie.</p>
            <p>Within foure dayes after, there arriued at the Riuer of <hi>Naunts</hi> two &amp; thirtie ſhips, and foure Gallyaſſes, which brought three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and fiue hundred Spanyards vnto the Duke of <hi>Mercurie;</hi> amongſt whome manie (being ſick) were ſent vp to <hi>Naunts</hi> to be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, we alſo thinking to haue wintered there with the Galley: but there came preſentlie commandement ſhee ſhould be rigged, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie munition and money to the armie. So departing from <hi>Naunts,</hi> we came to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of <hi>Morbien,</hi> thinking to haue founde the armie, but wee vnderſtood the whole fleete were returned to Spaine, foure Fly-boates, and two Gallyaſſes onelie excepted, which were gone to <hi>Blewet,</hi> to take the towne of <hi>Hensbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Captaine hearing theſe newes, went aſhore the next morning, taking all the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and two hundred Spaniſh ſouldiers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23097:5"/>
with him, whom he conducted to the towne of <hi>Vannes.</hi> When they were departed, the Lieutenant being left to keepe the Galley, with no more than ſeauen and twentie, or thirtie ſouldiers, I came vnto the captiued Captaine <hi>Le Pyne,</hi> and aſſured him, if he could finde meanes to breake or widen his mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, there was now great likely-hoode of his eſcape, with the reſt of the ſlaues. <hi>Le Pyne</hi> hearing my words, askt counſell of a ſouldier in the Galley, who affected him dearely, and for his ſake willingly conſented to our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, appointing in his watch to put tallow into the touch-holes of all the Calyuers, and after prime them; and I in my watch ſhould widen <hi>Le Pynes</hi> manacles, which accordingly I did, purpoſing that wedneſday morning, being the ſeauenth of Nouember laſt, to put our pretence in execution; but the wind being contrarie, wee referred it, till the next night: which ſorted (through Gods ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauce) to an happy end.</p>
            <p>Vpon thurſday morning, at three of the clock, I aroſe and called my other compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; being the Prouanſal, with whome hauing counſelled of the matter, I came to a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which was in the watch, ſaying, I could not ſleepe, being ſhaken with an ague, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if he pleaſed, I would watch for him till
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23097:5"/>
day; to which he gladly conſented, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanſall did the like by the ſouldier which watched in the poope, ſo ſtaying till wee thought euery man was a ſleepe, I came vnto <hi>Le Pyne</hi> bidding him diſpatch, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing there was but one rapier for vs, I fained my ſelfe to be verie ſick, and came to a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the middeſt of the Galley, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a little <hi>Aqua Vitae;</hi> from whence I ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueyed the Carpenters axe, and hid it in the poope, and comming to <hi>Le Pyne</hi> ſaid, now diſpatch come away or neuer, hee followed preſently, and I going before, blew out all the Lampes in the Galley, that none might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him pace: ſo comming to a Scotſhman, who was appoynted to aduertize the other ſlaues his companions, they ſhould ſuffer no ſouldiers that were in the prowe to paſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poope. But as we paſſed into the poope, <hi>Le pine</hi> not being perfect in the way, ſtumbled at an Italian called <hi>Nicolau,</hi> who ſodainely waking, demaunded who was there? It is your friend ſaid I. And being further que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, whether I did watch, I anſwered yea, and that I came to ſee, if it were faire weather. So comming into the poope, <hi>Le Pyne</hi> tooke the rapier, and I the axe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanſall hauing nothing, and ſo I ſtept vnto the Lieutenant and killed him: <hi>Nicolau</hi> the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23097:6"/>
awaking, and ſeeing how I ſtroke at his fellowes, caught me in his armes; ſaying, Engliſh traytor yeeld, or thou ſhalt dye, I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Le Pyne</hi> to help; who thruſt at him: which he ſeeing, left me, thinking to haue caught <hi>Le Pyne,</hi> but I followed him ſo hard, that at two blowes wee feld him ouer bord. Then wee ſet vpon the reſt, and ſlew thirteene of them; ſome lept into the water, and foure or fiue getting into a boate, called aboord a ſhip which was at an ancker before vs, ſaying, ſhoote, ſhoote, the ſlaues rebell againſt vs.</p>
            <p>But I perceiuing their purpoſe, and fearing that the ſhip would haue ſhot at vs, I got the yrons wherewith they binde and vnbinde the poore ſlaues, and gaue them to the Skot, ſaying, vnlooſe thy ſelfe, and light mee two Lynt-ſtocks and bring them forward; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſlaues haile forward the great can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and priming the reſt of the peeces, I hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid to the ſhip, and ſwore, if they in any wiſe attempted to hinder our libertie, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie ſinke her, and with that ſhewed them my lynt-ſtockes light.</p>
            <p>They of the ſhip hearing this, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible noyſe that the ſlaues made in breaking off their chaines, anſwered they woulde not hinder vs: ſo I cutting one of our cables, and weying another ancher, made the ſlaues
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23097:6"/>
rowe out of the hauen, and being at ſea vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſed them all: and that night by the help of God came to Bel-Ile, where hauing but 24. loaues of bread, and ſmall ſtore of other vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, being 153. ſlaues beſides the Prouan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, Le Pyne, and my ſelfe, wee paſſed the time as well as wee could. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wee ſet ſayle, and on Sunday the xi. of Nouember brought her into the towne of Rochel: where ſhee dooth remaine for the Kings vſe.</p>
            <p>Captaine Le Pyne, being at Rochel, was perſwaded to goe to the King for a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and in going was taken by the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers of Poyters, and my ſelfe being ſore hurt returned to Rochel, and afterwards came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, hauing the Maior and gouernors hands to their great Seale.</p>
            <p>Thus did I, by the help of God, eſcape the Spaniſh ſlauerie, the very Frenchmen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues bearing no rule where the Spaniard is in preſence: they vſe them as Dogges, the Captaines of the galley haue beene Italians, and other officers Spaniards, the moſt of their galley-ſlaues haue beene Frenchmen, Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, Scots, and Engliſh. Thus wiſhing vnto my countri-men, to be warned by other mens harmes, I end.</p>
