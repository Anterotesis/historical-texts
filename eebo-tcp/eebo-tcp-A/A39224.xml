            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And all this sheweth, and much more might be produced to shew, what need there is of <hi>Counsel;</hi> which, after thirty or forty years experience in the way of <hi>Congregational Churches,</hi> in fulness of liberty, we finde more and more need to insist upon, and that in such a fixed and ordered way, as that thereby men may be tyed to attend unto Counsel.</p>

There cannot be a <hi>less Council</hi> then that was, for there were but two Churches mentioned; and there cannot be a <hi>greater,</hi> and more compleat one, because there were

the greatest Counsellors, a most compleat Pattern, even the Apostles of Jesus Christ; teaching, That if there be but two Churches, they may enjoy the Ordinance of <hi>mutuall Counsel,</hi> though more incompleatly.

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because in Councils there is <hi>most light,</hi> and nearest to infallibility: and the more compleat, the better; though the most compleat Council may erre, because they have not a promise of infallible assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because when the Apostles themselves had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Churches, they did guide and counsel them how to use their power; as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

In thus doing, Councils succeed the Apostles.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Inasmuch as Councils are <hi>Publick Assemblies,</hi> and that not onely Ecclesiastically publick, but Civilly also, when they are held with openness and boldness. Hence, <hi>Civill Authority</hi> hath influence, by Law and Command, to give al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance unto such Assemblies; and so they have an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall Efficiency</hi> in calling Councils: but the <hi>Intrinsecall</hi> and <hi>proper Efficients</hi> of a Council, are <hi>the Churches,</hi> who elect and send Messengers to that end.</p>

                  <hi>themselves.</hi> And the reason hereof is, Because, as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of Learned men, is to affect a Prolacy over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: So the temptation of the Fraternity, is to affect a Morellian Democracy. And therefore the wisdome of God hath by institution ballanced all Ecclesiastical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils with Members of <hi>both sorts,</hi> that may ballance each other, by <hi>Number</hi> at least, though not in <hi>Weight,</hi> yet enough to prevent any prevalency of a temptation, either to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate the Churches under any Prelatical Usurpation of the Learned; or to elevate and intoxicate the Fraternity, to affect any inordinate power: which rather, and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The end of the Churches sending these Messengers, is to manage the Ordinance of <hi>Counsel</hi> in due order.</p>

               <p>Though Moderators may be often changed, it is not fit: that the Notaries should be so often changed.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The Power of Ecclesiastical Councils is onely Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or Doctrinal: Power of <hi>Censure</hi> is by the Lord fixed in the <hi>Church;</hi> and hence, when any appeal unto a Council, it is for further and more clear light from the Scripture, and for conviction thereby, but not for the Exercise of any Juridical Power.</p>

               <p>Hence in such places where, through the riches of the Grace of Christ, Churches are numerous, it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that the management of these Councils should be in Order, according to the Pattern of <hi>Compleat Councils, Acts</hi> 15. For multitude unordered, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Order</hi> is one of the <hi>Beauties of Heaven,</hi> and so it is of the Churches. <hi>Let all things be done in Order,</hi> 1 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. 40. <hi>Ierusalem is a City compacted,</hi> Psal. 122. 3. and the more orderly Bodies are, the better are they compacted.

Furthermore, this is to be considered, that though the <hi>Twenty four Elders</hi> are so called, by the least Number that they can be, by this Constitution; yet, according as the riches of Gods grace is more abundantly poured out, they may be more in Number, though under this constituting denomination. For, one Church may send forth <hi>

So likewise upon the same ground, when there be more <hi>Eminent Lights</hi> in any of the Councils (as through grace it is like often to be) they may send more then one to the <hi>Provincial,</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> or <hi>Oecumenical Councils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but still they are the <hi>Twenty four Elders,</hi> because that is the <hi>Foundation Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. What if I should illustrate this Point by that of the Apostles? who are often in Scripture called <hi>the Twelve Apostles,</hi> and yet there were more Apostles then <hi>Twelve:</hi> for who doubteth but that <hi>Paul,</hi> who was none of the <hi>Twelve</hi> yet he was <hi>an Apostle,</hi> and <hi>a chief Apostle,</hi> a great Foundation; and <hi>Barnabas</hi> was an <hi>Apostle</hi> also, <hi>Acts</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

               <p n="10">X. Again, though <hi>Twelve Churches</hi> be the lowest Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>first Combination,</hi> yet they may be more then <hi>Twelve,</hi> when the pourings out of Gods grace shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; yea, they may be any Number under <hi>Twenty four Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then <hi>Twenty three Churches</hi> should be in a Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Messengers sent to the <hi>first Council</hi> will be a great Number; but still they are the <hi>Twenty four Elders</hi> before the Lord, by their fundamental Constitution.</p>
               <p>So a like Number of <hi>Provincial Councils,</hi> and a like Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>National Councils,</hi> though their Messengers are many, yet they are still the <hi>Twenty four Elders,</hi> growing up, through grace, and increasing unto more <hi>Orders of Councils,</hi> for the greater glory of Christ.</p>
               <p>And when (through grace) there shall be <hi>Twenty four Churches,</hi> or <hi>first Councils,</hi> or <hi>Provincial,</hi> or <hi>National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> then they must be compacted into <hi>two Orders</hi> of those Councils, because <hi>Twelve</hi> is the Foundation Number, by which they are multiplied, and compacted. And when this is done, they are reduced to be <hi>Twenty four Elders</hi> strictly; the <hi>Foundation Number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in the Order of that <hi>Civill Government</hi> set up by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41580:7"/>
the Orders of <hi>Ten,</hi> and of <hi>fifty,</hi> &amp;c. are denominated b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the least and constituting Number: though those Orders may consist (when they are full of people and blessing) of many more, even any number under <hi>Twenty</hi> and <hi>an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, &amp;c.</hi> But when <hi>Ten</hi> are become <hi>Twenty,</hi> and when <hi>Fifty</hi> are become <hi>an hundred,</hi> then they must be multiplied into <hi>more Orders,</hi> because these Numbers are <hi>Foundation Numbers,</hi> by which the <hi>Orders</hi> of the Government are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and compacted; and when that is transacted, they are reduced unto their <hi>Foundation Numbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is here in the Ecclesiastical Orders of Government, the least Number of a compleat stated <hi>first Council,</hi> is <hi>Twelve Churches,</hi> whose least Number of Messengers are <hi>Twenty four;</hi> and by these Numbers they are denominated, though they may be more Churches in a Combination, and more Messengers from some of the Churches: and so it is in all the other <hi>Orders of Councils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a little further illustration of this point, I shall propose and answer <hi>Six Questions,</hi> which may let in a little further light into this Frame, and remove some Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>Quest. 1. <hi>May a Church perform any Ecclesiastical Acts by Messengers, or Representatives in their Name?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea. doubtless they may; they may <hi>Consult,</hi> and <hi>Agree</hi> to <hi>give Counsel,</hi> in such cases as may be presented for that end, touching either <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Order,</hi> as it appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Quest 2. <hi>May a Church elect by Messengers or Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, when themselves cannot be present where such Election is performed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> act of Election may be transacted by <hi>some</hi> of a Society; yea by <hi>a few</hi> in behalf of the rest, when they have their consent, and a calling so to act. For instance,</p>
               <p>If a <hi>lesser Number</hi> of a Church be necessarily absent from an act of Election performed in a lawful Assembly, they are all involved in the act of the <hi>major</hi> part: This is without Controversie fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Again, if the <hi>major</hi> part be necessarily absent, and fond a <hi>lesser</hi> part, or a <hi>

as if the <hi>whole People</hi> had been present; and <hi>David</hi> was King, not onely over the <hi>Representatives,</hi> who did actually chuse him, but over <hi>all the People,</hi> who did Elect him by their Representatives.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Political Bodies,</hi> whether <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> are multitudinous, and remote from the place of action, either <hi>all cannot act,</hi> or if they do, it must be by <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quest. 3. <hi>May a Church Elect Elders or Messengers out of another Church, unto a publick and common service of Christ and of the Churches?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, they may: For the <hi>great Collection</hi> of the <hi>Gentile Churches,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> carried up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at his last going thither, was an act of <hi>many Churches:</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> with those that went with him to present it, were <hi>chosen by the Churches</hi> unto that service, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19. And there were <hi>many more Churches Contributors,</hi> then there were <hi>Messengers sent to carry it. Acts</hi> 20. 4. there were but seven or eight in <hi>Pauls</hi> company, but all the Churches of <hi>Galatia, Corinth, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> were Contributors. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Churches <hi>chose Messengers</hi> who were none of their own <hi>particular Churches,</hi> unto that <hi>publick and common ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Christ, and of the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the ready subjection of all the Churches about <hi>Antioch,</hi> and other places, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 4. unto the Decrees of the Council at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> doth probably speak, That, as the trouble by those <hi>Questions,</hi> was a <hi>common case</hi> in all the Churches; so they had some <hi>fore-knowledge, concurrence,</hi> and <hi>consent</hi> (after <hi>consent</hi> sure enough they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d) in the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (Teaching Elders of <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 13. 2.) unto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to the Apostles and Elders about that matter.</p>
               <p>Again, seeing the Rule of <hi>Communion of Churches</hi> doth impose upon Elders a <hi>degree of care of all the Churches,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of those <hi>within their Ordered Communion;</hi> it doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so give unto all the Churches, a <hi>mutual interest in each others Elders,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41580:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>Hence, when they chuse any of the Elders within the compass of their Order, they chuse those, who, in <hi>some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> are their own, in whom they have an <hi>Ecclesiastical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> especially unto this publick service of <hi>Counsel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quest. 4. <hi>May many Churches Elect a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ew of their Elders unto some publick and common service<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches so Electing are interessed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, they may: For <hi>all the Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, Macedonia,</hi> &amp;c. did Elect <hi>a few</hi> to accompany <hi>Paul</hi> in carrying their Contributions unto <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and it is expresly said, that from the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> there were but <hi>two sent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Acts 20. 4. and we know there were at least <hi>seven Churches</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> Rev. 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>4.</p>
               <p>Quest. 5. <hi>When two, or a few Elders are chosen by many Churches unto some publick and common service of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, do they represent all the Churches who did Elect them unto that service?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, they do so: For when <hi>many Churches</hi> (by <hi>Paul</hi>'s ordering) sent <hi>a few</hi> Messengers to <hi>Corinth,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 23. to fetch their Contribution, to be carried (among the Contribution of many other Churches) unto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Paul,</hi> and a few others, chosen by the Churches unto that service, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19. these <hi>few Messengers</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present <hi>all the Churches who sent them:</hi> So as that what the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> should transact <hi>afore them,</hi> is expresly said to be <hi>afore all the Churches,</hi> viz. who sent them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 24.</p>
               <p>Quest. 6. <hi>These Orders of Councils, First, Second, Third, representing fewer or more Churches, Are they a Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Touching the <hi>first Councils,</hi> consisting of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Messengers of Churches</hi> sent for that end, it is out of question that these are a <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> Acts 15.</p>
               <p>The great difficulty is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> touching the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third Orders of Councils,</hi> and so higher, unto the highest <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Council,</hi> whose Members are chosen immediately by Councils, yet with the express consent of every particular Church: not immediately by the <hi>Churches,</hi> but by their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching these, in way of humble Proposal I affirm,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they are a Divine Institution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because their <hi>Foundation, Formation,</hi> and <hi>Constitution,</hi> is deducible from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as appeareth by laying together the foregoing <hi>Questions,</hi> and <hi>Answers</hi> thereunto, with what hath been said before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41580:8"/>2. Because this <hi>multiplying of Order upon Order,</hi> seemeth to be typified in the <hi>Ascents</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and by the multiplication of the Number <hi>Twelve</hi> in the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> Rev. 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Because if there be not this <hi>multiplying of Council above Council</hi> (<hi>above,</hi> I say, not in any <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>cal Power,</hi> but in <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi>) then it doth not yet appear that there is any way or expedient, whereby there should be a <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Equal</hi> Communion of all the Churches in a Nation, wherein every Church shall be, by their own act and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, interessed and concerned.</p>
               <p>Much less can there be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Equal</hi> Communion of Churches, of several Nations.</p>
               <p>For, if several Nations should need and desire to hold <hi>Communion of Councils,</hi> who shall chuse the <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> by whom this Communion shall be held and acted?</p>
               <p>If <hi>Princes</hi> chuse them, it is not a regular Ecclesiastical Council. If <hi>Churches</hi> chuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and send them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall <hi>some Churches</hi> onely chuse them, or <hi>all the Churches? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> and how can their act interest and oblige all?</p>
               <p>If <hi>all</hi> the Churches must chuse, then <hi>Immediately,</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                  <hi>Delegates: Immediately,</hi> it is unfeizible, especially to act in knowledge and prudence; but <hi>mediately</hi> by their <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> and <hi>Representatives</hi> they may.</p>
               <p>The same may be said of the Communion of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in a Nation or Province, where Elections must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Now that <hi>several Nations</hi> ought to hold Communion, and also <hi>all the Churches</hi> in a Nation, it doth appear in these Scriptures: <hi>Isa.</hi> 19. 23, 24, 25. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>This being commanded by God, and as yet no Way or Expedient appearing, whereby it may be duely acted, we are at a great loss.

               <p n="10">X. Every one of these Councils doth continue in being, until, according to Order, a <hi>new Election</hi> be made; the new Election doth antiquate the old.</p>

               <p n="11">XI.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Primitive Churches had a <hi>stated</hi> and <hi>perm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nent</hi> way of counsel eminently, and more then our <hi>stated</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Councils</hi> can be, for they had the Apostles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists constantly among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41580:12"/>And though they had fixed Elders in every Church, yet they did need the visitations, and frequently made use of the counsel of the Apostles and Evangelists, who were the <hi>permanent Councils</hi> of the Primitive Churches.</p>
               <p>And though it hath pleased the wisdome of our great Lawgiver, to give us but <hi>one Example</hi> of an ordinary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and that he hath done, to be our perpetual guide in our ordinary way; yet there be many examples of the Churches need of, and frequent use of the Apostles and Evangelists counsel, whom they had alwayes with them, or knew <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> to repair unto them for their help.</p>
               <p>And we finde by much and long experience, that our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Churches</hi> do stand in as much (if not more) need of <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>stated Councils,</hi> as the primitive Churches did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the <hi>constant presence</hi> of the Apostles and Evangelists, alwayes for their <hi>directive,</hi> and often for their <hi>corrective <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>We finde by experience, that our Churches do oftener need the <hi>directive</hi> help of Councils, then the <hi>corrective,</hi> and in both respects together we need them to be always in being.</p>
               <p>Many good works for the promotion of the Gospel and Kingdom of Jesus Christ do stick long in the birth, and languish: yea, oft miscarry and vanish for want of the help of Councils.</p>
               <p>Sundry Churches also, and remote places, ly long in the dark, without food and help, for want of the orderly care of setled Councils; <hi>Every bodies work is no-bodies.</hi> But when all Churches are in order, all know where their work lyeth.</p>
               <p>Disorders likewise, and insuperable distempers, by long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Nor can it be said that there is <hi>no example</hi> nor ground of stated and permanent Councils in the holy Scriptures, seeing the Apostles and Evangelists were so, and more, unto the Primitive Churches.</p>
               <p>Hence also it was enough to give us <hi>one p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not this strengthen the Argument for Bishops, and such like Superintendents over the Churches? for so they a gue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Were there a like example in an ordinary way, set down in Scripture, for this work to be done by any one <hi>Man</hi> not extraordinarily called, as there is <hi>for a Council,</hi> then their Argument would have force with it; but such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>pattern,</hi> or <hi>precept</hi> for it, is not to be found. And the way of Councils, (which is clearly instituted) is sufficient to attain the end, as we have found by pracious and pienteous experience: though we are still defective, in that we have not our Councils <hi>stated,</hi> and we do finde great inconvenience by reason of that defect.</p>
