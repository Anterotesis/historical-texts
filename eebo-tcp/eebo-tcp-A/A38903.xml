         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my laſt I acquainted you with the Generals
leaving of Bath, and comming in perſon to the
ſiege before Ragland, where he was entertained
in the army with great acclamations of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
After which, he ſent a ſummons into the
Caſtle, to which a dilatory anſwer (though not
an abſolute deniall was ſent; a civill Reply was made unto it: And
after a dayes conſideration thereof, the Marqueſſe tooke occaſion
to write a calme Letter unto the Generall: Expreſſing how much
he did reſpect the Generals Family, and what long acquaintance
he had with his Grandfather: In concluſion, invited to have ſome
Propoſitions ſent him, which were accordingly ſent: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
were honourable for the ſouldiery, but as to the Marqueſſe
to ſubmit to the mercy of the Parliament. The Marqueſſe having
conſidered of the Propoſitions, remained doubtfull, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Parliament would confirme what the Generall ſhould
grant, in caſe they ſhould agree, to which the Generall returned
him an anſwer; aſſuring him, That what he concluded of would
be performed. Whereupon, Thurſday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 13. the Marqueſſe
sent out a Drum, deſiring leave to ſend out his Commiſſioners, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
at 10 of the clocke: Whereupon (he ſayes) his Excellencie
ſhould ſee he would not be an obſtruction to a peace: which we
conjectured was as much as to ſay, He would ſend a poſitive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to our Propoſitions: And thereupon the Drum was returned
with a ſafe conduct for the Commiſſioners comming forth, and a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109260:2"/>
ceſſation of armes from 10 of the clocke till three. The Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
appointed on our part to meet theirs, were, Colonell <hi>Birch,</hi>
Maſter <hi>Herbert,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners of Parliament reſiding
in the army, and Major <hi>Juliday;</hi> whoſe Commiſſion was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what they ſhould deliver, and to preſent it to the Generall.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now give you an account how near our approaches are
made unto the Caſtle: That which is our maine worke, is about 60
yards from theirs, and that's the moſt. We have planted 4 Mortar
peeces, each of them carrying Granado ſhels, 12 inches Diameter,
and 2 mortar peeces planted at another place, carrying ſhels about
the like compaſſe: So that in caſe the Treaty doe breake off, we
are then ready to ſhew by what extremity they muſt expect to be
reduced. This we are very confident, that the Granadoes will
make them quit their workes, and out-houſes, and ſolely betake
themſelves into the Caſtle; which indeed will be a worke of time
before we ſhall be able to undermine it, in regard we muſt mine
downe the hill under a moate, and then their works, before we
can come to the Caſtle; yet we conceive it feaſible to be done
with ſome loſſe. Our Engineer, Captaine <hi>Hooper,</hi> a painfull and
honeſt man (proceeding as he hath begun) with exact running tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(which are made ſo ſecure, as if they were workes againſt a
ſtorme) will (with Gods Bleſſing) come within 10 yards in few
dayes, and then I beleeve we ſhall make galleries, mines, and many
batteries: The Generall is every day in the trenches, and yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
appointed a New Approach, which the Engineer of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who is now returned from Worceſter is to carry on with all
expedition: He has already broke the ground, throwne up ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of about an hundred yards in length and circuit, and is
within 60 yards of under part of their workes.</p>
            <p>During the Parley yeſterday, which held from Nine till Two,
they permitted us to come to their Workes, ſtand cloſe to their
Stockadoes and trenches and diſcourſe with them, ſo little do they
regard our knowledge of their Workes they are ſo ſtrong: The
Propoſitions ſent out by the Marqueſſe yeſterday, were as high as
ever any Gariſon yet propounded, to which the Generall returned
a ſhort and poſitive Anſwer, letting his Lordſhip know his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
deſerved no anſwer, and as for himſelfe, he muſt expect no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109260:3"/>
other conditions but to ſubmit to the mercy of the Parliament, and
gave him time till this day at Ten a Clocke to receive his finall
Anſwer; We are all perſwaded if he could but have leave to go
beyond Seas, the Souldiers having honorable conditions, he would
ſubmit, and were it not better to grant a man of 84. yeares thoſe
termes, that probably will be in his grave before the affaires of
Parliament will give leave to call him to triall, and thereby ſave
the lives of many an Officer and Souldier that have adventured
their lives in the Parliaments Cauſe (and may yet do them great
ſervice) to gaine this old mans Carkaſſe at ſo deare a rate. Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Rainsborow</hi> is already come to the Leagure, and his Regiment
and Colonell <hi>Hamond's</hi> this day expected: The Marqueſſe hath
this Morning ſent forth word that he will treate upon the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
Propoſitions: Whereupon the Treaty is appointed at Maſter
<hi>Oates</hi> his houſe about a mile and halfe from <hi>Ragland,</hi> where it is
to begin this afternoone at Two of the Clocke. The Generals
Commiſſioners are Colonell <hi>Morgan,</hi> Colonell <hi>Birch,</hi> Maſter

affright me: I know by your will and conſent it ſhould never be;
but ſouldiers are unruly, and the Parliament unqueſtionable, and

in my Lord of <hi>Shrewsberies</hi> Caſe, the Actors in that breach (who
were none of my Armie) have received their cenſure, and by this
time I beleeve the execution. But here, if any Concluſion be made
while I ſtay, I dare undertake there ſhall be no ſuch thing, or if
any, there ſhall be reparation.</p>
