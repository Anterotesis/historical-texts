            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>OH Lord God, the great and terrible, that rulest heaven and earth, that puttest down one, and settest up another, and none may say unto thee, what dost thou? Look down from the hibitation of thy holiness, and thy glory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with an eye of pity this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nation. O Lord, things are now at that pass, that we know not which way to look; Our eyes are up unto thee, merciful God, save or we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish! Let not the oppressions and calamities that have already befaln us seem small in the eyes of thy compassion, though we confess thou
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30718:4"/>
hast punished us much less then our iniquities deserve: But for thy mercy sake, which is over all thy works, for thy sons sake, who taketh away the sins of world, let it be enough: Let there be no more such terrible shakings, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes among us: Let the prayers of thy small remnant more prevail with thee for pardon and mercies, then the abominations of wicked men and hypocrites for judgement, and vengeance. Sanctifie thy bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter providences to such as it hath pleased thee to afflict and debase: Give them submiss patience under thy all-ruling-hand, and a joyful harvest from their sorrows, even if it be thy will in this life, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, in the next: and however thou disposest (O thou most Just and most Wise) of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and interests; yet let the interess of thy Gospel be Advanced,

Shew thy self a Defender if the innocent, One that humbleth those that exalt themselves, that taketh the crafty in his devices, and maketh the hypocrite a terror to himself. Lord God of Hoasts! Let not them have occasion to say with their mouth, or in their heart, that thou God hearest not, or seest not; or that thou God hast forsaken the Earth. Let a Book of Remembrance be written for those that fear thee, and yet speak often for thy truth; and put up into thy bottle every tear shed by those, whom it pitieth to see our <hi>Zion</hi> thus in the dust. Return Oh Lord! how long stoppest thou thy ears and wilt not hear thy

people pray? Be pleased for thy Sons sake, yet at length to make this Land a praise in the Earth, an holy Church, and a Religious prosperous State. Take away from amidst us the spirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion and strife, and hatred, and hypocrisie; and pour out a Spirit of love, of equity, and of truth: Remove every stumbling-block and rock of offence, every galling thorn, and pricking briar to the spirits of such as desire to fear thy name: and make the way of the Lord so plain in the Land, that the wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring man, though a fool, may not err therein. And cause all of us, however at present unhappily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, yet at length with unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous hearts to say; Not any of our wills, but the will of our Lord be done.</p>

And how many colours are found out to make each pretence seem probable? How difficult is it to determine which is right? how uncomfortable to hover between uncertainties? how dangerous to resolve at a rash adventure? Oh Lord, thy unworthy Servant hath a long time sadly considered these premises; and amidst those floods of doubts and controversies which now cover the face of thy Church, can scarce (with <hi>Noah's</hi> Dove)
