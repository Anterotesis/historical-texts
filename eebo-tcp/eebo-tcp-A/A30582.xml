         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe provident care of God is manifeſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his People in the preſent Preſervation of, and proviſion for them. To have the mouths of Lions ſtopped when we are caſt into the mid'ſt of their Den; the Waters to be a wall about us on the right hand and on the left, which in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and tendency would overwhelm us, to have the Buſh burning, and not conſumed, are as evident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the good will of him that dwelt in the buſh, of Gods preſence with and owning of his afflicted People now, as in the days of old; yea to have Hony out of the flinty Rock, Manna in the Wilderneſs, a voice behind us, Saying, This is the way, walk in it; enforceth as great an obligation to admiration and thankfulneſs upon us, as upon the Iſraelites of old. Among'ſt the many Engliſh Prophets who are dead, and yet ſpeak, the Reverend Author of the enſuing Treatiſe may challenge a place with the firſt Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies:
<pb facs="tcp:101278:3"/>
His Works, not my words are the beſt Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to commend him: That Scripture Encomium may be written upon his <hi>Stepney</hi> and <hi>Cripplegate</hi>-Lectures,—<hi>This and that man was born there.</hi> For although many now living, do through mercy enjoy able Teachers and Inſtructors; yet do they owe to him the Name of Father, as an Inſtrument of their Converſion. I may boldly apply that ſaying to holy <hi>Burrough's,</hi> which was once ſpoken of a Learned Divine beyond Sea: <hi>Meruerunt viri docti etiam poſt funera vivere, ac docere ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptis poſteros, quos infeliciter poſt eos naſci contigit; in eo autem virorum ordine Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughſium reponere, nemo praeter eum, qui propriae diffidit virtuti, prohibebit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Sermons preſented to thy view, are with the help of an able Learned Divine, (who alſo heard theſe Sermons preached,) caſt into that form of a Tract that now thou ſeeſt them in, without any material Additions or Alterations. The time when the Reverend Author preached them, was next in order after thoſe convincing Sermons, of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Sin; ſo that this Goſpel Soul-Reviving Diſcourſe was then a word ſpoke in due ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>In this Treatiſe thou haſt Goſpel Grace ſtated rightly, the Juſtice of God cleared, the Mercy of
<pb facs="tcp:101278:3"/>
God exalted, poor trembling Sinners incouraged to come to the Blood of Chriſt for Pardon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinners awakened out of their deadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding Dreams of Heaven, when they are ready to drop into Hell. In a word, here thou may'ſt take a view of the Love of the Father, the Grace of the Son, the Fountain opened for Sin and for Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Cordial Waters of Life for ſinking and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners, here thou may'ſt behold Sin, Damning ſin, ſin that God hates, and cannot but hate; Sin that God puniſheth, and cannot but puniſh, taken off the poor believing ſinner and laid upon his Surety; ſin condemned and puniſhed in Jeſus Chriſt, and the Believing Sinner juſtified, pardoned, acquitted. If therefore thou prizeſt peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt, Pray for light to direct thee into a diſtinct knowledge of this <hi>Goſpel Truth,</hi> and take up this Book and read it, and the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things, anſwerable to the Deſign of the Author, and the Prayer of him who heartily wiſheth thy Salvation, and growth in the knowledge of God, and of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>IT is now long ſince I undertook the Printing of this Book, and as my Incouragements were many, ſo I had obtained of one of thoſe Reverend Divines that have given their atteſtation to it, to peruſe the Work, and had his Teſtimony that he heard thoſe Sermons preached; and upon Peruſal of them found not any thing Material left out, of what the Author Mr. <hi>Jer. Burroughs</hi> delivered; and knowing that Mr. <hi>Peter Cole</hi> (who formerly Printed many of the Author's Works) had long laid wait and endeavoured to get this Copy out of the hands of thoſe that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Author's Books, offering as great Reward for the ſame, but could not obtain it. And now at laſt being ſo much wiſhed thereunto by his friends; being aſſured that as the whole is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpiritual and lovely in its Matter, and that wherein the very ſpirit and ſtyle of Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> is manifeſted; ſo there are many things (as I am informed) were never ſo much as touch't upon, or handled by any other Writer, and yet are of very great Importance to be known by all Intelligent and Sober-minded men, I thought good, having this aſſurance from them, to certifie ſo much to the Reader.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have, as you may remember, in many Sermons endeavoured to ſhew unto you the malignity and dreadful evil that there is in Sin; And what more ſeaſonable and ſuitable Argument can we now treat of, than the bleſſedneſs of Pardon of Sin?

                  </gap>s, that by the former argument have been made apprehenſive of the dreadful evil of it? How readily will they ſay, with the Prophet, <hi>How beautiful are the feet of thoſe that bring</hi> (ſuch) <hi>good tidings?</hi> Wherefore, me thinks, while I am reading this Text, I ſhould be like a man at an Eccho, that hears the words thereof reſounded back again, by every broken hearted ſinner in this Congregation, <hi>O, bleſſed, bleſſed is the man indeed whoſe tranſgreſſions are forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A word ſpoken in ſeaſon</hi> (ſays <hi>Solomon) is like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver</hi>; and conſidering,<note place="margin">Prov. 25.11.</note> how large I have been in opening of the <hi>Evil of Sin</hi> unto you, if ever a word was ſpoken in due ſeaſon, I hope it may be out of this Text:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101278:5"/>
The word of Reconciliation and pardon of Sin; and if God inable me to clear up unto you the excellency of thoſe Truths contained in this Scripture, I hope they will prove in all your eyes to be as <hi>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words read, are the firſt words of one of <hi>David</hi>'s Penitential Pſalms, and they are indeed the genuine voyce of a true Penitent; the very Character of an humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Soul; he is one that has admiring thoughts of the bleſſedneſs of the pardon of ſin: I will not ſpend time in Analyſing the whole Pſalm, becauſe the ſweetneſs and bleſſedneſs of the Argument draws my heart to come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to it; And bleſſed may your ears be, who after hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the dreadful evil of ſin, may come to hear the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed doctrine of Pardon; it is that which God has deny'd to many thouſands: And who knows but many even of thoſe that in this Congregation have heard the ſorrow of that Doctrine, are now gone (perhaps to their own place) and feel what they then heard, and much more, and are paſt ever hearing the argument of pardon and forgiveneſs of ſin: that bleſſed ſound ſhall never come to their ears; but the horrid noiſe of yelling, roarings, and curſings of damned ſpirits, for the wrath of God that lies heavy on them for their ſin.</p>
               <p>This Pſalm in the title of it is <hi>a Pſalm of David Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chil</hi>; that is, <hi>a Pſalm of Inſtruction</hi>; or, <hi>for Inſtruction:</hi> And what is a more uſeful Inſtruction than to inſtruct the ſoul where true bleſſedneſs lies? And what is a better inſtruction than to tell man the way of the pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin? the way to true happineſs? The happineſs of the reaſonable creature is that which many wiſe men thought to find out, but after all their ſearch, they were much puzled, and in the dark, and could never come to find where it lay, by all the wiſdom of the fleſh; only the rational creature is capable of bleſſedneſs, becauſe it is cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of ſuch an act as to reflect upon it ſelf: that is the ground why the rational creature is capable of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, above all other creatures; no creature can truly be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101278:5"/>
ſaid to be a bleſſed creature, but only the rational; becauſe no creature elſe can reflect upon its own condition to know it ſelf. But then not only to know our ſelves, but our own happineſs, where our bleſſedneſs lies; this muſt needs be a profitable inſtruction. No Philoſopher did ever give ſuch a deſcription of happineſs as this is, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe,</hi> &amp;c. yea <hi>David,</hi> who had a Monopoly of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this world to the full, and had the Crown upon his head, ſays not, Bleſſed is he that is Crowned and has a Kingdom. <hi>David</hi> that had the riches of this world, did not ſay, Bleſſed is he that hath this worlds goods. <hi>David</hi> that had honours, and was reputed among the mighty men, did not ſay, Bleſſed is he that hath worldly honours. <hi>David</hi> that had many Victories over Enemies, ſays not, Bleſſed is he that rides in Triumph over his Enemies. <hi>David</hi> that had ſumptuous Palaces, and the delights of this world, does not ſay, Bleſſed is he that has them. But in the midſt of all Outward good things, <hi>David</hi> enjoyed in this world, he finds his bleſſedneſs to conſiſt in this, <hi>The pardon and forgiveneſs of his ſins</hi>; he pronounces them and them only bleſſed, whoſe ſin is pardoned.</p>
               <p>This Inſtruction of the bleſſedneſs of Pardon of Sin, as it lies here annexed, is of weight indeed, and of infinite concernment: <hi>Luther</hi> ſays, <hi>The Argument of free Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Remiſſion of Sin, is that that makes a Divine:</hi> and this may be added to that, 'tis this that makes a Chriſtian; <hi>To be inſtructed rightly in the Juſtification of a Sinner, is that that makes a Chriſtian.</hi> Nay, although we had ten thouſand Inſtructors in other things, not only in Natural knowledge, but in Divinity too, in all the points of it; yet we could never be wiſe unto Salvation, except we were inſtructed with this inſtruction, in the bleſſedneſs of Juſtification and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin. <hi>Luther</hi> ſays, <hi>Let this Doctrine lie dead, and all the whole knowledge of other Truths is to little purpoſe.</hi> Therefore well may the title of the Pſalm be <hi>a Pſalm of Inſtruction: Bleſſed is the man whoſe Tranſgreſſions are forgiven, and whoſe Iniquities are covered.</hi> Wherefore our Point of Doctrine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words is this,
<q>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101278:6"/>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> The Bleſſedneſs of a Man, or of any Soul; conſiſts in the free Grace of God forgiving of his ſin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That is our point; the bleſſedneſs of any man or woman does not conſiſt in the enjoyment of any thing in all this world, but in the free grace of God forgiving of his ſin; It neither conſiſts in any thing we can do or have, but in the free grace of God forgiving of ſin; and that is the meaning of that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 6, 7. which St. <hi>Paul</hi> cites from this place of Scripture, obſerve it, 'tis to this very purpoſe, even as <hi>David</hi> alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man to whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe Iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe Sins are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> The ſcope of the Apoſtle in this place is, to declare the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful, conſiſted not in any thing he had or did, but in the free grace of God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of his ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. ſays <hi>Paul,</hi> Where is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs you ſpake of? for, <hi>I bear you record, if poſſible, you would have pluckt out your own eyes, and given them to me:</hi> Where is then the bleſſedneſs you ſpake of? What's the meaning of this bleſſedneſs? certainly this bleſſedneſs in my Text, it was this bleſſed doctrine St. <hi>Paul</hi> being firſt that brought it to the <hi>Gallatians,</hi> concerning the free Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a poor ſoul by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, in the free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and remiſſion of his ſin by faith in Chriſt; this is the bleſſedneſs ſpoken of: Now, becauſe the <hi>Galatians</hi> at the firſt hearing of this doctrine were ſo mightily taken with it, that they cry'd out, O this is a bleſſed doctrine; Remiſſion of Sin by the free grace of God through faith in Chriſt, O this is the bleſſedeſt doctrine that ever we heard; they were ſo taken with it, that if poſſible, they would have pluckt out their eyes for <hi>Paul,</hi> that brought them ſuch a doctrine as this at their firſt hearing and receiving of it. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the <hi>Galatians</hi> were turn'd aſide by falſe Teachers, that had taken off the edge of their affections to this bleſſed Truth. Now <hi>Paul</hi> coming to reprove them, ſays, Where is then the bleſſedneſs you ſpake of, there was a time
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101278:6"/>
when I firſt taught you the Doctrine of the free forgiveneſs of ſin by faith in Chriſt, and you ſaid it was a bleſſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and your hearts were mightily taken with it, where is it now? How comes it to paſs that your hearts are ſo taken off from the eſteem you then had of it? Where is then the bleſſedneſs you ſpake of? Thus 'tis uſually, the Miniſters of Chriſt come and preach Doctrine to People that their hearts are taken with, their ſpirits ſtir'd, and they mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with the firſt hearing of it; but afterwards by ſome ſin, or the company of carnal friends, their hearts are taken off, though while they were hearing ſuch and ſuch a Truth, their hearts glow'd and burn'd within them. God grant it may not be ſo with ſome of you, who when you heard lately the Doctrine of the Evil of Sin, your hearts were mightily affected, and you ſaid, O what a dreadful evil is there in ſin, in the leaſt ſin; and being convinced of it, you began to reform; yet afterwards you fell off again. May it not be ſaid of you, Where is the ſence of the Evil of Sin you ſpake of? Where is that bitterneſs upon your hearts, on the convictions you had of the evil of ſin? Where is it? What is become of it? As St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, the bleſſedneſs you ſpake of, Where is it? What is become of all that ſtrength and power the Doctrine of Remiſſion of Sin had upon your hearts? Take another Scripture, Remiſſion of Sin is the ſpecial Bleſſedneſs of the ſecond Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi>; when he came to <hi>Abraham</hi> and told him, <hi>In his Seed all Nations-ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> Gal. 3.17. compar'd with the 24. in the 17. <hi>verſe</hi> he ſpeaks of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that the Law that was 430 years after, could not diſanul the Promiſe that it ſhould be of none effect, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>Wherefore then ſerved the Law?</hi> why ſays he, <hi>It was our Schoolmaſter to bring us unto Chriſt:</hi> The ſcope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew, that there is a Covenant of Grace beyond that of the Law, and that the Covenant of the Law is to bring us to the Covenant of Grace; and the principal thing in the Covenant of Grace is in the 24. <hi>verſ. The Law,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was our Schoolmaſter to bring us unto Chriſt</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That we might be juſtified by faith, and thereby receive
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101278:7"/>
remiſſion of our ſins, if the Scripture places bleſſedneſs in the remiſſion of ſin: That it is ſo, I ſuppoſe is clear enough, the main buſineſs we have to do, is to ſhew how it is ſo; that is, to open unto you wherein the bleſſedneſs of the pardon of ſin conſiſts, and ſhew you in what particulars the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pardon of ſin may appear unto you: and to that there are many things may be ſaid.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Bleſſedneſs of the Pardon of Sin, which appears <hi>1.</hi> Negatively in the Evil it frees us from.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat, that hath been lately delivered of the Evil of Sin, may be of great concernment to diſcover where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bleſſedneſs of pardon of ſin lyes, the deliverance from ſo great an evil, as you heard, the evil of ſin was; ſurely, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſins are forgiven.</hi> If ſin be ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an evil as you heard, ſurely, Bleſſed is the man that is delivered from all that evil: if it remain freſh upon your minds, what the evil of ſin againſt God was, and what it brought upon your ſelves; you cannot but ſay, this is one principal thing wherein it appears, that man or woman is bleſſed that hath his ſin pardoned: If any man or woman be in any great danger, or under any great evil or miſery; and if he be delivered from it, we ſay, that man is a bleſſed man, or a bleſſed woman that is quit from ſuch a woful evil that was upon them; you account your ſelves happy to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered firm any dangerous ſtorms, and to have a calm; Are not they then happy that are delivered from the evil of ſin? Let me ſpeak a little to a poor ſinner that underſtands what the meaning of ſin is, and that underſtands ſomewhat of the dreadful evil of it: I would ask of thee oh poor ſinner; What ſeeſt thou? the anſwer will be, What ſee I? Oh I ſee the angry Countenance of an Infinite God againſt me, whoſe eyes are as a flaming fire looking with indignation upon me!
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101278:7"/>
I ſee a black diſmal cloud of the diſpleaſure of the Almighty hanging over me! I ſee a moſt hideous and dreadful ſentence of wrath ready to fall upon me! I ſee woe, miſery, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction purſuing of me! I ſee blackneſs of darkneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation even ſurrounding me! I both ſee and feel the woful accuſations of a guilty Conſcience within me, condemning me; continually grating upon my ſoul, and terrifying me with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Viſions of eternal miſeries to betide me! I ſee the chain of black guilt and horrour on my ſoul, that I carry with me whereſoever I go! I ſee the bottomleſs gulf of eternal horrour and diſpair with the mouth of it wide open ready to ſwallow me up! Now then, this ſight being preſented before an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and awakened Conſcience; Now comes in the pardon and forgiveneſs of ſin whereby this dreadful cloud is diſpel'd, the tempeſt is gone; the darkneſs and miſery vaniſh't away, and all evil whatſoever the ſoul is ſet free from, ſin, and from all the dreadful conſequences of it. Is not this a bleſſed man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring his former condition with his preſent ſtate, looking on him as even now, having the ſenſe of the dreadful evil of ſin upon his Conſcience, and the heavy burden of it on his back, ready to ſink under it, into the gulph of miſery, and now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin comes; O what a bleſſed change is this! O <hi>bleſſed is the man whoſe ſin is pardoned.</hi> Now what God had laid unto his charge, or his own Conſcience, the Law, the Devil, or the World, 'tis all done away, all is diſcharg'd and gone, bleſſed is the man that is thus delivered; <hi>Old things are paſt away, and all things are become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. it is meant not only of Sanctification, but of Juſtification alſo, he is a new creature; <hi>Old things are paſt away, and all become new.</hi> Brethren, by reaſon of the ſin of man, there is a curſe upon the whole Creation, and this old Creation muſt come to confuſion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an evil thing for any man to ſeek his happineſs in any thing here in the old Creation, for there is a curſe upon it, and it will come to confuſion. But there is a new Creation of all in Chriſt, of all ſpiritual things in Chriſt: Now a ſinner when he comes to have his ſin pardoned and be juſtified, he come's into a new ſtate, that comes in by the new Creation; the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Children comes by, and conſiſts in the new Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101278:8"/>
old things are done away, and he comes to be ſeated in the new creation in Chriſt; this is the firſt thing wherein a man or woman is bleſſed, Negatively, in being delivered from ſo great an evil.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Poſitively, he's a bleſſed man whoſe ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, if we conſider, the excellency of that mercy God makes that ſoul partaker of, whoſe ſins are forgiven, Dan. 9.9. <hi>To thee Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveneſſes,</hi> forgiveneſs is the fruit of glorious mercies, Exod. 34.6. <hi>The Lord is merciful and gracious, long ſuffering and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving inquity.</hi> Now I ſhall open this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, and ſhew the riches of mercy in forgiveneſs of ſin. When the Scripture applys mercy to forgiveneſs of ſin, it hath divers expreſſions, ſometimes calls it <hi>riches of mercy, Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. ſometimes, <hi>plenteous mercy,</hi> Pſal. 86.8. ſometimes, <hi>Gods fulneſs of compaſſion,</hi> Pſal. 78.38. ſometimes, <hi>multitude of mercies,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. I might give divers other places, but thoſe may ſuffice; it is rich, plenteous, fulneſs of compaſſions, and multitude of mercies; When God forgives ſin, he ſhews mercies in all theſe expreſſions. For the opening of it unto you, I ſhall ſhew you what abundance of mercy God ſhows in the forgiveneſs of ſin, conſider mery 1. in the Efficient. 2. in the final cauſe of it.</p>

                     <hi>1.</hi> Of the Efficient Cauſe of Mercy in forgiveneſs of Sin.</head>
                  <p>Firſt for the Efficient Cauſe: there is abundance of mercy God manifeſts in the forgiveneſs of ſin, he abounds in his mercy, there is a Sea, an infinite vaſt Ocean of mercy, in which, the ſins of the Elect come to be ſwallowed up, though their ſins be many, and great, and committed with many grievous aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations: yet when they come to an act of Juſtification, to God, to be forgiven; I ſay, God comes to the ſoul as an infinite Ocean of mercy, that ſwallows up all the evil in ſin, attend unto it, Look as in the mighty Ocean, whether you caſt in a load or a ſhovel full of earth, the vaſt Ocean makes little difference of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101278:8"/>
either; ſo when a ſoul comes to God in Chriſt, when it comes to Pardon and Juſtification, whether ſins be little or great, 'tis all one, the mercy of God makes no difference at all; take heed to what I ſay, while I am ſpeaking of forgiveneſs of ſin, I ſhall make known ſo much grace, that if you abuſe it, it will be one of the moſt dreadful things that ever you did, and therefore while I go along, take heed of abuſing it, eſpecially you that deſire to hear of the pardoning mercy of God; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your ſins be little or great, when you come to pardoning mercy, it is an infinite Ocean that ſwallows up all; thoſe that have not their ſins pardoned, whether their ſins be little or great, it makes no difference, they are truly damn'd for little as well as great ſins, both ſinks down into Hell, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Ocean of wrath and horrour ſwallows up all; ſo in point of Juſtification, whether your ſins be little or great, it matters not, pardoning mercy ſwallows up all.</p>

                     <hi>2.</hi> Of the Final Cauſe of Mercy in forgiveneſs of Sin.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, but further, as Mercy is an infinite Ocean that ſwallows up Sin, ſo Mercy is the Final Cauſe. It is to this end that God might manifeſt the riches of his grace; when God forgives any one ſin, this forgiveneſs comes from Gods mercy, and it is to this end, That God may declare before Men and Angels, to all eternity, what the greatneſs and infinite riches of his grace is, what the grace of God is able to do when God comes to pardon ſin; 'tis for this end as if he ſhould ſay, Well, I am about now to pardon thy ſin, and this work I am about to do, it is for this very end, that it may be known to Men and Angels to all eternity, what the infinite riches of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace of God is able to do for poor ſinners. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that man is a bleſſed man, if the man whoſe ſins are pardoned hath ſuch mercy ſhewed to him, and ſuch a bleſſed work upon him, as is to that end, that God may declare to all eternity what the glorious riches of grace of an infinite God is; ſurely this is a great bleſſedneſs, when God ſhall ſeperate a man or woman for this end, it muſt be very glorious; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly therefore pardon of ſin is no light and mean thing, but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101278:9"/>
it muſt be a moſt glorious work of God whereſoever it is: And this Conſideration is a mighty Argument to uphold a poor ſoul under trouble of ſin, and a great incouragement for him to come in for pardon: Doſt thou ſee O troubled ſoul Gods wrath againſt thee, and doſt thou ſtand quaking at the apprehenſion of the evil of ſin? let not thy heart ſink, come in, and caſt thy ſelf on the free grace of God, there is a poſſibility for the pardon of thy ſin; for when God comes to pardon ſin, the mercy God ſhews in pardoning of any one ſin, he does it to the end that he might magnifie the riches of his grace to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſuch mercy that ſerves to that end muſt needs be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; And will not ſuch mercy ſerve thy turn, as muſt ſet out the infinite rich grace of God? God is pleaſed to manifeſt thus much mercy for the forgiveneſs of thy ſin; and where a ſinner is forgiven, it is this mercy that is manifeſted: when men judge of God by themſelves, they think ſlightly of him, when they judge of Gods thoughts by their own: What is the reaſon that makes ſinners have ſuch ſlight thoughts of ſin, but becauſe they judge of God by themſelves, that he abhors ſin no otherwiſe than man does, and ſo hope they may do well enough, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the infinite hatred that God hath to ſin by their own: ſo on the other ſide, the ſinner that is convinc't of the dreadful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of ſin, is ready to diſpair; Why? becauſe he judges of God by himſelf; as if the mercy of God were no other than the mercy of man; not conſidering the mercy of God in pardoning ſin, is ſuch mercy as is to ſhew his grace in the riches of it to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Well then, that man to whom ſuch mercy is ſhewn muſt needs be very bleſſed.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> THirdly, Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſins are forgiven, becauſe there is a glorious myſtery of godlineſs in forgiving of ſin; the work of God in forgiving a ſinner hath abundance of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101278:9"/>
glorious myſteries in it, the Argument ſtands thus; That man or woman for whom God ſhall work, ſuch a work as hath multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of glorious myſteries in it; that man or woman is bleſſed: But where ever ſin is forgiven, God works for that ſoul ſuch a ſtrange work, the ſtrangeſt that ever he did; a work that hath ſo many admirable myſteries in it, that in the opening of them will declare every way that this ſoul is bleſſed. And this is the buſineſs I would now do, to open the myſteries that are in the forgiveneſs of ſin; and it is to this end, that as I might ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the great work of God in pardoning ſin, ſo alſo that you might have higher thoughts of it than ever you had before, for that's it I aim at, to raiſe up the thoughts of men to the right underſtanding of this great point of the Juſtification of a ſinner, that ſo you may ſanctifie Gods Name, by having ſuch thoughts of it as the thing it ſelf calls for.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Where ſin is forgiven, it is by means of a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul, it is through the Mediation of the Son of God, obſerve it, for there is no point in all Religion is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er uſe to underſtand, than this point of the way of God in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of ſin, becauſe of the many myſteries of God contained in it; I hope I ſhall make it appear it is no ſlight work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Mark then, when God pardons ſin, 'tis always done through the mediation of the Son of God; God never pardons any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a Prince does; when a Malefactor hath offended him, he comes and humbles himſelf, caſts himſelf down at his feet, and cryes, I pray Sir forgive me, and he ſays, Well, I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you; God never forgives any ſin thus; and yet it is thus with people when they come to God for pardon, moſt of them never think of any other way. Friends, there muſt be a great deal more than ſo: for whoſoever hath his ſins forgiven, it muſt be by the vertue of the mediation and interceſſion of the Son of God, he muſt ſtand up before the Father, and mediate for thy ſoul: if all the Angels in Heaven ſtood up to mediate, it would not be ſufficient; but the Son of God alone muſt do it; 'tis as if a Malefactors condition was ſo, that the mediation

of all the Nobles could not prevail with the King for a pardon, but there muſt be the mediation of the Prince himſelf to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: So I ſay, poor ſoul, thou mayſt think it a ſlight buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but know if ever thou art forgiven, it muſt be by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Son of God, he muſt ſtand up to mediate for thee, and plead, Oh Father let ſuch a poor ſoul that hath been a Sabbath-breaker, a Lyer, a Drunkard, an Unclean perſon, let his ſins be forgiven, and let him not be damn'd, Father put in his Name for pardon: I ſhall not ſpeak of it how Chriſt mediates, but that is and has been his work from all eternity, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and make interceſſion for thoſe he ſaw before in the eternal Council of God ſhould live in ſuch times; and whatever pardon of God is gotten, it is through him; and if thou poor man ever com'ſt to be pardoned, know Chriſt hath been mediating to God the Father for thee; Oh Father, ſuch a poor creature that dwells, it may be, in ſuch a Cottage, or in ſuch an obſcure place, let his name be put in for forgiveneſs. And now, is not this a bleſſed thing, that thou poor creature ſhould'ſt have the Son of God to mediate for thy name to be put in for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don! this of a truth is ſo, if there be any truth in the Divinity of the Word, it is in this, That all the forgiveneſs and pardon any creature hath, it is by the mediation of the Son of God, and his heart was upon it from all eternity; ſurely here is abundance of grace in this one thing, take heed of abuſing it; this is the firſt myſtery, you muſt not look for pardon of ſin in a natural way to cry for forgiveneſs, but you muſt go in the Name of the Mediator in this myſtical way.</p>

muſt take the debt upon your ſelf, you muſt be their Surety, and you muſt enter into Bonds to pay everyfarthing of what debt the ſinners owe, you muſt pay all if you will undertake for them, ſo it is, for I will never come upon themſelves for it, but on you: Certainly there are theſe tranſactions between God the Father, and God the Son, from all eternity about the pardoning of any ſin, however you commit a ſin, and think not of it, and cry, Lord have mercy upon me, and ſo you have done with it, there's an end, you think that is all: But I ſay unto thee; if thy ſin be pardoned, Chriſt muſt take the debt upon himſelf, and be thy Surety, 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>He made him to be ſin for us that knew no ſin</hi>; the way of pardon is by a tranſlation of all our ſins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, Chriſt himſelf God bleſſed for ever, the Delight of the Father muſt be made ſin for the ſoul that hath ſinned; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, all the ſins thou haſt committed, if ever they be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, they muſt be by vertue of the Covenant between God the Father and the Son: all thy ſin muſt be tranſmitted on Chriſt, all thy oaths, drunkenneſs, and wickedneſs muſt be put upon him, and he muſt ſtand charged with them all: Oh you that are ſo laviſh in ſin, and take ſuch liberty to do wickedly; I ſay, if ever thy ſin be pardoned, it muſt be laid on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, run on as faſt as thou wilt, if ever thou be'ſt ſaved, at the beſt, yet thy ſin muſt be ſet on him, and charg'd upon his ſcore.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101278:13"/>
and juſtice of God in the forgiveneſs of a ſinner. Many people when they ſeek for pardon of ſin, they only think of Gods infinite grace and mercy, but not of his juſtice: But certainly, who ever he be that comes to be pardoned, God ſhews himſelf infinitely juſt as well as merciful; that he is merciful, that is clear to every one: But how does it appear he is ſo infinitely juſt? for that there is a clear Text for it, Rom. 3.26. <hi>To declare at this time his righteouſneſs that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus</hi>; ſo that God in the juſtifying of him that believes in Chriſt is juſt as well as merciful.</p>

afterward,</hi> this is a mighty myſtery; for God when he takes a poor ſoul and forgives him his ſin, he does not only forgive him his preſent and paſt ſins, but lays in a pardon for all the ſins that ever ſhall be committed by him afterwards; this is a way of pardoning ſin proper to God alone; there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pardons the offence one of another, ſo as God pardons here; therefore the Prophet cries out, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity and paſſeth by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the remnant of his heritage?</hi> Who is a God like to thee; who in all the world can pardon ſin as God doth? No Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pardons the ſin of a Child, no Prince the ſin of a Subject as God doth: Now, becauſe this is a point of admirable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all the Saints of God, 'tis fit it be opened and made out, that when God pardons ſin at firſt, he gives in a pardon for all they ſhall commit afterwards; I manifeſt it thus, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>There is now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> from whence I argue, Except God did pardon whatſoever ſins ſhould be committed when he juſtifies a ſinner, then at any time when a juſtified perſon ſins, until he renew an act of faith for pardon, there muſt be condemnation to him; for whoſoever is in ſuch an eſtate as hath any ſin unpardoned, for that inſtant he is in the ſtate of condemnation: But there is no inſtant of time, when it can be ſaid of any juſtified perſon, that he is in the ſtate of condemnation; I ſay no inſtant of time, for though a juſtifi'd perſon may fall into ſin after he is juſtified, yet at that inſtant when he falls into that ſin, there is by God apply'd a pardon, that was laid in before, although an act of faith be not renewed in regard of that particular ſin; that is the point I would make good, though it be true, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as our duty an act of faith to lay hold on our pardon, yea alſo it is required in reſpect of comfort too; for we cannot have comfort of the pardon of a new ſin committed, except there be a renewal of an act of faith: But yet this renewal of an act of faith, though it be neceſſary, becauſe commanded; and for our comfort, yet no abſolute neceſſity to free us from condemnation; but being once juſtified by Chriſt, there is a pardon laid up; ſo that upon any act of ſin newly committed, this pardon is apply'd by God himſelf, though we be not able
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101278:14"/>
by the renewal of a preſent act of faith, to ſue out pardon anew unto our ſelves. Nay the truth is, if this were not ſo, there could be no inſtant of time, wherein a believer was not in the ſtate of condemnation; for there is no inſtant of time wherein a believer doth not ſome way or other ſin againſt God: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is apparent and undeniable, that there is not a neceſſity of renewing an act of faith upon every ſin committed for the pardon of it, this Argument cannot be denyed, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, there muſt be a neceſſity of renewing an act of faith after the laſt act a believer doth; for in the laſt action a believer doth in this world, there is ſome ſin it: Now if there be ſome ſin in the laſt act of all, then there cannot be of neceſſity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red another act, for the applying of the pardon of that ſin a believer did do in the very laſt act he did in this world: thoſe that hold a believer cannot finally fall away, yet ſay, he may to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; many hold that if once a man be juſtified, he can never go to Hell; but yet this they hold, that he may ſo ſin that he may be brought into a ſtate of condemnation; he may be brought into ſuch a ſtate,, that if he ſhould die at that preſent he ſhould periſh; but ſay they, God doth take care that he ſhall not die, till there be a renewing of an act of faith for pardon: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, there is nothing in Scripture to prove, there is not any inſtant of time wherein a believer may not die; and yet if he do die he muſt then periſh, becauſe an act of faith was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; true ſay they further, that all ſins bring not into the ſtate of condemnation; there may be pardon of courſe for ſins of infirmity, but other ſins that waſt a mans Conſcience, there a believer is brought into the ſtate of condemnation, till there be a new act of faith renewed for pardon. I anſwer, If any one ſin, bring a believer, into the ſtate of condemnation after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, where ſhall we put the limits; as to ſay, if you go but thus far, you are not in a ſtate of condemnation, but if you go a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter further you are; God puts no ſuch limits in Scripture, but all ſin in its own nature brings into a ſtate of condemnation, and yet no ſin brings a believer into the ſtate of condemnation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a great myſtery of God in the pardoning of ſin, when God pardons the ſin of a believer, he does not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don what he hath done at preſent, but for what he ſhall do he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101278:15"/>

It was the bloud of his own Son: God gave him up to death for the ſin of mankind, and for the purchaſing a pardon for man: But ſome may ſay, <hi>What need God have purchaſt a pardon for man? Could he not have forgiven him by his abſolute Prerogative?</hi> I anſwer, there was need, becauſe of the ſatisfaction of Juſtice, he did purchaſe it out of the hands of Juſtice; God was fain to lay down a price to Juſtice, before he himſelf could pardon one ſin: Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied before he could give out one pardon: Well, take all theſe together, Chriſt muſt be our Surety, take the debt

I ſhall open this, That Pardon of Sin is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, and opens the ſluce to let in all other mercies, Jer. 31.31. <hi>Behold, the days come that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and the houſe of Judah:</hi> here God opens his goodneſs, and tells them he will make a new Covenant, not like that he made with their fathers, verſ. 32. <hi>but this ſhall be the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, verſ.</hi> 33. and he inſtances in ſome particulars, <hi>I will put my Law into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother; ſaying, know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me,</hi> &amp;c.

Further upon this there follows two things, <hi>Peace in Conſcience, and with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>; being juſtified by faith he hath peace with God, and as the immediate conſequence thereof, peace in Conſcience and with all the Creatures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Peace in Conſcience,</hi> thoſe fears and grating terrors that aroſe on guilt of Conſcience are gone, thoſe diſmal accuſations of Conſcience are ſtill'd; though 'tis true, a mans Conſcience may trouble him after Pardon and Juſtification, but it is through miſtake, the ground of all thoſe troubles of Conſcience are gone; 'tis with trouble of Conſcience after pardon of ſin as with the Sea, you that are Marriners may ſee the wind at Sea raiſing the boiſterous waves on high, yet after the wind is quite down 'tis a great while before they be ſtill and quiet; ſo in mens ſouls it is guilt of ſin that cauſes woful diſturbances: but when God pardons ſin, he comes into the Soul as Chriſt in the Ship, and bids all be ſtill; and though through our weakneſs, after the ſting and guilt is removed, Conſcience is troubled, yet is God pleaſed to help the weakneſs of his People ſooner or later; not only to pardon ſin in the Court of Heaven, but in the Court of Conſcience too, and then all fears and troubles are gone; certainly thoſe that know what the burnings, throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and ailings of an accuſing Conſcience means, they know what a bleſſing it is to have Peace of Conſcience, a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to have all well there, becauſe the Soul hath much to do with Conſcience, and Conſcience hath much to do with God, yea only to do with God; and if all be well with that which hath ſo much to do with the Almighty, it is a great bleſſedneſs, bleſſed is the man that is thus pardoned.</p>

But I muſt but touch it here: God is Lord of Hoaſts, and all the creatures ſtand armed ready to avenge Gods quarrel, and not only do they ſtand in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, but there is a kind of cry in the creatures to God to make them the Executioners of his wrath; Shall I go and ſtrike this Drunkard ſays one? and ſhall I ſtrike this Blaſphemer ſays ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? All the creatures in heaven &amp; earth cry againſt thee every day: But when God pardons thy ſin, all the creatures preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become thy friends; when the Judge hath quitted a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, the under-Officers have nothing to do with him; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the Creatures they are under-Officers, and when God is at peace they are at peace too;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.15.</note>

Suppoſe a Malefactor come to Court under his guilt being not pardoned; alas, he dare ſcarce look in at Court-gate; and when he comes, he keeps in ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, and dares not ſtir any further than he is call'd; but take another that is pardoned, he comes in boldly and goes from one room unto another, yea into the very Preſence-Chamber, and there can open his mind fully to the King, and ſpeak out all his heart; and this is a great difference between one under the guilt of ſin and another that is pardoned; one under the guilt of ſin he dare ſcarce go to Prayer, and thinks God caſts away his perſon and his ſervices, and that nothing is regarded; but when God comes to pardon, he calls the poor ſinner that was under trouble before, to come and draw near to him, and ſaith, fear not, open thy mind and heart to me, Lam. 3.55, 56, 57. <hi>I called upon thy Name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon.</hi> 57. <hi>In the day that I called upon thee thou dreweſt near, and ſaid'ſt fear not:</hi> Every poor ſoul that is juſtified, may ſay, God knows when I was under the guilt of ſin, I was caſt into the low dungeon, and the chains of guilt were upon me there, but through thy grace thou haſt heard my voyce, hide not thy ear at my breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at my cry; thou can'ſt not cry; yet if thou beeſt one whom God hath received to mercy, thou may'ſt have confidence that

                  <p n="3">3. Pardon of ſin is not only an inlet to many other mercies, but it is ſuch a mercy <hi>as makes all other mercies to be mercies,</hi> and without which no other mercies would be mercies; by this all other mercies are mercies: when once a ſoul comes to be pardoned, it may look upon all it hath in a far more ſweeter way than ever it could before; by this he may look upon Houſe and Land, Wife and Children, Eſtate and Friends, he may look upon theſe as mercies indeed; Why? for he has a pardon, his ſins are pardoned; as a man ſuppoſing he is charged, found guilty, and condemned, having a fair houſe, rich furniture, ſweet yoak-fellow and children, and all things he could deſire; but ſays he, What are all theſe to me ſeeing I am a condemned man? Well, he goes and gets a pardon unexpectedly, and now he returns to his Houſe, Wife and Relations again, and all are ſweet unto him, when he injoys them with a pardon, he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with another manner of eye than he did before; thus there is this difference between the enjoyment of outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in this world when ſin is pardoned, and before it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; thou haſt Houſes and Land, ſweet Yoak-fellow, and Children, trading at Sea and Land, and all things thou canſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; but what is all this to thee, while guilt of ſin lies grating on thy Conſcience? Well, God comes into thee with pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, and takes away thy ſin, the guilt of which lay corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on thy Conſcience, then thou may'ſt look upon thy Eſtate, Wife, Children, and all thy comings in to thee, as coming from the ſame eternal Fountain of Gods eternal love, that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf came from; this is a mighty Argument to perſwade men
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101278:23"/>
to ſeek after the pardon of their ſin, that you may have your comforts and enjoyments in this world in outward things ſweet unto you; and if there were no other reaſon to perſwade you to ſeek after forgiveneſs, this might be enough, that you may have all your outward mercies in mercy to you; you may have an Eſtate, a ſweet Yoak-fellow, and ſweet Children, and all thou canſt deſire, and theſe are mercies, but they are but ſuch mercies as God may give to thoſe that are Enemies unto him; they are but outward mercies at the beſt, coming not to thee as fruits of the Covenant, and ſo are not <hi>the ſure mercies of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>; nay, not worthy to be accounted mercies.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The guilt of ſin upon thy ſoul, is ſo great an evil, that take all theſe things at the beſt, they are but as a grain of Sugar put into a tun of Gall</hi>; a tun fill'd up with bitter Gall, and one grain of Sugar put into it, would not all the ſweetneſs of it be ſwallow'd up in the tun of Gall? ſo were the Monarchy of the whole World made over to thee, yet if thy ſin be unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, there is ſo much evil in it, as all that thou canſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy is but as one grain of Sugar put into a tun of Gall, the evil of ſin would ſwallow it all up.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou know'ſt not what thou haſt, whether it be out of Gods love or hatred</hi>; Nay, thou haſt rather cauſe to conclude, it is out of Gods anger and hatred, than out of Gods love: How canſt thou then account it a mercy, when all the comforts thou haſt, may come out of Gods infinite anger and hatred to thee, rather than out of love? therefore till thou art aſſured of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, thou haſt no mercy, thou canſt be aſſured of, is in mercy to thee: This ſhews,</p>

I am a wretched miſerable ſinner, oh mercy! Well, now you would have mercy, Why now, and not before? before you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101278:24"/>
had other things, and you quieted your hearts with them; and why not now, were not they mercies? but I know not whether they were out of love or hatred; Well, yet you quieted your hearts with them; and now they are all going, Do you now think it a fit time to cry for mercy? Oh how infinitely waſt thou miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that thou did'ſt not cry for mercy before! thou think'ſt it now a fit time to cry for mercy; why? thou had'ſt no mercy that thou could'ſt take the comfort of as a mercy unleſs thy ſins were pardoned; and therefore thou haſt now cauſe to cry for pardon, when ſickneſs comes, and God takes away this and the other mercy, thou think'ſt thou art left naked; if you knew all, you are naked now: and therefore would you live a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life in this world, and have your Houſe, Eſtate, and all Relations mercies to you; never be at reſt till you have got your ſins pardoned and forgiven; this conſidered, might be a mighty argument and means to draw the hearts of men to get pardon, that all their outward things might be ſweetned to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If all outward good be not a mercy unleſs ſin be pardoned, then what good wilt thou or any one get by the increaſe of ſin?</hi> thou think'ſt it to be a good; Why? all thou haſt now is not a good, is not a mercy; and doſt thou think to get good by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſin? when a temptation comes to draw thee to ſin, think thus, I have heard this day that all I have is not a mercy unleſs my ſin be pardoned, and therefore I can never get any mercy by the increaſe of ſin: Certainly did men and women underſtand themſelves, they would eaſily anſwer the Devil by this kind of reaſoning.</p>

And you hath he quickned together with him, having forgiven you all treſpaſſes</hi>; ſo that quickning and Sanctification is a fruit of forgiving of all their treſpaſſes, 1 Cor. 15.56, 57. <hi>The ſting of death is ſin; and the ſtrength of ſin is the law; but thanks be to God that giveth us the Victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the ſtrength of ſin is the law.

great many difficulties in the way, yet luſt to that ſin being ſtrong, it will break through all difficulties to get to it; ſo in mercy, when God comes with mercy to forgive a ſoul, this mercy of God muſt go through abundance of difficulties before it gets to you, which argues it to be wonderful ſtrong mercy, and therefore makes him bleſſed that partakes of it. When God made the World, it was done with a word ſpeaking, God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light:</hi> But when God comes to pardon a ſinner, Heaven and Earth muſt be moved; there muſt be a greater work of God in pardoning of a ſinner, than in making of the world; certainly the work is greater and paſſes through more difficulties.

                     </gap>u haſt done to God ſtand betwixt thee and pardon</hi>; never did any man in the world wrong another man as thou haſt wronged God: How ſin wrongs God has in part been held forth to you, in the evil of ſin and how contrary ſin is to the infinite holineſs of God, yet mercy breaks through that, yea above all, that great and difficult work of the ſatisfying the infinite juſtice of God, yet mercy breaks through that, and there ſtands in that.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This difficulty, that before thou canſt be pardoned, God muſt be made Man, and yet must remain the ſame God he was before</hi>; thou cryeſt for pardon of ſin, or thou art undone; ſuppoſe now, that Gods bowels of mercy did even yearn towards thee for to pardon thy ſin, yet before this is done, there muſt be this great work done; that God muſt be made man, and yet remain the ſame God he was before; here's a mighty difficult work, a greater work than making of the world, and yet mercy breaks through this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Here's this stands between ſin and pardon, That when God is made Man, he muſt die and be made a curſe</hi>; and not only ſo, but God the Father muſt do it; he muſt take his own Son and ſtab him for thee, he muſt himſelf take him and put him to death, and himſelf muſt pour out his wrath upon his own Son, before thy ſins can be pardoned. Now that God the Father ſhould take his own Son, the Son of his delight, ſtab him to the heart, and himſelf put him to death, this is a mighty great work; and yet this muſt be done before thou can'ſt be pardoned.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:101278:29"/>2. <hi>There's this difficulty ſtands in the way, That before ſin can be pardoned, the blind, dead, wicked, carnal, ſottiſh heart of Man, muſt be raiſed up to perform the moſt glorious Act that ever any creature did</hi>; which is an Act of believing: yet ſays God, that thy ſin may be pardoned, I will put forth my infinite power to effect it, to raiſe that blind, dead, ſottiſh, carnal, wicked heart of man ſo full of all wickedneſs, to perform the greateſt work that ever any creature did, for ſo is believing; Gods mighty power is put forth to effect this: Now there is all theſe difficulties lying in the way, and yet mercy paſſes through them all to pardon ſin; ſurely then, that ſoul muſt needs be bleſſed that hath his ſin pardoned; that God ſets his heart upon him ſo much, that rather than he will not ſhew mercy unto him, he will paſs through all theſe great difficulties that lie in the way; and truly on conſideration of this, before I paſs any further, there are <hi>three Meditations</hi> that may be collected hence, and may come with a great deal of power upon all our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Then it muſt needs be a great taking the Name of God in vain, for any man or woman to have ſlight thoughts of ſuch a mercy, as pardon of ſin is,</hi> that comes through ſo many difficulties.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This may come with power upon our hearts, if Gods mercy paſs through ſo many difficulties for the pardon of thy ſin thou mayſt be content to indure much difficulty in ſeeking for the pardon of thy ſin</hi>; thou ſeeſt what an evil ſin is, and art more ſenſible of it than ever thou wert before; well, thou art ſeeking for pardon, and thou camplaineſt, thou haſt waited long for pardon, it may be a quarter, or half a year, or it may be twelve months, and thou haſt got little aſſurance of pardon, and thou findeſt it much more difficult than thou thoughteſt it would be, temptations come ſtronger than ever, and the Devil ſuggeſts more evil thoughts than ever; thou findeſt duties hard to fleſh and bloud, and thou art wearied and tired with temptation, theſe are ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but yet art thou about that great work of ſeeking pardon of ſin, be contented to ſuffer ſome difficulties, yea ten times more than thou haſt; if God ſee good to lay it upon thee, for Gods mercies paſs through difficulties to pardon thy ſin, and if thou get'ſt through, though thou meeteſt with difficulties, thou haſt no cauſe to complain at all; Why ſhould not you be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101278:30"/>
willing to paſs through difficulties in ſeeking pardon, when as Gods mercies paſs through many difficulties to come to thy ſoul; thou art going to God, and ſeeking to him for mercies, and there lies many difficulties in the way; when God was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee, there lay many difficulties in the way, and yet he paſt through them all; therefore thou mayſt be content though thou meeteſt with ſome difficulties in ſeeking the pardon of thy ſins.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>This may make us willing to go through any ſervices, though they be hard, if thou art in getting of pardon</hi>; Suppoſe God ſet us about ſome hard work that hath many difficulties in it, do not complain as if God were a hard Maſter, when he ſets you about any hard work; for be it known unto you, thou art never ſet about any ſuch hard work in all thy life for God, that hath ſo many difficulties in it, as the work of God in pardoning thy ſin hath; there are more difficulties when God comes to pardon thy ſoul for ſin, than in any ſervice whatever that Cod requires of thee; thou look'ſt upon the ſervice of God, and there are many difficulties in it; be contented, do not complain, for God paſt through many difficulties to pardon thy ſin; and this is another conſideration, the difficulties God paſſes through to pardon ſin, is a great Argument that that ſoul is bleſſed that hath his iniquities forgiven.</p>

ſweeten it, ſuch an horrid thing as the death of the Son of God had need have ſome great thing to ſweeten it; what now ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this to God the Father, that his own Son ſhould be put to death? Why? nothing but this, that hereby ſinners might come to be redeemed, juſtified and pardoned, nothing elſe would ſweeten it to God the Father, but this does, Iſai. 53.10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him</hi>; and again, <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand</hi>; the Scripture ſays, God takes no delight in the death of a ſinner; and yet God did take delight in the death of his Son, it pleaſed God to ſee his Son bruiſed: when God the Father ſaw his Son under his wrath, ſwetting drops of water and blood under the curſe of the Law, it pleaſed God well; certainly then there muſt be ſome mighty thing that muſt ſweeten this, and make the death of his own Son a delightful object to him; Why? the very thing that did it was this, that Chriſt being made a curſe, he thereby did redeem us from the curſe, procur'd the pardon of our ſins, and reconciled us unto God; and this very thing ſweetned the death of the Son of God unto God the Father, therefore the heart of God was much in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For Chriſt,</hi> What was the buſineſs that brought him from the Fathers boſome, made him content to take our nature upon him, to ſuffer, and to be a man of ſorrows, ſo as to delight in it? there was a kind of delight to Chriſt in induring the wrath of God; for <hi>with deſire</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>have I deſired to eat this Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> becauſe it was the Preparation to his Death and Sufferings of the wrath of God, in all the fruits and effects of it for the ſin of Man; and when Chriſt came to inſtitute the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and to give his blood for the remiſſion of ſins, the Text ſays, <hi>He gave thanks</hi>; What did he give thanks for? ſurely the thing for which he gave thanks for, (upon which the Supper of the Lord is called the Euchariſt, from the <hi>Greek</hi> word that ſignifies Thanksgiving;) was this, that by his death Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins ſhould be obtain'd: when Chriſt was to die &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all the wrath of God that was due for our ſins, Chriſt bleſſed God &amp; thanked God the Father for it: ſurely there muſt be ſome great matter to ſweeten it; that he ſhould be ſo affected as to bleſs God the Father for that that coſt him his life, and yet he did: Mark what it is that ſatisfies Chriſt for all this, Iſa. 53.10.

                  <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and his ſoul was made an offering for ſin:</hi> all was laid upon Chriſt; Well, but what did Chriſt look for for all this? Verſ. 11. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and ſhall be ſatisfied</hi>; that that ſhall ſatisfie Chriſt for all his pains, labour and ſufferings, ſhall be to ſee of the travel of his ſoul; What is that?

Why by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many; as if Chriſt had ſaid, this is the very thing my Soul travels for, in all that I have done or ſuffered in all my life, that I might but bring this great buſineſs to paſs, to juſtifie ſome ſouls, to get the ſin of thoſe poor ſouls that are thine Elect pardoned, and their perſons juſtified: this my ſoul travels for, and oh Father let me but ſee this, the travel of my Soul, and I am ſatisfied: Chriſt accounted it worth all the travel of his Soul, in all he did and ſuffered, that he might juſtifie ſome ſouls, as if he had ſaid, he would have no other boon from his Father but only this; Father if thou wilt but recompence all my travel with this, I ſhall for ever account my ſelf that I am ſatisfied, and have enough: How ſhould we be ſatified with Chriſt, when Chriſt accounts the pardon of our ſins ſatisfaction enough?

But now know, that all the ſigns in the world will not ſerve to quiet the heart, but that it may return again to its former doubts, till God come to pacifie the ſpirit by the witneſs of the Holy Ghoſt; for it is ſo great a matter, where once the Soul underſtands the infinite breach made between God and it by ſin, that it muſt needs be more than an ordinary work to aſſure the Soul of Gods Reconciliation to it, and nothing can do it ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily but the Holy Ghoſt; he muſt come to the Soul to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it of this thing: perhaps the caſe of a poor Soul is thus; Suppoſe a Priſoner in Goal lies bound in fetters for ſome great offence againſt his Prince; and ſome friend comes and tells him there is hope of pardon; Oh, ſays he, 'tis too good news to be true; well, another comes to the grate of the Priſon, and tells that he hears from the Court, the King hath ſealed Pardons, and put ſuch a ones name in, this is ſome comfort; but yet this frees him not from fears and doubtings.

his own Spirit that lies in his own boſom, and knows all his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, to declare the mind of God, and to ſay to ſuch a ſoul, <hi>Peace be to thee, thy ſins are forgiven</hi>; now this ſatisfies the ſoul.</p>
               <p>But it may be here objected, <hi>How may I know it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God that witneſſes, and not my own fancies or deluſions of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, as we know the Sun by its own light, ſo we may know the Spirit by its own teſtimony; and though there be may ſome ebbs, yet it will riſe again; there is ſuch a witneſſing work of the Spirit, by a kind of ſweet and ſecret intercourſe between God and the Soul, whereby God over-powers all doubts and fears; though I do not ſay, every one hath it in a like ſenſible meaſure; yet this I ſay, when this full aſſurance comes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there may be doubts and many queſtions before in the ſoul, for fear of being deluded, (for certainly many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and deluded) yet then the Spirit over-powers all doubts and fears, and witneſſes to the Soul its own work: Do not you ſay, becauſe ſome are deluded with fancies, that there is no witneſs of the Spirit; when as there is ſcarce any point in the Goſpel the Scripture ſpeaks more about than this of the witneſs of the Spirit: indeed they that judge of the myſteries of the Goſpel by Humane Reaſon, and underſtand no further than that reaches too, and that are little acquainted with thoſe converſes that are between God and a believing Soul, they may ſlight this witneſs of the Spirit; but you muſt know, there is not any Soul that has aſſurance he ſhall go to Heaven, but it is wrought on by a high ſupernatural and myſterious way; and if there were no other way to evidence this to the Soul but by ſome ſigns, this would be no higher evidence than by way of reaſon: But we are to know, as <hi>great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Spirit</hi>; God juſtified in the Spirit is a great myſtery, Chriſts Incarnation is a great myſtery, ſo is a Believers Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as well as Chriſts Incarnation; ſo alſo the witneſs of Juſtification is a great myſtery; and therefore I beſeech you look up higher than for ſuch ſigns as Reaſon may reach unto, and beg of God to reveal this unto you, that thou may'ſt have the

not abuſe this grace of God, I know not how to open it to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers but with a great deal of danger to others; but how much danger ſoever it may be to others, yet it muſt be opened and delivered to Believers; it is Gods mind that his grace ſhould be made known unto them, he would have them to know it to the full, that his Pardoning Mercy is irrevocable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Believer ſhould not queſtion his Juſtification upon every failing in his Sanctification, this is a diſhonour to the free and rich grace of God, if on every failing we call in queſtion that great work of the Juſtification of our ſouls, either to ſay, or think, I indeed did hope before that God had pardoned the ſins of my youth, and all my antient ſins, but falling into ſin again, I am afraid all is undone; all that God hath done unto me is undone again, and I muſt anſwer for all my ſins: this I confeſs will come upon the Conſcience, ſpecially upon the committing of any new ſin; but though it do, yet if ever you have been aſſured of the pardon of of your ſin, know, this mercy ſhall never be recall'd again: <hi>the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure</hi>; and this is a fundamental mercy that always abides: therefore as we obſerved in <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.7. Chriſt ſays, <hi>Thou art all fair my Love, there is no ſpot in thee</hi>; but in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. you ſhall find ſhe was in a ſleepy ſecure and ſinful condition, as a man or woman aſleep, they might do what they would with her; men might impoſe what they would upon her, put her in what poſture they pleaſed, and yet ſhe was unſenſible; but yet in this condition her heart was awake, <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh</hi>; there remain'd a Principle of grace alive in her: but mark what Chriſt ſaid, though ſhe confeſt ſhe was aſleep; yet Chriſt ſays, <hi>Open to me my Siſter, my Love, my Dove, my undefiled:</hi> this was ſpoken when the Church was in a ſecure ſinful condition; yet this is the voyce of Chriſt calling the Church his Siſter, his Love, his Dove, his Undefiled one, when ſhe was in that ſecure condition; which ſhews the grace of God in pardoning ſin is not call'd back again: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a point wherein much treaſure lies, I ſhall a little open the Irrevocableneſs of Gods mercy in his Pardoning and Juſtifying Grace; and for this I ſhall give you ſome places of Scripture, which being opened, as they will ſhew the greatneſs of the mercy; ſo they will afford abundant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101278:36"/>
of Conſolation and Encouragement to every believing ſoul. The</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt Scripture Expreſſion I ſhall name is in</hi> Iſai. 43.25. where the Lord tells his people, that <hi>he blots out their tranſgreſſions</hi>; God ſeems to take much delight in this Phraſe, and therefore doubles it, <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins:</hi> Now this phraſe of blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out is taken from the cuſtom of Tradeſmen that have their Books of Accounts, wherein they enter all their Debts that are owing to them by ſuch and ſuch men: Now when theſe come to be paid, the Debt-book is croſſed or blotted out; if any of you owe a debt, when you come to pay it, you call for the Debt-book to ſee it croſſed or blotted out, and then you aſſure your ſelves you ſhall never hear of it more. Now you muſt know, that all ſinners are debtors to the Lord; they are in <hi>a debt of puniſhment</hi> for want or failing in paying him a <hi>debt of Obedience:</hi> many men by their ſin run into debt with God day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and becauſe God does not call for the debt preſently, they think there's nothing between God and them, but carry it as if all were well; as many Gallants run into Tradeſmens debt to hang fine Cloaths upon their backs, and ruffle it up and down in the world, and never think of their debts till their Creditors come and arreſt them, and caſt them into Goal, and there they lie in Priſon, for all their ruffling it up and down in the world: Juſt ſo men and women by their ſin run into debt with God, and though God do not call for the debt preſently, yet they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Heaven; it is as certain that every ſin of any man or woman is ſet down in Gods Debt-book, as any debt you owe is ſet down in your Creditors Book: and as certainly muſt your debts be call'd for, and ſatisfaction and payment made unto God for them, as certain as any Tradeſman will call for payment of his debt: Now this is the work of Juſtification between God and your Souls, if ye would know the nature of it. When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſees a poor ſoul that God the Father hath given to him to ſave, thus run into debt, Chriſt comes and lays down a price before God the Father, to pay this debt; and Chriſt ſees that the debt be blotted out of the Book: Now when God comes with pardoning mercy to a Soul, God ſhews the debt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101278:36"/>
Book to a Believer, and cauſes him to ſee all his debts blotted out; and by that he certainly aſſures the Soul his debt ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be called for again, this is ſuch a mercy as is irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, it ſhall not be brought back again, the debt being once paid ſhall never more be call'd for; this is the firſt expreſſion, and it is a bleſſed one: Many men that are run into debt, and are in danger every hour to have ſome Bayliffs arreſt them, they cannot look out of their doors but they are ready to fall upon them; they would think themſelves happy, if they might have any that would come and lay down all, and ſatisfie the debt, and that they might ſee the debt blotted out, they would think themſelves happy indeed: Well, know that it is ſo with God when he comes to pardon ſin, the Debt-book is blotted out, and all Bonds cancell'd.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Though they be blotted out, yet they may be before Gods face,</hi> and God may ſee them, though he will not call for them again; therefore the Scripture tells us, that God will take that courſe with the ſins of Believers as that he will caſt them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his back, and never ſo much as lay the debt before his face to look upon them, Iſai. 38.17. <hi>Thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy back</hi>; that which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſpake of himſelf, is true of every believing ſoul, God caſts the ſins of every Believer behind his back; when a man caſts a thing behind his back, he does it to that end, that he might take no farther notice of it; but though God caſt a mans ſins behind his back, yet if they be not very far, he may eaſily turn his face and look upon them when he will: therefore mark further,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Another Scripture expreſſion,</hi> Pſal. 103.10. <hi>As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far hath he removed our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from us</hi>; thus God expreſſeth himſelf, to ſatisfie the ſouls of his people, that their ſins ſhall never be called for again; the Eaſt and Weſt, it is an expreſſion to note out the utmoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; the Eaſt and Weſt are ſo remote, that thoſe two Points can never come together; ſo the ſins that God has pardoned to any ſoul, they ſhall never be call'd for again.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Though they be remov'd as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt; yet God's eyes may look a great way off</hi>; though thoſe Points be at ſo great a diſtance to our eyes, yet not ſo to the eye of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101278:37"/>
God; therefore there is another expreſſion that may make it more full, that God will never look upon their ſins again that he has once pardoned, he blots them out, he caſts them behind his back, he removes them as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt; and if that be not enough to ſatisfie thee, Micah 7.19. <hi>He will caſt them into the bottom of the Sea</hi>; things that are caſt into the bottom of the Sea, are utterly thrown out of ſight, never to be lookt for again; Well, but though God caſt them into the bottom of the Sea, he may think upon them. Therefore</p>
               <p>Fifthly, mark another expreſſion, further to ſatisfie thee, God ſays, <hi>He will remember them no more</hi>; they ſhall be ſo far from being thought upon, that God ſays he will not remember them any more; but you will ſay, it is impoſſible for God but to remember them; yea, but when God pardons, it ſhall be as Irrevocable as if God did never remember them; there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Texts remarkable for this, Iſai. 43.25. <hi>I will blot out thy tranſgreſſions,—and will not remember thy ſins: I, may be not now</hi> (thou may'ſt ſay) <hi>But he will hereafter</hi>; ſee what is ſaid in Jer. 31.34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more</hi>; neither now nor hereafter, <hi>I will remember their ſin no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>They ſhall be ſo forgiven, as that there ſhall be no more mention of them</hi>; there ſhall never be the leaſt mention of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſins before God, and for that ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.16. it is ſpoken of every godly man indefinitely that turns to God, and is a Believer, <hi>None of his ſins that he hath committed ſhall be mentioned unto him</hi>; by the way, let men take heed how they upbraid the people of God for any of their former ſins: Perhaps you knew ſuch a one in the times of his ignorance, and you ſay he was a lyar, a Drunkard; but now God has reveal'd his mercy to him in the pardon of his ſin, and God ſays he will not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them any more: Take heed how you caſt their ſins, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the times of their ignorance, in their teeth, ſaying, oh you are ſo preciſe now, I knew what you were a little before; Shall the God of Heaven ſay, he will not mention them any more; and yet will you do it? God will take it very ill, at your hands: this is admirable comfort to every Believer, that God will not remember their ſin any more; he would have thee to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101278:37"/>
remember them, to humble thy ſoul for them, and to renew thy repentance, but he will not remember them to upbraid thee with them, nor would he have others do it. <hi>Beza</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf: when he was young, <hi>He made ſome vain and ſinful Poems, which his Enemies upbraided him with afterwards, and caſts them in his teeth,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Theſe men envy me the grace of God,</hi> becauſe God has vouchſaf't to me his grace, they envy me, and caſt in my teeth the evil that I have formerly done: Oh what a comfort and priviledge is this to thee! Oh thou believing ſoul, though thou wer't never ſo wicked and abominable before, yet I tell thee from God this day, in whoſe preſence thou ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt that he will never remember thy ſin any more; and this may be a mighty encouragement for men and women to believe and turn from all their wicked wayes, though thou haſt been never ſo vile, abominable, and wicked: yet be it known unto thee this day, that if thou wilt come in and believe, God will never mention any of thy wickedneſſes more, they ſhall be ſo forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they ſhall never be mentioned; thou it may be, art afraid that either here in this life, or at the day of Judgment all thy ſins ſhall be charged on thee; well, be not afraid, perhaps there are many of you that are conſcious to your ſelves of great ſins committed; and you would give a thouſand Worlds to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of them: Oh ſay ſome, there are ſuch and ſuch ſins committed, that are ſo great, that they cannot be forgiven; I may mourn and grieve for them, but what ſhall I be the better? the ſins of my youth lie ſo heavy on me, and God and my own Conſcience upbraids me; and what comfort can I have in my life, when God and my own Soul upbraids me? Well, be of good comfort, and be incouraged, this day to come in and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this bleſſed tidings, that where God pardons ſin he will mention them no more, and he will take it very ill at the hands of any that ſhall mention them to upbraid thee for them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Yet further, to ſet forth the fulneſs of this mercy, when God pardons ſin, they ſhall be ſo done away as that they ſhall not be found.</hi> Jer. 50.20. <hi>In thoſe days, — the Iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found</hi>; for I will pardon them, whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101278:38"/>
and if I pardon them, then they ſhall be ſo done away, as that they ſhall not be found.</p>
               <p>Yet further, the righteouſneſs Believers have in Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an <hi>everlasting righteouſneſs,</hi> and therefore abides for ever, and cannot be afterwards taken away, Dan. 9.24. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined — to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs</hi>; the righteouſneſs that is put upon thy Soul by Chriſt, in the pardon of thy ſin, it is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs, and will abide everlaſtingly. Yet further, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. it is ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt by one offering, hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> that is, juſtified; Juſtification being call'd by the name of Sanctification, or them that are ſanctified; that is, ſet apart to be made partakers of the great bleſſing of the new Covenant, to have a ſhare in the blood of Chriſt for Juſtification; Chriſt by one offering has for ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected them that are ſanctified; therefore being perfected in Juſtification, there is no recalling this mercy back again.</p>
               <p>Once more, this mercy is ſet out by the typical ſervice of the Scape-Goat, Levit. 16.20. <hi>On whoſe head they were to put all the ſins of the People, all their tranſgreſſions, and all their iniquities, and ſend him into the Wilderneſs,</hi> or Land of forgetfulneſs, amongſt wild beaſts, never to be lookt after again; ſo are the ſins of all Believers laid upon Chriſt, and carried into a Land of forgetfulneſs, and ſhall never come to be charged any more: So much for that particular of the Irrevocableneſs of Pardon of Sin, which ſhews that bleſſed is that man or woman that hath their ſins pardoned, becauſe they ſhall never be recall'd again.</p>

                  </note> God in pardoning thy ſin, does more for thee than he would do for thoſe thouſand thouſand millions of Angels; it is a mercy that God has deny'd to thoſe millions of Angels that ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: Suppoſe a poor wretched man be guilty of Treaſon againſt the King, and as he is, ſo a great part of the chief No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Land are guilty alſo, as well as he: But now when the King comes to look upon them, he ſets his heart on this poor man (that perhaps begg'd from door to door) and ſays this poor creature ſhall be forgiven; I will paſs by his offence, and not only ſo, but advance him into high and great favour at the Court, and condemns all the Nobles: Now if this poor man ſhall ſee all the Noble men in chains, that were guilty but of one offence; and he perhaps hath been guilty for act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a treaſonable way 40, 50, or 70 years; and the Noble men guilty but for one offence; and this poor wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſees theſe Noble men in chains, and knows that all they and every one of them are condemn'd to ſuffer moſt dreadful tortures, to dye a moſt dreadful torturing tormenting death: Now what a mighty aggravation is this of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the King, that ſhall pardon the offence of this poor creature; how will he ſtand amazed, admiring at the greatneſs of it; I that am guilty of the ſame offence, yea more guilty than they, and that I ſhall be pardoned, and the chief of the Nobility of the Kingdom muſt die a moſt torturing tormenting death, for their offence; what a difference hath the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour made between me and them: certainly this is the caſe for all the world, with any poor ſoul whoſe ſins are pardoned; God has done as much for thee, to the full; the Angels were the moſt glorious creatures that ever God made, and thou art but a poor worm in compariſon of them; they ſinned againſt him

but once, and thou art guilty of millions of tranſgreſſions, and yet God ſets his heart on thee, and ſays, I will do great things for thee, though I paſs by thouſands, millions of Angels; I will magnifie my rich grace to this poor creature in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſin, and advance him to high favour, though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them into everlaſting chains of darkneſs; now when a poor creature comes to ſee the infinite riches of Gods grace that hath made ſuch a difference between him and the Angels: how will he ſtand admiring of it? me thinks this ſhould mightily work upon the hearts of all poor ſinners, and make them to ſay, What ſhall God paſs by ſuch excellent creatures as the Angels, the moſt excellent creatures that ever God made, and come to me a poor worm, to ſet his heart on me, and ſhew mercy to me; Oh let me paſs by all the excellencies of the creatures to perform my duty unto him; Hath God paſt by the moſt excellent of his creatures that mercy might come to me? Oh let me paſs by all the glories and excellencies of any thing in this world, that my Soul may come in; in a way of duty and ſervice unto him: Shall God leave the glorious Angels to ſhew mercy to me, and to do good for me; and ſhall not I leave my baſe luſts for him? Shall not I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leave any thing to ſerve him? Shall I ſatisfie any baſe luſt, with the neglect of him? God forbid.

                  <hi>Becauſe the execution of a few may be a means to bring others unto allegiance:</hi> But when God comes to execute Malefactors, the execution of ſome cannot be a means to work good on others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially at the great day; 'tis true, in this world God is long-ſuffering, and executes a few, that it may be a means to work good on others; But how is God ſaid to be a God of rich and glorious mercy, and yet pardons very few, and executes moſt; for all the world have been in Treaſon againſt him: how is it that God pardons feweſt and deſtroys moſt? I hope to give you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101278:40"/>
very good reaſon and ſatisfaction, in ſhewing you how the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite glory of the mercy of God appears, and yet but few are pardoned; yea rather the more, becauſe that few are pardoned: God would thereby manifeſt the more his glorious mercy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It may well ſtand with the glorious riches of the mercy of God, that many are deſtroy'd and yet but few pardoned; thus, Becauſe that God would have a proportion between his Juſtice and Mercy</hi>; you ſay, he would have a proportion, Is not be as merciful as he is juſt? Then there muſt be as many pardoned as condemned. No, if God will obſerve a proportion between his mercy and juſtice, and that he will have his Juſtice appear as well as his Mercy, then more muſt be damned than ſaved; How does that appear? thus; <hi>Becauſe the glory of Gods Juſtice in damning twenty hundred, is not ſo much as the glory of his Mercy in ſaving two</hi>; you may conceive it by what is ordinarily uſed among men: If the King ſave but two men that are Malefactors, he magnifies his mercy as much in that as his juſtice if he hang up a hundred: ſo if God ſave but two, his mercy is as much magnified as his juſtice in damning twenty hundred, the reaſon is this; <hi>Becauſe there is ſomething in the creature that calls for Gods juſtice,</hi> that requires that: <hi>But there is nothing in the creature, that requires his mercy</hi>; when God manifeſts his juſtice, he does ſuch a work as is due to the Creature; there is ſomething in the Creature that chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges ſuch a work from God: but when God comes to manifeſt mercy, there is nothing at all in us that ſhould require ſuch a work from God; no, his mercy is free, altogether from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 'tis his own work, and proceeds from his own hearts love, and nothing in us that may challenge it from him: Now ſeeing there is that in the Creature that challenges juſtice, and nothing at all that can require mercy; therefore if God ſhew mercy but to a few, it is as great a glory to his mercy as it is to his juſtice, if he condemn a hundred; but if he ſhould ſave as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as he condemns, the mercy of God would be beyond all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his juſtice, but becauſe that cannot be, hence it is that few are ſaved and many damned.</p>
               <p>Anſwer. 2. <hi>There are more damn'd than ſaved, becauſe God would hereby manifeſt his mercy the more to thee that art ſaved</hi>; by ſuffering ſo many others to periſh: this is one end that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101278:40"/>
God hath in it, that their deſtruction might ſet out the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the glory of his grace to thee. When a Limner would draw a Scutcheon, or a Picture in Or, or any other curious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, he lays the ground-work in black, and then the beauty of the other colours will thereby moſt appear: thou oh ſoul that haſt thy ſin pardoned, know that God lays the ground-work of thy mercy in the black diſmal deſtruction of multitudes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinners, he gives them their due, that that is their right; but the ultimate aim of God in it riſes to this, that their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may make the brightneſs of his glorious grace appear the more gloriouſly to them that are ſaved; that the Saints whoſe ſins God hath pardoned, may in Heaven have this argument to praiſe his grace ſo much the more, becauſe they are cull'd out of the maſs and multitude of ſinners that are damn'd; this will mightily inflame the hearts of Saints in giving God glory in Heaven, when they ſhall ſee ſo many thouſands and millions of thouſands caſt down to eternal deſtruction; that God ſhould do this to ſet off the riches of his grace to them: How will this inflame their hearts in giving God glory, and this God aims at as the top of his glory that he might have a company to be the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal objects of the riches of his grace; and this ſhews the baſe and low account God hath of wicked men, that he lets them periſh eternally, that he might magnifie the glory of his grace to Saints; What an aggravation is it of the greatneſs of Gods mercy to Saints, when he is content that ſo many thouſands of others ſhall periſh, that his mercy to them may more gloriouſly appear? As when a Prince hath a Child born, that he might ſhew his honour to the Child in ſolemnizing the Chriſtning of the Child; it may be thouſands of Oxen and Sheep ſhall looſe their lives in the ſolemnizing of the joy the Prince hath in his Child: If the Solemnity of the Joy the Prince hath in that little Infant may be the cauſe of thouſands of creatures loſing their lives, this ſhews the dear reſpect he hath to his Child, or elſe he would never let ſo many creatures go to the Shambles, but that he might ſhew his reſpect to his little Infant: So ſays God, there is a handful of People that I have thoughts to do good too, to all eternity, and I have ſet my heart upon them; and that I may manifeſt the greatneſs of my mercy to them, I
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101278:41"/>
will let thouſand thouſands of others periſh eternally, to be but as a black ground for that glorious work, that I intend to manifeſt in the riches of my grace in Chriſt in the pardoning of their ſin: thus you ſee it is a peculiar mercy, and therefore bleſſed are they that have their iniquities forgiven; <hi>for it is a mercy that is peculiar to them only.</hi> Oh how ought they to bleſs God, that he hath call'd them out of the multitude, when he has left others to the ſway of their own carnal ſottiſh and malitious hearts to go on againſt the ways of grace; and all <hi>becauſe he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi>

                  <hi>FUrther, Bleſſed is he that hath his iniquities forgiven, becauſe the very poſſibility of it to thouſands of creatures now under wrath would be priſed more, than ten thouſand worlds,</hi> to have but a poſſibility of it upon any terms; thoſe that are now damn'd in Hell, and ſee the ſtroaks of Gods dreadful wrath againſt them for their ſin, that are now ſwallowed up in the gulf of miſery and condemnation; if they might have but any poſſibility to have their ſins pardoned; how would they priſe it, if ſuch a Meſſenger were ſent from God to Hell-gates to call there and to cry out, <hi>O ye damned ſpirits, behold a meſſage from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; I come unto you from him, and this is the meſſage to let you know, That there is a poſſibility upon ſome terms (that God will require) that your ſins may be pardoned, and you delivered from that dreadful wrath you now lie under?</hi> How would the damned ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſing and rejoyce, and look about them to attend this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage? What acclamations would there be in Hell in the mid'ſt of thoſe fiery flames? What holding up of hands and rejoycing would there be to hear of ſuch a thing, that there is a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity on any terms? they would not ſtand to enquire what the terms were, whether hard or eaſie; they would anſwer, let
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101278:41"/>
them be what they will, if there be but a poſſibility it is enough, thinking every one it might be he: Well then, if the poſſibility of being ſaved, would be received with ſuch joyfulneſs by the damned in Hell; What then is the Poſſeſſion of it, and glorious knowledge of it to a ſoul that is already pardoned, if they would all cry out, on ſuppoſition a meſſage ſhould be delivered of a poſſibility that ſome ſhould be freed from Hell, and have their ſins pardoned? They would all cry out, Oh bleſſed, bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is he that ſhall have his ſins pardoned, and be delivered from Hell! if they would give this teſtimony, let us give it much more; Though there be a bleſſed difference between their condition and yours, yet not long ſince there was not, it may be, for ought you know, ſome of them might go to Church with you, ſit in the ſame Pew, and hear thoſe Sermons of the Evil of Sin, which now they are gone to feel, and are ſhut up in the bottomleſs pit, beyond any poſſibility of pardon: But this is granted to you all that are before the Lord this day, In the Name of God I can boldly preach this unto you, that if you come in and believe, there is a poſſibility, yea even for the worſt of all, they may come in and be pardoned, Now if the damned in Hell would priſe it ſo high, if there were a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for them to be pardoned, ſhall not you priſe it as high as they? as I remember in ſetting out the evil of ſin, that was one thing that aggravated the ſin of men above the Devils, that <hi>the Devils believe and tremble,</hi> and yet ſome men will not do ſo much as the Devils; ſo now I ſay, if there were but a poſſibility of pardon to the damned in Hell, how would they rejoyce; and ſhall not you rejoyce more than the damned ſouls in Hell would? Bethink your ſelves, if the damned ſouls in Hell would rejoyce, if they had a meſſage of a poſſibility for them to be ſaved; me thinks you ſhould not be quiet, if you find not the ſame workings in your hearts as would be in theirs; Shall a poor Miniſter be forc't to ſay, there is leſs hopes to prevail with you than if he were to preach to thoſe in Hell? Shall he ſay, there would be better Auditors in Hell than are here? God forbid it ſhould be ſo, that there ſhould be more ſtirring in Hell (if they might but here of a probability of being pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) than there is with you, if your hearts are not ſtirr'd at the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101278:42"/>
hearing of this bleſſed Doctrine of the Pardon of Sin; that there would be better Auditors in Hell than you are, whoſe hearts are not ſtirr'd in hearing the glorious myſteries of the Goſpel opened, how a ſinner may come to get the pardon of his ſins; God forbid it ſhould be ſo.</p>

                  <hi>FUrther, Bleſſed is he that hath his Iniquities forgiven, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin it is the ſpecial end of all the Ordinances of God</hi>; the Ordinances of God that he has appointed and ſet up in his Church, attain their end in this bleſſed effect, in the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin; and it is an argument their is much bleſſedneſs in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, becauſe thoſe precious Ordinances of Chriſt attain their ſpecial ends in it; <hi>there are three great Ordinances I ſhall inſtance in, the Word, Sacraments, and Diſcipline</hi>; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſhould count themſelves in a happy condition when they ſee thoſe bleſſed ends wrought on them, which God hath appointed thoſe Ordinances to effect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For hearing,</hi> 'tis a great Ordinance that Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>When he aſcended on high he gave gifts unto men</hi>; upon Chriſts Triumphal Aſcenſion to God the Father, he gave this great gift unto his Church, that his Church ſhould have Paſtors and Teachers; which by the way, argues the horrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe that ſlight Paſtors and Teachers of his Church; becauſe it is part of the glorious gift of Chriſt when he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on high: Well, did Chriſt ordain Paſtors and Teachers for the preaching the Word; ſurely it is for ſome great end and purpoſe that he hath in it, there is ſurely ſome great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he intends to reap by it. What is the end for which Chriſt hath ſet up this great Ordinance? 2 Cor. 5.18. <hi>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf, and hath committed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101278:42"/>
to us the Miniſtry of Reconciliation.</hi> Miniſters of the Word are Miniſters of Reconciliation that God hath given to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: what is that? read the next verſe, to wit, <hi>That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſes unto them:</hi> Now then, there is a word of Reconciliation, and this is committed unto us, God hath appointed that we ſhould have this Word of Reconciliation to convey it unto you; What is this? to wit, That God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their ſins; ſo then <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin is the end of this Doctrine of Reconciliation,</hi> that there ſhould be forgiveneſs and pardon of ſin to poor ſouls in and through Chriſt Jeſus; ſo that this ſhews the great ſcope of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the end of it, to wit, forgiveneſs of ſin: therefore no wonder we ſtick in this Point, becauſe the great buſineſs we have to do, is to declare the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, when a Miniſter is about that, he is about the work that God hath appointed him to do; all other Doctrines are but to make way for this, and to teach people how to walk worthy of it; and this is the only taking Doctrine to all thoſe that God hath appointed this mercy too, though we as Miniſters of Chriſt preach againſt the vanities and profits of this world; but this is not the main thing, not the right method of Preaching to work upon the hearts of People, nor the great end of Chriſts Aſcention, he did not give gifts principally for theſe things, but that men ſhould be able to reveal the great Doctrine of Pardon of ſin: Miniſters need not keep a ſtir to get eſteem and love, and to make themſelves honourable among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; if they did but apply themſelves to Preach this great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine God hath ſet them about, That God was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world unto himſelf not imputing their ſins, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but gain honour in the hearts of thoſe that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this mercy too; (Many complain they want reſpect and honour, let them take pains in this Doctrine, and they cannot chooſe but they muſt get honour, if once this Word of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation take hold on any mans heart by Faith and Repentance; let men ſpeak againſt ſuch a Miniſter never ſo much, ſay what they will of him,) his heart will not be taken off from him, but will be ready to anſwer as the poor blind man did the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101278:43"/>
Scribes and Phariſees who raiſed on Chriſt, Joh. 9.24. <hi>Saying, give glory to God; but we know this man is a ſinner: He anſwered whether he be a ſinner or no, I know not; One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I ſee, be it was that opened my eyes</hi>; thus he anſwered their ſlander: and ſo when others clamour againſt a Miniſter, and ſpeak evil of them, that ſoul that hath his eyes opened, he will ſay, I am ſure God hath done great things for me by him: he hath ſhew'd me the evil of ſin, and the ſad condition I was in by nature, and he hath revealed to me the exceeding riches of the mercy and grace of God, and my ſoul hath ſound it ſo, God hath come to my ſoul in his Preaching: Now ſuch a Miniſtry as this will certainly ingage the hearts of people to them; 'tis not the man ſo much as Chriſt in the man, and this is the end of our Miniſtry, not to tell this or that conceit or ſtory, but to ſhew you the riches of the grace of God in the pardon of ſin, and the Juſtification of your Souls through Chriſt Jeſus, your Acceptation and Reconciliation through him, this is the firſt Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Sacraments,</hi> for what purpoſe hath Chriſt ordained them? the main end for which they were ordained is for Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the Supper is ſealed up Gods mercy in the pardon of ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 28. Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>The Cup is the blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of Sin</hi>; as if Chriſt had ſaid, this is the great Ordinance to ſeal unto People the pardon of their ſins: Brethren, the King does not uſe to ſet his Broad Seal to trifles and toys, and fancies, but unto things of great concernment and conſequence, they muſt be ſuch that ſhall have the Broad Seal: ſo here, becauſe pardon of ſin is ſuch a bleſſed thing, the Broad Seal of Heaven is ordained to ſeal it; and when the Sacrament is adminiſtred rightly, it is no other but the <hi>Broad Seal of Heaven to Seal up the pardon of thy ſin</hi>; and ſo ſhould men and women come to receive the Sacrament, they ſhould think this day is a ſealing-day; as in Courts of Juſtice they have their Sealing-days, and 'tis uſually ſaid, ſuch a day is a Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-day, ſo a Sacrament day is a ſealing-day, ſealing up to you the the great bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs of ſin; a Soul thinks thus, <hi>I am a poor wretched vile ſinner before the Lord, woe unto me; thus and thus have I done, woe is me. But I have heard of the riches of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101278:43"/>
Gods grace in pardoning my ſin; and this day God calls me to come in, and have the pardon of my ſin ſealed with the Broad Seal of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that my ſoul may be aſſured, and I may go away in peace, and be comforted and quieted in the great buſineſs that lies upon me, thoſe ſins of mine that have ſo grated on my Conſcience, and for which I have had dreadful apprehenſions of the Clouds of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure hanging over my head; this day I am to go to have the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a pardon of them all:</hi> Thus ſhould men and women come to the Sacrament with ſuch thoughts upon their hearts, as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance appointed and ordained by Chriſt for the ſealing up the pardon of their ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The third Ordinance is the Ordinance of Diſcipline, whoſe ſins ſoever you remit they are remitted,</hi> Joh. 20.22. and thoſe who are caſt out of the Church, and then received in again, find it to be an Ordinance of Chriſt, to aſſure them of remiſſion of their ſins. It caſts out thoſe that are ſcandalous, and when they repent it receives them in again, and thereby aſſures them of the pardon of their ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Tranſition to the Application.</hi> Having done with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, if you would run over and make ſome recollection of what has bin delivered of the glorious bleſſedneſs of this mercy of forgiveneſs of ſins, you might ſee the effects following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. I have ſhew'd you the <hi>abundant grace</hi> of God that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the forgiveneſs of ſin. I have ſhew'd you the many <hi>myſteries</hi> that there are in it, and that it is an <hi>inlet</hi> to many other mercies; I have ſhewed you the great <hi>difficulties</hi> it paſſes through, and how much the <hi>heart</hi> of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, was in this mercy; I ſhewed you, it was <hi>a perfect and an irrevocable mercy,</hi> a mercy denyed to Angels, and ſhewed but to a few of mankind, compared to thoſe that are paſt by; I have ſhewed, it is a mercy, the very <hi>poſſibility</hi> of it would make the damned to rejoyce, and it is a mercy, that is the end of all <hi>Ordinances:</hi> And now having come to ſome period of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, methinks that Scripture comes preſently into my mind, that notable place in Rom. 8.31. <hi>If theſe things be ſo,</hi> if God thus gloriouſly appear, in the riches of his grace for the pardon of ſin; <hi>What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things?</hi> the Apoſtle after he had ſpent ſome time in opening the Doctrine of free
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101278:44"/>
Juſtification, for the working it upon the heart of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and his own heart too, ſays, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things?</hi> the holy Apoſtle ſtood as a man amazed at the wonderful rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the grace of God in pardoning of ſin; in the verſe before, having ſaid, <hi>Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate them he called, and whom he called, them he justified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified:</hi> And having ſpoken much to the point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in this Chapter, he concludes at verſ. 31. <hi>Now what ſhall we ſay to thoſe things?</hi> as if he had ſaid, Lord, how does thy glory appear in the Juſtification of a ſinner, and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſin through Jeſus Chriſt? that we cannot but ſtand amazed at the greatneſs of thy glory appearing herein! that we know not what to ſay, there is ſo much of thy glorious grace appears, that our mouths are ſtopped; What ſhall we ſay to theſe things? So now, after we have heard of theſe glorious things, of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Revelation of the grace of God in and through his Son, working in ſuch a glorious and myſterious way of godlineſs for the juſtifying of a ſinner, and pardoning of his ſin; if we could now ſit down as men and women amazed and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as having our hearts ſo fill'd with the glory of theſe things, as being not able to expreſs our ſelves, but even ſit down ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the brightneſs of the glory of them; it would be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fruit of our attendance in hearing thoſe things, we ſhould ſanctifie the Name of God in it; and t'would be very happy for us; but if not while we are here together, yet, get into your Cloſets, and look into this myſtery of godlineſs, and recollect what you can of that which you have heard; and let this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration lie warm upon your hearts and thoughts: O Lord! what ſhall we ſay to theſe things? that God ſhould have ſuch thoughts of ſuch mercy and grace in the pardon of ſin, as we have heard; What ſhall we ſay to it? and though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your hearts be not able to expreſs more, yet by meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſure the fire will kindle, and bring forth ſome admirable expreſſions in glorifying the Name of God, or in ſinging ſome Pſalm to his praiſe, or in doubbling and trebbling that bleſſed acclamation with the heavenly Hoſt, Luk. 2.14. <hi>Glory to God in the Higheſt, on Earth peace, good will towards men</hi>; O here is the good will of God towards poor wretched vile men; <hi>Glory be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101278:44"/>
to God in the Higheſt; Lord, What is man that thou ſhould'ſt be ſo mindful of him? thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels</hi>; nay, as you have heard this day, God has ſet him above thoſe Angels that ſinned againſt him; Chriſt would not ſhew mercy to them, they could not be pardoned; this is for poor ſinners in the world, a generation of thoſe that ſeek him, that have this great mercy of pardon and forgiveneſs of ſin revealed to them; What ſhall we ſay to theſe things? the Apoſtles expreſſion may help us to make way to the Application, and as I have told you we ſhould ſanctifie the Name of God, in ſtanding amazed at the wonderful grace of God that gloriouſly appears in the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſinner, as we have opened in many Particulars. And now we have many things to ſay in the Application of theſe things, for the anſwer to that queſtion, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things?</hi> attend in the fear of God, and you ſhall hear in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication what ſhall be ſaid to thoſe things, you have heard in the former Doctrine.</p>

                  <hi>FIrſt, this we have to ſay to thoſe things, Surely if the Pardon of Sin be ſo great a mercy as you have heard, and that there is ſuch a wonderful work of God in it; then it muſt needs be a horrible and vile thing to ſin againſt this grace that the heart of God is ſo much in</hi>; to diſhonour this great work of God muſt needs be a very vile and horrible thing: And this hath been my intention, my very plot, as to ſet forth the greatneſs of the grace of God in the mercy of forgiveneſs; ſo alſo to keep you from ſinning againſt this grace. If he be bleſſed upon whom ſuch a great and glorious work of God is wrought in forgiveneſs of ſin; then it muſt needs be a moſt horrible and dreadful thing for any man or woman to ſin againſt this grace of God; and horrible to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour ſuch a great work of God as this is.</p>

How few of you now this morning that are come into the preſence of God, have had your thoughts working thus? <hi>O my ſoul how is it with thee? How does matters ſtand betwixt God and thee? What guilt is it thou haſt upon thy Spirit? What hath Divine Juſtice to charge thee withal? Conſcience ſpeak freely and fully: What is there in Heaven againſt me? Is there any thing upon Record that I am charg'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al? How is it between God and me?</hi> O what ſtrangers are moſt men unto ſuch thoughts as theſe! but go on in a ſleepy, ſecure, and dead hearted way, either they believe there is no guilt at all upon their ſpirits, or no great evil in that guilt, or elſe think 'tis no great matter for God to pardon; you are very ſolicitous for the fleſh, <hi>what you ſhall eat and drink, and what you ſhall put on</hi>; and for your Eſtates, how to get and increaſe in the world: But to make up the Records between God and your Souls, to get them diſcharg'd, and the Records of Heaven cancell'd that are againſt you: O how ſeldom do theſe things take up your thoughts? know you that are of ſuch careleſs ſpirits about this great matter of pardon of ſin, that it is a great aggravation of your ſin, that you are ſo careleſs about that great work of God in pardoning ſin, you are careleſs and ſpend but a few thoughts about that; that hath (as I may ſo ſpeak with holy reverence) taken up the heart of the infinite God from all eternity: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, there is not any in the world, not any of the works of God towards his creatures hath taken up the thoughts and heart
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101278:45"/>
of God ſo much as this one work of the pardon of ſin, &amp; yet your thoughts are not taken up with it, you little mind it: certainly there is a great diſproportion between your thoughts and Gods; whereas thoſe that are godly, ſhould labour to work as God works; and thoſe things that hath taken up the heart of God, ſhould take up their hearts; whereas thoſe things that are even unworthy of an immortal Soul take up your thoughts, and thoſe objects that take up the thoughts &amp; heart of God about pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin, your own Conſciences can tell you is very little in your thoughts and hearts: Certainly my Brethren, were the thoughts of men and women taken up about this ſerious and great buſineſs of getting pardon of their ſin, it would prevent and cure them of thouſands of other vain, ſlight, fooliſh and wicked thoughts; there are, I ſuppoſe, many of you begin to be ſenſible of ſin, and of the baſe wandring, filthy, unclean, and wicked thoughts of your hearts; and you ſay, O that we could but help our ſelves againſt theſe wandring, vile and wicked thoughts; ſurely this would be a great help, if you would get your thoughts poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with ſerious ſubjects, it would have a great deal of waight in it, to help you againſt thoſe light and vain things your thoughts work about. Now of all ſubjects in the world, this is the moſt ſerious <hi>about the grace of God; How his infinite wiſdom hath wrought to reconcile himſelf to your ſouls, in the bringing about the pardon of ſin, and making peace between himſelf and the Children of men.</hi> Now if you would take up your thoughts about the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of getting pardon of your ſins, it would take off your thoughts from other things: Suppoſe a man have a vain, ſlight, wandering, fooliſh heart; yet if he were condemned to die ſome dreadful tormenting death, his thoughts would quickly be taken off from other things, and taken up about uſing means; if there were any poſſibility to deliver himſelf from death; <hi>Jerom</hi> in one of his Epiſtles hath this Relation of one that was troubled with vile thoughts, and he, that he complained unto had this device, I name it not to approve it, but he had this device, he brought the man to have a charge of a crime laid againſt him, and cauſed him to be brought before a Judge, and put into Priſon, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he came to him, and askt him, How is it now with you? Does your vain thoughts ſtill abide with you as they were
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101278:46"/>
wont to do? he gave him this anſwer, ſays he, <hi>I cannot live, and what ſhall I now think of Uncleanneſs and Fornication? I am in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of my life, and I have now no time to think of ſuch things</hi>; and that help't and cured his thoughts: from this we may ſee, that if a ſoul was poſſeſt of the evil of ſin, and the danger of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the neceſſity and great conſequence of a pardon; what a mighty means would it be to take off your thoughts from other things, and turn them upon this; and certainly, who ever you are, whoſe thoughts are not mightily taken up about this great ſubject of the pardon of your ſins, you <hi>take the name of God in vain,</hi> and do not <hi>ſanctifie him in this great work of his</hi>; and know this, you that ſpend your days ſleeping in ſecurity, your damnation ſleeps and ſlumbers not; and until your ſin be pardoned, the infinite ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God is working your doom, for the full ſatisfaction of it, that is the firſt thing they diſhonour God that go on in ſecure courſes without minding ſuch a great thing as the pardon of ſin is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Others diſhonour God, who in ſtead of making it their great buſineſs in this world to get their ſin pardoned, they make it their great work to increaſe the guilt of ſin,</hi> by heaping up more and more guilt and ſo make the flame greater, and add to it continually; you would think it a very unreaſonable and deſperate thing in a man, that being condemn'd to ſome grievous and dreadful death, yet there being a pardon propounded, and ſome poſſibility of it, and a friend for this very end get a Reprieval of the King for two or three days, that he might have time to ſue out his Pardon; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a thing: Now then, if this man in this time of Reprieval that is given for this very end, to ſeek a Pardon, ſhould call for good cheer and muſick, merriment and ſporting, and not only ſo, but fall into railing againſt the Prince, increaſe his guilt, and provoke the Prince more and more againſt him; Would not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſay, this man is worthy of the greateſt extream tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentingeſt death that could be deviſed? Nay, I ſuppoſe, ſhould you hear of ſuch an one condemn'd to die, and had his life given him for this very end, you would think, ſurely this man will ſpend theſe days in another manner than ever he ſpent his time before: you that would think ſo of ſuch a man, it may be ſome of you, before the Lord this day, are guilty of the ſame evil, for this is a certain truth, that all the men in the world have been

condemn'd to eternal death, and all the time of your life is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you for this very end, a few days that God gives you for this very purpoſe, meerly that you might have a little liberty to ſue out your pardon, and make up your peace with God: O that men and women would but underſtand this, what they live for, that all the time of their lives is given them to make up their peace with God; you are to know it is given for this end, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Malefactor hath a Reprieve to get his Pardon; this is your very condition, you ſtand before the Lord guilty of eternal death, but God in his patience and long-ſufferance gives you a few days to live to ſue out your Pardon, and if you let this time ſlip, and theſe days be gone, I profeſs to you this day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that mercy it ſelf ſhall never ſave you; I would but know of many of you, how you ſpend theſe days? you are not certain of one day, it may be not an hour; Do you ſpend theſe days in making it the great buſineſs and work of your Souls to ſue out a Pardon? Let me ſpeak to you, and O that you would ſpeak it in ſecret between God and your own Souls, and that you would anſwer in the Name of God every ſoul preſent, to this Queſtion, <hi>Soul haſt thou made it the great work and buſineſs of thy life, above all things in the world, to ſue out thy Pardon, and ſeek for Reconciliation with thy God, and a diſcharge of thy ſins?</hi> I verily fear that many of you that hear me this day, if we could but hear Conſcience ſpeak, would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, What? I make it the great work and buſineſs of my life to ſue out a Pardon, God knows it hath been the great work and buſineſs of my life to increaſe my guilt; there is not a day goes over my head, but I have brought more guilt upon my ſelf by wicked Oaths, taking Gods Name in vain, neglecting his Worſhip, abuſing of his creatures, perhaps by drunkenneſs or uncleanneſs; methinks your Conſciences might miſgive you, when you are ſo far from making it the great buſineſs of your lives to ſue for pardon, that you make it your great work to encreaſe your guilt; Doſt thou think ever to get pardon of thy ſin, ſo long as thou goeſt on to encreaſe thy guilt, and make thy ſelf more vile? the lives of many people are ſuch in a courſe of wickedneſs, that it beſpeaks them that either they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to periſh eternally in their ſin, or elſe to make it to be as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101278:47"/>
great a burden to the mercy of God as can be in the pardoning of their ſin; if it be ſo mighty a work of God to pardon ſin, obſerve what I ſay; it follows from the point wherein I opened the wonderful work of God in pardoning any one ſin; think thus, Is it ſo great a work of God to pardon one ſin? Shall I go on then to add ſin unto ſin to make the work greater? Friend, if God pardon but one ſin in thought that thou haſt been guilty of in all thy life, it would be a work that would yield thee matter of praiſe to all eternity; and wilt thou be ſo deſperate then as to add ſin unto ſin? As ſuppoſe a man had ſome grievous diſeaſe, and it would be the ſtrangeſt work to cure him that ever was wrought ſince the Earth and Heavens were made, if this man ſhould go on by intemperate courſes, to increaſe the malignity and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om of it day by day more and more; what a deſperate thing would this be eſteemed in him, eſpecially if he were in a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of cure; yea, and perhaps he could tell others, that there is ſome poſſibility, and yet he goes on to encreaſe the malignity more and more; how would every one think this mans courſes unreaſonable? O that we would conſider of the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the dealings of men with God; men are aſhamed to be unreaſonable in their dealings with men, but in their dealings with God, they are as unreaſonable as can be imagined; you are guilty of many ſins, have you hope to be forgiven, yes, you will ſay, you have hope; have you hope? if God deliver you from any of your ſins, he muſt do ſuch a work as is greater than the making of Heaven and Earth; what do you then to encreaſe your ſin, when it is ſo great a work to pardon your ſin: O! the horrible wickedneſs of men and women to increaſe their ſin, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.17. I may allude unto it, and it is an argument of great force, <hi>Is the iniquity of Peor too little, from which we are not cleanſed to this day?</hi> ſo I may ſay to ſinners going on in their ſins; <hi>Is the iniquity of Peor too little, from which you are not cleanſed to this day?</hi> What, is the iniquity of your youth too little that you committed, and miſpent your time when you were Prentice, or lived in ſuch and ſuch a family? Is that ſin too little to magnifie the grace of God in pardoning of it, but that you muſt add more and more unto it, as if you would tempt God to try and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God would extend his mercy further and further? we tell
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101278:47"/>
you in the Name of God, and ſay to you, the ſins you have committed already are ſo grievous, that it muſt needs be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful work of God to forgive them; and what, muſt you needs add more and more, and tempt God to extend his mercy fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Take heed of tempting God to extend his mercy further, for though God may be pleaſed to extend his mercy thus far; Who ſhall preſcribe God how far he ſhall go? Who can tell but that the thoughts of God towards thee are thus, that he will go thus far to pardon thee, but if thou go on in ſin, who can tell whether he will go on to pardon further? 'Tis true, when God comes to pardon, he will do them all away; but know thou that goeſt on to increaſe the guilt of thy ſin, thou may'ſt find it, as many thouſands have found it a mighty hard thing, which hath coſt them much anguiſh and diſtreſs of ſpirit, to get the pardon of their ſin ſealed in the Court of Conſcience, though it was ſealed before in Heaven; O the anguiſh of ſpirit it hath coſt them! and doſt thou ſtill go on to heap up more and more ſin, as if the pardon of thy ſin was nothing? there is a great deal of reaſon in this, to cry to ſinners to ſtop in the courſe of ſin; for thou haſt gone on enough already, go no further, that's a ſecond abuſe of the mercy of God in pardoning ſin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>They abuſe the mercy of God that have extream ſlight thoughts of pardon of ſin,</hi> that think to have it at any time, when they will, 'tis but <hi>repenting</hi>; as it was ſaid of <hi>Lewis</hi> the xi<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, King of <hi>France, That he wore a Cruſifix in his Hat, and when he had committed a ſin, it was but taking it down and kiſſing of it, and all was well again,</hi> ſo many Idolatrous Papiſts, they have as ſlight thoughts of pardon of ſin as can be, if they commit a ſin, they make no more of it, but go to a Prieſt to ſhrieve them, or kneel before a Crucifix and knock their breaſt, which is a thing ſoon done, and all's well again; certainly 'tis a great diſhonour to God, for any man to have ſlight thoughts of the pardon of ſin: It is ſuch a work as if ever any thing put God to it (as I may ſay) to pardon ſin, and yet to ſalve his Juſtice, it was this work; and certainly, if ever God have love to thee, thou wilt change thy thoughts about this; and certainly, the ſlight thoughts men have about this, is the cauſe many times why they are held ſo long under the ſpirit of bondage; when God begins to work
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101278:48"/>
upon them, and ſtirs the Conſcience, and lays the guilt of ſin home upon it: how long are they before they can have any aſſurance of pardon? and in juſt judgment it is ſo, becauſe they had ſlight thoughts before of the pardon of ſin. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is ſtoried of <hi>Pompey, when one of his Captains came to him, and told him he wanted men</hi>; ſays he, <hi>I can but ſtamp my foot upon the ground and bring forth ſo many men preſently</hi>; but when the Enemy came, this Captain came to him again, and ſaid, where's your men now; but then he could not get them when he was in diſtreſs and had great need of them; as many think they can do great things with a word ſpeaking, as if all muſt be at their beck preſently, but when they come to it, they fail and find it otherwiſe; ſo many make it a ſmall matter to get pardon of ſin, they think to do it with a <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> at their death-bed, or the like; but when they come to it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, God makes them to know, <hi>It is the greateſt buſineſs that ever they had to do in, in all their lives</hi>; there is nothing that God is ſo jealous of as his honour, and ſpecially about this great work, and certainly, were it not that God is very jealous of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and would cure the ſlight thoughts that men have of this great work; there needs never be ſo much humiliation and workings of the ſpirit of bondage; and certainly, did we but know the greatneſs of this work, how would ſinners ſnatch at any opportunity or hint of Gods favour appearing to them? they would do as the ſervants of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> 1 King. 20.33. <hi>diligently obſerve if any thing would come from him, and haſtily catch at it,</hi> they watched that if any thing did come from him, that did make any way to that which they ſought after, and did haſtily catch at it; ſo, did a ſoul underſtand the pardon of ſin, what a great work it is, he would be ſo far from having ſlight thoughts of it, that he would come cloath'd in Sackcloath, and every Sermon would be watching and enquiring, what hath God ſpoke any word to my ſoul or no? And if any word fall from a Miniſter concerning this great buſineſs, ſuch a ſoul would catch greedily at it, and loſe no opportunity to imbrace it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. is very remarkable to this purpoſe, <hi>David</hi> found it a very hard thing to get pardon of his own ſin, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it, and God forgave him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. what follows?
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101278:48"/>
verſ. 6. <hi>For this ſhall every man that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou may'st be found</hi>; as if <hi>David</hi> in this language ſpake thus, O all you poor ſinners, that ſin againſt God, think it an eaſie matter to get pardon of ſin; know, I have found it otherwiſe, it coſt me dear before I could get aſſurance of pardon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this cauſe let every one that is acquainted with the ways of God, ſeek to God in due time, and not put it off from time to time, for the buſineſs is not ſo ſlight to put it off: many abuſe the example of <hi>David,</hi> and think becauſe he ſinned, they may take liberty to ſin, but they conſider not what abundance of ſorrow it coſt him to get his pardon; it coſt him ſo much as that he tells them, <hi>for this cauſe every one ſhall ſeek God in due time:</hi> many think they may put it off till any time; but mark what <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>For this cauſe every man that is godly ſhall ſeek thee in a time when thou may'st be found</hi>; he does not ſay, I have found mercy in the pardoning of my great ſins, and for this cauſe men ſhall be bold to put it off to any time; no, but for this cauſe thoſe that are godly, and have any acquaintance in the wayes of God, will ſeek God in a time that he may be found; and if thoſe that are godly, that have ſin pardoned in the Court of heaven, find ſo hard a matter of it to get it pardoned in their own Conſciences; how does it concern thee that perhaps haſt thy ſin neither pardoned in the Court of Heaven, nor in thy own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>But art in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity,</hi> how concerns it thee to look to it? that is a third ſort that abuſe the mercy of God <hi>in having ſlight thoughts of the pardon of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thoſe that ſeek for pardon but are unſenſible of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the work of God in pardoning,</hi> they do not put it off, but ſeek it for the preſent, but how? with extream unſenſibleneſs; they do not come before God with brokenneſs, trouble and contrition of ſpirit in ſeeking after pardon of ſin; many they repeat of their ſins before God, and have a gift of Prayer; it is that which would make a mans heart to tremble, to conſider how many have a great gift in Prayer, and will be praying half an hour, and will repeat abundance of their ſins, make Catalogues, and tell large ſtories of their ſins, bring in all the aggravations againſt them for their ſins; judge themſelves, and ſpeak mighty words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101278:49"/>
themſelves for their ſins, and yet all this while, God knows with a deſperate, dull, dead and ſenſleſs heart for their ſins; it may be others that joyn with them, their hearts are broken with their expreſſions, and yet in the mean time thy Conſcience may tell thee, thy heart is deſperately hard before God, and not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at all of what thou ſpeakeſt; thou wer't putting up Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God, and yet with as dull and ſenſeleſs a ſpirit, as if thou wer't ſpeaking of a matter of no conſequence at all; this is a high degree of <hi>taking the bleſſed Name of God in vain</hi>; for we are to know, the Name of God in forgiveneſs of ſin is a moſt glorious Name, and we had need to take heed how we ſpeak to God in this buſineſs, that we take not his Name in vain, <hi>for he will not hold him guiltleſs that takes his Name in vain</hi>; we had need to look to the <hi>ſanctifying of Gods Name</hi> in this thing: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man will think it of himſelf, that to ſwear and blaſpheme is a taking of the Name of God in vain; and why is it ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſin againſt the 3d Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of thy God in vain, &amp;c.</hi> for my part I cannot but think that to make large Confeſſions of ſin, and yet with a ſenſleſs dead heart, is a high degree of taking the Name of God in vain; (mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me not, if thy heart be ſenſible of thy unſenſibleneſs, thou art not of thoſe that <hi>take the Name of God in vain</hi>; God accepts of this, it is the rational part of the ſoul that is taken with this, and this is pleaſing to him, though thou canſt not bring the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part of the ſoul up to this thing; but I ſpeak it of thoſe that have got a formality in crying and confeſſing of their ſins, and yet are unſenſible of them; yea, it may be, glory in this, that they can in the Church thus ſpeak of their ſins, and have ſuch expreſſions before the Lord; take heed of this, if you would ſhew your parts and abilities, let it be in ſomething elſe, and not to come before the holy God; and before others in a holy duty to vent your parts and abilities there: it is a dangerous thing for any to meddle ſo in this kind, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. as he ſays there, <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion</hi>; ſo I may ſay without the blood of thy heart, without the bleeding of thy heart there is no remiſſion, or at leaſt a being ſenſible of thy unſenſibleneſs; if thou can'ſt not <hi>mourn</hi> then <hi>mourn</hi> that thou can'ſt not <hi>mourn,</hi> be ſenſible of thy unſenſibleneſs, and then
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101278:49"/>
God may accept of thee; but otherwiſe without this kind <hi>of blood there is no remiſſion</hi>; that is to ſanctifie the Name of God, conſider this note, it may be of uſe many ways, that is, to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Name of God, when there comes to be in my heart a diſpoſition ſutable to the work of God I have to deal withal; ſutable to the manifeſtation of God in that thing I have to deal with God in: if any ask, <hi>What is it to ſanctifie Gods Name,</hi> I would anſwer thus; <hi>To ſanctifie Gods Name in any thing, it is to labour to get an anſwerable diſpoſition to that thing that I have to deal with God in</hi>; when I am to deal with God in any work, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that work I muſt have a diſpoſition in my heart ſutable to it; as to inſtance, I ſanctifie Gods Name in Prayer, when I ſpeak of Gods glorious Attributes and Titles then, when there is an anſwerable diſpoſition in my heart to thoſe glorious Titles that I ſpeak of; ſo I ſanctifie Gods Name when I confeſs my ſin before God the Judge of all the World, in having an anſwerable diſpoſition in my heart ſutable to this Judge; and then I ſanctifie Gods Name in ſeeking pardon of ſin, when I have an anſwerable diſpoſition in my heart to the greatneſs of the work of God in pardoning ſin; therefore all of you muſt be careful, when you intreat God to pardon ſin, to intreat him alſo to ſanctifie his Name; How is that? intreat God to manifeſt that glorious work to your ſouls, and then labour to get your hearts into an anſwerable diſpoſition ſutable to that great work; you that go to God every day in ſeeking pardon of ſin; have you been apprehenſive of the greatneſs of it; Hath God ſhewed you the greatneſs of his work in it? or further, ſince the time that you have heard of the greatneſs of the work; have you been caſting in your ſouls how to get an anſwerable diſpoſition ſutable to theſe Divine Truths? Certainly, ſo far as you are wanting in that, ſo far you art ſhort of ſanctifying Gods Name; and for time to come, this muſt be the great work of your ſouls, to get anſwerable diſpoſitions in ſeeking pardon of ſin, that may be ſutable to the great work of God in it; if one that comes to ſeek to you, to Petition you to remove ſome evil one that hath offended you, if he come ſlightly, you will ſay, you muſt come after another manner; Shall a poor man or woman expect ſuch a kind of coming from a Child, Servant, or Inferiour; and yet

about the pardon of their ſins, becauſe they content themſelves with ſuch poor mean Evidences; for had they a high eſteem of it, they would labour to make pardon of ſin ſurer than any thing in the world. To wind up all, thoſe that know what pardon of ſin is; how do they ſpend their time, and lay out themſelves to get aſſurance? Take this one note, <hi>Becauſe God ſees thoſe that are his own people underſtand what forgiveneſs is, have a high eſteem of it, and are very ſolicitous about it, he condiſcends in his kindneſs to aſſure them by all ſorts of ways and means</hi>; methinks God deals with them in this manner, the poor ſoul ſtands ſhaking and trembling, crying our, Oh! that I might have my ſins forgiven, and have aſſurance of it; Why, ſays God, what way do you take to make things ſure from one to another? ſays you, firſt we give our word one to another,<note place="margin">1.

follows him; Well, ſays God, this poor ſoul notwithſtanding will have doubts of my grace; now that it might have ſtrong conſolation, I have ſwore that I might make my mercy ſure to ſuch a ſoul, that's a fourth way: but is there any thing elſe you uſe to make things ſure between one another? Yea Lord, Fourthly, we put our Seals to it, an Oath taken may ſoon paſs over,<note place="margin">5. Seal.</note> but a Seal that abides: ſays God, I will do that too, I will give you Seals, and there are divers ſorts of Seals; there's firſt the Broad Seal of Heaven: What is that? that is nothing elſe, but the very Printing of the Image of God on the Soul, that is the Broad Seal of Heaven. And as the Broad Seal of <hi>England,</hi> hath the Picture or Image of the King ſtampt upon it, ſo the Broad Seal of Heaven is nothing elſe but the Image of God ſtamp't or imprinted on the Soul. 2. <hi>There is the Privy Seal of the Holy Spirit of God,</hi> which is the perſwading and aſſuring of the ſoul of its intereſt it hath in Chriſt and God the Father. In 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. you have Gods Privy Seal, <hi>The Lord knows them that are his,</hi> and they having his Privy Seal know themſelves to be the Lords, Cant. 6.2. <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine</hi>; ſo <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2.20. being ſealed with this Seal, ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf for me</hi>; he was perſwaded and aſſured of ſalvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. This Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Sealing is like the <hi>New Name,</hi> Revel. 2.17. <hi>Which no man knoweth ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi> And to this you ſhall have a <hi>third Seal Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord,</hi> that is, to aſſure you, that the end of the Sacrament is to Seal up Pardon of ſin; God ſaw that his People would be very ſolicitous, and therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all theſe wayes of aſſurance to them; when you therefore come to the Sacrament, you ſhould come with a ſenſe upon your ſouls of the great need you have of the grace of God in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin, and come to it as to a Sealing-day; you have many fears and doubts; come ſo as that you may have the grace of pardon ſeal'd to your ſouls; take heed of coming ſo as to have your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demation ſealed: for certainly, all Ordinances if they work not for that end that they are appointed, they turn to another and quite contrary; as the Word, if it be not the ſavour of life, it is the ſavour of death; and ſo the Sacraments, if they ſeal not the pardon of thy ſins up unto thee, they ſeal up the ſentence
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101278:53"/>
of death and condemnation; therefore look to it, as oft as you come unworthily to the Sacrament, you have ſo many Seals of death and condemnation ſet upon your ſouls: Take heed you do not come to take another Seal of death; 'tis much to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many in this place come to take the ſeal of eternal death upon their ſouls: but thoſe that come worthily, though admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations be not in that due order as they ſhould, yet God may be preſent with his own Ordinance to give them comfort from it, and help their Evidences by it; I muſt conclude this, thoſe that content themſelves with ſlight Evidences about this great work, diſhonour the grace of God: you would have us preach of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and indeed it is a bleſſed Argument which our ſouls delight much to be preaching of, becauſe we find ſo much ſweetneſs in it, and for which our ſouls ſhall expatiate themſelves in glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to all eternity; but we are withal jealous of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring of God in this mercy, and therefore it is that we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſo with you, after the laying open of this mercy, that you may not abuſe it: for certainly my Brethren, there is nothing in the world God takes to heart more, than the <hi>diſhonour that is done to his pardoning mercy</hi>; and nothing more aggravates the ſin of People than to have ſlight thoughts of this great work.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>This is a great diſhonour to Gods pardoning mercy, for men to put off the ſeeking of it to the worſt times that poſſible can be</hi>; Is it not the ordinary way of moſt people, to put of the ſeeking of the grace and favour of God, Pardon of ſin, and Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, till the time of ſickneſs, and the time of death? they go on all their life time in ſinning againſt God; but when they are lying upon their ſick-beds and death-beds, Lord have mercy upon me, pardon me, forgive me, a wicked wretch that I have been; theſe kind of words we hear from men at that time: O that God would forgive and pardon ſuch and ſuch ſins, and then perhaps they will tell ſome particular ſins if they think they ſhall die, they will open themſelves to the Miniſter, or to ſome faithful Neighbour in the diſcloſing of their particular ſins, and beſeech them to pray to God for mercy; but if they have any hopes to eſcape, they will keep them in, and be loath to rip open the ſins of their lives: This I ſay, for any to put off
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101278:54"/>
the ſeeking unto God for his pardoning grace till that time, it is to put a great diſhonour upon God, for it is a putting of it off to the worſt time that poſſible can be. And that makes much to the diſhonour of God: For</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Thoſe men ſeek pardon of ſin, when ſin is leaving them, or they muſt leave ſin whether they will or no</hi>; when you have ſerved your own turn of ſin, after you have had as much ſuppoſed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as you can, then you think to be delivered from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin; what is there but a meer ſelfiſh ſpirit in ſeeking God now, and God ſees it ſo; it is not ſeeking after pardon of ſin that you may honour God in his infinite grace, for then you would ſeek after it now, and the honour of God would be dear to you now; but you ſeek it at ſuch a time meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of reſpect to your ſelves, this is a great diſhonour to God, <hi>It is the firſt born of Gods glory to pardon ſin</hi>; and for God to ſee men and women have no higher ends in ſeeking pardoning grace, but meerly to ſave their own skins; How may God look upon them with diſdain? What ſhall I magnifie the riches of my grace ſo wonderfully in this work of my pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy? And ſhall my creatures ſeek after it for no other end, nor higher aims, but meerly to ſave their own skins? you bring down the grace of God, that that is the top of his infinite Majeſty and Glory you put to a low and baſe end; therefore put not off ſeeking it to the laſt, <hi>'tis a great diſhonour to his grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is the worſt time, becauſe you come to ſeek after pardoning grace when it is the time of Gods wrath,</hi> Prov. 11.4. the time of affliction, and trouble, ſickneſs, and death, is call'd <hi>the day of wrath</hi>; Riches avail not in the day <hi>of Gods wrath</hi>; Riches avail for comfort at preſent, but in the day of wrath they will not: God hath his day of affliction, and his day of wrath, he hath his time to come to viſit men for their ſins: Now then, for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to come to ſeek to have the pardon of their ſins when Gods time <hi>is to viſit for ſin,</hi> that muſt needs be the worſt time that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble can be, I reaſon thus, and conſider of it; if God does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his mercy in the day of mercy, is it likely, that he will grant mercy in the day of wrath? while you are alive, and have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, health and opportunity to come to hear the Doctrine of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101278:54"/>
the Juſtification of a ſinner, and forgiveneſs of ſin opened, you are to know it is the day of Gods grace; <hi>Now is the acceptable time, now is the day of Salvation and of grace</hi>; when God gives liberty and oppertunity, thus to have the myſteries of the Goſpel o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto you, this is the day of Gods grace: Now if God deny you grace in this day of mercy, that you are not ſo much as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, your ſouls melted and your hearts ſtirred; Do you think that now you are upon your ſick-beds or death-beds, which is a day of wrath unto you? for ſo it is to thoſe that have not their ſins pardoned before, it is a day of wrath, and Gods time of viſiting for ſin; Is it likely that God will now ſhew thee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? I beſeech you conſider, the uſual way of Gods working on men is according to his Ordinance: Now the ordinary way of Gods conveying grace is by the Miniſtry of the Word; Did God ever appoint any other way to convey Chriſt, and grace to thy Soul? give me a Text for it; Where do you find a Text in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of any other way as an Ordinance appointed by God, for the conveying of his pardoning grace in Chriſt to any Soul? No, it is in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and by faith, that lays hold of the pardoning grace of God, by coming to hear the Word preached; Now if God come not in that time to work upon thee, and to beſtow mercy in his own appointed way, it is not likely he will come any other way: I remember in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi>'s, he has this expreſſion, <hi>Let any one give me an example, that ever any one that lived under a powerful Miniſtry, and not ſavingly wrought upon that way, was ever wrought upon any other way</hi>; many he ſays may be ſtirred, but for his part he knew none that was ſo ſtirred by affliction to the converſion of their ſouls, if God had not before in the Ordinances of grace wrought upon them: then it muſt needs be the worſt time that can be to ſeek pardon of ſin in a day of trouble or affliction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is uſually a time of Gods wrath viſiting for ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The work of the Soul in ſeeking after Gods pardoning mercy, and applying of it to himſelf, as it is the excellenteſt work that ever a creature did perform, ſo it does require the moſt exquiſite work of the Spirit that ever was required,</hi> or that ever any creature was ſet about; it is the moſt intenſive work of the ſpirit of

man, the applying of the grace of God in Chriſt, and the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with it for Juſtification, it is the higheſt, moſt exquiſite, moſt glorious and moſt admirable work of the ſpirit of man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in the world, and it requires the greateſt intenſneſs and ſtrength of a mans ſpirit that ever any work did: Now then to put this off till ſuch a time as a mans ſtrength is gone, and he through diſeaſes unfit for any thing, and when as all the ſtrength he hath will be little enough to help him to bear his pain, this muſt needs be the worſt time; you are miſtaken if you think the applying of Gods mercy in Chriſt is but in ſaying <hi>Lord have mercy upon me</hi>; No, it is Gods putting the heart of man to do the moſt glorious work that hath the greateſt operation in it that ever he did. I remember it related of one that lived wickedly, and divers ſought to reclaim him, ſays he, come when I am upon my ſick bed, that is time enough; and afterwards he being ſick, was put in mind of it; you ſaid you would do it then: but then he ſwore a great Oath, ſaying, What is this a time to repent in? becauſe he then felt ſo much trouble and anguiſh that took up his thoughts, that he was ſtirr'd with indignation to be put upon repenting then, in a time when he felt ſo much do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſpirit by the pains that were upon him; Is this a time to repent in? if that be not, then do it betimes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is the worſt time, becauſe God ſhall loſe a great part of his end in pardoning ſin</hi>; for when God pardons ſin it is to this end, that his poor creatures might honour and worſhip him in <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

I know no ſuch Text of Scripture; it is true, there are Scriptures tending that way that do not limit the time; but no Scripture does expreſs it ſo: many people run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with that expreſſion, as if it were ſo; there is no Text of Scripture hath thoſe words; there is one Text of Scripture this is taken out of, but that is ſpoken to another end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had need to examine what is ſpoken, 'tis <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. this comes the neareſt to thoſe words, mark this Scripture, and ſee what you can have from thence to defer the ſeeking of Gods pardoning mercy and grace till ſickneſs and death; <hi>But if the wicked ſhall turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live, he ſhall not die</hi>; here this Scripture does not limit a time, though it ſays not, At what time ſoever; it ſays, if he <hi>turn from all his ſins, and keep all my Statutes, and do that that is lawful and right</hi>; ſo that this Scripture promiſes mercy to one that turns from all his ſins, and will keep all Gods Statutes, and ſo do all that is lawful and right: But now, if you put it off to the time of ſickneſs and death; How can you do all this? <hi>Turn from all ſin and keep all Gods Statutes then,</hi> or, How can you <hi>do that is lawful and right</hi> then? it muſt be then when you can keep all Gods Statutes, as well as turn from all your ſins; ſo that if you take all together, there is not ſo much incouragement to that which is ſo frequent in your mouths; <hi>At what time ſoever a ſinner repents,</hi> it muſt be at ſuch a time as that you muſt keep all Gods Statutes: but further, God ſpeaks here to the Jews ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition of the Covenant of works, becauſe they made account to be juſtified by the Law; ſays God you will put it off, and think at laſt to turn from your wicked wayes, and that I will have mercy on you; I but look to it, if you will repent, it muſt be ſuch a repentance as muſt be joyned, with a <hi>keeping all my Statutes</hi>; therefore thoſe that do not underſtand the way of the Goſpel, but depend upon a repentance on their

and that at ſuch a rate and infinite price as the death of my own Son? Shall his life and blood go to procure pardon (one drop of which is more worth than ten thouſand worlds) and when all this is done, ſhall my creature think to put me off by a poor work of their own prayers, tears, good meaning, or the like; or with the moſt glorious work that they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? for the greateſt and moſt glorious work that they can perform is not near worth ſo much as one drop of the blood of Chriſt. And if you have not ſuch high thoughts of Gods Pardoning Mercy, that it muſt be procured by that which hath more worth in it than all the Creation beſides, you do diſhonour it, by having ſuch low thoughts of it, when as you think to obtain it by any duty that you can do; you think God is a merciful God, and you hope upon your reforming and performing duties of Obedience, that God will be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified towards you for all that is amiſs: Certainly when you have theſe thoughts of Gods pardoning grace, you make it to be but as common and ordinary pity towards one in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but the grace of God is a higher thing than common pity and compaſſion, and it is a mighty diſhonour to God to have no higher thoughts of it, that you think of it but as of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pity and compaſſion that one creature hath unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or if you think it differs from that pity one creature hath to another, it is but a difference in degrees;; only you think it is a little higher in degree: but you muſt look upon it in another way, and as another kind of pity then one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bears to another; it is true, Gods pardoning his poor creatures is in pity and compaſſion, but it is through the death and ſatisfaction of his own Son; and if you think to procure it any other way than by the mediation of the Son of God, you look upon it but in a natural way, as nature will dictate unto you; for nature will dictate, that the beholding of one crying out in miſery will move pity and compaſſion, and you go no further: But you are to know, the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of God, is the moſt ſupernatural and myſteriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing in all the Book of God; therefore when God works in us, we muſt act faith upon it in a myſtical way, or act faith upon it as a great myſterie; and therefore you that

have been made ſenſible of ſin, it may be you have thought of Gods grace for the pardon and forgiveneſs of your ſins, and for to quiet the trouble of your ſpirits; Have you done that? there is I ſuppoſe many a poor ſoul may ſay, I have been often with God when no eye ſaw me, but only Gods, ſeeking the pardon of my ſin in trouble of ſpirit; you have done ſo: but has your eye at that time been faſtened on the Son of God, as the great Mediator between God and Man, to interceed to God the Father for the obtaining this mercy, by making ſatisfaction to infinite Juſtice: Together with your cries for pardon, have your eyes been upon the Son of God at the right hand of the Father, pleading for man? Have your hearts been taken with the great myſteries of godlineſs, and wrought upon by the infinite grace of God? Have you put forth a mighty power of the Spirit of Faith, to tender up to God the Father the Attonement that his Son has made by his blood and death for your ſins? Have you ſeen that the pardoning grace of God is ſo high, that it is impoſſible to be reach't unto by any thing you can do, but only by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Son of God? If it have been thus with your ſpirits? then you have ſomewhat of the ſenſe of the great work of God in this thing; but otherwiſe, though you have been never ſo much wrought on and have had floods of ſorrow, and have cryed never ſo earneſt for the pardon of your ſins, yet except you have had ſome ſuch kind of thoughts of Gods grace, as theſe are, upon your hearts, working af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God this way, you were never throughly acquainted with the way of Gods pardoning grace, and ſo you have diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him, by having too low thoughts of it, except your hearts have been raiſed to this height, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. in that time when <hi>David</hi> was on repenting, he called unto God to <hi>purge him with Hyſop; David</hi> deſired the renewing of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods mercy in Chriſt, in the pardoning of that horrible offence he had committed; and therefore prays that he may be purged with Hyſop: What is the meaning of that? there is a great myſtery in it; in the time of the Law when the blood was ſprinkled, it was done with a bunch of Hyſop; and it was a Type of the Blood of Chriſt that was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101278:57"/>
to make an Attonement, Levit. 14. <hi>They were to take a bunch of Hyſop to ſprinkle withal</hi>; Now ſays <hi>David, Purge me with Hyſop,</hi> that is, apply to me the blood of Chriſt, for I have need of freſh applications of the blood of Chriſt; I have ſinned againſt him, and have done what in me lay to bring my ſelf under Gods wrath, and have brought new guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſoul: Now for the aſſurance of thy love to me, let there be freſh applications of the blood of thy Son; let there be a new ſprinkling of the blood of thy Son upon me: I ſuppoſe many of you in reading this place, did not think of the meaning of the Spirit of God in it, that may be a great help unto you, when at any time you are ſeeking the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of your ſins, to cry to God to be purged with Hyſop; <hi>O Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſprinkle the blood of Chriſt afreſh upon me; for I know that all my Prayers and Tears, and all that I can do, cannot purge me from the guilt of that ſin I have committed againſt thee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou purge me with Hyſop; that is, by applying of the Blood of thy Son unto me:</hi> And this is the Eighth way of diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of God, <hi>in ſeeking for it any other way than through the blood of his Son</hi>; and remember when you are ſeeking it, that it may be the laſt time; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you look up to God for it in, by, and through the death of his Son; for otherwiſe, though you are never ſo earneſt in Prayer, you diſhonour this grace: It is an eaſie matter to convince men and women, that they are guilty of diſhonouring the grace of God, if they ſeek for pardon in a negligent and ſluggiſh way; but now, though you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſenſible, and put forth never ſo much ſtrength in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, yet you diſhonour God, except you look upon it as ſuch a high thing that can never be reacht unto, but through the mediation of the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>The ninth way of diſhonouring the grace of God is, for any one to venture on ſin, the rather becauſe they hope they ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,</hi> that dare to venture on ſin on that ground, hoping that God will at laſt pardon them, I ſpake before of thoſe that did nothing elſe but increaſe their ſins in ſtead of ſeeking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, and of the miſerable ſad condition of ſuch: But thoſe we now ſpeak of, are not ſuch as are come to this height

of ſinning, to do nothing elſe but increaſe their ſins; but ſuch men and women who being convinc't of ſin, and if they were perſwaded that God would never pardon that ſin, they would find knots enough to ſtop them from the commiſſion of it: but becauſe they have ſome hopes that God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, therfore on that very ground they venture on ſin; 'tis true, it is an offence, but God is a merciful God, he will forgive though it be an evil: there is more evil and miſcheif in this than thou can'ſt imagin; What, art thou convinc't of ſin, and wilt thou venture on ſin meerly on this ground, becauſe thou hopeſt that God will pardon thee? I may ſay unto thee as <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Act. 8.22. <hi>Pray O pray to God, that if it be poſſible, this thought of thy heart may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee</hi>; for this thought of thy heart hath ſo much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity in it, and is ſo great a provocation againſt God as poſſible can be imagined, (except the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,) for any man or women to venture on any ſin in hopes of pardon: ſome will ſay, What need we be ſo ſtrict, and trouble our ſelves ſo much? God is merciful, and therefore they think upon that ground; they need not be ſo ſtrict; this is a horrible degree of <hi>turning the grace of God into wantenneſs,</hi> Jude 4. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch there, that profeſt they did believe in Chriſt; mark what he ſays of them, <hi>There are certain men crept in unawares, — ungodly men turning the grace of God into laciviouſneſs, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; 'tis a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place, if there be any one in the Congregation that have ever had the glorious light of the Goſpel revealed to them, that can reaſon thus? I do ſuch and ſuch things, yet God is merciful; O that God would convince thee of this evil, give me leave to open it unto you, how men creep in; they were Chriſtians, and were come into the Church; but how? they crept in cunningly; the Saints of God were not aware of them, they crept in amongſt them; here by the way, we may take notice, that in a Church there ought to be none admitted Members, but ſuch as there may be ſome teſtimony of godlineſs in them; for if any be ungodly, they are ſuch as creep in unawares; the Church of God ſhould keep
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101278:58"/>
them out, ſuch as creep in unawares ſhould be kept out: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cry out, they will not have communion with any Church, becauſe there are ſome wicked men in it; and others ſay, while there is a Church on Earth, the tares will be among the corn, and chaff will be among the wheat: be not deceived, I know none in the world that does think there is any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſo pure, but that ſome ungodly one may creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: but conſider, to have ſome evil ones in the Church is one thing, and the Church to have power to caſt them out, that is another thing; 'tis true, they will creep into the Church, but when they are crept in, and appear to be ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones, we muſt do our duty; tell them of their faults, and if they will not hear us, we muſt tell it to the Church; and if the Church have power and will not deal with them, it need not at all hinder our communicating with them: but here lies the caſe, Whether we ſhould withdraw, becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ones are among them? or, Whether we can joyn with that Church wherein there is no power to keep them out, and after they are crept in to caſt them out? they will creep into the Church, they came in unawares; but the ſtate of the Church ſhould be ſuch, that they ſhould ſuffer no evil men to come in, and if they do come in, it is unawares to the Church, by making a Profeſſion of Religion; for the Church can go no further then what does outwardly appear unto them: if men make a Profeſſion of Religion, and have a converſation agreeable to it, the Church can go no further; but for a Church to admit al, if they be no ſwearers, no adulterers, of groſs livers in any other ſin, although they make no Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nay, if they do but hire a Houſe in the Pariſh, it is enough to make them members of the Church, and when they are in, there is no power to caſt them out; &amp; if a power heretofore, the remedy was worſe than the diſeaſe; it was ſuch a power as was never ordained of God: Whether we ſhould joyn with ſuch a Church or no; or whether we ſhould withdraw, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſome evil ones among them is queſtionable? ſurely none can imagine there ſhould be ſuch a pure Church in the world, as that there ſhould be no tares among them; But if there be a power in every Church to admit of none

ſtand amazed and riſe with indignation againſt it, Rom. 6.1. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, Shall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound?</hi> — ſome there were that did abuſe the grace of God to ſin; How does the Apoſtle riſe with indignation againſt that abominable wickedneſs? he does not grant it, but reject it with a horrible indignation, <hi>God forbid,</hi> What? to ſin that grace may abound, God forbid: What? to make uſe of the grace of God to further ſin; Shall we ſtand to anſwer theſe men, in the horrible reaſoning of their hearts? No, they are to be caſt of with deteſtation and rejection, with <hi>a God forbid,</hi> that there ſhould be any of ſuch vile and wicked hearts thus to abuſe the pardoning grace of God: Suppoſe you forgive one ſervant a fault, and another ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould ſay; well, my Maſter hath forgiven him, I will do ſo too; upon that ground, if thou commit the ſame offence, he will not forgive thee, becauſe thou offendeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, which is a moſt horrid thing. Let me a little further reaſon the caſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is an argument of an abominable heart, that hath no way to keep it from ſin, but only guilt, and fear of wrath and Hell</hi>; Thou makeſt not the grace of God an argument to keep thee from ſin, nor the evil of ſin in it ſelf; which is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and wrong to God; there is more evil in ſin it ſelf, ſetting a ſide the conſideration of the guilt and puniſhment of it, there is ten thouſand times more evil in ſin it ſelf, than all the puniſhment in Hell will countervail; and thou haſt no way to keep thee from ſin, but only the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; it is an argument of a baſe wicked heart.</p>

that we ſhould preſume to ſin, on hopes that God may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it: No, <hi>But to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts; and that we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly</hi>; and not to take liberty to ſin, to lye, ſteal, be filthy and the like, becauſe God will pardon; no, it teaches other manner of leſſons than theſe; and then it follows, <hi>looking for that bleſſed hope and appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Christ</hi>; mark the Text, there is a great deal in it, when the grace of God that brings ſalvation, and mercy, and pardon of ſin is revealed, it teaches us theſe Leſſons; becauſe of the grace and favour of God is revealed to us, <hi>that we ſhould deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> and then we may with comfort look for the bleſſed hope and appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; but otherwiſe you can never look for that bleſſed hope: let me ſpeak to thoſe that reaſon thus, that they may venture on ſin, becauſe of Gods pardoning grace; Does the Revelation of the grace of God teach you to live ungodly, and in worldly luſts? Can you look for that bleſſed hope with comfort, and expect the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt? 'tis impoſſible, you cannot, 'tis not <hi>a bleſſed hope</hi> that you have, but <hi>a curſed hope</hi>; that all ſhall be well at laſt, though you live ungodly and wickedly, and for the appearing of the great God; certainly it will be a terrible appearing to thee, that made Chriſt who came to diſſolve the works of the Devil, to be a means to uphold the works of the Devil.</p>

Certainly, thoſe that know the grace of God in Chriſt know that there is no ſuch powerful argument as the grace of God in Chriſt in pardoning ſin, to keep up the heart to God, and to keep from ſin as this, no ſuch argument in the world that is like to this; the eyeing of Gods grace is a ſpecial thing to quench and keep down luſt; whereas thoſe that ſin after this mercy, whoſe luſts and corruptions overcome the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this pardoning mercy, they are deprived of the beſt and moſt ſpecial ſpiritual helps, that can be to keep from ſin; Phil. 4.7. <hi>The peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and minds in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>; the word in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal is very ſignificant, <hi>ſhall guard your hearts</hi>; this is the emphaticalneſs of the phraſe; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>The ſweet peace of God, is ſuch as paſſeth underſtanding, and ſhall guard your hearts</hi>; as indeed the peace of God that comes to flow out from the ſweetneſs of the pardoning grace of God is ſuch, as <hi>paſſeth underſtanding</hi>; but yet after all this, there will be many dangers, and you are to be involved with many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; but this peace of God will be a guard to your ſouls, to keep you from ſin and temptation: The ſoul of a Believer that hath peace ſpoken to it, is there compared to a <hi>Captain</hi> in <hi>War,</hi> or a <hi>Prince</hi> that apprehends himſelf in ſome <hi>danger,</hi> ſets a ſtrong guard about his Perſon to keep him from danger: Now what is the guard, that keeps the ſoul of a Believer from temptation and danger? It is the <hi>peace of God,</hi> that is the greateſt and ſtrongeſt guard in the world; if you complain of ſin and temptations, and that you are afraid that ſin will ſurprize you; What guard would you have to keep you? <hi>The peace of God is the beſt guard</hi> that can be: Now after

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let me further ſpeak to ſúch that ſin after the pardoning grace of God, and do not walk anſwerable to that grace that was let forth in witneſſing the pardon of ſin; 'tis a thouſand to one thou wilt looſe thy evidence</hi>; 'tis true, it is irrevocable in Gods heart, yet thou may'ſt carry it ſo, that by thy looſe walking, thou may'ſt looſe the evidence of it in thy own ſoul, and it may be as ſad with thee as if thou wer't not at all pardoned; we are to know that when an Evidence is given in, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardon of ſin, every renewed act of ſin is a blot to that Evidence: A man that having Evidences of Lands, or an Eſtate, will keep them fair; but if he ſhould ſuffer them to be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, one blot after another, perhaps ſo blotted as neither he nor any one elſe is able to read them; it may coſt him a great deal of trouble before he get them renew'd again; ſo 'tis with a poor creature that hath got ſome comfortable Evidence of the pardon of ſin, but giving way to temptation, commits a ſin, and there he gets a blot; and then, the next temptation, coming poſſibly to worldly Mindedneſs, Paſſion, Unbelief, ſlightneſs of Spirit, Vanity, Senſuality, and abuſe of the Creatures; by often yielding to theſe, he gets more and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed blots; ſo that if his Evidences be lookt into, they will be found ſo full of blots, that no marvel in a time of temptation they cannot read them; poſſibly ſome that are skilful in the way of God, and the nature of the Covenant of grace, may pick out ſomewhat of the meaning of them; but thou haſt faln ſo ſouly from God that thy Evidences are ſo blotted and blur'd, that in thy own apprehenſion thou can'ſt ſee nothing, but that thy condition is as dangerous as ever it was and as uncomfortable, thy Evidences are ſo blotted that thou can'ſt not read them thy ſelf, and ſo haſt no comfort by them, and 'tis to thee as if thou had'ſt none at all; this is the duty, and would be the comfort of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that when they have gotten their Evidences, that they would keep them ſo clear, that they might read them every morning, and run and read them, and not ſtand
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101278:64"/>
pooring and beating their brains and hearts, and fret them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they cannot find ſuch and ſuch a thing that was to them an Evidence of the pardon of their ſins, this is through their neglect; and if they had been careful to have kept their Evidences clear and plain, O the comfort they might have had to have read them every morning: If the Pollution of ſin recoil back again, no marvel the ſenſe of guilt of ſin upon thy Conſcience recoil back again; if God have committed ſuch a Jewel to thee as the Evidence of pardon of ſin, and thou makeſt no better uſe of it, 'tis juſt with God to take it out of thy hands, and keep it in his own; and though he ſhew mercy at laſt unto thee, yet thou may'ſt not know it while thou art in this world; 'tis a very hard thing to recover it again: thoſe that have had the pardon of ſin ſeal'd unto them, have by their falling into ſin afterwards, ſo darkned and loſt their Evidences that they could never recover them again; as <hi>David,</hi> ſee how he cries out, <hi>Create in me a clean heart, and reſtore to me the joy of thy Salvation; David</hi> ſaw all was gone, and that there muſt be a new Creation and Reſtoration; <hi>Reſtore to me the joy of thy ſalvation</hi>; O the joy that once I had, and now have loſt; O Lord that I may have it once again: <hi>David</hi> had a little ſenſual pleaſure for a while, but he paid dear for it, he loſt <hi>the joy of Gods Salvation:</hi> What think you, <hi>David</hi> would have given to have got it again? for ought we know, he never had it ſo fully as before: Thoſe that have had ſome comfortable Evidence of pardoning grace, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards through their negligence, looſneſs, and vanity, have loſt it, may never come to injoy the comfort of it again as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they did; and therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> had ſinned againſt his <hi>Maſter</hi>; mark, when Chriſt came to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Loveſt thou me?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt I love thee</hi>; Chriſt puts it to him again; <hi>Loveſt thou me?</hi> he would not take his firſt anſwer, but puts it to him the ſecond and third time, <hi>Loveſt thou me?</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> look to your ſelf, it is not any preſent ſudden work that can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Evidences again; you that have ſinned and darkned your Evidences, had need to put this Queſtion

to your own hearts again and again, to get it ſure, that you love Chriſt, and that Chriſt loves you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Let me ſpeak to ſuch as ſin after pardon, it may juſtly provoke God to deal with you, though he do not take away his everlaſting love; yet to deal with you as a Slave rather than a Child; I mean, in following you with ſore and heavy chaſtiſements,</hi> though he may ſave your ſouls at laſt, yet it may cauſe God to meet you with ſuch ſore and evil things in this world, that for that ſloath and ſluggiſhneſs of your hearts you may pay dear for it, before you die; truly ſo may be the dealings of God with his own Children whom he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.14. God is ſpeaking there to his own people: <hi>Is Iſrael a ſervant? Is he a home-born ſlave?</hi> and at verſ. 18. <hi>What haſt thou to do in the way of Egypt?</hi> ſo thou to whom God hath heretofore received to mercy and pardon; but thou haſt walk't ſo, that Gods ways to thee ſeem to be ſuch as it may be ſaid, <hi>Is this man or woman a ſervant? Is he a home-born ſlave?</hi> God ſpeaks it with pity, <hi>Iſrael is my dear Son</hi>; How comes it to paſs that <hi>he is as a home-born ſlave?</hi> What, is he a ſervant, and brought into ſuch a condition as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or a ſlave? What is the matter?

Where is that filial ingenious ſpirit of thine, that God is fain to deal with thee as now he doth?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Again, thou that ſinneſt after pardon, thou comeſt to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate thy ſins more than the ſins of the wicked, in ſome regards</hi>; thoſe that are wicked, and go on in their vile ways againſt God, you cry out of them as wretched creatures, baſe, filthy, drunkards, ſwearers, lyars, falſe men and women in their dealings, ſuch as are not to be dealt withal in the world, you think theſe are wicked; but you that ſin after mercy, your ſins have an aggravation upon them beyond theirs; for they never knew what Gods ſweet pardoning mercy meant; they never heard God ſpeak peace to their ſouls, as thou haſt to thine; they never had the ſecret Viſitations of Gods
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101278:65"/>
Spirit, nor the warm beams of Gods mercy ſhining into their hearts; they were never acquainted with ſuch things; and therefore though they go on in ſin, after which they have bin accuſtomed, 'tis not ſo much to be wondered at: But thou that haſte had a taſt of the ſweetneſs of Gods love in Chriſt, in pardoning mercy; for thee to ſin after this, 'tis a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aggravation than the ſins of the other; and as 'tis a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aggravation than the ſins of the wicked, ſo thy ſin goes more near to the heart of Chriſt than the ſins of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ungodly do; the ſins of the moſt prophaneſt wretch in all the Town doe not go ſo near to the heart of Chriſt, as thoſe that are committed after receipts of mercy from Chriſt; What, you my ſons to do thus and thus againſt me? I remember 'tis reported of <hi>Caeſar, when many with their Poinyards came about him, and ſtab'd him in the Senate-Houſe, at length comes</hi> Brutus, <hi>whom he had done much good for, he comes and gives him a blow, he look't upon him, and cries out; What, thou my ſon</hi> Brutus, <hi>wilt thou give me a blow and ſtab?</hi> It went nearer to the heart of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to have <hi>Brutus</hi> come and give him a wound and ſtab, than for all the other that came round about and ſtab'd him; ſo Chriſt may look upon thee, for whom he has purchas't pardon, ſhed his blood, and laid down his life for; What, thou my ſon, wilt thou ſin againſt me? for wicked wretches that are ſtrangers to him, no marvel if they ſin againſt him; but for you that are his ſons, his redeemed ones, that have received ſuch pardoning grace and mercy; for you to ſin: this goes to the heart of Chriſt more than the ſins of the ungodlyeſt wretch in all the Pariſh, And would you not be loath to do more againſt Chriſt than the vileſt wretch in the Pariſh? you that have received ſo much mercy from Chriſt: <hi>Further, other mens ſins anger God, but no mens ſins grieve the Spirit of God ſo, as the ſins of thoſe that have received pardon</hi>; they go to the heart of God, <hi>and greive the Spirit by which they are ſealed</hi>; the Spirit of God that hath ſealed to your ſouls the pardon of your ſins, let not that Spirit be grieved; 'tis a greater ſin to grieve the bleſſed Spirit of God than you are aware of. Further, yet once more, <hi>you bring a diſgrace upon the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101278:66"/>
Doctrine of Aſſurance of Pardon:</hi> We preach that a man may not only have ſome good hopes that his ſins are pardoned; but we ſay God hath revealed ſuch a fulneſs of riches of grace in the Goſpel, that a man may have certain and full aſſurance of the pardon of his ſin; as if he heard a voyce from Heaven, ſpeaking to him by name, thy ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; or as if when Chriſt in the days of his fleſh, ſaid to any one, <hi>ſon, go in peace, thy ſins are pardoned</hi>; certainly, there may be as full aſſurance of pardon of ſin, by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit of God, as if ſuch a voyce came from Heaven: But our Adverſaries ſay, open but that gap, and 'tis an open way for men to take liberty to commit any ſin; What need men care what ſins they commit, when they know they are pardoned? that has been objected againſt us; but now we ſay, there is ſuch a vertue in the grace of God going along with pardoning of ſin, that heals the ſoul, as well as comforts the ſoul; we anſwer it thus, but you take away our anſwer, and digrace that bleſſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Pardon of Sin; for wherein does it appear, there is ſuch a healing power in the aſſurance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin? if it be ſo, then you would walk more ſtrictly than any man in the world can do, in the time of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt horror of Conſcience that poſſible can be; and this would bring an honour to the Doctrine of Aſſurance; but you by ſinning after pardon, How do you diſgrace this bleſſed Doctrine, and take away the anſwer out of our mouths?

A Schollar would think it a diſhonour to him, for one to come to reaſon with him, and bring nothing but poor low weak objections that are not worth the anſwering, he would think it a diſgrace to him; certainly it is a diſhonour to the grace of God, to ſet ſuch things as theſe againſt it, thou look'ſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it in a natural way, and doſt not conſider, it is the great deſigne of God above all things in the World; to magnify his grace in pardoning of ſin; certainly were this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, theſe things would be counted too low and unworthy to be ſet againſt ſuch a deſigne; when it is the greateſt, God hath to magnify his name in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou judgeſt of God according to thy own thoughts,</hi> and this God will take exceeding ill, as they <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I kept ſilence thou thoughteſt I was altogether ſuch a one, as thy ſelf</hi>; 'Tis a great evil to meaſure God by our own thoughts, and there are <hi>two waies</hi> of diſhonouring God by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The way of the carnal ſecure ſinner</hi>; he meaſured God by his own thoughts, he thinks God is not ſo ſtrickt to be angry for every fault; and if thou offendeſt, that if we go and cry him mercy, he will be pleaſed again. We think it an eaſie matter to pleaſe God, and becauſe God is ſilent, we think he do's not hate ſin as he doth, thats one way of diſhonouring God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Second <hi>way is when a man comes to be troubled for ſin, and conſcience enlightened</hi>; then we think ſlightly of God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. It may be thou haſt a hard heart and wouldſt not pardon one that provokes thee again and again, thou wouldſt not paſs by ſuch and ſuch offences, and thou thinkſt God is ſo too, thou thinkeſt God to be like thy ſelf, and that he cannot bear with thee in ſuch and ſuch things, becauſe thou canſt not bear with others. This is to judge God by our own line, but know, that the thoughts of Gods pardoning grace are as far above ours <hi>as the Heavens are above the Earth</hi>; and therefore we muſt not meaſure God by our own thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:101278:68"/>Thirdly, <hi>Thou diſhonoureſt the pardoning grace of God, by haveing low thoughts of it, becauſe it is contrary to the Scriptures.</hi> For the main ſcope of all the Scriptures is to magnifie the pardoning grace of God, and to ſet it out in its greatneſs to to thy ſoul, and thou mak'ſt it thy main work to under-value it, Luther <hi>ſais, the ſcope of the whole ſcriptures are but this, that we might know and acknowledge God to be a gracious and merciful God,</hi> and a <hi>greater</hi> then <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks this; that is a notable Text of Scripture in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> 10.42, 43. <hi>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to teſtifie, it is he that was ordained of God to be the Judge of Quick and Dead. To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name; whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Marke, to him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name; whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins: So that it is the ſcope and intention of all the Prophets, to witneſs this to a poor ſoul, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſin: You will ſay, whoſoever believes on him, but there is all the Queſtion: but thou hindreſt thy ſelf of believing, thou wouldſt have aſſurance before thou doſt believe, thou muſt believe that thou mayeſt have it, that is, thou muſt venture and caſt thy ſoul upon this grace of God; all the Prophets witneſs this, that whoſoever believes on him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins; therefore by thy ſitting down in theſe ſullen diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging thoughts of thy heart, thou giveſt a lye to all the Prophets of God, thou giv'ſt not a lye only to our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for certainly ſo it is, God ſees it ſo, but to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God: now when God makes it the work of all the Prophets to witneſs forgiveneſs of ſins by Chriſt, wilt thou make it thy work to object againſt it.</p>
               <p>Again, Know that thy reaſonings are quite contrary to the Scriptures, for thou reaſoneſt, that pardoning mercy will not be thine, becauſe thy ſins are ſo great, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.11. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid cries to God to <hi>pardon his iniquities for they are great,</hi> he makes the greatneſs of his ſins, an argument to drive him too God, not from God, and this is Gods own argument. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <hi>I will not again curſe the Ground any more for mans ſake</hi>; why?
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101278:68"/>
                  <hi>for the imaginations of Mans heart are evil from his youth</hi>; one would have thought it ſhould have been thus, the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of mans heart are evil, and therefore I will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but curſe the ground. No ſaies God, I will not, becauſe the imaginations of mans heart are evil from his youth; as if he ſhould ſay, if I ſhould never leave cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing till man leave ſinning, I ſhould alwayes be curſing, ſo ſaies God, If I ſhould never pardon ſin till mans ſins are leſs, I ſhould never pardon at all. So in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.13, 14. You have God reaſoning there like to this here; <hi>She went after her lovers, and forgat me, ſais God,</hi> 14.v. <hi>Therefore will I allure her, and bring her into the Wilderneſs, and ſpeak comfortably unto her.</hi> For ſhe had forgotten me, and went after her lovers; ſee how the Scripture makes that an argument of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Take another Text in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs, I was wroth and ſmote him, I hid me and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> Marke what followes; <hi>I have ſeen his wayes and will heal him, and will reſtore comfort to him and to his mourners,</hi> he went on frowardly in the perverſeneſs of his Spirit ſaies God, I have ſeen his ways and will heal him: thus God expreſſes himſelf to the end of the Chap. to incourage the hearts of thoſe that are ſencible of their ſins, and would be ſenſible of the evil of ſin, and account it a great miſery that they cannot be ſencible of it, the Lord would incourage them, therefore the greatneſs of ſin is no diſcouragement at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further, The way that thou takeſt is the way to periſh,</hi> there can be no good in that way, thou mayſt pine away in thine iniquity, but for to get any Councel, help, comfort, or mercy: be aſſur'd thou canſt not, therefore reaſon as <hi>the Lepers,</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 7.3. <hi>If we ſit here we ſhall certainly dye, if we go to the Camp of the</hi> Syrians <hi>they can but kill us, let us ariſe and go:</hi> And it was a good going to them, for they met with that, that helpt and relieved them; So do you ſay if I ſit down thus, there is no way but I muſt dye, but however though I ſhould never get any comfort or help, yet it is better venture that way than the other: thou knoweſt not what thou mai'ſt meet with, may be thou think'ſt it humility to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101278:69"/>
ſit down in this way, but know that moſt deſperate pride may be under it, and ſtand with ſuch diſcouragements. We know the moſt proud ſpirits may be the moſt diſcouraged ſpirits, as the Devil, the Scripture ſets him forth to be as proud as Lucifer, yet none ſo proud as ſpirits under ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements: there may be much pride in diſcouragements, therefore take heed leaſt there be any ſecret pleaſing of your ſelves this way, though you be in ſome trouble, yet if you feel there is a ſecret pleaſure in that ſmart that falls upon you, and ſome kinde of contentedneſs in going your own way, as many men though they meet with abundance of Croſſes, yet if they go their own way, it pleaſes them much; take heed, there may be deſperate pride at the bottom of all this.</p>

                  <hi>If this be to diſhonour the pardoning grace of God; what would you have us to do?</hi> (We would not ſpeak it were it not ſo, to what end is it for us to ſtudy, and pray to God for light and help to open the grace of God, if a little diſcouragement of heart and ſulleneſs of Spirit, ſhall turn all aſide, and make all that we ſay to be of none effeſt: therefore great reaſon there is that we ſhould tell you this is a great diſhonouring of the pardoning grace of God:) but what, would you have us to doubt no more, but go on and perſwade our hearts our ſins are pardoned and theres an end?</p>

                  <hi>No, if I ſhould ſay you could do this, it would be in vain for me to ſay all this,</hi> for it is not in your power to caſt off all fears of Gods anger, and preſently perſwade your ſelves your ſins are pardoned; this is not in your power to do: and therefore this is not the thing I put you upon, it muſt be the mighty work of God; in the 2. of <hi>Ezech.</hi> When the Prophet had done in the end of the 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> the <hi>next verſe</hi> of the 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> he ſaies, <hi>Son of Man ſtand upon thy feet,</hi> but that was not enough to raiſe the Prophet, no not for God himſelf to ſay <hi>Son of Man ſtand upon thy feet</hi> but together with the voice of God, <hi>verſe</hi> the 2. There enters into him the Spirit of God, and ſets him on his feet; ſo it is with the Miniſters of the Word, we ſpeak to ſouls that are caſt down under the burden of their ſins, to ſtir up themſelves that they may not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101278:69"/>
alwayes lye down drooping, but ſtand up on their feet; But together with our ſpeaking, God muſt ſpeak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey his ſpirit to the ſoul before it is able to ſtand up.</p>
               <p>Queſt <hi>Well, but what would you have us to do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are the things I would have you do.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>I would have you turn your fears of preſuming, into fears of diſhonouring the grace of God.</hi> I would have you be as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that Gods grace ſhould be diſhonoured by unbelief, as now you are fearful leſt you ſhould preſume upon Gods grace; thoſe that are ſecure, they fear not leſt they ſhould preſume; but thoſe whoſe conſciences are awakened, their great fear is leaſt they ſhould preſume upon Gods grace, and diſhonour it by preſumption; if thou feareſt thou ſhouldſt diſhonour the grace of God by preſumption, why ſhouldſt thou not fear leſt thou ſhouldſt diſhonour it by unbelief, as well as by preſumption? certainly the ſtrength of this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is from the Devil. Thoſe that have their conſciences troubled for ſin, he labours to keep them from venturing on the grace of God, leaſt they ſhould preſume; but the way to cut the Sinews of this temptation, is to fear rather leaſt thou ſhouldſt diſhonour the grace of God by unbelief; many look not at unbelief as a great ſin, but God is diſpleaſed at thy unbelief, as much as by thoſe that do preſume.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The thing I would have you to do, you that are under the checkings of Conſcience for ſin, and full of doubts that God will not pardon, and you cannot be perſwaded your ſins are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Labour to ſet the greatneſs of the pardoning grace of God in the fulneſs of it, to the utmoſt you can, before the eye of your ſouls,</hi> That it may be before you; though you cannot reach to it, yet ſet it before you; you do not know what an effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the pardoning grace of God hath, by being preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſouls, and kept there; no marvel you find not the power of it, when as you ſet it not before your eyes, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Gods grace lyes much in preſenting it before your ſouls. <hi>The Braſen Serpent, if they lookt not to it, it would never heal</hi>; So though the pardoning grace of God, be in books and Sermons; yet unleſs it be before your eyes, and you fix and faſten the eye of your ſouls upon it; it will never heal
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101278:70"/>
you: therefore keep it before your eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.3. There is an excellent expreſſion; <hi>In the morning will I direct my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto thee, and will look up.</hi> I ſuppoſe many of you in the morning will not neglect prayer to God; but mark the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>I will direct my Prayer</hi>; Tis not I will ſay my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but direct my prayer, there's a great emphaſis in it. I will level my Prayer aright, and dart up my ſoul aright to Heaven, and obſerve the way that God would have me; and ſo direct my heart in prayer to him. It may be ſome of you go thus far, not to content your ſelves with a dead hearted ſluggiſh Prayer: But what do you look to all the day after? what ſhall wandring and diſcouraging thoughts bring you to look down all the day? Would you look up to your morning Prayers, and what you prayed for, there would come a great deal of efficacy upon your ſouls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Be careful to keep your hearts ſtirring and active,</hi> be afraid of deadneſs and dulneſs; take heed of ſuch thoughts, <hi>Why ſhould I pray and read, when as I have no heart to perform any duty</hi>: Up and be doing, and the Lord be with you; if ever your hearts were active at any thing in the world, it ought to be in this, if once you give your ſelves liberty to lye down, and the activity of your Spirits be gone, you are in a ſad condition, twill be very difficult to get them up again; take heed of a ſullen heart, you may be very active, and yet calme, quiet, and patient, theres a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction between theſe two, when I am active and yet calme, ſtilling of my heart under God, and yet ſtirring of my heart unto God, theſe two are joyned together in thoſe whom God directs unto himſelf.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Renew thy reſolutions,</hi> that what ever becomes of thee, whether God will ever ſpeak peace or no to thee yet ſo long as thou liveſt, thou will do what thou canſt; to honour his name, and keep from ſin: Keep thy heart under the power of this reſolution.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Keep thy heart in a waiting frame,</hi> uſe the means, <hi>lye at the Poole,</hi> as the man that lay many years waiting for the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Waters met with help at laſt; ſo do thou keep thy heart in a waiting frame, and think with thy ſelf if mercy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101278:70"/>
come at laſt, it will recompence thee for all thy waitings and pains.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Be willing to catch hold of any beginnings of Gods diſcoverings of himſef,</hi> if it be but a little glimpſe make much of it, and bleſs God for it: Many in their trouble ſeek to God for pardon; but they are always complaining, either to their Neighbours or themſelves; but ſeldom expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Thanks-givings: Now, you ſhould obſerve what God hath granted, what beginnings and glimpſe of his grace appear; look and ſee if there be not <hi>a little cloud, the bigneſs of a mans hand,</hi> it may breed a ſhower, a ſhower of grace may come after it; but take notice of it, when it is but the bigneſs of a mans hand: it is a great evil in ſuch as are under trouble of Conſcience, becauſe they find not full Aſſurance preſently, they think they receive nothing at all: Well, wait upon God under theſe directions, and as you ſhall not be ſo guilty of diſhonouring the pardoning mercy of God; ſo 'twill be a means to bring great good unto your ſouls. We have now done with the ſeveral wayes of diſhonouring the pardoning grace of God; and becauſe God is very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of this, and takes it exceeding ill; I have been the larger in it; now I am to ſhew the evil of it.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Evil of diſhonouring the Pardoning Grace of God.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There is this evil in it, becauſe it is a ſinning againſt mercy, which God accounts his glory</hi>; a man takes it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill, if he be wronged in his Goods, or good Name, or in any thing he apprehends an excellency in; and (mark it) <hi>The greater excellency a man apprehends in any thing, the greater evil he accounts the wrong that is done to him in that thing:</hi> As a covetous man, if you wrong him in his Eſtate, he preſently as a mad man cannot bear it, becauſe you wrong him of that which he counts his greateſt excellency; ſo a Scholar, a man of parts will rather you wrong him in any thing than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him as a Dunce, becauſe he accounts his parts and learning his greateſt excellency, therefore he would not be wronged in that: ſo you that are Marriners, and have skill
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101278:71"/>
in ſailing, and in the Art of Navigation, if one vilifie your work, and find fault with you there, 'tis as if one touch't your free-hold, you cannot bear it; Why? becauſe you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it your excellency; ſo it is between us and God, if we wrong God in that which he accounts his excellency, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear it; Now the pardoning mercy of God is that which God counts his excellency and glory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. when God deſcended <hi>to ſhew Moſes his glory, his Pardoning Mercy</hi> was one of the great Maſter-pieces, wherein God accounted his glory to conſiſt, more than in the making of Heaven and Earth: Now for God to be contemn'd in that wherein his glory conſiſts, muſt needs be a great diſhonour to him; the mercy of God comes from <hi>the bowels of his compaſſions</hi>; Now if you ſtrike one on the arm or ſhoulder, it is not ſo much as if you ſtrike him on his bowels; when you diſhonour the pardoning grace of God, you do as it were ſpurn at the Bowels of God and Chriſt, and he accounts it ſo: certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you that can hear this, and neglect it, and prize and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer every baſe iuſt before it, you do as it were go up and down kicking and ſpurning at the bowels of God; and that Child that ſhould ſpurn at his Mothers bowels, is not ſo much to be blamed as thou art that goeſt on in ſin, after thou haſt heard the pardoning grace of God opened to thee, thy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in ſin is a ſpurning at the very bowels of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This aggravates the ſin of ſuch men above the ſins of the Heathen</hi>; their ſins are nothing in compariſon of thoſe that live under the Goſpel, and have the grace of God open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them; at the Day of Judgment, when thou heareſt them condemned for ſins againſt the Light of Nature, they may ſay, <hi>Lord, What ſhall become of theſe?</hi> we never heard of ſuch grace and pardoning mercy in Chriſt as you heard of, that have lived in ſuch and ſuch a place, and have had the pardoning mercy of God opened to you; if they do not plead againſt you, yet it will be made known before all Men and Angels what you have heard, and what has been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, and what God has done for you; and for you to continue in ſin, your ſins will thereby be aggravated, and your condemnation heightened.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:101278:71"/>Thirdly, <hi>Your ſin is above the ſin of the Devils</hi>; the ſin of the Devils is not ſo great as yours is that live under the light of the Goſpel, and have the pardoning grace of God preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you: for though the Devils blaſpheme God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, yet their ſins have not this aggravation upon them that yours have; God never came and told them, <hi>he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pardon their ſins</hi>; nor did Chriſt make any purchaſe for them by his blood; but to you is the Goſpel preacht, and pardon offered dayly to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Are not your ſins greater then, than the ſins of the Devils? Would not you account it a great aggravation of any ones offence, that hath wronged and injured you, and ſhould ſeek for pardon, and yet you rather ſeek to him, and offer pardon to him, and ſue to him to accept it, and he goes away and contemns you; would not you account this a great aggravation? know, thy ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this grace, makes thee to be in a worſe condition than <hi>Belzebub</hi> himſelf, that is the chief all the Devils; he had never this aggravation, which is a dreadful one to ſin againſt the pardoning mercy of God; ſo that the very Devils may complain againſt you, and ſay, <hi>O Lord we ſinned againſt thee, but thou tookeſt advantage againſt us preſently for one ſin; but how have theſe ſinned againſt thy pardoning mercy, that has been offered to them again and again, which was never offered us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>I might ſhew you the evil the Scripture ſays of it,</hi> take two or three Texts, Joh. 3.18, 19. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already,</hi> and verſ. ult. <hi>He that believeth not, the wrath of God abideth on him</hi>; it ſticks faſt upon ſuch a one, and that place in Heb. 10.29. <hi>If they that ſinned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Moſes Law died without mercy,</hi> who had but little of this grace revealed unto them; <hi>How much ſorer puniſhment ſhall they have, that ſin under the Goſpel, under the full revelation of this grace</hi>; but to conclude all, there is nothing will be ſuch an aggravation of thy torments in Hell, as theſe Sermons of Gods pardoning mercy, if thou go on in ſin: When we ſpeak of the pardoning grace of God, we cannot do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trembling hearts; Why? Becauſe we know God will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding quick with thoſe that have the grace of the Goſpel preacht unto them: And therefore when we come upon this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101278:72"/>
argument, we cannot but do as a Phyſitian that is giving his Patient a Potion that is of mighty operation, that will either cure him, or diſpatch him ſuddenly, if it cure not: A Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian cannot but come with a trembling hand, with ſuch a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he knows it muſt work one way or other: we know God is exceeding quick with thoſe to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his pardoning mercy in the preaching of the Goſpel, and thoſe truths we preach, will have a quick operation either to bring you out of your ſins to Salvation, or elſe they will quickly diſpatch you for condemnation, Mark 16.15, 16. <hi>Go</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>and preach the Goſpel to every creature; and he that believes ſhall be ſaved; and he that believes not ſhall be damned:</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, go open the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the Juſtification of a ſinner by the freeneſs of the grace of God through Chriſt Jeſus, and whoſoever will come in and believe, and cloſe with it ſhall be ſaved; but he that believes not ſhall be damned: there is no trifling in the buſineſs, he that believes and comes in ſhall be ſaved; but he that believes not ſhall periſh, he ſhall be damned; let people know when they have the Goſpel preach't unto them, there is no trifling, no dallying with it, 'tis not to be put off; he that comes in, ſhall be ſaved; but he that ſtands off ſhall periſh, ſhall be damned, and ſhall know that I will fetch up my glory from him another day, in another way; as if Chriſt had ſaid, Go preach, make quick work of it; either come in and be ſaved, or ſtand out and periſh: And ſo <hi>John</hi> when he came to preach the Doctrine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10. ſays, <hi>Now the Axe is laid to the root of the tree, every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen down and caſt into the fire:</hi> Now alſo the Axe is laid to the root of the tree; Why not before? No, all that while they went on in Ignorance, and underſtood not ſin, and the grace of God brought unto them, for the pardon of their ſin all that while; God let them grow, though they bore no fruit, or but ill fruit: but now alſo the Axe is laid to the root,—<hi>If he bears not good fruit now, he is hewn down and caſt into the fire.</hi> Now, when you hear of pardon of ſin, and grace revealed in the Goſpel, either you bring forth fruit, or

you do not, if you do not, God is peremptory; if you come in and imbrace the Goſpel, you ſhall be ſaved; but if you do not, the Axe is laid unto your root to cut you down: the Goſpel makes quick work with you, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. it is ſo ſtrong that it kills with the very ſavour of it, it has ſuch a ſavour as it can kill with the very ſmell of it; <hi>To him that believes, it is the ſavour of life unto life; but to him that believes not, it is the ſavour of death unto death,</hi> Act, 17.30. <hi>In the times of Ignorance God winked,</hi> when men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not what the evil of ſin was; <hi>but now he commands all men to repent:</hi> before you heard the dreadful evil and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity that is in ſin, God might wink at you; but now he commands you all, having heard ſo many Sermons of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil nature of ſin, to repent, or elſe God will be very quick with you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. an excellent place, <hi>The Word of God is quick and powerful</hi>; but what word is it? mark, in the 2d. verſe, <hi>Unto us,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was the Goſpel preached:</hi> It was the Word of the Goſpel, and verſ. 8. <hi>If Jeſus had given them reſt:</hi> It is that reſt ſpoken of in the Goſpel; and mark what he ſays in the beginning; <hi>Let us therefore fear, leaſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being left of entering into reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it:</hi> Let us therefore fear, for the Word of God is ſwift, and will make quick diſpatch: No Sermons make ſuch quick diſpatch as Sermons of the Goſpel; fear leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeem to come ſhort: let us fear, leaſt any of us ſhould go on in any way that makes it ſeem to appear we reject the Goſpel.

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of the ſeveral Miſtakes of Men about the Pardon of their Sins.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>OUr work now is to ſhew who they are that have their ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned</hi>; for there is nothing in all the world ſo much concerns us, as to know how things ſtand with us in relation to God and our ſouls, whether we be pardoned or no; for a miſtake in this is a wonderful miſtake; and yet how many thouſands are there that venture the weight of this great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs upon poor, weak, and ſlight grounds, yea rather on meer ſuggeſtions of their own hearts? and therefore we muſt firſt labour to convince men of their miſtakes about pardon of ſin; and then lay down ſome ſound Evidences of pardon, in which there may be true and ſolid peace. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are exceeding apt to miſtake in point of pardon of ſin, hoping that God has pardoned them, and that they ſhall not be laid to their charge, but upon very ſlight grounds that will deceive them; And therefore I deſire this day you would look upon your ſelves as arraign'd before the great God, as one day you muſt be: And let your hearts ſo hear, and attend to what we deliver, as if God ſhould ſpeak to you, and ſay, Thou ſinner, ſuch and ſuch things thou art privy to, and haſt been guilty of, What can'ſt thou ſay why the ſentence of everlaſting death ſhould not be paſt upon thee? why God ſhould not declare againſt thee according to his Law? I ſuppoſe, ſcarce any of you but have ſome hope that God will never proceed againſt you according to his Law; for indeed, if he do, you are undone for ever. But what are the grounds of your hopes; why you think God will not proceed againſt you for your ſins, but will paſs them by, and forgive you? let us a little examine the grounds of it, for it is of very great Conſequence; and certainly many people are now ſunk down into the bottomleſs pit of Hell, by reſting upon falſe grounds; I ſhall labour to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101278:74"/>
diſcover the weakneſs of their ſtanding, that reſt on falſe grounds, the</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Is this many, think that God has pardoned their ſin, becauſe it is but little they have been guilty of,</hi> and for that they think there is a pardon in courſe; were I guilty of ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wickedneſs, and notorious ſins, as many others are; then I think it would go hard with me; I ſhould be affraid, things between God and me were very grievous, but the ſins I have been guilty of, are no ſuch great ſins; I hope God will paſs them by: God forbid I ſhould think he were ſo ſtrickt as not to paſs by ſuch ſmall ſins as thoſe that I have been guilty of. For anſwer to this</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>1 <hi>Know thou doſt not underſtand, what the evil and malignity of ſin means</hi>; If thou thinkſt the leaſt ſin does not make ſuch a breach between God and thee, as all created power in Heaven and Earth, can never make up again: if you do not beleive that all thoſe Sermons preacht unto you about the evil of ſin, are loſt unto you. But know, as a little Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife may ſtabb you to death; as truly as a gaſh of the greateſt Sword, and a little ſhot out of a Piſtol may kill you as well as a Canon bullet; So a little ſin may prove your eternal ruine as well as a great one: and therefore that is no argument that God hath paſt by your ſins, becauſe they are little ones; and for that conſider this one thing I am further ſpeaking of:</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Gods pardoning mercy is his own, to do with it what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>; and therefore that God may ſhew his prerogative, he will ſometimes to ſome, pardon their great ſins, and others he will damn for little ſins; you think your ſins are not ſo great as other mens, and therefore you think that God will forgive you; do not deceive your ſelves with this, God will do with his mercy what he pleaſes. What if he will pardon the moſt notorious groſs ſins in others, and damn thee for thy ſins in thoughts? what if he will pardon the moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious uncleanneſs and murder in another, and damn thee for a wanton thought? he may do it, for his mercy is his own: For this take the example of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>David</hi> committed many ſins, but eſpecially thoſe two of <hi>Adultery and Murder,</hi> and yet God pardoned him, but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101278:74"/>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> committed far leſs ſins then thoſe, and yet God caſt him off for ever; the things on which God laid the caſting off of <hi>Saul</hi> were theſe two ſins.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He did not ſtay till</hi> Samuel <hi>came,</hi> when <hi>Samuel</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a time to come, he deferr'd it to the laſt minute, and <hi>Saul</hi> was in a great ſtrait, he tarry'd for him long, and he thought he muſt not go to war except he offer'd Sacrifice before, and he ventured to offer it himſelf, and did not ſtay out the full time; he ſtaid ſo long till he thought that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> would not come, and then that he did was but to offer Sacrifice to God, and yet God laies this very thing unto his charge as a cauſe why he would caſt him off. 1 Sam. 13.13. Samuel <hi>tells him that God had thought to eſtabliſh the Kingdom for ever unto him, But now he will not</hi>; you are gone <hi>Saul</hi> for this ſin: the 2. <hi>ſin in Scripture</hi> on which God layes his caſting off upon is this, <hi>God ſent him againſt the</hi> Amalekites, <hi>and bad him deſtroy all, but he ſpar'd the fat of the flock, and the King.</hi> Now the ſparing of the fat of the flock was done out of a good intention, he profeſſes it was that the People might have of the fatteſt to offer in Sacrifice to God, a good intention and yet for this God tells him, <hi>that he would rend the Kingdom from him,</hi> for that thing, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.28. True it is, that though <hi>Saul</hi> was guilty of other ſins, yet if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſtory, you ſhall finde that theſe were the two ſins for which God puts the caſting away of <hi>Saul</hi> upon. And yet <hi>David</hi> committed <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>adultery,</hi> and was not caſt off; why? Why if God will ſhew his prerogative, what hath the creature to reaſon with him for it, if he will damn <hi>Saul</hi> for his ſins that were leſs, and pardon <hi>Davids</hi> that were greater, what haſt thou to do with that? his mercy is his own: Thou think'ſt it may be becauſe thou couldſt put a man off with this reaſon, my ſins are ſmall, and therefore I may be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them becauſe they are not ſo great as others: Grant it may be ſo, yet know that tis not ſo with God, he may pardon great ſins in others, and yet thou maiſt periſh eternally for the leaſt ſins of all, and therefore take this for a Concluſion; If thou haſt no other ground for the pardon of thy ſin; but becauſe they are little ones; I pronounce in the name of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101278:75"/>
God againſt thee this day, thy ſins are not pardoned; But ſtand upon the file, and thou ſhalt externally periſh in them, if thou haſt no other ground then that, to ſhew for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them; and therefore never make that an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they are pardoned, <hi>becauſe they are leſs then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Plea.</note>Secondly, <hi>Others it may be will plead, my ſins are not many</hi>; we are all ſinners, but I have not multiplied and increaſed my ſins as others have done. I ſhall anſwer to that briefly, <hi>know that one ſin is enough to damn thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                  <hi>as fully as a Million of tranſgreſſions reiterated again, and again</hi>; One chain is enough to hold thee in everlaſting darkneſs, and God may damn thee for one ſin, as well as for never ſo many thouſands, as you have heard, he did the Angels for their firſt, and but one ſin; and therefore though thy ſins are not many, that is no argument at all. Further, we may obſerve in the way of Gods pardoning mercy; he pardons ſome that have gone a long time on in their ſins, and makes quick worke with others that have been but a little time in ſin, and that we may ſee in the example of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Amon</hi>; compare thoſe two together, in the example of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> you ſhall finde that he raigned ſome 55 years; he was a notorious vile ſinner againſt God; and yet he raigned a long time in it, his converſion was but late. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.1. <hi>He was</hi> 12. <hi>years old, when he began to raign, and he raigned</hi> 55. <hi>years in</hi> Jeruſalem; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all this time he went on in committing moſt notorious abominations, and yet God pardoned him. But now mark, his Son <hi>Amon</hi> comes after him, and perhaps he might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus, my Father lived thus and thus, and for a long time had his luſt and deſires, and why may not I venture to do as my Father did; and ſo he went on in his Fathers wickedneſs; but now mark, <hi>God comes preſently upon him, and lets him live but two years,</hi> and theres an end of him. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> continued 55. <hi>years,</hi> and his Son comes after him, and he would go on in his Fathers ſteps, and God preſently cut him off; ſo though ſome may continue in whoredom, and in other abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and perhaps live in Outward proſperity many years, 40 or 50 years, yet God may paſs them by, and then if thou
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101278:75"/>
ſinn'ſt after their example, he may come upon thee for the firſt or ſecond act, cut the off, and ſend thee down preſently to Hell; and therefore do not ſay, my ſins are but few, and therefore God will paſs them by, that is no argument at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The third falſe ground that others apprehend their ſins are pardoned is this, becauſe the guilt of them does not lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Conſciences</hi>; they think they are not guilty of their ſins, and ſay, they were committed a great while ago, and a long time hath paſt, and they heard not of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they think they ſhall never hear of them more, God hath quite paſt them over, becauſe they were committed a long time ſince, and they have not heard of them. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Do not deceive your ſelves in this, for the ſins that you have committed twenty, fourty, or ſixty years ago, though thou never heard'ſt of them ſince, it is no argument that they are pardoned; for they may be on the file in Heaven, ſtand there upon Record, and lie as a debt againſt you all, though they were committed eighty years ago; 'tis no argument a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor is pardoned, becauſe the Aſſize is not to morrow, or next day; 'tis true, God will have his Aſſize for ſome ſooner; but for you he hath reſerved it till another time; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis you hear not of you ſins, Exod. 32.34. <hi>In the day when I viſit, I will viſit their ſin upon them:</hi> God has his day, and perhaps his day is not come to viſit; and therefore thou thinkeſt thou art diſcharged, becauſe the day of Gods Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation is not come to thee. And Secondly, know further, that though thy ſins were committed a great while ſince, yet in regard of Gods Eternity, they are to him as if they were committed this morning before thou cameſt to the Aſſembly, although you committed them fourty or fifty years ago, yet to God they are but as a ſin committed yeſterday; it may be you think your Conſciences would fly in your faces, if you were drunk yeſternight, and ſhould come to the Sacrament this morning; and certainly he muſt be a deſperate wretch, a monſtrous notorious villain, that ſhould dare to come to the Sacrament this morning that was drunk the laſt night, the laſt week, and never made his peace with God, his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101278:76"/>
may fly in his face if he were not a Monſter: but now, your ſins that were committed fourty or fifty years ago, know they are to God as if they were committed but this morning; for Gods eternity conſiſts not in paſſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but in this, that there is no ſucceſſion with God, no time paſt, nor time to come with God; all time to God is as a perpetual now: and therefore all thy ſins that thou haſt committed in time paſt, is in the eye of God as if they were committed this very hour; there's a great deal of need to underſtand this rightly, for the humbling of men and women, by cauſing them to look back upon their ſins, and to lay them to heart; for they are thus preſented before God, as if they were committed this very moment, Job 14.16, 17. <hi>Doſt thou not watch over my ſin? my tranſgreſſion is ſealed up in a bag, and thou ſoweſt up mine iniquity:</hi> God watches over your ſins, and will come upon you for them; they are ſealed up in a bag: ſometimes when I have ſeen the Clerk of the Aſſizes draw out his Indictments, ſuch a one for murder, and ſuch a one for Felony; it put me in mind of this Text; thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments againſt men were put up in the Clerk of the Aſſizes bag, it may be a good while before: and now at the Aſſizes they are drawn out and read openly in the face of the Court; ſo are thy ſins all put in a bag, and God in the day of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he pulls them out, and reads them openly before Men and Angels. We have an example in Scripture, how God did come on men for ſins committed a long while before, as the example of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, who ſold him, and after this they went on and never heard of it till a long time after; it appears not that their Conſciences were troubled till two and twenty years after they had committed that ſin; till they came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were in affliction, and then their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences began to fly in their faces; for the ſin they committed againſt their Brother: <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſeventeen years old when he was ſold, and when he ſtood before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> he was thirty, there's thirteen years; and then ſeven years of plenty, and two years of famine before they came into <hi>Egypt</hi>; there's two and twenty years, before their Conſciences did fly in their faces for their ſin againſt their Brother: Take heed what you
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101278:76"/>
do; for the ſins of your youth may be a torment to your old age: it may be you little think of it; but remember, when you are old God may come and reckon with you for the ſins of your youth: 'tis and ſhould be a great argument to make people to take heed of ſin; for thoſe ſins thou committeſt now may do thee a miſchief fourty or ſixty years hence; as in the natural body, many young men though they feel no diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in their bodies for the preſent, and ſo care not for their diet, nor how to avoid Surfits: yet after they grow old, then they feel their diſtempers in their joynts and bones, which is no other than their drunkenneſs and intemperance when they were young; ſo 'tis in regard of the ſoul, many in their younger years do greatly follow after wickedneſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hear not of it, they go away and never are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; but afterwards in their old age, God comes upon them for the ſins of their youth: <hi>Joab</hi> when he was young commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſin, but when his hoary head was on him, God then came to him in wrath for it; and therefore think not all thy ſins are pardoned, becauſe 'tis a great while ago ſince they were committed; but rather reckon up thy former ſins and bewail them, and do not reſt on this ground, becauſe 'tis long ſince they were committed, 'tis not to be built upon, you muſt look for other grounds, or elſe you are undone for ever, for this will certainly fail you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Others reaſon that God has pardoned their ſins, not only becauſe they have been committed a great while ago; but they have had proſperity, it hath been well with them,</hi> and God has done them good; and certainly if God had not pardoned their ſins, God would never have let them thrive; I ſhall ſpeak but little to this, for theſe reaſonings are very vain, (there are others I ſhall more inſiſt upon; know this, thou makeſt it an argument of Gods pardoning mercy, it may rather be an argument of Gods eternal curſe, for God to ſuffer a man to proſper much after great ſins committed, it is a ſign that God hath given that man over to hardneſs of heart, which is the moſt dreadful curſe in the world; after God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14, 15. Chapters you may read <hi>Saul had a great deal of ſucceſs in his way immediately after God had caſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101278:77"/>
him off</hi>; ſo though God have caſt off a man or a woman, yet that man or woman may have much ſucceſs in their way; you that are Marriners, you cannot draw an argument, that becauſe you have had a good Voyage, and have paſt ſuch dangers, (though you have committed many ſins,) that God is at peace with you, and that all your faults are paſt over; no, you may have many good ſucceſſes in in your Voyages, and yet periſh at length for the ſins you have committed in your Voyages; and ſo you may have good ſucceſs, as <hi>Saul</hi> had good ſucceſs in war, and yet was caſt off for all that.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Others ſay, we are not ſo vain to make outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity an argument or ground that our ſins are pardoned: but we ſorrow for ſin, repent of them, and turn from them, and rely on Gods mercy through Chriſt that our ſins are pardoned,</hi> theſe are arguments of a higher nature than the former; and if there be true ſorrow, unfaigned repentance, reformation, and a truſting in Gods mercy through Jeſus Chriſt, they will be good arguments indeed: but now I ſhall ſhew you there may be all theſe, and yet ſin not pardoned; yea a relying on Chriſt at leaſt, ſo as people may think they rely upon Chriſt, and yet not ſin pardoned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Though theſe things we mentioned laſt may ſeem to be hard, yet the tryal of them is a very ſafe and wholſome thing,</hi> becauſe if you miſtake in this, you are undone; you will examine Evidences for your Houſes and Lands; do ſo in the great matters between God and your ſouls: And for ſorrow for ſin, I ſhall make it plain, there may be a great deal of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin, and yet ſin not pardoned; you know the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 King. 21.27, to 29. verſes, <hi>And it came to paſs when Ahab heard thoſe words, that he rent his clothes, and put ſackcloath upon his fleſh, and faſted, and lay in ſackcloath and went ſoftly</hi>; when God did but ſend the Prophet to tell him of his ſin, preſently upon the Prophets words he rent his clothes, which was a ſign of extream ſorrow in thoſe times, and then he put on Sackcloath: he put off his Princely Robes, his brave Apparrel, and put on Sackcloath, and that not for an outward garment, but upon his fleſh, and then faſted and lay in Sackcloath, and went ſoftly as a dejected
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101278:77"/>
man: the pride and ſtoutneſs of his heart ſeem'd to be ſo much abated, that God takes notice of it in the 29. verſe, <hi>Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf before me</hi>; and becauſe he did ſo, the judgment was deferred for a while; yet certainly <hi>Ahab</hi>'s ſin was not, or ever ſhould be pardoned, though he put on Sackcloath and humbled himſelf before the Lord: I appeal unto you this morning, Are not many of you hoping for pardon of ſin, and yet come far ſhort of <hi>Ahab?</hi> all you do in your repentance, is to ſay, God be merciful unto me, I am ſorry, Lord forgive me, and there's an end, all's done pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; but <hi>Ahab</hi> went a great deal further, and yet his ſin was not pardoned: Take the example of <hi>Eſau,</hi> you know what the Scripture ſays of him, <hi>He ſought the bleſſing with tears, and yet found no place for repentance</hi>; and in being reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the bleſſing, it was a type of his rejection of Heaven; ſome carry it thus, to prove there may be tears, and yet no true repentance, that is a truth; <hi>Eſau</hi> was very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and ſhed many tears, and yet there was no true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but I rather take the meaning of the Text thus; he found no place of repentance in his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi>; his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> had given the bleſſing to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and would not call it back, though he ſought it with tears; there was no place for <hi>Iſaac</hi> to recal it any more, though he ſhed many tears, yet he went without it; ſo that there may be much ſorrow, and thou may'ſt ſeek the bleſſing with many tears, and yet God may be ſo turn'd againſt thee that there will be no place for repentance, that is, <hi>God will not call in that that is out againſt thee.</hi> And of <hi>Judas</hi> 'tis ſaid when he ſaw <hi>Chriſt was condemn'd, that he repented</hi>; 'tis ſaid he did repent, yet <hi>Judas</hi> was not pardoned; ſo that you ſee plainly, there may be repentance, and yet ſin never pardoned: Indeed, true repentance hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pardon going along with it; but the Scripture ſpeaks of a repentance that may be without pardon; therefore when thou ſay'ſt thou repenteſt, you muſt not look upon it ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you repent, therefore your ſins are pardoned, as if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry repentance was true; for thou miſtakeſt in the work of repentance, thou thinkeſt this to be repentance to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for thee to be ſorry at the very heart for thy ſins; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101278:78"/>
thou may'ſt be ſorry at the heart, and yet periſh for all that; I make no queſtion but <hi>Judas</hi> was ſorry at his heart, and wiſht it had never been done, and if it were to do again, he would never do it; there is as much expreſt, he repented, and he brought the 30 pieces again; he was not only ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but made ſatisfaction; he brought the mony back again that he had got in a wicked way: and therefore if you think this to be true repentance, you are mightily miſtaken, but wherein is it that we fail? It is not for me now to enter on the Doctrine of true Repentance, I am to ſpeak of it ſo far as to convince men, that it is not a ground for hope of pardon of ſin: Mark it, when 'tis thus with thee, thou repenteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou ſeeſt that ſin will bring thee into danger: Now, thou haſt had the pleaſure or the profit of it, and thou ſeeſt now it will bring thee into trouble and danger, thou art ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that ever thou did'ſt it: certainly, if God would be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſuch kind of ſorrow, he might have enough of it in Hell; for there is yelling and ſorrow, becauſe of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that ſin hath brought upon them: to ſorrow becauſe of the trouble that our ſins bring on us is meerly natural, and flows from nature it ſelf, and far from a ſaving work of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; therefore the repentance many hope to have, What is it? when we tell them of their ſins, they ſay, they hope to repent; What do they mean? Why? they would take the pleaſure of ſin, and when the puniſhment comes, they would be ſorry for it, and repent of it: the ordinary way to put men off from this plea, is to tell them How do you know you ſhall live, or that your hearts ſhall not be hardned? but ſuppoſe you do live, and that you have a heart to do as you ſay, yet your repentance may fail you; if your repentance be no other than that which comes for ſorrow of ſin, becauſe of the puniſhment, it will fail you; certainly that repentance that muſt go for current in Heaven is of another nature: poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly I may ſhew afterwards what is true and falſe ſorrow; but for the preſent I ſhall ſhew where the miſtake lies: Whoſoever therefore that builds their believing of the pardon of their ſin meerly on their ſorrow, and ſuch kind of ſorrow, they are like a man that would erect a great Building, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101278:78"/>
lay the foundation of it in a quag-mire, or on the ſand, as the Scripture ſpeaks, when ſtorms come the building falls; I ſhall ſpeak hereafter to thoſe that build on the Sand; but theſe build on a Quagmire, on a few tears, ſorrow and trouble of ſpirit they have upon the apprehenſion of puniſhment of ſin: this building will fall in time of ſtraights and danger; and this is the reaſon why people that depend upon ſorrow never have peace: for how can I tell the meaſure of ſorrow I am to have before peace be ſpoken, and then if they feel not ſorrow, they are queſtioning again: it is a dangerous thing to lay the hopes of pardon of ſin upon our own ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; where or how then ſhall we lay our hopes? why, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſorrows of Jeſus Chriſt, there you ſhall find the ſureſt ground (there may be ſome miſtake there too, but for the preſent I ſhall not ſtay on that) we muſt look ten thouſand times more at the ſorrows of Chriſt than at our own ſorrows; and therefore when your hearts are troubled, and you look for mercy, depend more ten thouſand times on the ſorrows of Chriſt than on all your own ſorrows; for your ſorrows for ſin cannot ſatisfie Gods Juſtice; and that that muſt be a ground of hope for the pardon of my ſin, muſt be ſomething that muſt ſatisfie the juſtice of God; for though there be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much ſorrow, yet it will not ſatisfie Gods juſtice; and conſider further, <hi>True ſorrow rather follows the work of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication then preceds it;</hi> as thus, <hi>I am not therefore pardoned becauſe I mourn; but becauſe I am pardoned, therefore I come to mourn</hi>; ſo ſtands the Truth in Divinity in point of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Repentance: you pervert the order, if you think becauſe you mourn, and are a little ſorrowful, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall be pardoned; the truth is, if your mourning and ſorrow be a work of true ſaving grace: you mourn and ſorrow becauſe you are juſtified; ſorrow of true repentance rather flows from pardon, then pardon from it; when God pardons ſin, he lets out the graces of his Spirit, and then comes ſorrow as a fruit or Evidence of Gods pardoning love and Reconciliation; for though God may give outward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to a man that is not pardoned; yet God never gives his Spirit to work any ſaving grace in the heart till he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101278:79"/>
'tis a fruit of his pardoning grace and favour, and becauſe he has juſtified thee, he ſends his Spirit to work ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and repentance: Many think Juſtification flows from ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; but thou muſt come to ſorrow and repentance another way: know that all true ſorrow flows from Juſtification; all that ſorrow before Juſtification, it is but Legal ſorrow, and reveals ſomething that may hinder the ſoul from Chriſt, as ſin, and the terrors of the Law, and the wrath of God; but it does not intereſt the ſoul in Chriſt; this I affirm as moſt certain Divinity, that there is no ſorrow whereby any ſoul is intereſted and planted in Chriſt; the ſorrow that is wrought in them before Juſtification, in order of nature, may be a means to bring them to God, and make them enquire after Chriſt, and ſtir up their hearts to take away thoſe things that do hinder from Chriſt; but it does not intereſt the ſoul in Chriſt: you do not underſtand the way of the Goſpel, if you think that ſorrow intereſts the ſoul in Chriſt; no, that muſt be by faith laying hold on him for Juſtification, and then comes ſorrow of repentance after; thou may'ſt ſee thy ſelf an undone wretch for ſin, and loſt for ever, and nothing in the world can quiet thee; all this may be by the work of the Law: but then God comes and ſhews thee his grace in Chriſt, and enables thee to cloſe with it for Juſtification, and then comes in Evangelical ſorrow, mourning and melting ſorrow more than ever before: but now it comes in another way from the Spirit of God melting the ſoul, becauſe it hath ſinned againſt Jeſus Chriſt, who hath ſo graciouſly appeared to it in his pardoning mercy to the ſoul; ſo that now you ſorrow becauſe you are pardoned, for it comes as a fruit of faith lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of the pardoning grace of God; and then there is no ſuch argument in the world to melt the heart with ſorrow, as when faith tells the ſoul that ſin is pardoned; and though thy ſorrow was little before, and now is greater, thou need'ſt not be troubled, if God make thy humiliations greater for ſin after the knowledg of thy pardon; for the revelation of Gods grace in the pardon of thy ſin, is the moſt excellent means to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſoul in the world: the ſorrows of Gods Children after pardon, as they work on their own hearts ſo on Gods
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101278:79"/>
heart too; God is mightily taken with it: when once thy ſins are pardoned, then God makes thy heart melt to him as his does to thee: but the ſorrow of one that is an Enemy to God does not ſoften Gods heart; there is a great deal of difference between the ſorrow of Gods Children, and the ſorrow of others; they make ſorrow the ground of pardon, this God accepts not: 'tis true, you may ſorrow for ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be a means to bring you to Chriſt; but that that juſtifies the ſoul is Union with Chriſt by Faith, and all that ſorrow that works Repentance to Salvation flows, from Gods grace in Chriſt, having juſtified you. Juſtification is the firſt thing that eſtates thee in bleſſedneſs; ſorrow does not firſt ſtate thee in a bleſſed condition, but is meerly a fruit of that bleſſedneſs thou art ſtated in: certainly theſe things are the Truths of God; ſo that when you look for bleſſedneſs any other way, you look for it meerly in a natural way, or as a Heathen may do; a Heathen knows he ought not to offend God, and he knows he had need to have mercy from God, and that he ought to be ſorrowful for his ſins; I might give you many examples for it, but I muſt haſten: thoſe then that ſeek after pardon of ſin this way, do but ſeek for it meerly in a natural way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Others ſay, I am not only ſorry for my ſins, but I reform; and is not this a ground of pardon?</hi> Know likewiſe, that there may be a leaving of ſin, and yet ſin not pardoned; for that take the example of <hi>Herod,</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>He heard John Baptiſt gladly, and reformed in many things</hi>; he was a great deal the better for <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry, and yet <hi>Herod</hi> was not pardoned: this is a notable example for you that come to hear Sermons, and ſeem to be much affected, let me ask you in the Name of God, and let Conſcience anſwer, What is it you reformed ſince you heard all thoſe Sermons of the Evil of Sin, and now of the Pardon of Sin? What Evils have you reformed in your families, and in your own hearts? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hope that many of you may ſay, through grace theſe and theſe evils were in my family before, but now I have reformed them; and theſe evils I did before, but now I have left them; I hope many can ſay ſo, and bleſſed be God for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101278:80"/>
this fruit of our Miniſtry if any thing be reform'd, if Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths be better kept, and Duties in family ſet up, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Exerciſes of Religion performed; that you are not ſo proud, paſſionate, and froward as before: O that it may be ſaid ſo, 'tis worth our labour to reſtrain ſin, that God may not be ſo much diſhonoured, if there were no more done: but we preach for further and higher ends, that ſouls would not ſtay in reforming; for <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and did many things; and <hi>Judas</hi> caſt away the money, he repented and would not keep the money, there was a kind of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in both <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi>; but this is no ground to build upon for pardon of ſin; <hi>As thoſe that depended on their ſorrow for pardon, built on the quagmire; ſo thoſe that depend on their reformation, build upon the ſand</hi>; the one by his ſorrow and trouble for ſin, ſeems as it were to be in the work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, is like a man that digs deep for a foundation, but does not caſt out the old mould, but builds upon it; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeems like one that not only digs deep, but caſts out the old rubbiſh, and brings in new mould, new earth: lays by and caſts away his former ſins, and does the contrary good; but now, though they go further than the former in caſting out the old rubbiſh, and bringing in of new earth, yet after all this is done they build upon it, and do not build upon the Rock Chriſt; they bring in the new earth of their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances and Duties, and this they build upon, and do not build upon the Rock Chriſt for the <hi>pardon of their ſins, and Juſtification of their ſouls before God,</hi> and here they fail, and this is their undoing, their miſtake in this; and yet it is moſt ſure, that every one of us would miſtake in this; if God did not reveal in the Goſpel another way to receive Pardon and Juſtification in his Son, we ſhould certainly all of us reſt here, and go no further; no man or woman in the world, that never heard the Goſpel went further than this, and ſo far one may go without the Goſpel; we may dig deep, caſt out the old rubbiſh, and bring in new earth; this we may do, and not hear of the Goſpel: And therefore we have a great deal of cauſe to bleſs God that we may hear the myſteries of the Goſpel opened unto us; for certainly we ſhould elſe go no
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101278:80"/>
further, and if we go no further, we ſhould certainly periſh; and therefore if we go but thus far, it is not building on the Rock Chriſt; hence the ground and bottom of faith for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification cannot be in Reformation, or in any thing in the creature, it muſt be in ſomething above and without us, and yet by faith, (wrought in us) though without us; I mean the Rock Chriſt, and the Foundation that is laid for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſin in Chriſt, that muſt be the Foundation of our faith, and not in what we do our ſelves: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Know, that all Reformation in the world will not ſatisfie for the evil that you have done for the time paſt</hi>; this I would convince you of, and be you willing to hear it, it may be of great uſe unto you; when we preach Chriſt and free grace, it is to bring you to Chriſt; our preaching down of works is not to keep you from doing of them, but from reſting in them: that which I aim at, is to bring you into an enquiring frame of ſpirit, a reſtleſs condition, that ſo we may bring you to that which is the true reſt; and we ſhall be as glad to bring you into the true reſt, as now to bring you into reſtleſneſs: Know, all Reformations for time to come, will not ſatisfie God for time paſt, it will not: amongſt men, if you have run into arrearages with your Landlord for Rent, and you bring him a quarters Rent when there's three or four quarters behind, or may be two or three years, if you ſhould think to pay the Rent of two or three years with bringing the laſt quarter, it would be accounted a fooliſh conceit; ſo would it be, if with God you ſhould think the duties you do at preſent, ſhould ſatisfie for all the arrearages you have run into for time paſt: you do not underſtand Gods way, if you think that God will be ſatisfied for all that is paſt by what you do at the preſent: Suppoſe what you do now were perfect, and for all time to come you never committed one ſin againſt God any more, yet all this would not ſatisfie for time paſt, this looks but at time to come, and does not at all take off any thing for the time paſt: Beſides, you may ſee matter enough in your beſt Reformations for God to condemn you, not only for your former ſins, but ſins in your reforming; but if there were no ſin in that, that would be no ſatisfaction for that which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101278:81"/>
is paſt: Mark this, <hi>That which muſt be the ground of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of thy ſin, muſt be that that muſt ſatisfie for thy ſin paſt, and for all thy ſins to come</hi>; and that was opened unto you in opening the myſteries of godlineſs in the Pardon and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a Sinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Know this, that God accepts of duties, not for the duties themſelves, but becauſe he accepts of the perſon that performs them</hi>; God does not accept of the duties, and then of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is not Gods way: but he accepts firſt of the perſon, and then of the actions: God never accepts of what we do, till he accepts of our perſons; <hi>As</hi> Abel, <hi>God had regard to</hi> Abel<hi>'s perſon firſt, and then to his offerings</hi>; ſo God has firſt regard to the perſon of any man, and then to his Offerings: thou thinkeſt thou art a poor wretched creature, and then thou thinkeſt it may be, if I had ſuch and ſuch parts, and could do thus and thus, then God would accept of me; I tell thee, all thy parts and performances are caſt away, till God accept of thy perſon; <hi>St. Paul was blameleſs according to the Law, and yet he accounted all loſs for Chriſt</hi>; for he knew, that when God revealed the Goſpel to him, that he could not be accepted for his righteouſneſs; but his perſon muſt firſt be accepted, and then his righteouſneſs: So that the way of new Obedience, and the work of Sanctification, are the qualifications of the man that is juſtified; but not the conditions required for the Juſtification of his perſon; 'tis not that that juſtifies the ſoul, the Juſtification of the ſoul comes not through theſe, but theſe flow from Juſtification; and until a ſoul underſtands this, he never rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms duties. Therefore further, to conclude this, though good Works and new Obedience are <hi>good Nurſes unto Faith</hi>; yet if you make theſe <hi>the Mother of your Faith,</hi> your faith is but a Baſtard faith; theſe are not the right Mother of Faith: if your faith be begotten out of your Duties and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and your faith have no other Mother than theſe, then your faith is illegitimate, and not true born, it has not the right Mother; <hi>The right Mother of Faith, is the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the freeneſs of Gods grace in the Covenant of the Goſpel, ſhewed unto the Soul through the mediation of the Son
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101278:81"/>
of God:</hi> this laid open to the eye of the ſoul, by the mighty work of the Spirit of God, raiſes and creates faith in the ſoul; this is the generation of true ſaving faith, <hi>the faith of Gods Elect,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks; Duties and Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances cannot be the Mother of it; it is of a higher birth than that birth that ariſes out of Parts, Duties, or Performances whatſoever; thy faith will not inherit, if it be baſe born: through faith we come to inherit the Promiſes; and if thy faith hath no other foundation than thy ſorrows and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, thy faith is illegitimate, and not that that ſhall inherit; 'tis not of the right kind that will bring thee unto Salvation: thus you ſee what miſtakes there may be in this great Point of the Juſtification of a Sinner, and in being made bleſſed; and therefore we had need look to it to be ſure, that what we reſt upon will hold, leaſt when we come to lay claim, and make challenge of bleſſedneſs, our hold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us: Many think the main matters of Religion to be nothing but believing in Jeſus Chriſt, and crying God mercy: you ſee by theſe things that I have ſpoken, that there had need be much workings of ſpirit in the way of Religion, and mighty ſtrong teachings of the Holy Ghoſt to lead the ſoul; for there may be many miſtakes, and to prevent and remove thoſe miſtakes that lie in the way to get peace with God, 'tis a matter of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and not a ſlight buſineſs to be done ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Others ſay, we truſt in the mercy of God, and in this I am to ſpeak to two ſorts. Firſt, Thoſe that are moſt groſly ignorant,</hi> that have no other ground to hope for pardon of ſin, but becauſe they hear that God is a merciful God: Know thus much, that notwithſtanding what you hear of God, that he is merciful, and not willing that men ſhould periſh: yet the Scripture reveals clearly to us, that notwithſtanding God is gracious and merciful, yet the greateſt part of the world periſh in their ſins; there is nothing more clear then this, that moſt people in the world do periſh; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay God is merciful, is not enough; you may be ſorry for ſin, reform, and ſay, God is merciful, and yet
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101278:82"/>
periſh: if theſe three were enough, what needed the ſon of God to come, and take our nature upon him, and be made a curſe for Mans ſin, lay down his life, and ſhed his precious blood, why might not theſe three have been joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo Chriſt never have come? for though Chriſt had never come, I might have been ſorrowful, and I might have reformed and ſaid God is merciful, though Chriſt had never come: thoſe that never knew Chriſt, nor heard of him yet, they may be ſorrowful, reforme, and ſay God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. I beſeech you conſider this note, <hi>I can never be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and ſaved, in ſuch a way, as it might be done, though Chriſt had never come</hi>; I can then never be pardoned and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all the means I take for pardon and Salvation, if thoſe things might be done though Chriſt had never come; and if you have nothing elſe but them to reſt upon, then you can never be ſaved; put this to your hearts, what have I wrought in my heart, that I might not have had, if Chriſt had not come into the world; certainly the moſt things that moſt people have to reſt upon, for pardon and ſalvation; they might have had though Chriſt had never come into the world. <hi>Further, Thou ſaiſt God is merciful,</hi> True, the mercy of God is ſweet and a bleſſed argument, and our ſouls much delight to open the grace and mercy of God; and I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to open to you what is revealed in the Goſpel; yet Gods mercy is free, though he delight to glorifie his mercy: <hi>and he hath thouſand thouſands of Subjects, to glorify his mercy in, though thou periſh eternally.</hi> Though thou periſh eternally, yet God may be glorious in the bleſſedneſs of his mercy: God hath others to magnifie his mercy unto beſides thee: a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar comes and asks an almes of a man, and he gives him none, that is not an argument the man is not merciful, for he hath other objects, that are more ſuitable and fit; though he give not to every one, tis no diſhonour to his compaſſion; ſo it is with God, he hath thouſands of objects to beſtow his mercy on; though thou periſh. Further, Thou ſaiſt God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and thererefore thou hop'ſt for pardon: Why? God is and hath been merciful to thee beyond all that thou canſt conceive, God hath ſhew'd his mercy to thee already: thou
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101278:82"/>
ſaiſt God is merciful, true, or elſe thou hadſt not been alive at this preſent: that thou ſhouldſt hear and ſee, and have all thy members whole, and the uſe of all thy ſences, and that thou ſhouldſt ſtand here this day under the meanes of grace, and that thou ſhouldſt hear God call on thee to repent, and believe in his Son, while thou walk'ſt on in thy ſin, and art dead in ſins and treſpaſſes: he ſends his ſon and ſpirit to thee, to tell thee that he would reſcue thee, and give life unto thee; again, is not here rich mercy, perhaps thou haſt had thy portion of mercy already, that God intends for thee, yea ſo much mercy, that all the Angels and ſaints will give accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations to God, for that mercy thou haſt had, though thou periſh; God hath many waies ſhewd mercy to thee, in ſo much as that the very devils themſelves will acknowledge that God was very good to his poor creatures.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt of mercy; haſt not thou abuſed and turn'd mercy into wantonneſs?</hi> perhaps the mercy thou ſpeakſt of, now is at this very preſent pleading to God againſt thee; ſaying, how have I been abuſed by this wretched man? the more my beauty &amp; excellency hath been diſplayed, the more wicked he hath grown; what if mercy be now pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee? even thoſe mercies that thou haſt abuſed; and therefore thou hadſt need to look for ſomewhat elſe to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thy ſoul upon then this, to ſay that God is merciful; this is to the <hi>firſt ſort, thoſe that are groſly Ignorant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There are others that mourne, pray and reform, and then have ſome kinde of relyance on God to pardon them, for his mercies ſake</hi>; and therefore to them I ſhall ſay thus much: <hi>Know, the mercy of God muſt be received after Gods own way</hi>; he hath appointed the communications of it, and ſo it muſt be received; otherwiſe it can never attain to ſuch an effect as the pardon of thy ſin; note this, that all the mercy in God conſidered, as he is creator of Heaven and Earth, and not let out through the Mediator Chriſt Jeſus God-man it never wrought to the pardon of any one ſin, and therefore if you looke upon the mercy of God, and do not look to the right way of the conveyance of it, you may moſt dangerouſly miſtake: The ground and bottom of faith, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101278:83"/>
juſtifies is not meerly to caſt ones ſelf on the mercy of God, (for there is none, but in a natural way know that God is a merciful God) but the main ground of Juſtification, or of juſtifying faith, is the free grace of God through Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>That God is merciful through a Mediator</hi>: Otherwiſe the ground of your faith is but on a meer confuſed notion of the mercy of God, which will certainly faile you; a heathen may have as much to be the ground of his faith, that the great creator of Heaven and Earth, pitties thoſe that are in miſery, and I am a poor creature in miſery; Ile cry to him, and ile reform my life, and ile relye on him; thus far a heathen may go: but the ground and bottom of faith is not the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in general, but the mercy of God in and through a Mediator; obſerve a little further, the ground of juſtifying faith is not thus, that God for Chriſts ſake will forgive me for what Chriſt hath done to purchaſe my pardon, but there is another work of faith in the ſouls of believers, though the ſoul apprehend it not; tis not the work of faith in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to believe that Chriſt hath paid ſo much as my debt comes to; but thus, the work of faith is to bring the ſoul unto Chriſt, and to pitch it upon <hi>the perſon of Chriſt, to be made mine firſt, and then the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be mine</hi>: Tis not thus, I believe this is my debt, and there is ſo much money to pay it; but this is the work of faith, to bring thee <hi>to be marryed</hi> to ſuch a perſon; and ſo the debt is tranſacted on him to whom thou art marryed, and he will diſcharge the debt, becauſe thou art marryed to him; ſo that the ground of faith is not to look unto God meerly through his ſon that ſo I may have pardon; but thus, I muſt come to have Chriſt to be mine; I muſt be marryed with Chriſt, and ſo through my union with the perſon of Chriſt, I come to have all that Chriſt hath done and ſuffered to be made over to me; and therefore when I come to look upon the riches of the grace of God in the mediation of his ſon; I muſt come with an eye of faith, to be marryed unto Chriſt, and Chriſt with me, the riches of Gods grace in Chriſt was opened before; we now make uſe of it as a trial to ſhew the danger of falſe grounds in relying upon God for pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:101278:83"/>Further, <hi>Though it be through the mercy of God to pardon ſin</hi>; yet it does not work thus, <hi>viz.</hi> You have ſinned, and my law requires ſuch and ſuch obedience, to be performed on ſuch tearms, or elſe you muſt periſh, but <hi>I through my mercy will remit ſomething</hi> of the rigour and ſtrictneſs of the Law: And moſt people confeſs, that by the ſtrictneſs of the Law they are condemn'd, but they hope the mercy of God will grant ſome remiſſion of the Law; as it is with men, if all Penal ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes ſhould be executed it would be very hard; but there is a Chancery to abate ſomething of the rigour, and ſtrictneſs of penal ſtatutes; and thus men think to come to have pardon, and deal with God after the manner of men; you think the crying to God for mercy wil abate ſomething of the ſtrictneſs, and ſeverity of the Law; but you miſtake in taking this way to get peace and reconciliation with God; to look upon Gods mercy to lye in this, to remit ſomething of the ſtrictneſs and ſeverity of the Law: No but the work of Gods mercy lyes in this, <hi>to finde out a ſurety for you, and to tranſact the debt upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Conſider the work of Gods mercy in juſtification of a ſinner, when faith layes hold upon it faith, muſt not lay hold upon it as a meer ſingle Act; but look at all the concomitants of the work of Gods grace, in making way for the juſtification of a ſinner</hi>: The mercy of God workes many waies, and faith muſt exerciſe it ſelf on Gods grace, according to the multiplicity of the work of it, in bringing about the juſtification of a ſinner; as thus, you have ſinned and you cry to God for pardon, but the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God does not work thus to pardon you, as tis a ſingle act, but the mercy of God works thus to mankind. Firſt, <hi>he is pleaſed to enter into a ſecond covenant</hi> with mankind after he had broken the firſt. <hi>A ſecond work of Gods mercy, is to ſet his wiſdom on work to finde out a way how mankind ſhould be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto him,</hi> and his ſin pardoned, and yet that God ſhould be no looſer; this was the work of his infinite wiſdom. And <hi>Thirdly, when this is found out, this can be done no other way, but only through the Son of God</hi> taking mans nature upon him, and ſuffer for him; then here's the mercy of God, to be willing to ſend his Son to mediate for poor creatures; and then a

of pardon continually going along with it: Now you have heard theſe things, go away and beſeech God to ſettle things aright in your ſouls, ſay to your hearts, Lord I ſee that ſetling of the heart aright upon Chriſt for juſtification and pardon of ſin, is another manner of buſineſs then I was aware of, and I am perſwaded that if I had died before, I ſhould certainly have dyed under ſome of theſe miſtakes; Lord ſettle my heart aright in this great buſineſs: Do not go away with ſuch thoughts as theſe, the Miniſter ſpeaks of ſuch miſtakes, but I hope it is far otherwiſe; do not venture to put off what we ſay with ſuch ſlight thoughts; when we ſpeak unto you we ſpeak in the Name of God, and it is a horrible taking of the Name of God in vain, if we examine not what we ſay unto you by the Word; And therefore know you are charged this day in the Name of God to look to it, and examine your hearts what grounds you go upon for the pardon of your ſin, that you may not miſtake; in which we ſhall give you ſome further help in laying down ſome poſitive grounds that you may reſt upon for the pardon of your ſin.</p>

for anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>Know, there is an outward call and an inward call</hi>; when God ſends the Miniſters of the Word to reveal the Goſpel, and the way of Salvation, that is no other but Gods calling mens ſouls from the ways of ſin and death to come into the ways of life; all that come to hear the ſound of the Goſpel preacht unto them; let them know, that is Gods call to ſinners to come in and repent; God calls to the Drunkard, the Unclean perſon, and all others that live in ſin to repent; when you come to hear the Word God calls you, and God requires of you, as you would have God to hear your cry when you are calling for mercy in the day of your diſtreſs, hear my call, now I call and cry in the Miniſtry of the Word; Would you have me to hear you when you cry to me? do you hear me now I am calling to you: O that People would underſtand the Miniſtry of the Word, that it is the call of God for ſinners to return and repent of their ſins, that they would look beyond man, and know that it is the voyce of God by them; and therefore it is a dangerous thing for People to neglect, reſiſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the Miniſtry of the Word; and there is ſome good hopes that God hath ſome ſouls in ſuch a place that he intends everlaſting good will unto, where he ſends the Miniſtry of the Word; God do's not uſe to ſend the call of the Goſpel to a place, but there are ſome ſouls to be called: And therefore</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Beſides the Outward Call, there is an Inward Call,</hi> and that is it the Apoſtle ſpeaks of: Many have the Outward Call of the Word to Faith and Repentance, and yet they periſh eternally: But thoſe whom God intends to ſave and hath love to indeed, he comes to them with an Inward Call, and this Inward Call of God is on this wiſe: God beholds the poor wretched ſinner going on in the ways of ſin, death, and perdition, and he comes to him by a ſecret and powerful voyce, ſpeaking to his very heart, <hi>O Sinner, conſider where thou art, What art thou a doing?

you; this is the way in the ordinary call of God, and though God ſanctifie ſome from the womb, yet afterwards by a mighty work of the Spirit he diſcovers unto them what the ſoul is by nature; there is ſomewhat like this even in thoſe that are ſanctified from the womb, though God in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way draw the ſoul out from ſin into the ways of life; but generally there are in the ordinary way of Gods working, theſe <hi>three or four voyces calling to the ſoul.</hi> 1. <hi>Says God to the ſoul, O ſoul thou art made for God, and for Eternity.</hi> 2. <hi>O ſoul thou art now in the ways of Hell,</hi> and of eternal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and muſt of neceſſity periſh in it. 3. <hi>O ſoul, behold here are the ways of life</hi> and ſalvation reveal'd unto thee, and ſet before thee in the Goſpel of my Son. And laſtly, <hi>O ſoul come in, and thou ſhalt have favour and acceptation in my Son</hi>; theſe are the four voyces in Gods call; I do not ſay every one hears them plainly and diſtinctly, yet they do for the ſubſtance of them in the ordinary way of the diſpenſation of Gods grace: Every ſoul that God juſtifies they are thus called of God, and 'tis a prevailing call, that brings them in to ſubmit unto it: Again, concerning this call of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture ſpeaks much of it, I ſhall ſhew a little further; mark it, That ſoul that once hears the call of God to bring it into the ways of life, <hi>that ſoul will evermore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Gods call in all other things</hi>; if God hath called me out of the ways of death, into the ways of life in obedience to that call that my ſoul hath yielded too, I ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more under the power of Gods call in all other things, let God call me to what he will, to what ſervice he pleaſes, to whatſoever difficulties and ſufferings he ſhall think meet, my ſoul is content, and ſays, <hi>Here I am, Lord ſpeak, thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hears.</hi> Now for a ſoul to be ſo under God, as to wait upon the call of God to any duty, ſervice, and imployment, that it dares not go about any thing but according to the call of God; this is a good Evidence that ſuch a ſoul hath been acquainted with that great call of God, that powerful call of God to bring him off from the ways of ſin into the ways of life and ſalvation. Further, thoſe that have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this call of God, <hi>there is an anſwerable frame
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101278:88"/>
and diſpoſition in their hearts,</hi> to call upon the Name of God for aſſiſtance, direction, and a bleſſing on all they undertake; they delight now to repair unto God and call upon him; as God calls unto them, ſo they call unto him; for that is the way of God according to his work in the ſoul, he puts a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious frame into the ſoul anſwerable to it: As in Election, thoſe whom he elects, when God calls them home he puts a gracious diſpoſition in their hearts for to elect him; as God chooſes the ſoul from the world, ſo the ſoul chooſes God above all things in the world, the ſoul anſwers to God: God ſets his heart on the ſoul, and ſays, I will chooſe thee for me; the ſoul again ſets its heart upon God, and ſays, I will chooſe thee for my God; as God calls the ſoul to come and live to him in the ways of grace, while he lives in this world; ſo the ſoul calls on God for his aſſiſtance, that he would give his help in unto him on all occaſions; and therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture gives us this expreſſion for the whole worſhip of God, Rom. 10.13. <hi>Whoſoever calls on the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved</hi>; that ſoul that is acquainted with Gods call, that ſoul calls on God again: And by the way, thoſe that are thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are fitteſt for Church-Communion; I mention this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word tranſlated Church comes from a <hi>Greek</hi> word that ſignifies to call out; that which in Scripture is uſually called a Church, ſignifies nothing elſe but this, a Company of People called out of the ways of ſin to the imbracing the ways of Godlineſs; ſo that the Church ſhould conſiſt of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called out of the ways of ſin, by the powerful and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious voyce of the Spirit of God; and they that are thus called have their ſins pardoned; you ſay, you hope God hath juſtified you; you read what God ſays, and what hath been preſented unto you; they who are called they are juſtified; then Calling, in order of nature, goes before Juſtification; this you will find in your own hearts, and if not, this you muſt do, when ever you come before God to hear the outward call, you muſt come with a waiting frame of heart to hear the inward call, and call upon God with ſuch a diſpoſition; ſay, Lord I have been taught that there is an outward call of thine in the Word, and an inward call, and I am going this

day to hear thy Word calling me out of the ways of ſin, O that I might have together with that the inward call of thy Spirit, when ſhall I hear that ſecret voyce; this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though I have been convinced many times at the hearing of the Word, yet my ſin hath prevail'd againſt me, becauſe that inward ſecret powerful voyce hath not come to my ſoul; that is the firſt Evidence, <hi>whom he hath juſtified, them he hath called.</hi> A</p>
               <p>Second Evidence is this, <hi>Whomſoever God pardons he receives into Covenant with himſelf</hi>; all pardoned ſinners are Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters with God: God pardons no ſoul but ſuch an one as he brings into the Bond of the Covenant with himſelf, that is the way of the conveyance of the grace of God for the pardon of ſin, to bring the ſoul into the Bonds of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the Scripture is evident in this, that forgiveneſs of ſin is made a ſpecial fruit of the New Covenant, that is clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, Jer. 31.33. <hi>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a New Covenant with the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. what is the ſpecial end of that Covenant, <hi>I will forgive their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and remember their ſins no more</hi>; But how does that come in? it comes in by way of Covenant, <hi>I will make a New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>; I will firſt receive them into Covenant, and then they ſhall have the fruit of this New Covenant, that their ſins ſhall be forgiven, and their iniquities remembred no more: The New Covenant is a myſterie to moſt people, and yet it is a certain truth, the pardon of thy ſin, and thy eternal good depends upon it; thou art one that God has brought into Covenant with himſelf, if thou beeſt or ever ſhalt be pardoned, as God will manifeſt to thy ſoul, that he hath through his Son tyed and bound himſelf to thee to be thy God, that whereas before thou wer't departed from him, and an enemy to him, yet now he is pleaſed to call thee to enter into a ſecond Covenant after thou had'ſt broken the firſt, and wer't caſt off by reaſon of that breach, God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to enter into a ſecond Covenant with thee, to be thy God in and through his Son; thou art to come in and joyn in this Covenant; for to a full Covenant there muſt be aſſent on both ſides, there muſt be a mutual ingagement of either
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101278:89"/>
parties; when God reveals this to thy ſoul, that though thou be by nature an Enemy to me, and haſt broken the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that I made with the Children of men, and art caſt off, yet be it known unto thee O thou wretched ſoul, I am content to enter into another Covenant with thee; there is a ſecond Covenant for life and ſalvation that I have made with poor man through my Son, and I require that thou ſhould'ſt come in, and give up thy ſelf in an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to make me to be thy God, and to cloſe with me and my Son in whatſoever I call thee to, in whatſoever thou haſt or can'ſt do to give up thy ſelf to the power of me and my Son; this thou muſt ingage and tye thy ſelf unto, in the ſtrongeſt Bonds that can be; this is the nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: we know there were two Covenants, and all the good of mankind in the firſt Covenant depended on this, his clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the tearms of it: Now the tearms of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was, Do this and live; but that is broken, and we have loſt our ability: Now the ſecond Covenant is, Believe and live; and the ſoul that God pardons, he brings into the Bond of the ſecond Covenant; it is brought to come and give it ſelf up to the Lord, and to be content to bind it ſelf with all bonds unto God, that he and he only ſhall be my God, as I deſire him to be mine, and his grace and mercy to be mine; ſo all that I have or can do, ſhall be his; I ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up my ſelf, and ingage my ſoul to be his for ever, my Eſtate, Abilities, whatever I have, or can do, ſhall be his: Now put this to your own ſouls, you hope your ſins are pardoned: But hath God brought you into the Bonds of the Covenant? Hath God ingaged himſelf to you by his Word, <hi>to be your God?</hi> and on the other ſide, Are your hearts ingaged to him by the ſtrongeſt Bonds that can be; and if there be any other Bonds that are ſtronger to tye your ſouls to God; Can your ſouls ſay, the Lord knows I am content and willing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; and that you will account it your happineſs to be tyed in the ſtrongeſt Bonds that can be? if it be ſo with thee? Now peace be to thy ſoul, thy ſins are pardoned: as on the one ſide, God hath made a Covenant with thee, ſo on the other ſide he hath brought thee to be in Covenant with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101278:89"/>
him; then be of good comfort, thy ſins are pardoned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe whoſe ſins God hath pardoned, he hath tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated them into the Kingdom of his Son</hi>; the Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe things divers ways, and they have a diverſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in them: Now I ground this note out of Col. 1, 13, 14. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son</hi>; mark what follows, <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his Blood the forgiveneſs of ſins</hi>; forgiveneſs of ſin is the end of Gods tranſlating of us into the Kingdom of his dear Son, in giving Redemption through his Blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſin; ſo that whoſoever God hath given Redemption to through the Blood of Chriſt, even the forgiveneſs of ſin, that is, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin being the ſpecial part of the Redemption we have by the blood of Chriſt, ſuch an one is tranſlated into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God; <hi>What is that you will ſay?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This notes a great change that there muſt be upon thoſe that are pardoned,</hi> becauſe the Scripture expreſſes it thus, they are <hi>tranſlated into another Kingdom,</hi> a Kingdom of the Son of God, the dear Son of God; it is dear mercy of God that tranſlates a ſoul into the Kingdom of his dear Son; it ſeems naturally we are in another Kingdom, and have another King beſides the Son of God, and have another Soveraign; 'tis certain we are ſo naturally, we are under the power of Satan, and in his Kingdom; but now when God comes to redeem a ſoul, and grant forgiveneſs of ſin, he tranſlates out of that Kingdom, and ſuch a ſoul refuſes to be a ſubject to Satan any longer, or a ſervant to his luſt any longer: but now Chriſt ſhall be my King, the Son of God by whom I expect Reconciliation, he ſhall be my King, and his Laws ſhall rule in my heart, and his Scepter ſhall ſway in my ſoul; now no more ſhall my own thoughts, counſels, opinions, will, and affections rule me, but Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be ſet up upon the throne of my ſoul, and he ſhall be my King; I before was led (a poor vile ignorant wretch) by the cuſtoms of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and example of others, and what they required of me by their laws in the matters of his worſhip; but now Chriſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101278:90"/>
ſhall be my King, I will expect my law from him; and all obedience I do to man, it ſhall be in order to this Chriſt my King; this is a tranſlation into the Kingdom of God, when the ſoul feels the power of Chriſt ruling in him, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaying him, and the ſoul looks up to Chriſt for its protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and proviſion, and deſires above all things in the world, to ſet up Jeſus Chriſt as his King in all the ways of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, both in his own heart, and the world too, and longs to hear that voyce, when it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and Saviour J<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſus Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever:</hi> Thus thoſe that have redempt on through the blood of Chriſt, even the forgiveneſs of ſins, they are tranſlated into the Kingdom of his dear Son; and as the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>They have the Kingdom of God within them</hi>; that is an expreſſion of the Holy Ghoſt in the Goſpel. Now this you are to examine your hearts upon; What of the Kingdom of Chriſt you have within you? Do you live and walk as one that hath the Kingdom of Chriſt within you? Is Chriſt as King and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign over your thoughts, words and actions? And do you look to him for the law of your thoughts, words and actions, and walk before him as your Soveraign Lord, depending on him to know his will continually, and fear and honour him as a King: If the Kingdom of Chriſt be in you, that is, if the Goſpel have an effectual work upon you; for the Goſpel in the power of it is ordinarily expreſt by the Kingdom of Heaven; when the Word comes to any place, the Kingdom of Heaven is ſaid to come; it would take up a great deal of time, to ſhew wherein the Holy Ghoſt calls the Goſpel the Kingdom of Heaven; but it is called the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe it is the Kingdom of Chriſt that is Lord from Heaven, and Chriſt rules in it by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: But now, though it be the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Kingly power of Chriſt be in the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, yet this does not prevail upon all ſorts; it is like a net that is caſt into the Sea, the meaning of it ſeems to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but that the preaching of the Goſpel among a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of People, is like a net caſt into the Sea, wherein ſome
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101278:90"/>
are catcht, and others remain worldly, filthy, and good for nothing, that is the meaning of the Text, and not any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at all for mixt Communions; but only thus; where the Preaching of the Goſpel is, there are ſome fiſhes good and worthy to be received, and others that are to be caſt out: Now, as there is an external Kingdom, ſo there is an intern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kingdom of Chriſt within our hearts; Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſets up his Throne in the hearts of every man and woman whoſe ſins are pardoned, that is a certain truth; and this day in the Name of God I pronounce unto you, that if your ſin be pardoned, Jeſus Chriſt hath ſet up his Throne in your hearts; and if you find any other Throne and Lord but Chriſt to rule you, know from God that your ſouls <hi>are yet in the gall of bitterneſs and the bond of iniquity,</hi> and your ſins are not pardoned; but that ſoul, who in the Preaching of the Goſpel can ſay, Bleſſed be God I have felt Chriſt come into my heart, and prevailed upon me; and now Chriſts Laws are the Laws I deſire to be ruled by; God knows I know but little of them, but I will labour to underſtand them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; therefore I come this day, that I might know more of the Law of God, and that Jeſus Chriſt might rule more powerfully in me than ever he hath done; if this be wrought in thee, I ſay unto thee in the Name of Chriſt, be of good comfort, thy ſins are pardoned, God will ſhew good unto thee when this world is ended; thou art one that Jeſus Chriſt hath brought into his Kingdom, and ſet up his Throne in thy heart, and therefore thou may'ſt be aſſured that he will take thee at laſt into his everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Where God forgives, he gives much</hi>; giving fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows forgiving; God never forgives any, but he gives much to that ſoul whom he forgives: As in that caſe when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preacht the Doctrine of forgiveneſs and pardon of ſin, the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them; ſo certainly, where the Preaching of pardon of ſin hath power through the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel over a ſoul; God gives much to that ſoul; and there are three things eſpecially that God gives pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently unto the ſoul whom he pardons, which have all been mentioned before in opening the bleſſedneſs of pardon of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101278:91"/>
ſin; and therefore I will but mention them now to ſtrengthen this note of tryal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hath God forgiven thee? then he hath given his Spirit to inlighten thee in the great myſteries of Salvation</hi>; thou pleadeſt thou art ignorant, and art not Book-learned; if God have ſo great a favour for thee as to pardon thy ſin, he will give thee underſtanding in the myſteries of the Goſpel, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. where God pardons ſin, they ſhall have this mercy <hi>to be taught of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God will give this unto thee, he will write his Law in thy heart</hi>; that is, he will work in thy heart a ſutable frame and diſpoſition to his Law; that thy heart and the Law of God ſhall be like two copies, that have the ſame things in them, and vary not one title from one another; there ſhall be a ſutableneſs between thy heart and the Law of God; not only to do that which God requires, becauſe I muſt do it; but becauſe I find it ſutable to the new nature beſtowed on me: he will write his Law in the heart; and therefore I pronounce before the Lord this day again, that whoſoever has his ſin pardoned, and his iniquities forgiven, that God hath writ his Law in the heart of that man or woman by the finger of his own Spirit; that heart of thine that was as a heart of ſtone, God will write his own Law thereon, as he did on the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that Moſes broke</hi>; though always thou haſt not a real ſight of it, yet ſuch a thing is there, and is a comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the pardon of thy ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God gives healing mercies to cleanſe thee from thy ſin,</hi> Jer. 33.8. <hi>I will cleanſe them from their iniquities, and pardon all their ſins</hi>; cleanſing from ſin and pardon of ſin, they ever go together; if God pardon thy ſin, he cleanſes thee from ſin; do not look therefore only after pardoning mercy, but likewiſe after cleanſing mercy; thoſe whom God hath joyned together, let no man put aſunder; pardoning and cleanſing God hath put together: God may beſtow other mercies, as health, ſtrength, and ſucceſs in outward things without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; but never cleanſing from ſin without pardon of it: and therefore if thou findeſt thy heart cleanſed, Peace be to thy ſoul, thy ſins are forgiven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:101278:91"/>Fifthly, <hi>Beſides theſe, thoſe whom God pardons he puts a glory upon them</hi>; there is a glory put upon all pardoned ſinners; they are indeed glorious creatures in the eyes of God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, yea, and there is a glory put upon them that the Saints of God are able to ſee; perhaps that glory is not ſeen by the purblind eye of the world that are in darkneſs; but thoſe that have their eyes in their heads, may ſee a glory put upon every ſoul that is pardoned, and for that, that Text is clear, Rom. 8.30. <hi>Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called: and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified: and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified:</hi> 'tis not ſpoken only of that glory the Saints ſhall have in the higheſt Heavens, when they ſhall be in glory with Chriſt; but of that glory God puts upon the ſoul in this world, 'tis not ſaid, them he will glorifie; but them he hath alſo glorified: there is no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſoul but is a glorified ſoul, this is a certain truth in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, <hi>That at that inſtant any ſoul is juſtified, at that inſtant he is glorified</hi>; in <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.9. there is an expreſſion ſomewhat like unto that, and it follows upon pardon of ſin; <hi>And it ſhall be to me a Name of joy, a praiſe, and an honour before all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon Earth,</hi> &amp;c. that is, I will put glory upon them, and ſo they ſhall be to me a name of joy, a praiſe, and an honour before all the Nations in the world: you will ſay, How is that? What is the glory of a juſtified ſoul? certainly the ſoul that is juſtified is glorious; God puts a glory on it by thoſe glorious graces of his Holy Spirit that he endows the ſoul withal; there is no juſtified ſoul but hath the glorious graces of the Holy Spirit put preſently upon it, and ſo 'tis beautiful and glorious, yea the only glorious object that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt delights in in all the world: take the pooreſt ſoul in the world, God putting his Image upon it, there is a greater glory and luſtre on that ſoul than is on all the Heavens and the Earth beſides; take all other creatures in their greateſt glory, and God ſees not ſo much glory on them as on any one ſoul whom he hath juſtified; for ſo it is, Holineſs and the graces of Gods Spirit are called the glory of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Rom. 3.23, 24. <hi>For we have all ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God</hi>; What is it to be deprived of the glory
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101278:92"/>
of God, but the loſs of that Image of God that man was made in: but when a man is juſtified, that glory of God is put upon him a freſh, upon his heart, his underſtanding, his will and affections, and that makes the Lord to delight to dwell with thee, converſe and have Communion with thee, becauſe of that glory that he hath put upon thee; ſo there is a glory alſo in the life and converſation; for on every ſoul that God juſtifies, there comes preſently a new luſtre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their life and converſation: All thoſe that have lived in horrible wickedneſs and baſe courſes; now when they are changed, and they manifeſt the graces of the Spirit of God ſhining in their converſation through the whole courſe of their lives, in meekneſs, patience, humility, heavenly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and the like; there is a luſtre on their converſations, to thoſe that are able to judge of it, they ſee it; and the world many times is dazled with it, they ſee a glory on them, and are convinc't, that certainly there is a work of God upon theſe men; and in their good moods they are wiſhing to die their deaths, and that their ends might be like theirs: the pooreſt ſervant, or child in a family, that was vile before, yet being juſtified, there is a luſtre in their converſations that convinces Parents and Governours, and makes them ſee an apparent difference between what they are now, and what they were before; though they contemn it, yet they know that God will own that difference that he has made to be his own glory, and will declare it one day that this was the thing that was glorious in his eyes: And therefore now would you know whether you are juſtified; Are you glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? What glory of God is come into your hearts, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in your lives and converſations? Can you ſay, my life is ſo, though I have many weakneſſes, yet I hope ſomething of the glory of God appears in me? for ſo it muſt be; there is no ſoul God juſtifies, but God inables him to live ſo, as the glory of God ſhines in the converſation of ſuch a one: Now if theſe things be ſo, what cauſe have you to fear, you are not a juſtified perſon? but for the preſent, many times it doth not appear; for moſt of you darken the glory of God in your lives: you that are juſtified ſhould ſhew it forth more in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101278:92"/>
your converſation among all with whom you have to do, and then what a beauty and Evidence of your Juſtification would it be unto you.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Thoſe whom God pardons, he makes them know what pardon means</hi>; thou hopeſt thy ſins are pardoned; Doſt thou underſtand, and know what hath been ſaid about it? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe whom God pardons, he cauſes admiring thoughts in the ſoul of the excellency of this bleſſedneſs of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin; the ſoul is taken with the admiration of <hi>three things.</hi> Firſt, <hi>It admires at the freeneſs and the riches of Gods grace.</hi> Secondly, <hi>At the price that was paid for pardon.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>It admires at the wonderful good it is brought into,</hi> and that which the ſoul receives by this bleſſedneſs of the pardon of ſin; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things God may beſtow on men and women, and they know not the worth of them, and do not mind God in them; but when God beſtows pardon of ſin, he makes the ſoul have admiring thoughts of it, and to know what it is, Jer. 33.9. <hi>And it ſhall be to me a Name of joy, a praiſe, and honour, and they ſhall fear and tremble, for all the goodneſs and proſperity that I procure unto it</hi>; certainly if others ſhall do it, much more themſelves; thoſe whom God pardons he beſtows ſuch mercies upon, as that the ſoul ſhall even ſtand amazed with a trembling heart and an amazed ſpirit, to behold all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the Lord ſhews to it: Now, have your hearts been taken with it? you may know much of your Evidences if your hearts have been taken with admiring thoughts of it; for certainly when God pardons ſin, he doth it to magnifie his grace, and ſet out to Men and Angels in the infiniteneſs of it, what his grace can do to poor ſouls; if this be Gods end, as certainly it is, then it muſt needs be that thoſe whom God pardons, he gives ſuch grace as ſhall cauſe the ſoul that it ſhall have admiring thoughts of it; Has thy ſoul ſeen ſo much of the grace of God, that it admires at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs of it? be of good comfort, thy ſins are pardoned.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>The more aſſurance God gives of pardon, the more the heart melts before God in mourning for the ſins that God has pardoned,</hi> according to the manifeſtation of Gods mercy in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101278:93"/>
pardoning, ſo doth the ſoul by the work of Gods grace melt in holy mourning, even for thoſe ſins that God has pardoned: many think they muſt mourn for ſin to get pardon, but when they are pardoned, Why ſhould they mourn then? I have ſpoken to that before, that many mourn to get pardon; but I ſay, they mourn, becauſe they are pardoned: I mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it thus, in this evidence I give of pardon of ſin; that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree of knowledge the ſoul hath of pardon of ſin, the heart melts before God for all ſins that are pardoned, the 51. <hi>Pſal.</hi> is exceeding remarkable, <hi>David</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments his ſin exceeding bitterly, but mark the <hi>Title of that Pſalm, To the chief Muſitian, a Pſalm of David, when Nathan the Prophet came unto him; after he had gone in to Bathſheba:</hi> Now would you know what <hi>Nathan</hi> did when he came unto <hi>David,</hi> you ſhall find if you read the ſtory of <hi>David</hi>'s Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Murther, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. Chap. it was to bring the news unto <hi>David</hi> of the pardon of his ſin; firſt <hi>Nathan</hi> convinces him of his ſin, that he ſhould do it <hi>before Iſrael, and before the Sun,</hi> and having convinc't him, he ſays further, <hi>the Lord hath put away thy ſin:</hi> Now a ſecure heart might go away, and ſay, all is well, I ſhall not dye, God hath pardoned my ſin, I need not be troubled any more about that matter: But mark the Pſalmiſt how he cries out to God, <hi>Have mercy O Lord upon me, and blot out all my tranſgreſſions, waſh me, purge me</hi>; and then he prays for reſtoring mercies for his broken bones, and then cries out for further aſſurance; the very grace of God that <hi>Nathan</hi> brought to him of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his ſin, that very grace of God did melt and break his heart ſo much the more; after God had ſent to him the pardon of his ſin, he mourned more than ever before; we never read that <hi>David</hi> was ſo much troubled for his ſin as in this 51. <hi>Pſal.</hi> that was after <hi>Nathan,</hi> had come unto him: Now if you find that at that time when God is pleas'd to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you in the Miniſtry of the Word, or in private to declare unto you the pardon of your ſin, and to give you the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Evidence of it, that then your hearts are moſt devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mourn for them, and to melt before God, Be of good comfort, thy ſins are pardoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:101278:93"/>Eightly, <hi>Another note is this, that according to the degree of pardon of ſin, ſo all other graces grow</hi>; the knowledge and aſſurance of Gods love in Chriſt in the pardon of ſin, it cauſes all other graces to grow proportionably, as you have it in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.19. about the knowledge of the love of God in Chriſt; mark the connection, he deſires <hi>That they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with all Saints what is the height, and depth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge, and be filled with all the fulneſs of God</hi>; What is the love of Chriſt? the love of Chriſt is the procuring cauſe of the forgiveneſs of ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before God the Father; and when you know this, this will fill you with all the fulneſs of God: Mark, firſt <hi>It brings God in to the ſoul</hi>; And ſecondly, <hi>Fills the ſoul with God</hi>; And thirdly, <hi>Fills the ſoul with the fulneſs of God</hi>; And fourthly, <hi>Fills the ſoul with all the fulneſs of God</hi>; when you come to know the love of God in Chriſt, if any thing in the world will fill the ſoul with all the fulneſs of God, this will: many will ſay, they hope their ſins are pardoned; Do you ſo? then you <hi>know the love of God in Chriſt</hi>; for this is a ſpecial work of the love of God <hi>in Chriſt</hi>; to pardon ſin; now the Apoſtel ſays, when you come to know this, you come to be filled with all the fulneſs of God; What is the fulneſs of God? as faith increaſes with the reſt of the graces, ſo you grow fuller and fuller in Gods fulneſs; and ſo you grow more into a fuller aſſurance of pardon of ſin: now the ſoul can ſay, as I find more aſſurance of the love of God in his Son, ſo I find my ſoul more filled with this grace of the fulneſs of God Alas, when I was under the Law, God and I were ſtrangers, I felt little of God in me; but now I begin to know the love of God in the Goſpel, I begin to have my ſoul filled with fulneſs of God, not with chaff and droſs and filthy things, which heretofore my thoughts, will, and affections were filled withal; but now 'tis otherwiſe with me, my ſoul is now filled with all the fulneſs of God; certainly that ſoul that can ſay thus, may well go a way with that word of Chriſt ſpoken to the woman, Luk, 7.50. <hi>Go in peace, thy faith hath ſaved thee,</hi> Rom. 5.1. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of pardon of ſin, <hi>being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God</hi>; that is, God

What knowledge is this? It's this, that we are juſtified by Faith and ſo come to have peace with God; How does this cauſe the heart to be inlarged? we rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God, and not only ſo, but we are ſtrengthened and can glory in tribulation; our hearts grow up to that ſtrength, that whatſoever tribulations we meet withal, we are able to bear them with patience, and not only ſo, but to glory in them, we not only grow up to bear that which many cannot, but to rejoyce in them, that is more, and then to glory is above rejoycing: Now, Do you find that the aſſurance that you have of the love of God, brings ſtrength in to your ſoul, to inable you <hi>to rejoyce in hope of the glory to come?</hi> as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, let what will become of us for the preſent, what though the world ſcorn us, hate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute us, yet we rejoyce in hope of the glory that is to come; and this makes us <hi>glory in tribulation; knowing, that tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, works patience; patience, experience; and experience, hope:</hi> Here's a working of ſeveral graces together, and this may help many a poor ſoul; O ſays the ſoul at ſuch a time, I had a great deal of aſſurance of pardon of ſin, and much joy thereupon; But have not Hypocrites joy? yes certainly, a Hypocrite may have wonderful raviſhments of ſpirit, and flaſhes of pardon of ſin, but yet there is ſomewhat wanting in other graces; but how ſhall I know that my aſſurance of pardon of ſin is right? thus, according to the degree you have of aſſurance of pardon, you have an anſwerable degree in the growth of other graces, as Humility, Patience, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs, Self-denyal, and the reſt, according as your faith grows, ſo you have a proportionable growth in all other graces; faith is as the root, and the more ſap there is in the root, the more will the branches grow: thoſe people that are ſo full of aſſurance, and never doubted, as they ſay; but as for other graces they are empty, as the Fear of God,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101278:94"/>
Meekneſs, Patience, Self-denyal, Heavenly-mindedneſs and the like; certainly, if thy faith be ſo high, and thy other graces ſo low, thou haſt much cauſe to fear thy faith is not right, 'tis not <hi>the faith of Gods Elect,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks, it is not <hi>pretious faith</hi>; for according to the degree you have of that, all other graces will grow; you hope that your ſins are pardoned, How come you by it? the ſoul that hath true pardon of ſin, hath fetch't it from Heaven in a right way, in Gods own way; How is that? it is on this wi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine now, Have you fetcht out your pardon through the way of the Goſpel, that the ſoul by a mighty act of faith hath been willing to venture its ſelf and its eternal ſtation on the Son of God? Have you look't on Chriſt as a mighty Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as one able to ſave you? then you have acted faith in a Goſpel way, and your ſins are pardoned: Again, Are you pardoned? then you are ſealed, that you heard likewiſe of; there is the Broad Seal of Heaven that ſtamps the Image of God upon the ſoul, as the Image of the King is on the Seal of the Kingdom; ſo the Image of God, the Broad Seal of Heaven is ſtampt upon the ſoul, which I mention that you may make uſe of it in examination.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>Whomſoever God pardons, there will be an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able work in thy ſoul unto the work of God in juſtifying thee</hi>; as in Election and Vocation, ſo in Juſtification; How is that? thus, that as God notwithſtanding all thy ſin, accepts of thee to his grace and love; ſo notwithſtanding all the trouble and afflictions that are in Gods ways, thou wilt accept of God and his ways; he accepts of thy ſoul not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thy ſin, thou wilt accept of him and his wayes notwithſtanding all evils and afflictions that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company

company them; there are woful evils of ſin that accompany thy ſoul, yet God will accept of thee; ſo there are great evils in the ways of God, Afflictions that accompany them, yet thou wilt accept of them and think it reaſonable: What, ſhall God accept of my ſoul, notwithſtanding all the evil of ſin; and ſhall not I accept of Gods ways, notwithſtanding all the evil of affliction and trouble? certainly, the ſoul that is pardoned, cannot but anſwer God ſo far as this; Will God juſtifie me notwithſtanding my ſin? I will juſtifie God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any trouble, affliction, difficulty, or ſufferings that may befal me in his ways, and I will juſtifie the ways of God; this is both an Evidence and a duty; God juſtifies our ſouls though they be very ſinful; we have cauſe to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Gods ways, though they be very troubleſom; if thou doſt not ſo, thou art none of Gods child; for <hi>wiſdom is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of her Children:</hi> thou hopeſt thy ſins are pardoned, and that God will juſtifie thee; and wilt not thou juſtifie him? Does not thy ſin hinder Gods grace to thee; and ſhall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affliction hinder thy glorifying God? O man! thou haſt too vile a heart, and too baſe a ſpirit, to be one of thoſe that God hath pardoned; if thou wert a child of Wiſdom, and one whom God hath pardoned, as God hath juſtified thee, ſo thou wilt juſtifie God: This note may meet with thoſe that in company hear Miniſters and the ways of God cryed out againſt, and yet have not a word to ſpeak to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God, perhaps Gentlemen and others ſpake ill of Gods ways, and thou ſtandeſt ſpeaking, and haſt not a word to ſay for God and his ways; Doſt thou think God hath juſtified thee, and doſt thou hear God and his People, and his Word reproached, and thou haſt not a heart to juſtifie God?</p>
               <p>Tenthly and laſtly, <hi>Thoſe whom God pardons and forgives, he puts in them a merciful frame of heart to forgive others; and that upon Divine grounds</hi>: there is a kind of natural forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: many will forgive, but it is as a Heathen forgives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it is a ſhame for many that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, that they do not go ſo far; but you muſt forgive in a ſpiritual way, for that is the way that accompanies padon of ſin, to forgive, becauſe I have had more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101278:95"/>
ſuch a one hath offended me; but how much more have I offended the Lord; and if the Lord forgive me, ought not I to forgive him? you know in the Goſpel he that had ſo many Talents forgiven him, and afterwards went and took his Brother by the throat, how ill the Lord took it, that having forgiven him ſo much, he ſhould exact of his Brother the utmoſt farthing; Hath God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee thy ſin, which had he not, it would have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly chained thee in torments, and wilt not thou forgive? for as it is an Evidence, ſo it is a duty and a part of Prayer in that divine Directory called the Lords Prayer, Matth. 6. <hi>Forgive us as we forgive</hi>; and in another place it runs thus, <hi>forgive, for we forgive</hi>; therefore thou can'ſt have no Evidence that God hath forgiven thy ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and pardoned thy treſpaſſes, except others be in thy thoughts forgiven too: I might have given divers Scriptures, but I mention it as a duty, that you that have any knowledg of your ſin pardoned, would make this as a ground to forgive your Brethren; ſay, Alas poor wretch, hath God forgiven me; was there ever ſuch a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my brother and me, as there was between God and me; and hath God forgiven, and ſhall not I forgive my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? It is impoſſible a ſoul ſhould be made acquainted with the rich mercy of God in forgiveneſs of ſin, and have not a meek ſpirit to forgive his brother: Nothing can take away the rugged ſowrneſs and rigidneſs of one man towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the Oyl of Gods grace in pardoning of ſin; and that coming once into the ſoul, makes the ſoul to be of a ſweet, mild, gentle, kind and tender frame: Obſerve this, you that have rugged natures, you ſay it is nature, and you cannot help it, if any thing change it, it is the mercy of God in pardoning thy ſin; is there not ſo much in the grace of God in pardoning thy ſin, as to change that rugged nature of thine? certainly there is: elſe thou haſt little hope that thy ſin is pardoned; therefore if God have pardoned thee, thou muſt go and do ſo likewiſe.

But there is one thing more, that is very meet to annex to all that hath been ſaid for; without that, I am afraid there are many to whom the conſolation of this Text and Point belongs to, will go away with little comfort, becauſe they know not how to apply them; and that is to give ſome rules how to make uſe of theſe ſigns, and be able to apply them; and by the ſame rules you may come to know any other notes of Trial concerning your ſpiritual Eſtate, and to make uſe of them in any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular whatſoever.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of the Rules how to apply the Evidences of Pardon of Sin.</head>
               <p>IT is a matter of great concernment to us, to try whether our ſins are forgiven; for in times of danger our hearts are ready to ſink; but the Evidence of this, that our ſins are forgiven will hold up our hearts in the midſt of the greateſt dangers whatſoever; if Heaven and Earth ſhould meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if I have aſſurance of this, for ſo it follows after <hi>David</hi> had pronounc't him <hi>bleſſed whoſe ſins were forgiven,</hi> Verſ. 6. <hi>Surely in the floods of great waters they ſhall not come nigh unto him</hi>; there may be floods of great waters: but he that hath his ſins forgiven, <hi>God ſhall preſerve him and compaſs him about with ſongs of deliverance</hi>; but they that have their ſins compaſs them about, ſhall have horrour and terrour to compaſs them about; but ſays <hi>David,</hi> having aſſurance his ſins were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, <hi>Thou art my hiding place, and thou ſhalt compaſs me about</hi>; therefore if your hearts cloſe with thoſe Evidences given, you may have comfort in the <hi>great water-floods, God will be a hiding place unto you</hi>; it concerns very much to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to put this out of doubt, and not to put it off to a ſick-bed, or death-bed time of examination; but now to thoſe Evidences there is another thing, which is of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Point, and that is to give ſome rules how to make uſe of thoſe or all other Evidences that ſhall be given at any time for tryal of any: Eſpecially for the tryal of our ſtates in point of Juſtification or Sanctification, but they will be helpful to the uſe of any other Evidences whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt is this</hi> (that you may be able to apply thoſe rules of Trial and Evidences given) <hi>though you cannot find them all, yet if you find but any one of them, you may receive comfort from that, though you feel not the reſt</hi>; you may be aſſured that the reſt are there: Many a ſoul, many times hears Evidences of the happy condition in point of pardon of ſin; and it may be,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101278:97"/>
there is one, two, or three, that they can catch hold on; but there are ſome others they cannot take hold of them: if thou findeſt but one of them in thy heart, though thou can'ſt not feel or ſee the other, yet God doth ſee the other to be there within, though they be not made ſo ſenſible to you; and therefore ſoul take hold of that which you can ſee or feel, and be aſſured the other are there, though they are not ſeen; if thou can'ſt take hold of one linck of a chain, and all the other be faſtened to it, thou may'ſt be able to draw the whole chain unto thee; for by taking hold of one link thou takeſt hold of the whole, though thou toucheſt not the other; ſo in the work of Gods graces, they are as a link united to one another, and if you can lay hold of one link you may be aſſured of the other, although you ſee them not; it is with many in this point as it is with ſome ignorant man, the Phyſitian tells him, he muſt take ſuch a thing that muſt have theſe and theſe ingredients in it; and when the Apothecary has mingled all, it may be but one of theſe things can be ſeen in the colour and outward appearance; perhaps ſome one ſyrup may take up all the colour in the outward part; and when it is brought to him, ſays he, I muſt have ſo many Ingredients in it, and I ſee but one; I, but though you ſee but one, yet there may be the efficacy of all in it, though but one give the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; ſo it is with the graces of Gods Spirit, though at the preſent ſome one appears, yet there may be the efficacy and power of them all in the ſoul, though there appear but one; perhaps it is in this caſe, as among many ingredients you can ſee and taſt but one, yet there may be the power of twenty there, though neither ſeen nor taſted; ſo it is with the work of God in the ſoul, ſometimes it may be, that there is but one grace to be ſeen, taſted, or felt, and yet where that one is, there are all the other; ſo that, that is one rule, when you look for Evidences and Signs, if you can find but one in your ſouls, all are there; as it is in ſin, where one ſin hath Dominion over the ſoul, though the others be not ſeen, yet we are to know, that other ſins have dominion over the ſoul too; though ſome men live under the ſlavery of one ſin more than another, as one man under the power of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101278:97"/>
Covetouſneſs, another under the power of Ambition, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſin; this man may be thought to be under the power of but one ſin, but the truth is, he is a ſlave to all ſin, every natural man that is out of Chriſt, is under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of every ſin, he is a ſlave to the Devil in every ſin; but by reaſon of the conſtitution of his body, and for ſome outward reſpects, he may refrain from ſome particular ſins that do not ſo well ſuit with him, whereas if it would ſerve for his own ends and purpoſes, he could as well commit any ſin as that one; this is a certain truth, <hi>Whoſoever makes not Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of every ſin, he makes Conſcience of none</hi>; though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from the practice of ſome others, it is not out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but for by-ends; therefore he that is under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of one ſin, is under the power of every ſin: Many think all men are ſinners, and for their parts they have but a few; ſuch a ſin I cannot leave, but I am free from all others; Doſt thou keep from all ſin but one? God will find thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of every ſin, and God will charge thee at the Tribunal as under the power of all ſin; ſo now on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Gods people are mightily troubled that they cannot find the work of Gods graces in all of them; ſuch an one they find, but they want it in another, becauſe it is not ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſtirring as the other; but as the truth is certain on one ſide, of the wicked; ſo it's true on the other ſide of the godly; that where there is one ſin there is every ſin; ſo where there is one grace, there is all grace; there is the power of godlineſs in every grace where there's one grace; that is the firſt rule to help us in making uſe of the Evidences before given. The</p>
               <p>Second rule is this, <hi>When ever we have found any one Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, upon ſerious examination, in the preſence of God, and now it appears not poſitively to the contrary at the preſent, but thou art meerly dubious of thoſe things that heretofore thou haſt felt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou doſt not feel them now, in this caſe we may and ſhould have recourſe to what God has wrought heretofore,</hi> and build upon the former workings of Gods Spirit upon us; true it is, when we come to give Evidences in our Miniſtry of thoſe that have grace, we may meet at ſuch a time with them as
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101278:98"/>
that they have ſenſe of nothing, and in ſuch a condition as that they are not able to know their own hearts, nor feel any workings upon them: Now, if it be meerly from want of ſenſe, and that the contrary poſitive evil appear not, but only the want of feeling of what thou had'ſt and felt hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; thou art to have recourſe <hi>to the days of old, as David</hi> often ſpeaks that he would <hi>remember the days of old</hi>; it may be you will ſay, ſome Hypocrites have thought they have been in this condition, they have had many ſlaſhes, and yet they have proved naught, how can we have recourſe to what was before when God did work upon me, <hi>I can indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when God did draw my heart, and then I thought I could have cloſed with any Evidence out of the Word, I felt ſuch workings in my heart, but I might do all that and yet all be but in hypocriſie.</hi> I anſwer, that certainly the bare want of ſenſe is not ground enough for me to think that all was in hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; for this, conſider, if I groan under it as under an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and would fain feel thoſe former manifeſtations I had formerly, and that I can take little comfort in my preſent caſe, and that my ſoul is continually longing and panting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the workings of Gods grace that I heretofore had; if this be ſo, and that there is nothing to the contrary, thou falleſt not off to ſin, or to the world to ſatisfie thy ſoul in ſinful ways, and that thy heart is yet panting after God; if it be thus with thee, thou may'ſt take the comfort of what thou had'ſt before, and feed upon it as Proviſion laid up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand for thy ſoul, as if thou had'ſt it preſent. But Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites that fall off from the viſitations of Gods Spirit, they fall not off only to a want of ſenſe of thoſe former movings and workings of the Spirit, but their hearts come to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſomething elſe, and they take up with ſome other contentments; and 'tis not a want of feeling only, of what they had heretofore, but their hearts run out from God into other ways of ſin and wickedneſs, ſo it is with Hypocrites, but thou haſt this teſtimony, that it is not ſo with thee, that although thou doſt want the preſent ſenſe of the work of God upon thee, yet thy heart longs after God, and thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied in this condition, and 'tis the greateſt affliction that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101278:98"/>
ever befel thee, and there is nothing elſe that thou lets thy heart run out unto, but thou art longing to get thy heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that bleſſed frame that thou waſt in heretofore; then certainly <hi>peace be unto thee</hi>; thou art to look back upon what thou haſt had heretofore, and wait upon God for his return again, for he will come, and thy ſoul ſhall rejoyce again in him; <hi>As that Martyr Mr.</hi> Glover, <hi>a little before he ſuffer'd, the Spirit of God ſeem'd to leave him, and he was in extream darkneſs, and had no feeling of any Evidence of Gods love to him, yet he was to dye the next day, and all his Evidences were loſt in his own apprehenſion, yet his friends told him, that God would appear, and deſired him to give them ſome ſign, if God did come unto him; that night he was in darkneſs, and until the Officers came to carry him to the Stake, he had yet no ſenſe or evidence of Gods love, but when he was tyed to the Stake, he cryed out, He is come, He is come:</hi> ſo that you muſt not argue, becauſe you have no preſent ſenſe, that therefore you have no evidence of your good condition; but if you have had it heretofore, you may build upon it that your ſtate is good, although you have no preſent ſenſe; that is the ſecond rule.</p>
               <p>The third rule is this, <hi>To help you how to make uſe of ſigns, when you would put your ſelves on tryal, you muſt take heed you do not caſt your Eſtates for the tryal of your ſelves on times of temptations</hi>; judg not of your eſtates by what you find and feel in times of temptation, for they are very unfit times to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine your condition upon a tryal then, as when tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are exceeding ſtrong, and horrour and fear comes into the ſoul; and perhaps ſome hear may know what I mean, when I ſpeak of horrour and fear coming in ſtrongly upon them, then it is a time that you had rather need to call upon God, and fall down upon your knees to Prayer, then to look to the tryal and examination of your ſelves at that time: It is with many in this caſe as it hath been with ſome that have been ſtruck with horrour of death before the Judge, and have had the Book given them to read, though they have been good Scholars, and able to read before, yet when the horrour of death hath been ſo upon them they have not been able to read one word; and ſo it is with many of Gods
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101278:99"/>
children in times of ſtrong temptations, they are not able to read their Evidences; as Children when their eyes are blear'd and blinded, give them the Book and they cannot read thereon: ſo when your hearts are under great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and afflictions, this is not a time of trial; then by the way, if it be not for a godly man, much leſs for a wicked man: many wicked men put it off to the day of death, and never ſo much as put themſelves to trial till horrour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or fears of death put them upon it; it is an ill time for Gods people to try themſelves then: Suppoſe you would weigh Gold, you will not do it in a ſtorm or wind; the trial of our eſtate is like the weighing of gold; <hi>for we are to weigh our ſelves by the ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> that we may know whether we ſhall be weight when God comes to weigh us; for every ſoul muſt be weighed, and wo be to thoſe to whom God ſhall ſay as he did <hi>to Belſhazzar, when the hand-writing appeared upon the wall, it was ſo terrible to him, that his knees ſmote one againſt another</hi>; But what was that? <hi>Thou art weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ballance, and art found too light:</hi> ſuch a hand will many find one day: Poor ſoul that thoughteſt thy ſelf in a good condition, and that thy ſins were pardoned; thou art weighed in the ballance, and art found too light; therefore it concerns you now to weigh your ſelves in the ballance of the Sanctuary: when you weigh gold, you muſt not hold the Scales in the mid'ſt of wind, ſtorms, and tempeſt that hurries the ballance up and down; but it muſt be in ſuch a place that you may hold them ſteadily that nothing may ſtir them; for in the wind the lighter may be blown down, and the heavieſt uppermoſt; but if you hold them in a ſtill place, you may try to a grain: ſo the Soul of man is like the Scales in the wind, in a time of temptation thou wilt have enough to come in to turn the ballance, lift it up, and make thee ſeem too light; and therefore when you would weigh your condition, do it when your hearts are compoſed, and you are your ſelves; when your hearts are quiet, then lay your ſouls to the ballance: many weigh their hearts in a time when trouble and affliction is upon their ſpirits, but they cannot do it, all they do then is nothing; there are but two
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101278:99"/>
things then to be done, either to open your condition to ſome or other that may help you; or elſe fall down upon your knees in Prayer to God, to get help from him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you under, and deliver you from the temptations that are upon you: but then 'tis no time for a man or woman to try themſelves, in times of ſtrong temptations, when it may be ſaid, a man or woman then is ſcarſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The fourth Rule for trial of your Eſtates is this, <hi>That when you find the Word on your ſide in any thing, never let go your hold of the Word,</hi> when you are perſwaded the Word ſpeaks well of your ſide in ſuch or ſuch a thing, never do any thing againſt it; as we muſt not receive any comfort but by the Word, ſo we muſt not reject any comforts but by the Word; ſome may ſay, I find ſomething in the Word that makes for me, but I am afraid I am not thus and thus qualified; but do you find any thing in the Word that gives you ground to think ſo? we muſt reſt upon the Word both ways, as we muſt not receive any thing to build our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts on, but it muſt be from the Word; ſo we muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing to trouble us but it muſt be from the Word; it muſt be the Word muſt wound men; for the Conſciences of men and women are under the power of no creature, but the Word: Now as there is no power in any creature in the world to raiſe a dejected ſoul, and to comfort a troubled Conſcience truly but the Word; So the people of God are to know, that they are ſo above the power of all other things, that nothing in the World ſhould trouble them but the Word only: as they ſhould account it a weak vain thing to reſt in the opinion of others for the comfort of their ſouls, that are in a good condition by what they find out of the Word; ſo they ſhould account it a vain thing to reſt on their own conceits in time of trouble, or in the ſaying of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, beſides what they have out of the Word; the ſoul ſays, I am affraid my ſtate is not good; <hi>But O my ſoul, is there any thing in the Word that ſays thus; that they that are thus and thus are not pardoned:</hi> As I muſt not conclude I am pardoned, but muſt bring ſomething out of the Word that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101278:100"/>
ſays it, ſo I muſt not conclude my ſtate is bad without the Word, ſay ſo too; but I find many diſtempers and many wandrings in my ſoul; give me leave to ask you this; where doth Gods Word ſay that ſuch a man that hath a great many wandering thoughts is not juſtified? where does the Word of God ſay that a heart that is under the remainder of ſome corruptions, and the ſoul labours under them as much as under any burden in the world; where does the Word ſay that that ſoul is not juſtified? many people in the caſe of trouble of Conſcience, although they have ſome evidences and good ground out of the Word for them, yet will have many fears and doubts becauſe of the remainder of ſuch and ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in them; but now the ground of their doubts is their own fears, and nothing out of the Word; and ſo when any ſpeaks and applies the Word unto them, they cannot ſay but it is ſuitable to their condition, and that God hath ſhewn mercy unto them; but ſo ſoon as you are gone the fears and ſuggeſtions of their own hearts prevail againſt them, to take away all their comforts more than all the applications of the Word prevailed to uphold &amp; continue their comforts; it is juſt with many that are gracious in the caſe of fears and doubts, as it is with the wicked in regard of their hopes, a wicked man hath the Word againſt him, that he is not in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but his own ſelf-love and conce<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> incourage him to preſume that he is in a good eſtate; now he regards his own opinion and conceit, and preſumes upon that, that his eſtate is good more than on whatſoever is ſaid unto him out of the Word that it is not ſo: ſo the people of God, although they are in a good eſtate, yet their own fears ſo damps their hearts that makes them queſtion that it is not ſo, but the ground of it is their own fears, as the ground of the wicked in thinking their eſtate is good is from their own opinions; ſo the People of God many times from their own conceit and opinions, rather than from the Word, think their eſtate is bad: Take this Rule, <hi>As you muſt receive no comfort but out of the Word; ſo you muſt not receive any trouble but from the Word</hi>; when you receive trouble any other ways, you do not conſider that God has laid your eſtates ſo high that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101278:100"/>
all your troubles depend on nothing but the Word; and therefore anſwer all with Scripture, when the Devil caſts temptations before thee, bid him prove that thy eſtate is not good from the Word, I have this out of the Word to prove it is ſo, and thou haſt nothing to the contrary: in other things you will not be baffled, as in your Evidences for your Eſtates; ſuppoſe a man come and lay claim unto it, although you cannot perhaps make out your title clear, yet you will bid him prove the contrary, and ſhew what grounds he hath to lay claim to it; 'tis not the clamours and talking of other men that will make you quit your hold, or ſatisfie you that it was never rightly yours: But let the Devil come and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt your ſouls, and you are ready to joyn with him, and ſay, it is ſo indeed, I am an hypocrite, and I have no true grace nor ſpiritual life, my ſoul is under the curſe of the Law and dominion of Sin ſtill: how unworthy do you carry it to the bleſſed Spirit of God, and all the grace and goodneſs of God that has been manifeſted and made known unto you concerning the pardon of your ſins? How unbefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is it that on every clamour of Satan, and ſtirring of corruptions in your own hearts, that you ſhould raze the foundation of all your comforts by calling all the work of God preſently into queſtion: Many a poor creature, that finds by Evidences out of the Word that their eſtate is good, they go away chearful, but if the next day there be any ſtirrings of corruption, they let go all, and raze the foundation of all their comforts: walk not ſo unworthy of the grace of God, depend upon the Word, as for your troubles, ſo for your comforts; as you are not comforted with any thing but from what the Word of God ſpeaks to you, ſo be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with nothing, but where you find the Word of God againſt you.</p>
               <p>The fifth Rule is this, <hi>When at any time you are put to ſeek your Evidences, and cannot find them, the beſt way is rather to renew than to ſpend time in finding of the old</hi>; as ſuppoſe any man or woman be ſearching out ſuch Evidences for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they had before, and cannot find them; it may be they are poring upon their own hearts for ſuch and ſuch

workings as they have had heretofore, and cannot find them, and ſo are ready to conclude that all is naught, and lie down as people diſconſolate, becauſe their condition is not good, they cannot find ſuch Evidences as heretofore they had; now in this caſe, the beſt way is, if I cannot find my Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, or the uſe of them I had before, to renew them, the time I ſpend in ſeeking and diſcouraging of my heart, if I ſpent it in actings and workings of my heart after God, for the renewing of my Evidences, perhaps I might have renewed them in that time; as in matters between men and women in this world, they have Evidences that would clear the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in differences; but perhaps they cannot find them, or they are grown ſo old that they cannot read them, and they ſpend a great deal of time about them, whereas poſſibly, did they go to the Court of Roles, they might have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with leſs charge and time; ſo it is with the ſoul, when it cannot find ſuch and ſuch Evidences, it ſpends a great deal of time, and ſits down in diſcouragement and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, when as perhaps in leſs time thou mighteſt have renewed them; as thus, ſuppoſe thou art looking after this Evidence of thy Calling, for God calls whom he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies; Now thou art looking after thy call, and thou art troubled that thou doſt not remember how God did work upon thy heart then, or heretofore, and a great deal of time is ſpent; cannot you find how 'twas with you then? No, then fall upon this courſe, liſten to what voyce of God thou heareſt now in thy heart; ſay to thy ſoul, <hi>Do not I now find the work of God in me; do not I find him now drawing of my heart out of the world unto himſelf, and does not my heart liſten unto this call?</hi> for the call of God is not only at firſt converſion, but God is alwayes calling and drawing the heart from the world unto himſelf; if thou can'ſt not make uſe of the work of God heretofore, make uſe of his preſent work upon thee: Again, thoſe whom God juſtifies, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenant with God; for it was by way of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (as I told you) they give up themſelves to God in an everlaſting Covenant: But when did I come into Covenant with God? I am afraid I am not the man or woman in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101278:101"/>
with God, I cannot remember any ſuch work; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thy heart ſinks down within thee, becauſe thou can'ſt not clear up this work of entring into Covenant with God heretofore: Now the time that thou ſpendeſt in ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this work, ſpend it in entring now into Covenant with God at this preſent time; it will be no hinderance to thee that thou can'ſt not find what was heretofore, if now at this preſent thou can'ſt ſurrender up thy ſelf to God in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, this is enough, do it: Now if you can find your hearts, now come in, and yield up your ſelves into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, you may have the comfort of this Evidence as fully as if you clearly remembred all the former tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and the work of God upon you in your firſt entring into Covenant with God: Again, thoſe that had their ſins pardoned, I told you, were brought into the Kingdom of Chriſt; but you will ſay, I cannot remember how I was tranſlated; <hi>Take now upon you the Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; many trouble themſelves, ſaying, I never found ſuch humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations and troubles for ſin as you ſpeak of, or as others have found; How is it now with your ſouls? Do you find ſin now a burden to your ſouls? Is it not the greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If you were put to your choice, had you not rather ſuffer any thing in the world than ſin againſt God; <hi>and not only out of Convictions of Conſcience, but becauſe you find a frame of ſpirit in your hearts ſuitable thereunto?</hi> for an Hypocrite he may have Convictions of Conſcience, but the frame of his ſpirit is not ſuited thereunto: in you there is a frame of ſpirit ſuitable to the convictions of Conſcience within you, though you cannot remember you have had ſuch ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and troubles in convictions for ſin, as others have had, while they were under the ſpirit of bondage, yet you may be comforted by the preſent frame of ſpirit that you have; and ſo in the like caſes, if you cannot find your old Evidences, fall to work to renew your Evidences, and do not ſpend time in lying down under the diſcouragements of your own hearts.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Rule is this, <hi>When you examine your ſelves to find out your Evidences, carry this thought along with you, that you
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101278:102"/>
have to deal with God in the Covenant of grace:</hi> and this will be of marvellous uſe unto you; perhaps to ſome theſe are very dry things, and they ſee but little in them, and ſcarce know what they be; but I hope there be many others that have knowledge of an eternal ſtate to be between God and their ſouls; I hope I ſpeak things will be very precious to them; yea, I ſay unto many of you; for while I am in this argument, I am ſpeaking to ſuch as have had the fear of God faln upon their hearts, and they have made it the great buſineſs of their lives, above all things in this world, to know how tearms are between God and their ſouls, to know how it ſtands with them for their everlaſting eſtates; I know abundance of people ſcarce ever call theſe things in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to whom theſe Rules will be of little or no uſe at all; but if I ſpeak to ſome, or any one troubled ſoul to help and direct them, though I do no good to others I ſhall think my time well ſpent; wherefore then in your exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ever carry this with you, that you have to deal with God in the Covenant of grace, and not in a Covenant of works: Certainly, that many are ſo troubled in their Conſciences about their eternal eſtates, it is on this ground, becauſe they look upon God in the way of the Covenant of works; if they find any corruptions ſtirring and breaking forth, and temptations ſtrong upon them, they think pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently all is naught, and that God will never accept of them; What is the reaſon? If we had to deal with God in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, the leaſt ſtirring of corruption, it is enough to caſt the ſoul down into eternal horrour; as <hi>Adam,</hi> though he had never ſo much goodneſs before by the Image of God upon him, yet one ſin eternally caſt him, if there had not come in a Covenant of grace: Now, though people will acknowledge there is a Covenant of grace, yet upon the ſtirring of their corruption, they carry it as that it ſerves for no other uſe than if they had to deal with God in a Covenant of works, and as if there were no Covenant of grace at all: Now, what a diſhonour is this to the riches of Gods goodneſs in the Covenant of grace, that tells us, <hi>We are not to be judged for our eternal eſtate by the Covenant of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101278:102"/>
works; and tells us, that he that muſt be our Judge for our eternal condition, is our Advocate with the Father: and tells us alſo, that God accepts of the uprightneſs and the ſincerity of the heart, and that the want of perfection ſhall never damn thy ſoul:</hi> He that ſtands before the Lord to make atonement, and to be our Advocate to plead with the Father for us; he it is that muſt be the Judge of our eternal eſtate; and therefore when I ſet my ſelf before the Lord, I conſider that I have to deal with him in a Covenant of grace: Suppoſe I find and feel ſuch and ſuch corruptions and weakneſſes in me; Is it not poſſible that my eſtate is happy by the Covenant of grace? Collect your ſelves, and ſay, Why do I determine of my everlaſting condition? Have I to deal with God in the Covenant of grace, and cannot theſe imperfections ſtand with it? Why do I make ſuch concluſions that my ſtate is naught, becauſe of the ſtirrings of ſuch and ſuch corruptions? The doubts and fears of moſt Chriſtians ariſe from hence, becauſe they have not a clear underſtanding of the difference between the Covenant of grace and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works; there is nothing in the world would ſo ſatisfie the Conſciences of men and women, ſo <hi>as a clear underſtanding of the Covenant of grace and the Covenant of works:</hi> Many people cry out of the Preachers, that they diſquiet and trouble the hearts of people by their Preaching; the truth is, no Preachers occaſion ſo much the trouble and perplexity of Conſciences, as thoſe that preach Morality and meerly the way of duty, and never come to make them ſee clearly the difference between the Covenant of grace and the Covenant of works; and I appeal unto you, who are they that moſt quiet and ſettle your Conſciences, and ſatisfie your ſpirits; Are they not thoſe Preachers that open the difference between the Covenant of grace and the Covenant of works? Certainly thoſe Preachers that ſhew you what the Covenant of grace is, are the only men that quiet and ſatisfie Conſcience; and 'tis a truth, that nothing can do it but that: You that are Chriſtians, how ſhould you then labour to get a further inſight into the Covenant of grace; and inſtead of other Diſcourſes leſs uſeful, let this be the ſubject of your diſcourſe, the difference of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101278:103"/>
Covenant of works and the Covenant of grace, or the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this Covenant; and that this is the Covenant that we muſt depend upon, notwithſtanding our weakneſſes: And now I am ſpeaking of this Covenant, that weakneſs may ſtand with the Covenant of grace, many that have carnal hearts may be ready to abuſe it; take notice how dear the comforts of your ſouls coſt God, and God will have his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to comfort you, though the revealing of ſuch things will indanger many a mans ſoul: God is content to hazard the damnation of other men to comfort you; for certainly thoſe things that we ſpeak for your comfort will be the damnation of many others:<note place="margin">O rich grace.</note> Think thus, O Lord muſt the comforts of my ſoul coſt ſo dear, and that for my comfort many ſouls are hazarded, who by taking occaſion to ſin, abuſe that grace that is reached forth to me, and ſo are like eternally to periſh: O then, what need had I to make good uſe of this grace that comes to me with the hazard of the ſouls of ſo many others? If a man ſhould bring ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Balſom to apply to a wound, and tell him there is not one drop of it but coſt a thouſand pound at leaſt, would not this be highly prized? Now, when we come and ſhew you any thing that may comfort your hearts and ſatisfie your ſouls, we muſt reveal ſuch things, that not only coſt much, but the leaſt dram of Goſpel-comforts coſt that which was of infinite worth, and 'tis valuable two ways: firſt, every drop of the Balſom of the Goſpel coſt the blood of Chriſt; but beſides this, the very revealing of it muſt coſt the damnation of many ſouls, and yet God is content to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that that you may be comforted: We in the Name of God come and preach the grace of the Goſpel, and we think many will be hardned by it, and grow more ſecure, and abuſe Gods mercy; but then we ſatisfie our ſelves with this, that the comforting of any broken troubled ſoul is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the eyes of Jeſus Chriſt, that he is content to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the hardning of many other ſouls; if they will be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned let them be hardned, Chriſt is content to venture it; and hereby we ſee how precious theſe comforts are; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had need to prize them, and not caſt them off: as ſuppoſe a Captain for the ſaving of the lives of two or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101278:103"/>
three men ſhould venture the lives of a thouſand men meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſave the lives of two or three, were not theſe mens lives very precious to him? ſo Jeſus Chriſt he ventures the hardning of the hearts of many for the comforting of a few; therefore it ſhews your comforts are precious things, you ſhould not eaſily put them off, for they coſt dear.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Rule in applying Evidences is this, <hi>That when you cannot ſee the work of faith reaching to Aſſurance, yet labour to put forth the work of faith of Adherence</hi>; there may be much of the workings of the faith of adherence, where there cannot be the faith of aſſurance; that is certain, there may be true faith adhereing to Chriſt for the pardon of ſin where the ſoul hath no certain aſſurance of it: Many poor creatures are cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and ſaying, if I had faith of aſſurance, and a full perſwaſion my ſins were pardoned, I could be comforted; but becauſe they have not attained to a full perſwaſion and aſſurance, they think they have no grace at all; but there may be faith in the pardon of ſin, where there is not a reflect act of the ſoul, whereby I come to know it hath faith, and that its ſins are pardoned, 1. <hi>Joh. Chap.</hi> 2.3. he ſhews there that there may be knowledge, and yet not know they do know; <hi>Hereby we know that we do know him, if we keep his Commandements,</hi> hereby we know that we do know him: now knowing of Chriſt, and knowing that we do know him, is not all one; there is a knowing, and a knowing that we do know him; ſo <hi>there is a beleiving and a knowing we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive:</hi> there may be a true work of grace, that I may know Chriſt, and know him to ſalvation, and yet not know that I do know him, that is, by a reflect act of faith, a knowing that I do know him; ſo then, where there is not a faith of aſſurance there may be a faith of adherence; that is, when the ſoul ſticks to Chriſt, and can giue it ſelf unto, and venture it ſelf upon Chriſt for pardon of ſin, life and Salvation; that is faith of adherence: ſuppoſe in ſeeking my Evidences (many of them being taken from the effects and friuts of faith) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find them, and ſo cannot put forth a reflect act of the ſoul, which is faith of aſſurance, yet I may at that time have a faith of adherence; thou may'ſt feel thy heart ſtick to Chriſt, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101278:104"/>
thou may'ſt venture thy ſoul on Chriſt; that faith will ſave thee, though you have not a faith of aſſurance; that is, though you cannot find ſuch Evidences whereby you may draw up ſuch a concluſion, or make up ſuch a judgment that you are pardoned; yet if you have a faith of adherence, that you can ſtick to Ghriſt, and venture your ſoules on him for life and Salvation, and all that is good; that faith will ſave you; and therefore upon examination of your Evidences, when you cannot get up to ſuch acts of faith as aſſurance is, live then by a faith of adherence, ſtick to Chriſt, ſay, here I will reſolve to live and dye, venture on the grace of God in Chriſt: Now for the ſoul to do this, it is a mighty work of faith; for if you can venture your ſouls on Chriſt, you will venture your Eſtates on Chriſt, your Names on Chriſt, and all that you have on Chriſt; and therefore remember, if you have not a faith of aſſurance, then venture your ſelves on Chriſt by a faith of adherence, and comfort will come in that way,</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>If at any time you feel comforts from Evidences flow in upon your ſouls, and that you are able to apply the comforts to your ſelves, that the Lord hath ſpoken to you by ſuch and ſuch ſigns of a pardoned ſinner, take heed you do not reſt much upon Evidences</hi>; but then at that very time, think with your ſelves, though now I have comforts, I may looſe them, and God may call me to another condition; God never granted theſe helps unto me for my Saviours that I ſhould reſt upon them, they are but bladders to help me to ſwim, and God may take away theſe, and call me to live upon the meer actings of faith, and not at all on ſenſe, thats certain he may do it, for when we bring theſe Signs and Evidences of grace, as they come from faith, and are effects and fruits of it, they are but as bladders to help young ſwimmers that cannot ſwim with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and learn them to ſwim; but thoſe that have got the Art, though the bladders be taken away, they can ſwim; but take them away from the others, and they will ſink; ſo that theſe Evidences are for young and weak Chriſtians that cannot live on primary acts of faith, which a ſtrong Chriſtian can do, when all other things are taken away; and therefore when we feel the comfort of any ſigns depend not on this,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101278:104"/>
the Lord may take them away; and becauſe he delights in the meer actings of faith, that is the reaſon why God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws himſelf from the ſouls of his people, that they ſhall not have the uſe of Signs and Evidences as they had before, becauſe he would teach them to live on the more neceſſary acts of faith; God loves the voice of <hi>Job, though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him</hi>; I will venture my ſoul upon him, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of me; when theres nothing elſe to reſt on but God, then to live by actings of faith merely on him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights much in this; and therefore take heed you do not reſt ſo much on ſigns, as if all your comforts were loſt and you undone, when you cannot have ſuch uſe of them as you have had heretofore.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>when you have at any time loſt the uſe of ſigns, do not determine that all is gone, and that you ſhall never have the uſe of them more</hi>; this is that that mightily hinders many poor Chriſtians that are in trouble of Conſcience, becauſe they cannot find the evidence of the pardon of their ſins, and that God accepts of them in what they do; what do they do preſently? they yeild to the horrible ſentence of damnation againſt themſelves: Gods Spirit, ſay they is now gone, and he will return no more; he will never come any more unto me: take heed you do not faſten on any ſuch kind of thoughts as thoſe are, to determine of your own eſtates, or that Gods Spirit will not come again: but do you humble your ſouls before the Lord, and wait upon him.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>When at any time all Signs and Evidences fail you, and you are ready to determine that all is gone, yet even then keep up good thoughts of God</hi>; As the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> when her Beloved was gone, yet ſhe prized him, and ſaid <hi>He is the chiefeſt of ten thouſands</hi> in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. when ſhe was asked; What is thy beloved? ſays ſhe, he is thus, and thus, &amp; then concludes, <hi>He is altogether lovely</hi>; and this was at ſuch a time as he was gone, yet ſhe retain'd good thoughts of him; ſo 'tis a good ſign for any ſoul, that when trouble of conſcience is upon them, or any other trouble, that they retain good thoughts of God and Chriſt and the wayes of God, when the ſoul ſays, whatever become of me, though I periſh for ever,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101278:105"/>
yet God is good, his Word, his ways are good, his Goſpel, and the Covenant in his Son is good; and whatever troubles are upon me, yet God is righteous; and though God juſtifie not me, yet I will juſtifie God; if there be any ſoul that cannot find his Evidences, or any of thoſe ſigns before ſpoken of, you may make uſe of this; if you cannot find any other, do what thou can'ſt to juſtifie God; thou art afraid that God will not juſtifie thee, <hi>do thou juſtifie him</hi>; ſometimes it is with many men, as with ſome wretched ſervant that has dealt falſly with his Maſter, and may be all the while he can make any advantage of his Maſter for his own ends, he will ſpeak well of him, but if his Maſter turn him out of doors for his wickedneſs, then he rails on him; 'tis ordinary for bad ſervants to do ſo when they are turn'd away for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſo it is with many, when all goes well with them, then they like well of the wayes of God; but if they come to ſuch a condition as that they think that God will caſt them away indeed, and that they are like to periſh, then they begin to have hard thoughts of God, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they ſpeak againſt God and his ways; take heed of this, although you want the Evidences of his love and mercy, yet retain in your hearts good thoughts of God and of his ways, and this will be a ſpecial help to bring into your ſouls the comfort and aſſurance of your Juſtification; and now I have done with this argument, I have ſhewed you who it is that hath his ſins pardoned, I have ſhewed the ſeveral miſtakes, and I have ſhewed you certain infallible grounds from Scripture Evidences of the pardon of ſin, and Rules how to make uſe of thoſe Evidences; and now upon what you have heard, you have teſtimony and aſſurance of the pardon of your ſins, or you have not; if you find your hearts do not anſwer to theſe Evidences, or that you are afraid that your ſins are not pardoned, then take a uſe of Exhortation to put you on to ſeek after this bleſſedneſs.</p>

               <p>I <hi>Am now come to a uſe of Exhortation,</hi> and it concerns us all, either thoſe that are not pardoned, or thoſe that have aſſurance of the pardon of their ſins; for there is none that have aſſurance but may make uſe of it: Chriſt taught his Diſciples to pray daily for the <hi>forgiveneſs of their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, as well as for their daily bread</hi>; and what we are to pray for, we are to ſeek after; ſo that it concerns all; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs is deſirable to all, it is as natural for man as a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature to deſire bleſſedneſs as it is for the fire to burn; only here's the great miſtake in the world, all would have it, but they look not for it in the right way: Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that has been ſaid, that thou may'ſt not have ſlight thoughts of the pardon of ſin, and ſay, I hope they are pardoned, and the like; I ſhall ſpeak to awaken thee: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou wer't now ſet on the brink of the infinite Ocean of Eternity, and the bottomleſs Gulf were ready to devour thee, and the Records of Heaven were opened, and there ſhewed thee that thy ſins were not cancelled, but remain upon the file? What thou would'ſt then do, do it now; for this is our time, and this is the great work of our lives, not to cumber our ſelves about many things, but about this one thing, to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling; this is the great work to ſeek to ſecure this bleſſing of the pardon of our ſins, which is the foundation of all; in the obtaining of it we obtain all bleſſings; it ought to be our chief care, and we ought to lay out our chief ſtrength and indeavours in ſeeking of it; and if God would be pleaſed to put his hand to your hearts, and turn the ſtream of your thoughts and indeavours, the very turning of your hearts after this buſineſs is a great mercy; there is ſo much bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs in it, as not only the obtaining of it, but the very

motion of the heart this way is worth all the world, in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. we read, <hi>there were many thouſands that had their hearts pricked at hearing the Word preached, and they cryed out men and brethren, What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> O that there were a diſpoſition in the hearts of men to cry thus; we ſee it is our bleſſedneſs if we have it; and if we have it not, we are all curſed for ever; What ſhall we do to get it? <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.17. we read <hi>of one came running after Chriſt, ſaying, What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> O that your hearts were now in ſuch a frame to come running after Chriſt, ſaying, What ſhall we do that our ſins may be pardoned: but before I come to any thing elſe, it is neceſſary by way of caution or proviſo to ſay three or four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This; that although I muſt ſeek after God for the pardon of ſin, yet know there is nothing in a natural man that is or can be acceptable</hi>; all his endeavours have not that in them that can gain him acceptance with God: But then to what purpoſe are we to endeavour to do any thing? yes, we muſt be ſtriving after the pardon of ſin, although without Chriſt we can do nothing; and <hi>a bad tree cannot bring forth good fruit,</hi> yet it is to purpoſe that we be doing, for God likes well the exerciſe of the work of common gifts; though they are not ſaving, and to eternal life, yet God likes the exerciſe of them ſo far as there is any thing good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them; when <hi>that young man came to Chriſt,</hi> Mar. 10.21. <hi>Chriſt look't upon him and loved him,</hi> though not with ſuch a love as to ſave him and bring him to eternal life, yet God did diſcover love to ſuch a one; therefore <hi>it is to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a man ſhould put himſelf on doing what he can, if it be only for that.</hi> 2. <hi>It is to ſome purpoſe that the heart be ſtirring after God and Chriſt, becauſe hereby we ſhall evidence that we are not ſo negligent of God and Chriſt, and the things of eternal life as we were before.</hi> 3. <hi>It is to ſome purpoſe, for in the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the common works of Gods Spirit, God many times comes in with ſaving works</hi>; for God works not upon men as upon ſtocks or ſtones, but God puts them on by ſtirring up the common works of his Spirit, and at that time when they are moſt in ſtirring, it is Gods uſual way to come in with
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101278:106"/>
the ſaving works of his Spirit; therefore it is not to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we are putting on poor creatures to do what they can.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Caution is this, <hi>That whatſoever any one doth in ſeeking after Chriſt before he has union with Chriſt, it is not to be reckoned on as the condition of the Covenant of Grace or a Goſpel-work</hi>; there are no preparatory works for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt, that are the condition of the Covenant of grace; though they be ſuch things as we muſt follow after, yet they are not the condition of the Covenant of grace: Now that that is the condition of the Covenant of grace ſanctifies him that hath it, and follows upon our union with Chriſt; though God uſes to carry on the ſoul in the way of legal terrors, humiliations, and the like; yet theſe are not the work of the Covenant of grace; and therefore this may help many a poor ſoul about terrors of Conſcience and humiliations; that are troubled that they never had thoſe degrees as others have; why as they do not prepare and fit thee for Chriſt; ſo the want of them is no hinderance to the receiving of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third Caution is this that follows on the other, <hi>That though you put your ſelves upon the uſe of all means to the receiving of Chriſt, yet take heed you do not reſt in any of thoſe preparatory works,</hi> there's a great deal of danger in that; many ſouls miſtake, and it is to be feared it is in this, the reſting in ſomething that they have done; it may be God has awakened their Conſciences, and they fall upon work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon humbling and reforming themſelves, and here they reſt; but this is a miſtake, you muſt not reſt until you find you are in Chriſt, and until there be an union with Chriſt and your ſouls; the work is not therefore done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are humbled and reformed, and run another courſe to what you did before. for Rom. 9.16. <hi>'Tis not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy</hi>; not of him that <hi>willeth,</hi> that is, that hath ſome good affections to it; nor of him that <hi>runneth,</hi> that is, though his endeavours be never ſo ſtrong, yet 'tis not of him neither: many think they have peace in their ſouls
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101278:107"/>
upon their good deſires and endeavours; when their hearts are mightily ſtirr'd, and they wonderfully inlarged, then they make no queſtion but all is done, and they quiet their hearts with that, and think there is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work to be done; but it is not ſo; <hi>Not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy</hi>; though we muſt; will, and we muſt run, yet there may be <hi>running and ſtriving to enter in, and yet not enter</hi>; this is a very great point, to let us ſee all of us what need we have of the free grace of God in pardoning of our ſin.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Though God does not tie himſelf to come in to pardon upon theſe preparatory works going before, yet it is worthy of the utmoſt endeavours of any ſoul in the world, that there is a poſſibility of the obtaining of it</hi>; though God tie not himſelf to give pardon on thoſe works, yet there is enough in it to require the utmoſt endeavours of any one to be laid out, could we do ten thouſand times more than we can, even the very poſſibility of obtaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, is worth the calling forth of all our ſtrength; know that the very poſſibility of having ſin pardoned, is enough to ſet all your hearts a work to ſeek after it, though God do not tie himſelf to come in then and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; tis not thus, that God would have his creature ſeek unto him, and then all ſhould be left unto that ſeeking; no, for if that were granted, that God did foreſee ſomething that his creature would do, and upon that he would give him pardon, then all the world would be ſaved; but all the world do not what they can; if God had tied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to come in then when men do what they can, all the world might be ſaved; but it is not ſo: God hath left it ſo that he will have his creature (do what he can) to relie upon him; and when he doth come in, then he enters into the greateſt and ſtrongeſt bonds that can be to do his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good; but I come to inforce the Exhortation for to ſeek after the pardon of ſin.</p>

                  <hi>In the ſeeking pardon of your ſins ſet your ſelves as in the preſence of God,</hi> and put this upon your ſouls; I am now looking after the pardon of ſin, but how do I do it? does my heart work ſo in it as that I can ſatisfie my own Conſcience in the work I do? that it is ſuch a work, that may teſtifie my high reſpect to God from whom I ſeek it; is it ſuch a work as manifeſts that I am ſenſible, it is a buſineſs of the moſt infinite concernment that I have in all the world; and am I ſenſible of the infinite Power and Majeſty of God as one that is infinitly above me; when you ſeek after pardon, you muſt do it ſo, as that you may be able to ſatisfie your Conſciences that your ſeeking is ſuch a work as does hold forth the glorious greatneſs of that God that you are ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after; many pray ſlightly, as God be merciful to me, and mumble over a few words, and have done; does this hold forth that they have ſuch an apprehenſion of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the power of that God they ſeek after, ſurely no; thats the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If thou wilt ſeek after pardon of ſin, it muſt be ſuch a ſeeking as may teſtifie that thou doſt prize thy life here in this world above all things elſe in it</hi>; becauſe God gives thee time in it to ſeek after him; Is thy ſeeking ſuch that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts the time of thy life is given the for this very end? if you were ſenſible of this, you would ſeek it in another manner than you do; you would ſeek it as a condemn'd man ſeeks his pardon; for certainly, every man is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd man, and the time of your life is like a condemn'd mans time, between his condemnation and execution: Now does your ſeeking teſtifie and witneſs that you ſpend your time, and that your hearts are ſo ſtir'd in ſeeking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as that it holds forth you account your lives pretious, and uſe it for the ſame end, to get the pardon of your ſin, if a condemn'd man have time to ſeek a pardon two or three days; and he followes drinking, playing, and the like, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly none would apprehend this man ſpent his time, as if it were given him for to get his pardon; look upon the courſes and lives of moſt men; and are they ſuch that does teſtifie they live to that very end, to ſeek pardon? if men
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101278:108"/>
were ſo ſenſible of it, as they ſhould, they would cry and weep, and lament unto God for the pardon of their ſins, and ſo carry it as would teſtifie they prize their lives at a high rate for this end, that they may ſeek the pardon of their ſins.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It muſt be done ſo, as that you may have this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in your Conſciences, that you never ſought after any thing in the world ſo as you ſought after this</hi>; though it was never ſo an important occaſion, yet there is nothing after which your endevours have been ſo powerful as after this; I appeale to you in this place; is the work of your ſouls after pardon ſo? as that in your own Conſciences you can ſay, if any buſineſs ever took up my heart, this hath, if ever my ſpirit was up in any thing in the world it is in this; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, unleſs it be ſo, you have not done that that God requires of you.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>You muſt ſo do it as apprehending God is ready to be gone, and to turne away from you</hi>; you muſt ſo ſeek after him, as apprehending, for ought you know, that God is juſt a going away; and if thou haſt it not now, 'tis uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether thou ſhalt ever have it; the ſoul muſt cry as a poor Malefactor does when the Judge is on the Bench, he cries all that while; but when he is ready to riſe, and is going off, then he cries mercy, mercy; when he thinks, if he let him go, then he ſhall never ſee his face more; he cries then to purpoſe; ſo ſhould it be with every ſoul that underſtands the danger of loſing of it; you ſhould ſo ſeek after it, as looking on your ſelves ſtanding before God the Judge of all the World, having the ſentence of death out againſt you, yet for the preſent God is looking on you, and admits of you to look on him; but ſo as apprehending God ready to turn aſide, and you know not whether ever he will grant you ſuch an opportunity of ſeeing him any more; O then if a man would ſeek after God as ready to turn aſide from him, and for ought he knows, he ſhould never ſee him more: Certainly, if you know the evil of ſin, and the bleſſedneſs of pardon of ſin; What a deep impreſſion would ſuch an apprehenſion make upon your hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:101278:108"/>Fifthly, <hi>So ſeek after it as that thou may'ſt teſtifie thou would'ſt ſanctifie the great Name of God in it</hi>; I do not ſay thou can'ſt do it, but thou muſt endeavour after it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that that which thou doſt may have ſome reſemblance to it; there is no work that ever God did from all eternity, that hath ſo much or more of his Name in it, than this work of the pardon of ſin hath; this is a poſitive work of God, and is for this end <hi>to declare his Name</hi>; the works and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God about this was the greateſt thing that ever God did; you heard much concerning the glory of God in this work, in the opening of the Doctrine: Now what I put you upon in the uſe is this, <hi>That in ſeeking pardon of ſin, know you are are ſo to endeavour after it, as your endeavours may hold forth the apprehenſions your ſouls have of the great Name of God:</hi> certainly this ſanctifies Gods Name when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it ſo, when there is a work upon our ſouls ſuitable in ſome meaſure to the excellent and glorious Name of God that appears in ſome meaſure in the work that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about: as ſuppoſe it be the ſpeaking of any attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of God, then I ſanctifie Gods Name, when there is that reverential reſpect to God in reference to ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute; ſo when I give God praiſe for a mercy, I ſanctifie Cods Name when there is a work upon my heart ſuitable to that glorious Name of God that appears in that mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on me; ſo if I ſeek after God for a bleſſing, then I reverence Gods Name, when there is ſuch a diſpoſition in my heart, that is ſomewhat ſuitable to the glorious Name of God that appears in that bleſſing: ſo in endeavouring to ſanctifie Gods Name in ſeeking after pardon of ſin, thou doſt it then, when there is ſuch a frame in thy heart as may hold forth to Men and Angels, that this work of thine hath ſome kind of ſuitableneſs to the glorious Name of God that appears in it; this is to ſanctifie the Name of God, and this is a great work; this is the great thing for which thou waſt made; and this is the great thing for which the counſels of God, yea the deep counſels of God were ſet a work from all eternity: Now the diſpoſitions of our ſpirits muſt be ſuch, as may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the great end, the wiſdom and counſels of God had in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101278:109"/>
it, and therefore it muſt be a great work that muſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that; for certainly thoſe whom God pardons he makes them underſtand what pardon means. Now th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, if thy ſeeking be ſuch as that thou knoweſt what it is thou ſeekeſt after, then it muſt hold forth alſo that thou doſt underſtand the Name of God is exceeding glorious in it; and then as thou doeſt apprehend this, ſo according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy heart will work after it; and therefore when you are alone, and you find your hearts working this way, ſay, What do I do? Do I ſo call upon him, and ſeek after him, as that this work of mine declares to God and my own Conſcience I ſeek for it ſo, as that I may manifeſt the glorious Name of the great God is in it? certainly if I do not do it thus, <hi>I take Gods Name in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Further, you muſt ſeek after it as if you were now to anſwer for all your ſins before the Lord, as you would wiſh you had done it then,</hi> ſo do it now; I put it to every one of you; Have you not been on your ſick-beds, and in your apprehenſion neer unto death; hath not God waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Conſciences, and you have been afraid upon the account of your ſins; what kind of temper your ſouls have been in then, know it concerns you every day in the whole courſe of your lives to have the ſame apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as you had at that time; do now as then you would have done: certainly thou doſt not underſtand what pardon of ſin means, if thou doſt not ſeek it thus.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly, <hi>Do it as thou thinkeſt in thy Conſcience the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls in Hell would do if God ſhould give them a poſſibility,</hi> What would they do if God ſhould proclaim unto them a poſſibility of pardon? what would they do? divers things you may conceive they would do; and here it comes up fully to my hand to put you upon it, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſay, <hi>O! what ſhall I do?</hi> Were we to preach to them in Hell, do you think that there is any one of them but would mightily cry to the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; 'tis not like that any one of ſuch an Auditory but would mightily cry to God, if the great counſels of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardon of ſin were preacht to them; and will not every one of you now mightily cry to God for it? certainly if they
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:101278:109"/>
would do it in Hell, Why ſhould not you do it now; that which you think they would do, not with a few ſlight vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, do you do now with all your might.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>Do this: ſo ſeek after it as to deſire if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that you might bring as much glory unto God, as he would have had of you if he ſhould have damn'd you for ever</hi>; this is an excellent frame of ſpirit though you do not know it, but though you do not, yet you ſhould put your ſelves upon ſuch a kind of work and God may come in; you cry out for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but never cry out for Gods honour, O what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the honour of God that he hath loſt by me, and the diſhonour I have brought to him, ſay, <hi>O Lord I have diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Name, O that I might ſo honour thy Name as I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured it</hi>; O Lord thou mighteſt make up thy honour in my eternal damnation; but O Lord, I would if I could do any thing that might make up that diſhonour that I have brought by my ſin, if I could do any thing that thou mighteſt have any honour in, I would do it: for a cloſe, I ſhall put this for a conſideration to you; <hi>whatſoever you would do upon any ſuppoſition, ſuppoſe your danger were as great as ever it was in all your lives, what you would do then do it now</hi>; you muſt do all that can be done by a creature: Now if you would do more on ſuch a ſuppoſition as this, after all thoſe Sermons you have heard of the evil of ſin, and now of the great bleſſedneſs of the pardon of ſin, if you do not do what a creature is able to do, How can you look for pardon of ſin in the face of God? and therefore what you would do on any ſuch ſuppoſition, do now, though thou ſhouldeſt not get pardon; ſuppoſe ſuch a thing as if thou wer't now ready to be damn'd, yet is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to do it, than not to do it? Having ſpoken of theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, I come now more garticularly to the other part of the Queſtion, <hi>What is to be done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This is to be done, be ſure thou takeſt off thy heart from all other imaginary bleſſedneſs</hi>; certainly there is no man in the world but hath ſomewhat elſe his heart was running out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; now thou muſt get off thy heart from that thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be; it may be thy heart was ſet upon friends, or upon pleaſures of the fleſh, and thou thoughteſt thy ſelf happy
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101278:110"/>
the more thou had'ſt liberty for thy luſt, and the like; now thou muſt be convinc't that <hi>thou haſt fed upon aſhes, and haſt not been able to ſay there is a lie in my right hand</hi>; but God hath now ſhewed me there is a lie, and I have look't for happineſs elſe where; but now I ſee it is not there to be found, win thy ſoul fully to this; O my ſoul art thou taken off from all other things, hath God convinc't thee that thou may'ſt have honours, riches, pleaſures, and yet be a Reprobate, wo unto me for the time that I have loſt, I have laid out my time and mony for another bleſſedneſs, that is no where to be found but in the grace of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Let Conſcience have free liberty to ſhew thee thy ſins, and charge them upon thee,</hi> yea to accuſe and condemn thee, and do thou help thy Conſcience; when Conſcience accuſes and condemns, then do thou condemn thy ſelf; if thou would'ſt be pardoned, then give Conſcience ſcope and liberty; 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous when God begins to ſtir the hearts of men and women, to make any ſtop or give any check to Conſcience there, the wiſeſt courſe is to give Conſcience liberty, for it will have liberty one day to accuſe and condemn you; Why will you not now give it liberty? Conſcience will one day bring all thy evil deeds before thee and accuſe thee; now let it accuſe and condemn thee, and certainly if thou doſt ſo, thou art in a very good way to come to have abſolution of thy ſins in thy Conſcince now; for at the great day the Books ſhall be opened: Now bring as it were a day of Judgment upon thy ſelf, contract the Throne of God into your own hearts, and call for the Book of Conſcience, and ſay, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? What ſay'ſt thou againſt me that I may get it blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out now, that it may not be read againſt me at the day of Judgment?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Be willing to own all thy ſins,</hi> confeſs, diſcover them with all the heart-breaking circumſtances and aggravations thou canſt poſſible, the Lord knows thy ſins whether thou confeſſeſt them or not; but God will have thee to come and lay them open, God will have thee to come and charge thy ſelf with them: 'tis a very good thing to open Conſcience free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the Lord, not in a ſlight way, but in a way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:101278:110"/>
and bitterneſs of ſpirit bewailing them, and crying by way of Prayer and Petition againſt them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Be willing to accept of the puniſhment of ſin,</hi> ſay, O Lord, as thus I do charge and acknowledge, bewail and cry out of my ſin; ſo here I am Lord, ready and willing to accept of the puniſhment of my ſin, and the ſoul that is in this frame is in a comfortable way of pardon of ſin.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Reſolve to avoid ſin whatever come of it,</hi> at that very time when thou art ſeeking pardon, of ſin be ſure to reſolve never to ſin again, for know, that for ought thou knoweſt, the very next ſin thou committeſt may make God come upon thee for all thy former ſins. And then</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Caſt out whatſoever is gotten by falſe ways, make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly, <hi>Be ſure that thou be put off with nothing elſe but pardon of ſin</hi>; never reſt keeping thy ſoul always in a waiting frame, looking up to God for pardon: To all theſe things I ſhall add, that all theſe muſt have reference to the great work of the Son of God, when you cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> though I have ſpoken of divers things, yet know all is with reference unto Chriſt the Son of God, God-Man; look upon him as the head of the ſecond Covenant offering up himſelf for our ſins, let thine eye be upon him, and as thou giveſt thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience liberty to charge thy ſins upon thy own ſoul, ſo charge them upon Chriſt the head of the ſecond Covenant; have an eye to him for the diſcharge of them; Doſt thou vomit up thy ſin by confeſſion, and cry to God for pardon? remember that thou cry to him through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt; look upon him <hi>that muſt make up the breach, reſtore thee to favour, and remove the curſe</hi>: in every work be ſure thou eye Chriſt, and make uſe of theſe rules ſo, as may further the venturing of thy ſoul upon Chriſt; except thy ſoul riſe to this, to work thee to Chriſt, all the other is but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural work, though as I ſaid before, that thou ſhouldeſt let Conſcience condemn thee, and that thou have anguiſh of ſpirit, know all theſe are but natural works, any further then they ſerve in reference unto Chriſt: And now I have ſhewed you what you are to do, What is it that you will do?
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101278:111"/>
will you ſet up your reſolution, that through the grace of God in Chriſt, whatever hath been told you, you will ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame, then happy are you; but if you do it not, it may be you may wiſh you had done it when ſin lies heavy on you; then you will cry that God would be merciful to you, but then God and Conſcience will ſay, I warned you at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place, and were not you there put in a way to ſeek after pardon; What did you do after you went away? the next day you went among your Companions, and were as drunk and as wicked as ever before; if it be ſo, then trouble will be upon you; it may be ſome poor creature that ſat in the ſame pew with thee, had a heart to ſeek pardon, and is abſolved before men and Angels, and at the day of Judgment ſhall ſit at Chriſts right hand, and thou that heardeſt the ſame Word, and haſt neglected it, now comeſt to have thy ſoul for ever lie under the weight and burden of thy ſins: God forbid that there ſhould be ſuch a difference made; thou haſt heard the way, ſeek after the pardon of thy ſin; let it not be in vain that all theſe Sermons have been preach't unto you, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. when they preach't about pardon of ſin, it ſays <hi>to him give all the Prophets witneſs</hi>; O that you might come in and give witneſs that this day remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin was preach't unto you; O that while you hear this Word, the Holy Ghoſt might fall upon you, that you might have your hearts fired with ſtrong reſolutions, to ſet about this work in the power of the Holy Ghoſt, and reſt not in any thing on this ſide of a pardon: Now I come to give you ſome incouragements, and they will work two ways, either draw you to Chriſt, or for ever ſtop your mouths, that you ſhall have nothing to ſay againſt him. I ſhall name fifteen incouragements unto you.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>This time is not only afforded for this end, but the means the Lord hath brought you under is a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he intends mercy for you,</hi> and you may conclude there are more of Gods Elect may have pardoning mercy than in former times; the light of the Goſpel breaks forth, and certainly there is more to be brought in, the Goſpel is the fruit of Chriſt's death, and given for the Elects ſake, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.9, 10. he bids him <hi>go end preach, for he had much people</hi>; he ſhould have oppoſition, but go, be not afraid, for I have much people in that place; 'tis true, the rain will fall upon the tiles as well as on the tender hearbs and graſs; but certainly where God ſends his Word he hath people to be gathered in; and if you take notice of Gods Providence in this point, it may much incourage you to come in, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there be many in this Congregation, and in others, where the Word is preached, that he will pardon, Mar. 10.46. <hi>The blind man hearing it was Chriſt that paſt by, he cryed for mercy, and many charged him to hold his peace, but he cried the more, and Chriſt ſtood ſtill and called him unto him:</hi> Now if thou ſeeſt thy ſin, and cryeſt for pardon, Chriſt will call thee to give pardoning mercy to thee as he did <hi>Bartimeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It may be thou art not only under the means of grace and the outward call, but thou begin'ſt to feel an inward call,</hi> there are ſome ſtirrings of Gods Spirit within thee; thou could'ſt ſay before, thou wonderedſt what the matter was
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:101278:112"/>
with people to run after Sermons, but now thou begin'ſt to feel the effect of it, <hi>And the glory of God appears to thee in this place, when thou art hearing of his Word</hi>; thou may'ſt hence reaſon, as <hi>Manoa</hi>'s wife, Judg. 13.23. <hi>That certainly if God had intended to have killed us, he would not have received a burnt Offering and a meat Offering at our hands; neither would he have ſhewed us all theſe things</hi>; ſo ſay to thy ſoul, if God had intended to kill me, he would not have been ſo willing to have drawn me after him, neither would he have ſhewed me all theſe things, and let that be an incouragement unto thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The end why God continues this world in being, is that he might give pardon to his Elect</hi>; certainly this world had been diſſolved long ago, if it were not that he might bring pardon to his Elect, and to thoſe that ſee their ſins; this muſt needs be a great incouragement to a ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> to thoſe that ſee their ſins, to come in; when this pardoning work is done, <hi>Chriſt will deliver up his Kingdom to his Father</hi>; if a malefactor ſhould come to ſue out his pardon, and one ſhould ſay unto him, 'tis well Sir you are come, for the King would not have kept his Court ſo long here, but that you ſhould come in; were not this a great incouragement? ſo ſay I, were it not that men ſhould come to get the pardon of their ſins, the Court of the world would have been broken up long before this time,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The principal ſcope of the Scriptures is for this very end, to reveal the pardoning grace of God</hi>; you have here the heart of God laid open; Chriſt wept and mourned that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would not come in, that they might be <hi>pardoned</hi> and ſaved.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> I have read a ſtory, <hi>that in</hi> Athens <hi>there was a Temple, and in that there was a woman weeping, and in one hand ſhe had a bleeding Heart, and with the other ſhe was writing Pardons</hi>; ſo Chriſt he ſtands weeping over you, that you will not come in, and he hath a bleeding heart, bleeding for you in the one hand, and with the other hand he is ready to write you a pardon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 42. nay, he does not only weep: But the</p>
               <p>Sixth incouragement may be, <hi>He ſends his Ambaſſadors to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101278:112"/>
woe you to come in,</hi> and tells them they ſhall not take a denyal at your hands, 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>They intreat and beg as in his Name,</hi> nay it is the beſeechings and intreatings of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as if a King ſhould ſend one of the Attendants on him to a poor condemned Priſoner, and ſay, go tell ſuch a one that he muſt come for his pardon, and tell him, I beſeech him, and take no denyal of him, I beſeech him to come in; would not this manifeſt the great willingneſs of the King to pardon; God does ſo, he ſends his Miniſters and beſeeches you to come in and take a pardon; 'tis as certain God ſpeaks thus by his Miniſters, as if you heard God ſpeaking by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, this ſhould move you to come in, <hi>Chriſt begs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats you to be reconciled,</hi> that his bloud might not be ſhed in vain: ſeeing it is ſo, that God begs of thee to come in, why ſhouldeſt not thou come in, and take pardon of thy ſin, Why can'ſt not thou come in and give up thy ſelf and all thou haſt and art to him.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Know it is the great office and work of Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip to bind up the broken hearts of wounded ſinners,</hi> Iſai. 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, and he hath anointed me, he hath ſent me to preach good tidings to the meek; he hath ſeat me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound</hi>; this in the New Teſtament is applyed to Chriſt. Now this being the great work for which Chriſt came into the world, to bind up the broken-hearted, ſee whether thou canſt not rely on Chriſt by an act of faith, this ſhould be a great incouragement.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>Conſider that, that God thou haſt to deal withal, his nature is mercy in the abſtract</hi>; and if ſo, he is free in his mercy; as the Sun ſhines, becauſe it's the nature of it to ſhine; ſo the mercy of God muſt needs work freely, becauſe it is his nature; as the fire burns naturally, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. &amp; <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. <hi>God pardons becauſe he delights in mercy</hi>; thou ſay'ſt thou art a poor ſinner; well, though it be ſo, yet thou may'ſt ſay, though God can ſee nothing in me, yet ſeeing that he is a God that delights in mercy, this may move me to come in: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He hath more delight in pardoning any ſinner than in all the creatures of Heaven and Earth</hi>; God delights in all the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101278:113"/>
works of his hands; but in this he delights in more than in all; he delights in them all, but not ſo much as in magnifying his grace in Jeſus Chriſt; for in this he magnifies his Son, and therefore he hath more pleaſure, and takes more delight in pardoning a poor humbled ſinner, than in all the works of his hands beſides.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>No one can take ſo much pleaſure in the ſalvation of his own ſoul, as God doth in pardoning of thy ſin</hi>; and the reaſon is, becauſe this is the greateſt deſign that God hath, which is the ſetting out of his glory in his pardoning mercy in Chriſt, and therefore this may be a great encouragement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God is more delighted in the work of thy heart cloſing with free grace, than in all the legal works of humiliation</hi>; what ſays Chriſt? <hi>this is the good will and pleaſure of God</hi>; and <hi>David</hi> was called <hi>a man after Gods own heart</hi>; Why? becauſe he was a man that would do his will; ſo that this is a great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, though many abuſe this and pervert it to their own deſtruction, yet God will have it taught, that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have the comfort of it, and therefore thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cloſe with God and come in, and take hold of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>Though God hath taken ſuch a way in mercy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſin, yet he loſeth nothing in his juſtice</hi>; Chriſt hath taken ſuch order that his glory ſhall no way be diminiſhed, his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall be ſatisfied; and therefore thou need'ſt not ſay thus, I have ſo ſinned againſt God that I know not, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to make up his glory; for there is care taken for that already, and therefore that need not diſcourage thee.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>There are as vile ſinners now Triumphing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as any of you that are here, be you never ſo black and vile,</hi> and therefore be not diſcouraged at the greatneſs of thy ſins; for though they be very great, yet that may not keep thee out, others as vile as thou art, are now in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, <hi>Make the utmoſt of thy ſin thou can'ſt, yet this need not hinder thee to come to God for: for ought that either men or Angels know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou haſt as much intereſt in Chriſt as any Saint in Heaven over had,</hi> and if thou comeſt in and layeſt hold on
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101278:113"/>
Chriſt, thy very laying hold on Chriſt will plainly ſhew thou haſt a right unto him, and therefore be not diſcouraged but come in.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thy cloſing with Chriſt, thou wilt find ſuch a change as was never wrought in any creature beſides</hi>; for though thou wer't vile and filthy, more vile and filthy than a child new born by original and actual ſins ingendred in thee, yet thou ſhalt be made cleaner than a child, and more pure in the eyes of God than any child cleanſed from his filthineſs; would not you do any thing to be pure in the eyes of God, make uſe of what I ſay, and you ſhall be clean; when you hear the Miniſters utter the threatnings of God you fall out with the man, and ſay, he preaches nothing but terror; alas 'tis our delight to preach the pardoning grace of God; but we muſt ſhew the evil of ſin, and it is that you might come in and imbrace mercy; for know, we delight to preach mercy more than any thing elſe; and know, that if thou deſireſt that all thy thoughts, ways and actions may be for Gods glory, he will not upbraid thee for coming in unto him, Joh. 6.37. <hi>He that cometh to Chriſt, he will in no wiſe caſt out</hi>; though thou haſt been never ſo great a ſinner, yet thou may'ſt come in and cloſe with Chriſt; for he that comes to him, be he what he will, he will in no wiſe caſt out.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, <hi>Thou wilt fill Heaven with joy, and there will be more melody in Heaven than at the coming in of any Prince to his Kingdom</hi>; and I may ſay unto you, even in this place, if you come in, the Angels will rejoyce at it; for there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Angels ſtand about you; therefore take heed of your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for they come to ſee your behaviour; have a ſpecial care your hearts be ſet upon the work you come about, for they are here to ſee how you carry your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, <hi>In obtaining pardon of ſin and cloſing with Chriſt by faith, thou art made heir of the whole world,</hi> Rom. 4.13. How does many of you Marriners, and others venture upon dangerous voyages to get great Eſtates in this world, and you count them happy that are born to great Eſtates; Why, by cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt by faith for remiſſion of ſins, you are made heirs of the whole world, I mean not of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101278:114"/>
that to come, but of this preſent world, though none of you certainly deſire more than may carry you to Heaven, yet you are true and proper heirs of the whole world: <hi>All is yours,</hi> the Scripture is very clear in it; but I cannot now ſtand to inlarge upon it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. latter end.</p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, <hi>For any thing thou knoweſt, thou art one of Gods Elect, and there is nothing thou art to do, but God hath promiſed to inable thee to do it</hi>; for there is ſuch a tranſaction between God and Chriſt, that he that ſhall be ſaved ſhall not have only ſavour vouchſaf't unto him, but ſhall be inabled to do whatſoever God requires of him, there ſhall be grace given to every one of the Elect of God. And now if thou comeſt in and giveſt up thy ſelf, and all that thou art, haſt or can'ſt do to Chriſt: How knoweſt thou but thou art one of thoſe that art Elect, and ſo ſhall be made for ever happy? But if after all that has been ſaid, thou goeſt away with ſlight thoughts of this rich and tranſcendent grace of pardoning mercy, and doſt not ſet preſently upon the work to obtain it, <hi>Be thou for ever aſhamed and confounded, but let the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy of God be for ever magnified.</hi>
