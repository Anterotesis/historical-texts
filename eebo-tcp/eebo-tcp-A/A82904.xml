            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis houſe hath read the Petition from the County of <hi>Yorke,</hi> the expreſſions wherein, are ſo full of affections to the publike good of the Kingdome, and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they receive it with much content, and ſatisfaction, and aſſure you by me, that your zeale to the common-wealth, hath added much to the honour of your Country; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding me in their names, to returne their very hearty thankes; the Houſe concures with you in opinion, that the onely remedy for this diſtracted Kingdome to recover its ancient ſtrength, happineſſe, and luſtre, is unity; which as it hath ever beene the ayme and ſcope of all their proceedings, ſo ſhall it ever bee the chiefeſt of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. And for this purpoſe they are already upon framing their humble deſires to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, wherein they ſhall requeſt ſuch things as they conceive doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chiefely tend to the honour of God, the greatneſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his Majeſtie, and the publike

good of this Common-wealth, theſe were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perfected before the receipt of your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and will very ſpeedily be ſent to the King, which had beene done ere this, but that his Majeſtie withdrawing himſelfe ſo farre from the Parliament, and thoſe many denyals they have had in thoſe things they have deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, have neceſſitated them to ſpend much of their time in Meſſages, and diverted them from their other more neceſſary buſineſses, but they doubt not but in theſe deſires they will make ſuch cleare demonſtrations of their duty to the King, and love to his people, who have intruſted them, that they ſhall fully acquit themſelves thereof, both to him and them.
