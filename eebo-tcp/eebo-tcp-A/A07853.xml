         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this Booke, that ſheweth dyuers
cauſes how the Peſtilence
may be ingendred.
Capitulo. i.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onſydering that thys
treatiſe is very needfull
and neceſſarye agaynſt
the ſickneſſe of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and for a common
wealth &amp; health of the Queenes liege
people, I Thomas Moulton doctour
of Diuinitie, of the order of the Frere
Preachers, the which for to gather
moueth me for diuers cauſes, the one
is prayers of myne owne bretheren.</p>
            <p>Another is cauſe of prayers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
worthy Gentles.</p>
            <p>And another is compaſſyon that I
haue of the poore people, that was &amp;
is deſtroyed euery day therby, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faute
of helpe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7943:8"/>
And the fourth cauſe that mooueth
the moſt of all, pure conſcience, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
chriſten man, &amp; woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is bound
by the lawe of conſcience, and they
know their euen chriſten in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,
or that is lykely to fal to great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
to helpe them if he maye by his
wit wyth his trauayle, and with hys

me to compounde and to gather
this treatiſe, and to ſet it in printe ſo
in engliſh, that euery man both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and lewde, riche and poore, maye
the better vnderſtand it, and do ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
And ſo euery man, woman, and
chylde to be their own Phiſytion in
time of neede, agaynſt the vengeance
and corruption of the peſtilence, that
now is reigning with other diſeaſes
many mo, and this treatiſe for the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence

partes, and conſequently inſueth the

ſeuen dayes with the Planets, with
the natures and expoſitions of the
xii. ſignes, deuyded by the .xii. months
of the yeare, with the remedyes for
many dyuers other diſeaſes that hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and greeueth the body of man.</p>
            <p>And the fyrſt parte of this booke tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
dyuers cauſes how the peſtilence
may be gendred.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde part telleth how man,
woman and childe, ſhall preſerue and
keepe themſelues from the peſtilence,
if ſo the man woman or chylde be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
that falleth therein.</p>
            <p>The thyrd parte telleth the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
helpe, and medicine agaynſt the
peſtilence.</p>
            <p>In the fyrſt part I ſay of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſe,
as I tolde, be ſhewed dyuers
cauſes, which may be the grounde of
this Peſtilence that nowe reigneth,
I fynde by the treatinge of fower
Doctoures, the fower Pillers that
<pb facs="tcp:7943:9"/>
vpholdeth holy church, that is to ſaye
S. Auſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, S. Ierom, S. Gregory, &amp;
S. Ambroſe, where they ſpeke of this
matter, they ſay, that ſyn that rayg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
among the people, and namely
that ſinne that reigneth among head
men, &amp; the gouernours of the church,
and of the law, is cauſe of the Peſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
Vengeaunce, taken for ſynne.
Hereof I fynde enſample and Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
in holy Wryt, in the ſeconde
booke of Kinges, in the .xxiii. Chapy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
There ſheweth holye Writ open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
that for the ſinne of King Dauid,
God ſent vnto him his Prophet, and
gaue him choyſe of thre things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that he had leuer that GOD
ſhould ſende vpon him for his ſinne,
and of his people, hunger ſeuen yere,
or elſe he had leauer that hee ſhoulde
ſende vpon him purſute of enemies,
and to be ouercome of them thre mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths,
or yet that he had leuer that
<pb facs="tcp:7943:9"/>
he ſhould ſende vpon him Peſtilence
three days &amp; three nights. And than
King Dauid truly choſe Peſtylence,
ſo that from that tyme, that he had
choſen thus peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or it was none
of the day, there was dead. xxvii.M.
of his people. And then King Dauid
ſaw that vengeaunce was taken for
his ſinne by peſtylence, mourningly
with great ſorrow &amp; great compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon
of heart, he cryed God almygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
mercye, and when he had done,
anon the peſtylence ſeaced. And for
ſynne that raigned in the people, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyous
peſtilence hath bene taken, as
was ſhewed on Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as telleth
Vincent in ſpeculo Hiſtoriali, &amp; Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius
telleth the ſame. Therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man in what degree or what
ſtate he be, put away ſinne thorough
hartily ſorrow, and very contricion,
aſking of good mekely mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes
entyrely, and amending
<pb facs="tcp:7943:10"/>
their lyfe, then he putteth away the
cauſe of peſtilence, that in caſe hys
vengeance taken for ſinne, and ſoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
ſauing we ought not to deeme
lightly of Gods priuities, this maye
be wel one cauſe of that hydeous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence,
that now is reigning.</p>
            <p>¶And they ſay generally in thys
realme, and truth it is that many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
are ſhewed, that men likely
deme that this ſinne is cauſe in part
of this peſtilence, as the corrupt ayre
and the venime thereof, the whyche
was cauſed by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and Iouis, the which Planets
their working within fewe yeares,
and the malyce of thy complection,
and of other ſinne, this lefte in the
ayre and beneath, the which malice
and venime hath his reſpecte and
his influence more in the complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of man then of beaſt, in as much
as the working of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction and
<pb facs="tcp:7943:10"/>
of other ſinne was more principally
in the ſin of mankynd, then in the ſin
of another maner of beaſt. But the
working of other coniunctions dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
are before hand had their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the ſignes of other beaſtes, &amp;
thir influence in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plections of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And therefore the malice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions
was cauſe whye that the
morel fell of ſuch beaſt, more then of
other that time, but this coniunction
aforeſayd, the which was wrought
more principally in the ſinne of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd,
more then of any other, whoſe
venime and malice yet reigning, is
the cauſe of the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ayre,
the which ayr corrupt, is cauſe of the
Peſtilence that now is reigning, but
neuertheleſſe if ſo that it bee impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyble
by: all Phyloſophers, that the
Elemente of the Ayre, ſhould in hys
owne kynde, and in his owne
ſubſtaunce be corrupt or elſe infecte,
<pb facs="tcp:7943:11"/>
ſythen it is ſymple and cleane is hys
ſubſtance, wrought without any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
or corruption. Neuertheles yet
by the way of vaporous fumoſytyes
and humors the which that are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and drawen from the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
by vertue at tractife of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that bene aboue, &amp; minged with
the ayre, ſo by accidentall cauſe is the
ayre corrupt and in part cauſe of this
peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But than thou mayſt meue
againſt me, &amp; ſay that if ſo were that
the venemous ayre, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof ſhould be cauſe of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
or elſe man, woman, and child,
ſhuld be infect therby, that it ſemeth
euery man, woman and child, ſhould
be infect &amp; corrupt by the peſtilence.
In the countrey there y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ayre corrupt
is reigning, ſythen the ayre in ſuch a
place is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to al manner of men.
To this anſwered Auicen in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
in the part there he treateth, De
<pb facs="tcp:7943:11"/>
cura februm: that if all the peſtilence
ayre be reygning in a countrey, &amp; if
it be common to all the inhabitantes
of that countrey, yet there ſhall none
be infect therewith, but they that be
repleat, and ful of corrupt humours,
the which corrupte humoures haue
their reſpect, and acording to receiue
the corruption and the venime of the
ayre, elſe in what countrey, or Cittye
that ſuch ayre were corrupt or veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
in al manner of men that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
that ayre in the ſame countrey,
or in the ſame cittye, ſhould be veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and dead therby, ye ſee wel and
know well, that the Element of the
fyre, hath no predomination nor will
not bren, but matter that is combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible,
and according to receiue fyre.
On the ſame wyſe the Elemente of
the ayre that is peſtilence corrupt, in
fecteth neyther man, woman, nor
chylde, but ſuch as haue ſuch veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myd
<pb facs="tcp:7943:12"/>
&amp; corupt humours within them
ſelfe diſpoſed to the ſame, the Peſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
thereof in ſuch tyme that ſuch
peſtilence ayre raignech in.</p>
            <p>After dyuerſity of venemous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and corruption in men reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And through the working of
that venemous peſtilence ayre or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
ſicknes and perillous gendred
in man, woman, and chylde. And
this alteracion in kynd, is wrought
by the malice &amp; influence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuction
aforeſayd, the which malice
of coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is likewiſe to be cauſe
of many other wonderfull alteraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
betwixt King and King, Lord
and Lorde, man and man, woman,
and woman, father &amp; ſonne, brother
and brother, and many other. Alſo it
is lykely to bee cauſe of depoſing of
Lordes out of Lorſhippes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunſing
and inhighing of knaues.
And Emperoures of mighty men,
<pb facs="tcp:7943:12"/>
ſpoyling and deſtroying of Kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Lordſhips. And alſo it is
lyke to be cauſe of great fyres, great
miſts and great water by land. And
cauſe of many great perils by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea.</p>
            <p>Alſo it is lykely to be cauſe of many
wonderful tokenings of great win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ds,
&amp; many other wonderful things.
Alſo deſtroying of many citties, and
principally of the Sariſins ſect, and
of many other wonderfull ſickneſſe.
Alſo the Siſmy of holye Churche is
lykely to ceaſe, and dyuers ſtates to
ende, and therwith many things is
lykely to fall, by the iudgement of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which I will not wryte
for dyuers cauſes. But knowe it
well all manner of menne, that theſe
thinges, I rehearſe not as thinges
told by propheſy, but as concluſions
following and ſhowing by Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and alſo by Aſtrology, for as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
Ipocras in his Booke, that
<pb facs="tcp:7943:13"/>
he made (De Epidimia) there ſhall
neuer Phiſytion be true in working
ne ſure Practiſor of Phiſicke, but he
work and practiſe by rules of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
for Ipocras ſayeth, that it is
impoſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man ſhall cure a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but if he know the cauſe of hys
ſickneſſe, there is ſome ſyckneſſe that
is cauſed by mouing and working of
the bodyes aboue, the which a man
may not know without Aſtronomy
and Aſtrology, than it ſeemeth well
that it is impoſſible to a man to cure
ſickneſſe generally, but he can of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtromye
and of Aſtrology. For as I
fynde in Lybro Interprecationem,
all the fower Elements and al other
things beneath, that bene compound
of them, are gendred by the courſe of
the planets aboue, and all the lyuely
bodyes beneath haue in parte, there
being their heale, &amp; the ſickneſſe by
the mouing of the bodyes aboue.</p>
