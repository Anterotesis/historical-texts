            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>At once his Sceptre and his rule of Sway;</l>
               <l>Whose righteous Lore the Prince had practis'd young,</l>
               <l>And from whose Loyns recorded <hi>Psyche</hi> sprung.</l>
               <l>His Temples last with Poppies were o'erspread,</l>
               <l>That nodding seem'd to consecrate his head:</l>
               <l>Just at that point of time, if Fame not lye,</l>
               <l>On his left hand twelve reverend <hi>Owls</hi> did fly.</l>
               <l>So <hi>Romulus,</hi> 'tis sung, by <hi>Tyber</hi>'s Brook,</l>
               <l>Presage of Sway from twice six Vultures took.</l>
               <l>Th' admiring throng loud acclamations make,</l>
               <l>And Omens of his future Empire take.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Syre</hi> then shook the honours of his head,</l>
               <l>And from his brows damps of oblivion shed</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99523:4"/>
Full on the filial dulness: long he stood,</l>
               <l>Repelling from his Breast the raging God;</l>
               <l>At length burst out in this prophetick mood:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Heavens bless my Son, from <hi>Ireland</hi> let him reign</l>
               <l>To far <hi>Barbadoes</hi> on the Western main;</l>
               <l>Of his Dominion may no end be known,</l>
               <l>And greater than his Father's be his Throne.</l>
               <l>Beyond loves Kingdom let him stretch his Pen;</l>
               <l>He paus'd, and all the people cry'd <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then thus, continu'd he, my Son advance</l>
               <l>Still in new Impudence, new Ignorance.</l>
               <l>Success let others teach, learn thou from me</l>
               <l>Pangs without birth, and fruitless Industry.</l>
               <l>Let <hi>Virtuoso</hi>'s in five years be writ;</l>
               <l>Yet not one thought accuse thy toyl of Wit.</l>
               <l>Let gentle <hi>George</hi> in triumph tread the Stage,</l>
               <l>Make <hi>Dorimant</hi> betray, and <hi>Loveit</hi> rage;</l>
               <l>Let <hi>Cully, Cockwood, Fopling,</hi> charm the Pit,</l>
               <l>And in their folly shew the Writers wit.</l>
               <l>Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence,</l>
               <l>And justifie their Author's want of sense.</l>
               <l>Let 'em be all by thy own model made</l>
               <l>Of dulness, and desire no foreign aid:</l>
               <l>That they to future ages may be known,</l>
               <l>Not Copies drawn, but issue of thy own.</l>
               <l>Nay let thy men of wit too be the same,</l>
               <l>All full of thee, and differing but in name;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99523:4"/>
But let no alien <hi>S—dl—y</hi> interpose</l>
               <l>To lard with wit thy hungry <hi>Epsom</hi> prose.</l>
               <l>And when false flowers of <hi>Rhethorick</hi> thou would'st: cull,</l>
               <l>Trust Nature, do not labour to be dull;</l>
               <l>But write thy best, and top; and in each line,</l>
               <l>Sir <hi>Formal'</hi>s oratory will be thine.</l>
               <l>Sir <hi>Formal,</hi> though unsought, attends thy quill,</l>
               <l>And does thy <hi>Northern Dedications</hi> fill.</l>
               <l>Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame,</l>
               <l>By arrogating <hi>Johnson</hi>'s Hostile name.</l>
               <l>Let Father <hi>Flecnoe</hi> fire thy mind with praise,</l>
               <l>And Uncle <hi>Ogleby</hi> thy envy raise.</l>
               <l>Thou art my blood, where <hi>Johnson</hi> has no part;</l>
               <l>What share have we in Nature or in Art?</l>
               <l>Where did his wit on learning fix a brand,</l>
               <l>And rail at Arts he did not understand?</l>
               <l>Where made he love in Prince <hi>Nicander</hi>'s vein,</l>
               <l>Or swept the dust in <hi>Psyche</hi>'s humble strain?</l>
               <l>Where sold he Bargains, Whip-stich, kiss my Arse,</l>
               <l>Promis'd a Play and dwinled to a Farce?</l>
               <l>When did his Muse from <hi>Fletcher</hi> scenes purloin,</l>
               <l>As thou whole <hi>Eth'ridg</hi> dost transfuse to thine?</l>
               <l>But so transfus'd as Oyl on Waters flow,</l>
               <l>His always floats above, thine sinks below.</l>
               <l>This is thy Province, this thy wondrous way,</l>
               <l>New Humours to invent for each new Play:</l>
               <l>This is that boasted Byas of thy mind,</l>
               <l>By which one way, to dulness, 'tis inclin'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99523:5"/>
Which makes thy writings lean on one side still,</l>
               <l>And in all changes that way bends thy will.</l>
               <l>Nor let thy mountain belly make pretence</l>
               <l>Of likeness; thine's a tympany of sense.</l>
               <l>A Tun of Man in thy large Bulk is writ,</l>
               <l>But sure thou'rt but a Kilderkin of wit.</l>
               <l>Like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep,</l>
               <l>Thy Tragick Muse gives smiles, thy Comick sleep.</l>
               <l>With whate'er gall thou sett'st thy self to write,</l>
               <l>Thy inoffensive Satyrs never bite.</l>
               <l>In thy fellonious heart, though Venom lies,</l>
               <l>It does but touch thy <hi>Irish</hi> pen, and dyes.</l>
               <l>Thy Genius calls thee not to purchase fame</l>
               <l>In keen Iambicks, but mild Anagram:</l>
               <l>Leave writing Plays, and chuse for thy command</l>
               <l>Some peacefull Province in Acrostick Land.</l>
               <l>There thou may'st wings display and Altars raise,</l>
               <l>And torture one poor word Ten thousand ways.</l>
               <l>Or if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents suit,</l>
               <l>Set thy own Songs, and sing them to thy lute.</l>
               <l>He said, but his last words were scarcely heard,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Longvil</hi> had a <hi>Trap</hi> prepar'd,</l>
               <l>And down they sent thee yet declaiming Bard.</l>
               <l>Sinking he left his Drugget robe behind,</l>
               <l>Born upwards by a Subterranean wind.</l>
               <l>The Mantle fell to the young Prophet's part,</l>
               <l>With double portion of his Father's Art.</l>
