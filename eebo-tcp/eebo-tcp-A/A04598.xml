            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For thys onlye cause ded they call hym thydre at that tyme, to ende by hys god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye dyscressyon serten greuouse scysmes and controuersyes, whych had longe (&amp; not without parell) contynued betwixt them.

<pb facs="tcp:21158:3"/>
for that they knewe hym a man of most grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scyence, lernynge, &amp; iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; also natyue borne within their domynyon in a cytie called Ißlebe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Ißleben.</note> And though the treatye of soch polytyck causes perteyned not to hys vocacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>On the xxiiij. daye of Ianuarye abou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te eleuen of the clocke,<note place="margin">Hallis.</note> he came to Hallis and remayned there all that daye forth and iij. dayes after in the howse of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Iustus Ionas. In the meane tyme he made there a solempne sermon in the temple, of the Conuersyon of S. Paule, out of the Apostles Actes.</p>
            <p>On the frydaye after / whych was the xxviii. daye of Ianuarye, he departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hallis with Doctor Ionas and hys iij. sonnes Iohan,<note place="margin">3. sonnes.</note> Martyne, and Paule, &amp; so passed ouer the daungerouse flode in a smal whyrye, takynge hys iournaye from thens towardes Ißleben hys owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue cytie.</p>
            <p>As he had ones entered the countye of


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21158:3"/>
Mansfelde, he was honourablye recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of an C. and xiij. horse men. Anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the charett he became so sore sycke, that all they whych were present,<note place="margin">Sore syck</note> moch doubted of hys lyfe. Wherupon they toke the next harboure, &amp; releued hym with soch prouysyon as there was, so that he was verye cherefull that nyght, and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>playned nomore of sickenesse.</p>
            <p>From the xxix. daye of Ianuarye tyll the xvij. daye of Februarye, he was contynuallye occupyed aboute the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of concorde and agrement of the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seyd noble prynces, bryngynge it vnto a most godlye conclusyon. And besydes hys great laboure in so necessarye a cause,<note place="margin">Preached</note> he preached in the meane tyme iiij. wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thye sermons, and ij. tymes communyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> churche there in the holye supper of the lorde.

            <p>From the afore sayd .xxix. daye of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarye to the xvij. of Februarye, manye a wonderfull sentence came out of hys mouthe, and manye confortable wordes ded he vtter. Manye harde places of the

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge all other, he oft tymes complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of hys age, and sayd. If it pleased God that he came agayne to Wittem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, he wolde desyre no longar to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, but depart in the lorde.</p>
            <p>And alwayes at euen, he vsed by the space of these xxi. dayes, to go from the prynces great haule i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to hys owne cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, where as standynge ryght vp agaynst the wyndowe, he occupyed a serten tyme in most feruent prayer vnto God the eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall father.<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> Wherof we Iustus Ionas, Michael Celius, Ioannes Aurifaber, &amp; Ambrose hys owne seruaunt moch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled, vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dynge oft tymes serten of hys wordes.

Not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withstandynge he came forth that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge &amp; agayne at euen, lyke as he had done euerye daye afore.

            <p>O most blessyd lorde, xx. years are a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye small tyme. Yet if there were no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace therin accordynge to thy godlye creacyon and ordynaunce, the worlde wolde in a maner be clerelye vacaunt, or without people. The greatter part of hys churche, doth God gather vnto hym from infauntes. And verelye I bele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue thys to be true, that whan a yonge childe of one yeare of age dyeth, there departeth out of the worlde with hym<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a M. or ij. of the same age.<note place="margin">Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge.</note> But whan I now depart the worlde whych am thre score yeares olde, there wyll sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nt iij. score depart hens with me of the same age, so fewe are there whych lyue to

            <p>After these communycacyons, he aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se and went vnto hys owne chambre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hys ij. sonnes Martyne and Paule with Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chael Celius folowynge hym.

how he ded? And he complayned of a wonderfull grefe about hys hart. Then ded they confort hym with warmed ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, wherupon he sumwhat amended.</p>

            <p>The same verye tyme that Doctour Martyne went so from hym, I am wele remembred that he sayd thus vnto me.
