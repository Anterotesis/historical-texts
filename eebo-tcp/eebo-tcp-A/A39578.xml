            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of your

make choice of me
(the most unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy)
to preach at
her Funerall. My
affections to you
were strong obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon me, I
was willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any Service
within my compasse
for her that was
dead, from whom I
enjoyed so many real
Respects when she
was alive. I was
Debtor to you both
for very much love,


<pb facs="tcp:109507:4"/>
and therefore willing
to serve you both in
doing this last Office
for her, which was no
other according to
Scripture language)
then your self;<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 28, 29.</note> When
you engaged me to
this work, my hands
were full of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
businesse about
my removal into the
Countrey, which
though it did not take
me off, yet did much
indispose me for this
Service; But being


<pb facs="tcp:109507:5"/>
engaged, I laid aside
(as much as I could)
other thoughts, that I
might be in my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
provided to offer
something which
might be sutable to
the present occasion,
and usefull to those
that should be my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
in that Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
I intended no
more then the service
of my Master, and the
benefit of the hearers
by the bare preaching
of a Sermon. Yet


<pb facs="tcp:109507:5"/>
when it was done,
whiles my affections
were stirring, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I cooled, I was
drawn contrary to
my former inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to promise you
the Notes of what I
had preached<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
since my promise, you
have kept me warm
with your letters, that
I might not recede. I
confess I judge my self

and I have smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for it; for my own


<pb facs="tcp:109507:6"/>
thoughts have been a
press to me, before
my Notes come under
the Press for you. I
know mine own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
and have so
much pride in me, that
I can hardly be willing
that others should
have occasion to take
notice of that naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
But it may be God
may stirre up some
faithfull friend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
some wholsome
reproof upon me, and
that may repair my

was thus exercised, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

further, it is as clear from
the Psalm it self, that those
afflictions which carried his

of this, were such, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with so much bitterness,
that he had much ado to
bridle his passion, nay
though he did with strong

                  <p>That which he declares
in the first part was,</p>
                  <p>1. That he was sensible
of his passion, under the
sense of his affliction, <hi>viz.</hi>
that he had need of a bridle,
when God used a spur. This
is fairly implied, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>2. His resolution to keep
under his passion, when he
felt it began to stirre. <hi>I said

with a ward.<note place="margin">

note upon this is, By how
much any man sets himself
more diligently to bring his
heart to obedience, and
strives to be patient under
his trials, by so much the
more many times is he vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his passions; and
he gives the reason, because
in such a case Satan puts


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109507:17"/>
forth his utmost, to oppose
him in his honest endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
who in the mean
time lets them alone, and
doth not trouble them,
whom he findes senselesse
and careless under the hand
of God. He addes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
perswasive to
those that are troubled with
such inordinate inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to remember <hi>David</hi>
least we faint in our mindes,
and the experience of our
weakness should betray our
hopes.</p>
                  <p>In the verses following
he gives an account of the
language which he uttered,
when his passions got vent,
to <hi>v.</hi> 7. which though they
carry truth in them, and
are an excellent description
of the vanity of mans life,


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109507:18"/>
yet as they were uttered,
and timed, do clearly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
by the context that he
was transported <hi>vitioso ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessu.</hi>
And therefore saith
my former Author, <hi>Non
sine stomacho &amp; indignatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
dicit, Notum fac mihi
Iehovah finem meum,</hi> &amp;c. It
was not without stomack
and passion that he saith,
Lord make me to know
mine end.</p>
                  <p>In the later part you have
the way of <hi>Davids</hi> cure, or
the means by which his soul
was reduced to a quiet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</p>
                  <p>1. Hope in God, <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>2. Prayer to God, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>3. The serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Gods hand in the
evils which he suffered; by
which he doth correct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109507:18"/>
for the breakings out
of his passion before. As if
he had said, Oh my soul,
dost thou consider from
whom thy afflictions come,
that thou thus complainest?
Thou hast to deal with God,
not with man; What dost
thou mean thus to lift up
thy self? God hath done it,
and wilt thou call him to
account? This was of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
use to stop his
mouth, to call in his heat,
to temper his passion, <hi>I was
dumb, I opened not my mouth,

                  <p>5. The Saint is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
at home; the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate

play its part, as one active
and in arms to keep down
the risings of those mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert

the soul which will lie down

kept down; where was the

told God to his face, <hi>He did

<hi>Jeremiah Cursed the day of

get advantage, and when
there is occasion he puts on

disorder, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 11. Besides,
knowing his advantage, how

                  <p>7. When the passions are

even for grace it self to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et

the man the worse the fact,

of his passions, the

he be not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>5. It is most unbeseeming
and unworthy of a Saint to
be often and ordinarily
transported with inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
passions. Not only in

to be moved to unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse,

be subject to passion,
and can hardly keep them
down, no wonder if other
men utterly destitute of
grace do grow drunk and
mad with passion in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
Though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be excused, there is no
better to be expected; Their
passions are ridden without

to see <hi>Saul</hi> in a passion?

though they be

something of their weight.
Perfection is not to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

pressed after it, but he tels
us also that he did not reach
it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>3. Though you take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to judge the weakness
of a Saint, and do call pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
when it is inordinate
an evil (for so it is) yet
you ought not presently to
censure and conclude the
man to be evil, because in
affliction thou seest him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
by his passion. There
is bitternesse in affliction
(which I might have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109507:24"/>
as a reason) and no
wonder if the bitternesse of
the Crosse do draw out the
bitternesse of the Patient.
If you see a man under his
passion you see him in an
ill time to make a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

been a Saint that should
have seen no more of him

the affliction is in its

                  <p>To clear this, consider</p>
                  <p>1. That all the evils of

of God; Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel

He himself owns
all the evil of affliction, as
the Author of it, <hi>Amos 3.
6. Isa.</hi> 45. 7. and therefore
we offer no injury to his
Holinesse, when we ascribe
it to him. <hi>Job</hi> made no
scruple to say, when <hi>Sabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Caldeans</hi> had plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him of his substance

<hi>That the Lord had taken,
Job</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Understand therefore,</p>
                  <p>1. That the affliction or
punishment, under which
any man suffers, is to be

of the Instruments that are

commit it, the affliction is
Gods, though God makes
use of an Instrument to
execute his purpose in the
chastisement of his Childe,
yet he puts no vitiosity into
the Instrument that he
makes use of. Evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
act crookedly,
out of their own stock.</p>
                  <p>2. God is a free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
Agent; He may use
what Instrument he will to
serve his own purpose;
and may suffer the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to use its freedom
about the doing of his
work, to bring about his
end by the Instrument, as
he did in the crucifying of
Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. God
is not, cannot be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109507:31"/>
of sinne; but it must
ever be acknowledged, that
he is, and cannot but be,
the orderer and disposer of
it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 22, 23, 24. It
is his pleasure to suffer sin
to be in the world, and
whiles it is in the world it is
not strange, if he order
the sinne of a wicked man,
to correct and punish the
sins of good men, as is clear

back, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>3. Though men cannot
make use of other mens
sins, to bring about their
ends without defiling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
(and therefore he
that doth not hinder is said
to command, rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood)
yet God can,


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109507:31"/>
and doth, by the sinnes of
the worst men, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to their intentions, work
out his own glory, and his
peoples good, without the
least touch of pollution to
himself, the least impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Honour, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and Justice, <hi>Exodus</hi>
9. 12. and 17. These things
considered, <hi>viz.</hi> That God
is not the Authour of the
Instruments sinne, but the
wise orderer of it, and that
he hath skill, and doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the sins of men, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
his people to serve
his own glory, and their
good, we need not be
afraid to say, That God is
the Authour of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatsoever it is, where
men that are the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the affliction, are


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109507:32"/>
Authors of the sin. I shall
apply this briefly.</p>
                  <p>It follows,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Job 5. 6.</note> as in <hi>Job 5. 6.
That afflictions spring not
out of the dust,</hi> neither do
they come by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hance;
which way soever they
come, the most high God
hath a hand in them.</p>
                  <p>2. It is folly much to eye
the Instrument in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in cases where Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are used. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
is but Gods Rod,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 17 13, 14. and could
not act, if it were not let
out, and ordered by the
principal Agent.</p>
                  <p>3. Whatever the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is that we are any of us
exercised with, it is duty
to look up above the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
<hi>(i. e.)</hi> to see the
hand of God which guides


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109507:32"/>
the Instrument, to own him
in it, to fall down before
him, to hear what he
speaks, and observe him
carefully in all that befals
us. Thus did <hi>David</hi> in this
Text, and in the case of
<hi>Shime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 10. And
so <hi>Job,</hi> Job 1. Well were
it if we could all do so,
both in reference to the
general and publick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
upon the Nation;
and in relation to our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
and personal trials.
We are apt to dwell too
much upon the second
causes, and neglect the
first.</p>
                  <p>4. It sheweth us whether
to go for the moderating,
removing, bearing, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of our affliction <hi>(i.
e.)</hi> to him whose hand is


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109507:33"/>
stretched out against us in
the affliction. Our way is
to God by Repentance,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 1. &amp; 14. and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
prayer, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 1, 2.
Thus God teacheth, <hi>Ps.</hi> 50.
and the Saints have learned,
<hi>Ps.</hi> 116. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>5. You may see upon
whom you must trust, in
the presence and use of all
means, when you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
affliction. You may
make use of Physicians,
Estates, Friends, other
Creatures to help. It is
duty to use them, and
mercy to have them. But
you must trust in none for
your help in affliction, but
in him that hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the affliction. It
was <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

in the Physician, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>


                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:109507:33"/>
16. 12. It is the rich mans
to trust in his wealth, <hi>Pro.</hi>
10. 15. None of these can
help without God; He
that breaks must binde up;
He that smites must heal.
If God be the Authour of
the affliction,<note place="margin">Hos. 6. 1.</note> it is too hard
a work for any creature
without God, to be the
Author of the Cure.</p>
                  <p>6. You may by this
judge whether you must
carry the glory, and to
whom you must pay the
Tribute, for moderating,
removing, sanctifying your
afflictions; Sure it must be
to him that is both the
Author of the affliction,
and of this Grace also, to
moderate, remove, or san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie.
In all our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we may take notice


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109507:34"/>
of something of mercy.
And whatever we can take
notice of in this kinde, it
is Gods work that is the
Author of the affliction:
And if the mercy be hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

let not another have the
glory, nor let him want
it that so well deserve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
Our afflictions, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they be, are not so
great, so long, so sharp,
so mischievous, as God
could make them: And if
he cut off any thing of
the time or measure, we
have reason to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him, <hi>Lam. 3. 22. Ezr.</hi>
9. 3.</p>
                  <p>7. It is the great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
of good men, that
God is the Authour of
affliction, though men that
are wicked are sometimes


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109507:34"/>
imployed as Instruments
about them: Though the
Instrument be an enemy,
and would devour and

Yet he that is the Author,

assure themselves, that the
Authour will not resign
up his Soveraignty to the
Instrument; It shall not
be as wicked men would
have it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76. 10. Nor
is it possible that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions

should hurt them, because

                     </gap>s, from pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
distempers. He that
considers that he hath to


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109507:39"/>
do with God in his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
may easily see he
should have nothing to do
with passion in his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>David</hi> saw this, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
it, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly
this Consideration (God
hath done it) should and
will where it is rightly
improved keep a man,</p>
                  <p>1. From complaining at
his Condition, or at the
measure he hath from the
hands of God. A Christian
hath no ground for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
when he is under
any affliction, though it be
sharp and long. Be it what
it will, yet <hi>Lam. 3. 39. Why
doth a living man complain?</hi>
The holy Ghost insinuates,
That a living man hath no
room for complaint. If he


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109507:39"/>
will complain, he must bring
it home to himself, and
discharge God. If he say,
God hath done it; He stops
his own mouth; Therefore
he should not complain,
especially since he hath
Gods Answer, <hi>A man for
his sin.</hi> Though God have
done it, sinne hath caused
it. So much as there is of
complaint reflecting upon
God, in our afflictions, so
much is wanting of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to God, by that
complaint. This Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is good to cut
off complaining, a thing
that we are all apt to
do when we have little
cause.</p>
                  <p>2. If it will keep a man
from complaining, which
hath something of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109507:40"/>
in it, it will much
lesse admit of disputing
and reasoning with God,
which hath too much of
pride and sawcinesse in it.
Mans reason cannot finde
a flaw in Gods working;
nor will he suffer it, that
when he hath done man
should dispute. It is his
duty to believe that which
is above his reason. He
must not argue with God,
because he cannot finde
Gods reason in his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
<hi>Rom. 9. 20. Nay,
but O man, who art thou
that repliest against God?</hi>
You may perhaps finde
some good men that have
ventured upon this in their
affliction, but it was when
passion had got the upper
hand of patience; <hi>Job,</hi>


                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:109507:40"/>
that went farre,<note place="margin">Job 13. 19 &amp; 23. 3, 4.</note> did not
dispute so long as his eye
was kept clear upon this
consideration, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21, 22.
And what he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
upon temptation,
and the stirring of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
he was ashamed of
it, when he had done.
Humble Expostulations,<note place="margin">Psal. 44. 23, 24, 25.</note>
God hath sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and the Saints
practised, when it hath
been to expresse the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of holy desires: but
carnall reasonings, and
proud disputes, the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of discontent and
maintenance of a quarrel,
have no place against Gods
providence, <hi>God hath done
it,</hi> if it be improved, will

keep a man from complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and disputing, it cannot
want any thing to keep
him from fretting and
murmuring at his affliction.
Shall dust and ashes be
angry with his Maker? or
man that is a worm suffer
his bloud to heat, his
passions to boyl up, if he
consider that God hath
done it? Suppose an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
be sharp and long,
Instruments used about it,
be wicked, unjust, cruell,
yet if he consider, that he
hath to do with God, and
that it is God that hath
to do with him, that it is
God that appoints and
orders his affliction, with
all its adjuncts and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
he will see little


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109507:41"/>
reason to give vent to his
passions, because of the
bitterness of his afflictions.
It is weaknesse to be angry
with the Instrument: (yea
though it act crookedly,
and voluntarily) but it is
madnesse to be angry and
tetchy with God, that
orders and guides the
Instrument to serve his
purpose. Foolish man that
sufferest thy self to be
fired with thy Cross, dost
thou know at whom thou
murmurest and repinest?
Sure thou neither knowest
against whom thou quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellest,
nor what he is, nor
what thou art, nor what
thou dost; If thou didst,
thou wouldst leap into the
water to cool thy self for

We reade of one good

lies as a brand of infamy

He stands in the Text as

take heed of such folly.
When thou art under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,

                  </p>
                  <p>I suppose this Doctrine
cannot want reason to
convince any man that
hath reason; it self is


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109507:42"/>
reason, and such as a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

would sit down and submit
unto; for Nature it self
teacheth, That, what a
God doth, cannot admit
of that creatures contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
subjection to such a
Deity. Reason will not
suffer a man to make his
dealings with his fellow
creatures, even with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
a measure for his
dealings with God, that
stands so much above
him.</p>
                  <p>But let us see what Use
may be made of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And it follows from
hence,</p>
                  <p>1. That one of the main
and capitall reasons of the
<hi>non</hi>-submission,<note place="margin">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109507:43"/>
and discontent of men,
under the Discipline of
the Rod, is the <hi>non</hi>-consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
or want of the
effectuall improvement of
this Consideration, that
their afflictions are ordered
and disposed by God, that
what is their suffering is
Gods doing. There is a
great deal of weaknesse
and sinfull folly discovered
in the afflicted state of the
children of men: And to
speak truth the godly
themselves have not been
all, nor alwaies clear in this
matter.</p>
                  <p>1. Sometimes we finde
some of them sullen and
dogged under their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and because they
could not be free from
trouble, therefore in a fit


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109507:43"/>
they would die before their
time. Some think this
<hi>Psalm</hi> points at such a
mood as this in the Prophet
that wrote it. But you are
sure to finde <hi>Jonah</hi> in such a
fit, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes full of
complaint under their
burthens, <hi>Was ever sorrow
like my sorrow?</hi> Lam. 1. 12.
Sometimes the kinde of
the affliction doth not
please them, otherwhiles
the season that God takes,
suites not with them. Again,
the smart, bitternes, length,
measure, manner of Gods
dealing is matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
one thing or other,
we are apt to finde fault
with in Gods dispensation,
rather then set the saddle
upon the right horse <hi>(i. e.)</hi>


                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:109507:44"/>
to finde fault with our own
provocation.</p>
                  <p>3. Sometimes they accuse
God, and accuse him falsly,
as if he dealt hardly and
unjustly with them,<note place="margin">Job 16. 11 to 19.</note> as if
because he doth chastise
them, therefore he did not
love them, or were become
their enemy, because he
doth not indulge their
folly.</p>
                  <p>4. Sometimes you may
finde them in the Schools,<note place="margin">Job 16. 21 &amp; 13. 23, 24.</note>
they will question Gods
dispensations towards them.
If they must suffer they
will dispute it, and know
the reason why. Nay, they
will climb up to the Bench,
and call God to the Bar,
to give an account of his
dealing. And thus in a
sort they make themselves


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109507:44"/>
the Gods, and God the
creature. Such a thing is in
it, though me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> do not think
on it.</p>
                  <p>5. Some men in their
affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction, cast off their
dependance, and will <hi>wait
no longer,</hi> 2 Kings 6. 33.
They are in haste, and if
God will not help them,
they will try somewhere
else: A Witch, a Devil,
any one shall be the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician

the Cure sooner then God
doth.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 6, 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Sometimes they fall
to fretting, they fume and
chafe, and storm, and rage,
and fling, as if they would
break all in peeces, and
play the <hi>Samsons,</hi> to knap
in sunder the cords where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God bindes them;

Not that they can do any
thing, but to shew that
they are mad,<note place="margin">Jonah 4.</note> and must be
bound.</p>
                  <p>7. Sometimes they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond
under their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and cast off their
confidence,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 27 1.</note> as if they
doubted of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the promise,<note place="margin">Psal. 116. 11.</note> because
hope is deferred, and they
have not that in their hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
which they have in their
eyes.</p>
                  <p>8. Sometimes they have
so little wit, as with the
dog to lie biting of the
stone; I mean, to flie upon
the Instruments, which God
useth in afflicting them.
They will not seem to
quarrell with God, but
they will pick an hundred
quarrels with the Rod<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:109507:45"/>
that is in his hand. It is
easie to interpret their
meaning.</p>
                  <p>9. Sometimes <hi>Non</hi>-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
is expressed by
excessive and immoderate
mourning under their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
And thus it is
with some (especially in
the losse of near Friends
and relations) though they
say little, yet they grieve
much, their eyes speak a
great deal more then their
tongues. But it is all one
as if they did speak with
their tongues, God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
it; where there is
too much of grief, there
is something of discontent.
He doth not submit aright
to the hand of God, that
suffers himself to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with sorrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109507:46"/>
Gods hand. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
supposeth such a thing
as this.</p>
                  <p>10. Sometimes it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
unhappily by the
neglect or giving over
duty,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 13.</note> and so it hath been
sometimes in pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
upon surprisal. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in passion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.
8, 9. But what ever is
the rise of it, the thing is
nought.</p>
                  <p>Now whence all this,
and all the rest that breaks
forth into a seab in mens
carriages under affliction?
Is it not hence, that men
do not in their affliction
consider that they are u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the hand of God, that
all that which they are
discontent at, and quarrel


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109507:46"/>
with, is Gods doing? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
it is from hence,
at least this bears a part.
If there were more of the
one, there should be lesse
of the other, lesse passion
if more serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this truth: I appeal
to any conscientious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
whether when they
have lashed out into any
passionate discontents by
reason of their sufferings,
they do not finde upon
reflection, that this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
hath lien asleep,
at lest hath not been
throughly improved; He
that sayes he doth seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
consider this, and
yet findes his heart to rise
and quarrell with God,
says also that his heart is
above measure proud and


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109507:47"/>
stout against God. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
this is one, and a
prevailing ground of the
distempers that are in the
soul, for the afflictions
that are upon the man, not
considering that God hath
done it.</p>
                  <p>2. Hence it will follow,
That none but a gracious
heart can carry it with
holy submission, quietly,
and without distemper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
affliction, especially
when afflictions are sharp
and pinching: And the
reason is, because none but
a gracious heart can make
a right improvement of
this Consideration. Where
there is not a distinct
knowledge of God, of his
Attributes, of his Ends, and
the fear of God to make


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109507:47"/>
the heart stand in awe of
him; it is not possible this
Consideration should work
up to such an effect, as
appeared in the Prophet
in this place. I doubt not
but a Heathen might be
convinced of the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of this, that what
is done by his God, should
not be contradicted by
himself; but it must be a
higher principle that must
enable him to practise, to
make such an improvement
of his consideration, that
it may balance his spirit,
and keep it even. There
must be something more
then reason, to keep under
the boylings of passion,
when a man is scorched
and pained with his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
This is an excellent


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109507:48"/>
reason indeed to balance
the spirit of a man: but
if there be not grace to
husband and advance this
reason, the pot will boyl
over notwithstanding.</p>
                  <p>And this is a main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the different carriage
between a godly man and
a wicked man in time of
affliction, I mean, when
each of them acts like
himself, and as such. Take
a godly man, and a wicked
man, and suppose their
afflictions equall, yet you
shall ordinarily see a deal
of difference in the temper,
and behaviour of the men,
in reference to their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
As the men differ
so their carriage. As they
differ in their principles,
so you shall finde them in


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109507:48"/>
their practice. The one
stoops, is quiet, dumb,
silent, acknowledgeth the
hand of God, and blesseth
him, <hi>Job 1. 20, 21, Levit.
10. 3. 1 Sam.</hi> 3. 18. The
other frets; is impatient,
discontent, cannot endure
the yoke, and therefore
labours to shake it off, will
do any thing, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so unlawful, to get his
leg out of the stocks. <hi>Job</hi> 2. 9.
You have a veryful instance
in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. 5, 6, 7.
There is in ordinary abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of difference between
good and bad men in the
carrying of the crosse; And
if it be examined, this
will be found to have an
influence upon the better
side, <hi>viz.</hi> the help of this
consideration, That God


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109507:49"/>
hath done it, and grace to
improve it.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>If it be said,</hi>
Some wicked men lie as
quietly under affliction, as
any men, not expressing any
thing of impatience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There may be
something like patience,
and submission to the hand
of God, discovered in a
wicked man under afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which if examined, is
but a counterfeit; They
are silent sometimes out of</p>
                  <p>1. A Stoical Apathy.</p>
                  <p>2. Or from natural cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
                  <p>3. Sometimes out of meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullennesse.</p>
                  <p>4. Or from some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Conscience
working servile fear, or
something else like these,


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109507:49"/>
but none of these, no nor
all of them together do
amount to that which we
now treat of, <hi>viz.</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
humble, silent submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
under affliction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
wrought out by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
improvement of
Gods hand in the affliction
that lies upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you give us
some Instances of very holy
men, who under affliction
have seemed to carry it as
frowardly, and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
as much passion as the
worst.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It must be confest,
And this doth so much
the more confirm the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
and Inference, That
where Grace is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nting,
an holy submission to Gods
hand (as the hand of God)


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109507:50"/>
must needs be wanting. It
is hardly done where there
is grace, and therefore
where it is not, it is
not to be expected; Know
then</p>
                  <p>1. That the Judgements
of those that are gracious
ones are right for this,
That when God strikes,
they should be dumb and
silent.<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 26, 27.</note> They own it as
good to do so,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14, 16.</note> though
sometime they do not the
good they own.</p>
                  <p>2. It is in their scope to
be that in performance,
which they are in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to practise as they
judge. Every gracious
heart resolves to keep the
Commandments of God,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 115. And because
the Command reacheth


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109507:50"/>
their tongues, therefore to
bridle their lips when Gods
rod is upon their backs, <hi>v. 1.
I said I will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It is in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
as well as in their
purpose; They know it to be
their duty, and as duty they
set upon what they know,
<hi>v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. I was dumb, I held my
peace.</hi> They are fruitlesse
and vain purposes that are
not seconded with some
endeavours. <hi>Job,</hi> though
surprized afterward, held
in to a miracle the first
and second bouts that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
had with him, <hi>Job</hi> 1:
21, 22. &amp; 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>4. But the best of the
Saints that is here in a
bearing Condition hath
flesh in him as well as
Spirit. And hence it is,


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109507:51"/>
that the worser part is
sometimes the stronger by
the advantage of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then passion gets
the upperhand of patience,
as otherwhiles patience
doth of passion. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is but in the fight,
not come to a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 26. And
whiles he is in fight, it
may be his unhappinesse
to have his affections rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till he rally again. He
is sure he shall have the
victory at the last, but not
sure that he shall get that
victory without wounds. It
is thus with the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Saints, often down
and up again, as I have
instanced. And therefore
it can hardly be expected
of any that he should be


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109507:51"/>
altogether, and at all times
so impassionate, as he is at
some.</p>
                  <p>5. If he be overcome,
and do speak unadvisedly
with his lips, or manifest
impatience under the rod,
there is this to say for him
to witnesse him a Saint, to
distinguish him from a
fool.</p>
                  <p>1. That he doth it not
easily, much lesse upon
choise. It is usually upon
surprisal, temptation, or in
desertion, when he is not
himself, when he hath not
his arms about him, his
graces ready. <hi>Job</hi> was
beaten out of his possession,
<hi>Job</hi> 3. 2. but it was upon very
strong assaults.</p>
                  <p>2. When he hath lost
any ground to the enemy,


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109507:52"/>
he is ashamed that the
enemy hath got it, and he
hath lost it. It is not
usual with him to justifie
himself in his folly, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
seemed to do, before
he cooled, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. But to
mourn for what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help, and to abhorre
himself for what he
hath done against his
God.<note place="margin">Job 42. 6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Though he fall yet
he doth not lie, he gets
up again; he never rests
till he have recovered his
losses, till his wounds be
cured. Thus <hi>David</hi> in this
Psalm. And when he is
up, he watcheth more
narrowly, and fights the
next bout<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, better then he
did the last.</p>
                  <p>3. Now it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109507:52"/>
for us to examine our
selves what we have been,<note place="margin">Vse. Examin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </note>
and what we have done,
when we have been under
affliction. There is no
question but we have all
tasted of sorrow more or
lesse, in one kinde or other,
in our bodies, names, estates,
relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all, <hi>Man is born to
trouble,</hi> Job 5. 7. But it is
a very great Question,
Whether we have been like
<hi>David</hi> in our afflictions?
Whether we have been
dumb, and not opened our
mouths? Or if we have,
Whether it have been upon
this Consideration, because
God hath done it? Few
can say they have been
silent, but fewer, that it

ground; Let us look into
both.</p>
                  <p>1. Have you been silent:
Can you say?</p>
                  <p>1. That you have used
no impatient Complaints
under affliction, as if your
sorrow had never been
fellowed, nor any suffered
as you have done. It is
very ordinary,<note place="margin">Lam 1. 12</note> especially
under pinching crosses, for
a man to aggravate his
own sufferings, to think
his own greatest, because
he doth not know what
other men feel in theirs.
But certainly too much
complaining argues too
little patience, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>To complain excessively,
to aggravate our griefs, is
not to be dumb. It is a
sign we feel sinne too little,


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109507:53"/>
when we complain of smart
so much.</p>
                  <p>2. Have you not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
accused God, as
dealing too severely with
you. If not in words, yet
will conscience clear you
for your thoughts, that
you have not condemned
God, as too hard a master.
Thinking is speaking with
God; if we have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
such thoughts, and
not shut them out when
they have offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
we have not been
dumb.</p>
                  <p>3. Have you never in
the Confidence of your
own Logick, challenged
God to a dispute, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of him a reason of
his matters, as if he should
not chastize his Creature,


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109507:54"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nlesse first he should
give his Creature an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
why he doth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stize.
This I beleeve is
more ordinary, then is
ordinarily thought of. I
have known some that have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sed strange boldnesse with
God in this kinde. But
that man that will have a
reason from God of his
dispensations towards him,
discovers plainly enough,
that he is at present outed
of his own. If they did
either know themselves
what vermine they are,
or did acknowledge God
in the greatnesse of his
Soveraignty, they would
quickly give that proud
humour an answer with
rebuke.</p>
                  <p>4. When you have been


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109507:54"/>
under affliction, have you
used no indirect means to
come to the end of your
affliction, before your affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hath had its end on
you? When God hath put
you into the prison, have
you staid there, till his
discharge hath been your
warrant? Oh how many
good men miscarry in this
case, using false keys to
open the doors, or bribing
the keepers to connive at
an escape before they have
obtained a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in our times have ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of <hi>Samaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Have you not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
cast away your
confidence, and laid aside
your hopes, as if because
God doth sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
therefore he would
deny, and that you
should never have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
because it comes
not just when you look
for it. It is too ordinary
in our afflictions, to give
way to dejection, and so
to make our yokes heavJer
while they are on, because
God is not pleased so soon
as we would have him to
take them off,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 27. 1.</note> What is
the language? I shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
I shall be undone, I

Thou art not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with Gods dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore through
unbelief wilt forestall his
compassion.</p>
                  <p>6. Though you durst
not seem to make many
words with God when
you have been in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet can you say, you
have let the Instrument
passe so quietly, as it should
have done, because an
Instrument in Gods hand.
This bewrayes many a
mans impatiency and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
that though he
sayes nothing to God, yet
he speaks a great deal too
much to the Rod that
God useth. Few men will


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109507:56"/>
let him that curseth him
passe, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Shimei,
2 Sam.</hi> 16. 10. Nay rather
we say, what God sayes,
<hi>Say not</hi> (Prov. 20. 22.) <hi>Say
not thou, I will recompense
evil.</hi> Let God say what
he will, we many of us
take liberty to say, and
do what we list, to requite
what we call our injuries
upon the Instrument: But
he deceives himself who
thinks he is silent towards
God, while he vents his
passion against the Rod
that God layes upon his
back; God will interpret
we mean him by our
quarrelling with his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                  <p>7. Have you moderated
your passions, and not
suffered the flouds to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109507:56"/>
the banks? when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
have been sharp,
and perhaps renewed, have
you not suffered your
selves to be drowned with
sorrow, and your spirits
to be overwhelmed? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we suffer our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
to eat up all our
comforts, and because we
cannot enjoy what we
would, therefore will not
take the benefit of what
we have. This is not
dumbnesse, but discontent.
It is peevishnesse in a
childe,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 33. &amp; 19. 1. 4.</note> because he hath
been whipped for his fault,
to refuse his meat. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
if we give way to
immoderate sorrow in our
afflictions, so as to refuse
to eat our bread, to serve
our relations, to neglect


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109507:57"/>
our duties either to God
or man, in our silence we
speak a language, which
God understands to be
impatient.<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 13.</note> To sorrow
without hope, is to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
without submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>So much for bare silence,
but we have another search
to make.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether we have
been silent upon this ground,
because whatever be the
affliction, it hath God for
the Authour, It is of his
doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Sometimes men
are dumb and silent under
affliction, out of pure Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
are not sensible
of the evil that lies upon
them, and the reason why


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109507:57"/>
they do not complain, is
because they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand:
And this is
not,<note place="margin">Hos. 7. 9.</note> because its Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes men are
silent, because they are
sullen, they restrain speech,
not to restrain passion,
but to gratifie pride, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they will enjoy an
humour, not because they
will expresse their patience.
This is not upon the
ground in the Text, because
its Gods doing.</p>
                  <p>3. Some men are si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
out of a stoicall
Apathy, because they
think they ought not to
be moved with any thing
that befals them, that it
is altogether below a man
that hath reason, to be


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109507:58"/>
affected with passion in
any case, either to rejoyce
in any good, or to mourn
for any evil. This is Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism,
not Christian silence,
much lesse upon this
ground, because God hath
done it.</p>
                  <p>4. There may be silence
out of a naturall Astorgy,
as being in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
without natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Though it be not
common, nor in the power
of any man, by the strength
of reason wholly to ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and lay asleep his
affections, according to the
Stoical dream,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 31.</note> yet it is
natural to some men to
be in a great measure
without naturall affection,
very unapt to be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or moved with any


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109507:58"/>
changes that do befall
them: yet this is not grace,
but a naturall indisposition
to sense any thing with
vehemency of affection:
One man burieth a wife,
and the burial of the wife
is almost the death of the
husband. He feels himself
half dead, because the
Companion of his life is
dead which was one half
of himself. I do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
this. Another buries
a wife, and scarc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> knows
what he buries <hi>(i. e.)</hi> is
so little affected with it,
that one would think he
buried that which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
loved. This is a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Ro</note>
not a vertue.</p>
                  <p>5. There may be silence
out of a naturall Courage,
raised by the study of


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109507:59"/>
morality. In morals there
are vertues called Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
Fortitude, to which
are opposed Cowardize,
Pusillanimity, weaknesse
of Spirit. The vertues are
seen in undertaking great
difficulties without recoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
bearing great trials
without shrinking. Now
some men bear their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
with a seeming
invinciblenesse <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they
bear them with so much
courage, that he that looks
on would think they did
not bear them. The setting
of a joynt, the dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
of their bodies, the
ripping up of the flesh,
seems as little to them as
to another; the opening of
a vein, the pulling out
of a tooth; And what is


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109507:59"/>
all this? Christian pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
holy submission, No,
it may be nothing but
natural stoutnesse, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by principles of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
because it speaks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and magnanimity
to bear great things without
the appearance of great
passion.</p>
                  <p>6. It may possibly be
upon strong Convictions
of sinne, and the workings
of a naturall Conscience,
labouring under guilt, and
the fear of some greater
evil. He that is in the
hands of an enemy, though
he have, and do suffer
much by him, yet is silent
under his present suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
because he knows he
is still liable to worse, that
he that hath plundred his


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109507:60"/>
pockets, and given him a
cut in the arm, hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
when he will to let
him bloud in the throat,
or in the heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he concludes it is best
to take that patiently, that
is done, lest he bring some
greater mischief upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by his impatiency. Thus
I believe it is with some
natural men, when God
layes his hand upon them
by some smarting affliction,
Conscience flies in their
faces, tels them now they
are in the hands of an
enemy, that he that hath
arrested them is he, that
they have sinned against
by oaths, perjuries, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
whoredom, bloud,
oppression; that he that
punisheth with sicknesse,


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109507:60"/>
losses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is able to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
with flames; that now
his body is not onely in
danger of death, but his
soul of Hell. This Alarm
from Conscience makes
him lie still: He dares
not complain of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
burthen, because h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
sees he is within the reach
of that which is a thousand
times worse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But what then will
argue our silence upon this
Consideration that God hath
done it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. When the heart
is sensible, that in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
it hath to do with
God, and is more awed
with the thoughts of him
that is the Author of the
affliction, then with the
affliction it self, of which


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:109507:61"/>
he is the Author. Thus
it was certainly with <hi>Job,
The Lord giveth, and the
Lord hath taken away.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 1.</note> It
is a very ill sign when on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pain, sicknesse, losse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do break our spirits,
but he that sends them is
not considered. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a great deal to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Authour, though
we should forget the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
then to be affected
with the affliction, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the Author.</p>
                  <p>2. If it be because God
hath done it, then the soul
will be free to condemn it
self, and justifie God in
all his dispensations. The
sanctified soul knows that
God can do nothing but
that which is righteous
towards his Creature, and


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109507:61"/>
therefore it must needs
justifie him in that which
he doth.<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 7, 14.</note> And this justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of God in his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 12. 6.</note>
is an argument that
his eye is upon him whom
he justifies,<note place="margin">Lam. 1. 18</note> and that he
sees it were an unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing to quarrel with
him for the doing of that
which he cannot but
clear him for in his own
conscience, when it is
done.</p>
                  <p>3. He that hath his
heart quieted, and his
mouth stopped, upon this
ground, because God hath
done it, will upon the
same ground labour to
be quiet, though his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
encrease, because he
hath the same reason ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still before him. The


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109507:62"/>
encreasing, multiplying,
lengthening of afflictions
is from the same hand.<note place="margin">Job 1. 21. <hi>When all came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet</hi> Job <hi>could say,</hi> The Lord hath taken, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Name of the Lord.</note> He
is as really the Authour
of the weight and measure,
as of the kinde and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of any affliction.
Indeed if this consideration
be laid aside, there may
be a change. It cannot
be expected of any plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
that it should ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
except it be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>4. He that is silent upon
this Consideration,<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 26. <hi>ad</hi> 34.</note> will
not make haste out of his
affliction.<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 33</note> He knows the
wise God can do nothing
without an end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will be contented
to wait upon God till he
have accomplished his end
in afflicting him. Because


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109507:62"/>
it is physick from the most
skilfull Physician, therefore
he will submit to the
Judgment of his Physician,
how long to continue in
that course. And because
God delights not in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
but strikes with
bowels, he concludes, that
so much the longer his
course, so much the greater
his benefit.</p>
                  <p>5. He that is quiet upon
this ground,<note place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> will upon the
same ground, as well blesse
God in his affliction, as
submit to his afflicting
hand. As you see it in
<hi>Job, The Lord hath given,
and the Lord hath taken,
Blessed be the Name of the
Lord.</hi> He eyed God both
in his safety and sufferings.
He saw both coming from


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109507:63"/>
the same hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were both worthy of
the same acknowledgment.
Since it was God that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
him, he must needs
be thankfull, for he knew
God could doe nothing
but what was worthy of
praise.</p>
                  <p>6. If it be because God
hath done it, then you
will not hear of any thing
from any other hand that
should raise up any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
in you against God:
Your souls will abhorre
any of these suggestions
from whomsoever they
come, that shall seem to
cast any blemish upon him,
or tend to work the least
discontent in you. When

The same Consideration

let this be the practise.
And now let it be yours,
that are at present called to
this exercise. For this end
consider</p>
                  <p>1. It is the will of God
it should be so; when he
strikes, he would have
his people submit, not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
or dispute, <hi>Luk. 21. 19.
Iam.</hi> 4. 7, 10.</p>
                  <p>2. The best Saints, when
they have been themselves,
and not outed their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
have done so. <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>

                  <p>3. When they have been
overtaken with passion,<note place="margin">Job 42. 6.</note>

Shame and repentance is
the best that comes of

                  <p>4. There is all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the world for our
silence under affliction,
because we create all our
own grief; we sin before
God-strikes:<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 39.</note> Shall he that
challengeth the field com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of his wounds? And
if we sinne against God,
Shall we not be dumb
when God afflicts us for
our sin? Shall we provoke
God by sinne, and yet
quarrell with God, when


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109507:66"/>
we have provoked him?

                  <p>5. It is very honourable
for a Christian, and a pious
thing to be silent and
quiet under Gods hand.
God sets a Crown upon
<hi>Jobs</hi> head for this, and
forgets his passion, because
he had been acquainted
with his patience, <hi>James

                  <p>Now one of the most
approved wayes to bring
the heart to a quiet, silent
frame, is that which this
Text and Doctrine offers,
<hi>viz.</hi> this Consideration,
that God hath done it.
And therefore to make it
serviceable to its end, turn
it and winde it in your
thoughts: Say thus, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
my affliction is, God
hath done it. And if God
have done it,</p>
                  <p>First, He hath done it,
that might do it. God
that hath done it is Lord
of the Creature. And may


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109507:68"/>
not he dispose of the
Creature that he is Lord
of? He that made Heaven
and Earth according to
his will, may not he doe
what he will in Heaven
and Earth? This Divinity
the Heathen Emperor had
learned in his affliction,
and what he had learned
himself, he preacheth to
us, <hi>Dan. 4. 34, 35. He doth
according to his will in the
army of Heaven, and among
the Inhabitants of the Earth.</hi>
This is the Doctrine. And
it is the Doctrine of Gods
Soveraignty, <hi>His dominion
is an everlasting dominion,
and his Kingdome from
generation to generation,
and he doth what he will,
vers.</hi> 34. But what is the
use? It is that which I


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109507:69"/>
am now urging, Therefore
he cannot be resisted;
therefore he may not be
questioned. So it follows,
<hi>And none can stay his hand.</hi>
None can force him to
retreat, or say to him,
<hi>What doest thou?</hi> i. e. call
him to an account, for his
providential dispensation.
This is excellent in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to our times, and to
publick transactions. <hi>The
potsherds of the earth may
strive and quarrel one with
another,<note place="margin">Isa. 45. 9.</note> but woe to him
that striveth with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
Shall the clay say to
him that fashioneth it, What
makest thou? We are all
the work of his hands,</hi> Psa.
100. And shall he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
that liberty which
his Creatures have, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109507:69"/>
of his own work?
No, from hence we must
argue thus, He is Lord
of the Creature, therefore
he may chastise his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And by his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he is entituled to this
liberty,</p>
                  <p>1. To pick out whom
he will. All his creatures
are equally under his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.
He is as much
Lord over Kings and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
by what Names
soever called, as over pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
and potsherds. Those
that deny it may be sent
to grasse, and then they
will learn it: Though
whiles they flourish in
their Kingdoms, they will
scarce own it. If any
man that is afflicted say,
Why me rather then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109507:70"/>
Answer thy self,
Why not thee as well as
any? since thou art as
much Gods Creature, as
much under his Soveraignty
as any other. He is as
free to deal with a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi>
Dan. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
with a <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. As to pick out whom
he will, so to chasten and
whip us with what Rod
he will. All afflictions are
in his own choise, whether
this or that. The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that comes under
discipline, must not prescribe
to him that is his Lord.
For the most part we are
most discontent with the
present, and are ready to
say, If it had been any
thing else we could have
born it. But this is nothing


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109507:70"/>
but pride, that we may
not be our own carvers.
The truth is, He that hath
not learned to bear any
thing that God inflicts,
hath yet learned to bear
nothing <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> nomine,</hi> because
God inflicts it: <hi>A quatenus
adomne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. To come when he
will, and to stay his own
time. Gods Soveraignty
knows no limits, but what
himself puts. He is at as
much liberty to take his
own time, as to choose
his own Rod. We are apt
to think, such an affliction
came very unseasonably,
and carried too long. But
we forget under whose
hands we are. It should
satisfie us under any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
that the time


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109507:71"/>
when it comes, and the
time which it lasts is Gods
time. He that did choose
the man, and his Crosse,
hath also chosen the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to afflict the man
by his Crosse. To finde fault
with the time or length of
affliction, is to finde fault
with the Soveraignty of
God, &amp; his liberty to afflict.</p>
                  <p>This is one Consideration
by which the Doctrine is
improved. He hath done
it that may do what he
will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, will it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that I must be silent
towards him that doth it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Improve it
thus, It is of the Lord,
<hi>The Lord hath given, the
Lord hath taken;</hi> why the
Lord is debtor to no man,
hath no dependance on


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109507:71"/>
any, can be beholden to
none; We have our whole
dependance upon God for
all we are, for all we have,
but he hath none upon us.
He was, and was infinitely
happy in himself before
there were any other beings
besides his own. And he
would be happy in himself,
though there were no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but his own. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Creature shews
forth something of his
Excellency that made it,
but addes nothing to the
perfection of his being.
A <hi>man cannot be profitable
to his maker,<note place="margin">Job 22. 2.</note> as he may be
to his neighbour.<note place="margin">Job 35. 8.</note> If we be
good, it is to our selves;
and if we be bad we cannot
hurt him.</hi> Argue thus
therefore, God hath laid


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109507:72"/>
his hand upon my body
by sicknesse, my health is
impaired, my life endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered:
If I quarrel, dispute,
complain, or grow sullen;
With whom is it that I
am angry? with God?
Why is God a debtor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me? Of his goodnesse
he hath preserved my
health so long. I have
enjoyed many comfortable
dayes. But is he bound,
because he hath done it to
continue his course so long
as I please? and not to
please himself when he
will, by changing of his
course? What have I done,
or what could I do to
oblige him to that which
he hath done for me?
And if he have done it of
his own will without an


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:109507:72"/>
obligation, shall I quarrel
with him, if at length it
please him not to do, that
which he was never bound
to do when he did it?
This Consideration will
teach thee and me to be
thankfull, that we have
had so many dayes of
health, which were given
of grace, not to wrangle
at sicknesse when it comes,
or lies upon us, it may be
for his end, to let us
know that God is no deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to us. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
when the affliction is
upon you in your relations,
Say you be afflicted in a
Husband, a Wife, a Childe,
a Parent, a Brother, a
Friend, a Comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nion.
Suppose any of these is
sick, weak, lame, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,

or distracted; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
suppose God makes a
breach by taking away
any of these relations.
Put the case how you will,
Suppose the affliction ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so pinching, and to
the quick by reason of the
Circumstances that doe
aggravate, as that you have
lost the best Father, the
best Mother, the best
Husband, the best Wife,
the best Friend, the best
Companion (we are apt
to indulge our selves, and
to think our comforts
were best when we have
lost them, though it may
be scarce content with
them when we had them.)
But suppose it really so;
Oh this stirs up passion!
You can hardly be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

We deal thus with God.
It is a wonder he will lend

Or shall we quit our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance

freely? Must he that gives
us such good blessings be

Physicians cannot say, that
all their Rules are certain,
much lesse that they act
according to certain Rules.
The Causes of diseases, as
to this or that particular
subject, are often hid from
them, and therefore they


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109507:76"/>
are necessitated to make
their applications by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
rather then science.
They have no windows to
look into the bodies of men,
and therefore are subject to
mistakes about mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and the diseases in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to them. But there
is no such thing befals
God. Ignorance and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
are incompatible with
his Nature and Glory. He
can as well not be, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

can erre in any of his
wayes. When he doth
afflict his children, he doth
it as a Physician, and he
never misseth in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
which he gives. He
knows all things, and
there is nothing hid from
him. All Causes, Effects, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,

He that hath <hi>made

He perfectly knows every
mans temper, whether
sweet or sour, hard or

any one should shew him

so he knows the disease,

sometimes in stead of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,

that when they do their

perfectly what every man

whom he administers, yea
though the diseases lie

done it, he that is infinite in

counsel &amp; judgment he hath
done it, and he hath done
it with judgement: Shall

might have served, or
it might better have come
at another time, we play
the fools. Do you know
who hath done it? Do
you know that God hath
done it? And is there
any wiser then God? Shall

                  </p>
                  <p>There are no contrary

are no qualities nor passions

Covetousnesse nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
He hath neither

of being flattered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,

him. If we seek to

can fetch us back
again; he never lost
any of his prisoners,
<hi>Psal. 139. 7. Job 11. 20.
Jer.</hi> 11. 11.</item>
                        <item>3. We cannot resist him,

yea if he will can fling

us on our beds. Oh it is
good to be silent before
the Lord; He is Almighty,
the strong God that layes
his hand upon us. There
is nothing to be got with
strugling, and therefore it
is best to make our yoke

                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:109507:87"/>Sixthly, If God have
done it, there is reason to
be dumb and silent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
so long as we are
on this side perfect and
compleat destruction, we
have a great deal of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
mixed with our sharpest
trials, <hi>Lam 3. 22. It is of the
Lords mercies,</hi> &amp;c. Though
we think it much, and too
much that God doth, yet
it is certain he hath not
done so much as he might.
If God have done (how
bad soever it seems to be)
be assured it might have
been much worse with us
then it is. If it be not so
bad with you as it was
with <hi>Job,</hi> Job 1. Job 2.
As it was with the people
of God in Captivity, <hi>Lam.</hi>
1. &amp; 2. &amp; 5. as it is with

make it to us.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, If God have
done it, then for your
q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

down of thoughts and
passions, let this prevail,
that he doth nothing in
time, but what was laid
in his wise Counsell from
Eternity. All issues and
Events, with all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
about them,
were designed by God for
his own Glory, <hi>Prov. 16. 4.
Ioh.</hi> 11. 4. And when they
do come to passe, are all
ordered and over-ruled to
serve that design. If God
cast us upon the bed of


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:109507:88"/>
sicknesse, or take away
our dearest relations from
us; it was determined it
should be so; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of absolute necessity,
it must be as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
put this question to
our owne hearts in
all our sufferings; My
soul, which must give
place to other? My will
to the designe, counsell
and glory of God, or
Gods counsel and glory
to my will?</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, I might adde,
and do you make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

good: You cannot but be

So that God will do me

of Gods doing, in


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109507:90"/>
all the evil that befals us,
affords this allay, <hi>viz.</hi> that
though God do afflict his
children, yet at that very
instant when he doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
he loves his children,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 126, 7. Yea that he
doth afflict them, because
he loves them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
                  <p>Though the Rod may
speak something of anger,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 20. Yet it never
speaks any thing of hatred
or revenge to a Saint.

out of love, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
How much more doth
God love when he doth
correct?</p>
                  <p>And because he doth
love them when he doth
chastise them, he gives
them sufficient ground to
be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rswaded, that none


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109507:90"/>
of their sufferings shall
separate them from his
love. Now who would
not be silent under the
Rod, which hears that the
Rod speaks so much love
to him, that with silence
bears it as a childe?</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, If God have
done it, it may be further
improved to calm ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

spirits, and make us qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
submit, because he
hath done it, that hath
power over his own work.
It is a very great comfort
to be under Gods hand in
affliction, because he is
one that keeps his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
under command, <hi>Mat.</hi>
8. 8, 9. He doth not let
them loose like Bears to
destroy, but useth them as
Leeches to let bloud, and


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:109507:91"/>
take off at pleasure. He
that layes on the Rod,
can rebuke and break the
Rod when he pleaseth.
If he send a plague, he
can stop it in an instant,
2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. He that wounds
can heal; he that breaks
can binde up; he that

6. 1. And he can give

in the same, or in
some other kinde, <hi>(i. e.)</hi>
give spirituall, when he
takes away temporal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.
Let us be very
quiet under the Crosse,
because he hath laid it on,
who in due time can take
it off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who not only doth
his servants good by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
but is wont to do
them good for their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:109507:91"/>
especially if they
they be calm and quiet in
the bearing of them. I
do not mean in a Popish,
but in a Gospel sense, not
for the merit of them,
but for the promise to
them.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, If God have
done it, then let this come
in for its share; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it is, it could not
have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> then it
is, <hi>Rebus sic stantibus,</hi> i. e.
as the Case is with the
servants of God when he
doth chastise them. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
God doth, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
best done, because
God doth it. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet
this is a truth, That it
would have been worse, if
it had not been done, and


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109507:92"/>
so done, and at such a
season. Gods work is best,
and his manner of working
best, and his time is best.
And thus we ought to
think and speak of his
work, unlesse we think
our selves wiser then
God.</p>
                  <p>And if it be thus, why
should I complain? If it
be better for me to lose
my childe, then to have
it, to lose my wife then
to have her, to lose my
Name or Estate then to
have it? there is reason I
should be content with
that which is, and not by
discontent demonstrate my
folly, that I affect that
which is worse, because I
cannot be content with
that which God doth, who


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:109507:92"/>
doth every way that which
is best, if we could look
the right way to see it;
God that made the world,
is the best workman in
the world. All his works
are done in Judgement,
nor can any come after
him to mend what he hath
done. There is abundance
of curiosity in the most
abstruse, dark, crosse, sour
providences, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found out present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, If God have
done it, and thou finde
that it begins to work
towards any distemper,
cast water upon the fire,
consider God hath done
it. And have I not reason
to bear it from his hands,
from whose hands I have


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109507:93"/>
received so much good? As
<hi>Job</hi> spake to his wife, so let
us speak to our souls, <hi>Job
2. Thou speakest foolishly,</hi>
O my soul, <hi>shall we receive
good at the hands of God,
and shall we not receive evil?</hi>
Before you quarrel at any

she was magnanimous, but
modest with it.</p>
                  <p>For her relations, I

                  <p>I may not forget that
she was of a charitable
disposition towards the

gave up the ghost. And now
I hope she with her three
sons, which were all living

birth, are magnifying and
praising the God of their
salvations, and singing <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffliction tempered with a
great deal of mercy, that
God had thus disposed. Had
she lived and conceived
Children every year (as she
was likely) it is apparent
she could never have
brought forth her birth:
And how sad would it have


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:109507:100"/>
been as to her self, so to her
friends to have been so oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the witnesses of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
without remedy!</p>
                  <p>I reckon it as the return
of prayers. Since in nature
it was rendred so impossible
to bear children, that God
hath taken her to himself,
from the possibility of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the misery of
bringing forth any more
Children. The Decree is
accomplished, and now
she and her Children,
I hope, do sit and
sing together.</p>

with Death, when he
with Reverend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Blake,<note place="margin">In July and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, 1650</note>

                  <p>I. DEath is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
lot of all men.


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109507:105"/>
Every man must die once.
There is no discharge
from that warre. The
best that lived have trod
this path. When I die,
I shall go but the same
way that other men have
gone before me, farre
better then my self; the
same way that <hi>Adam,
Noah, Abraham, David,
Paul,</hi> yea that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
went. Shall I not be
willing to follow when
so many, and such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ones, have gone
before?</p>
                  <p>II. My times are in
Gods hands; The term
and date of my life is set,
the way and manner of
my death determined. I
cannot out-live that date,
and nothing shall shorten


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:109507:105"/>
that date to prevent my
life.<note place="margin">Eccl. 3. 2.</note> Every thing is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
in its time, and so
shall death be to me,
when my time is come.
When corn is ripe, it is
seasonable to cut it down.
I shall not be cut down,
till it be seasonable. And
how can I wish to stand any
longer?</p>
                  <p>III. Death is that
which I (as <hi>Job)</hi> have
waited for all my dayes.
Do I not live with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
to die? It should
neither be strange nor
unwelcome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it
comes, which a man looks
and waits for it before it
comes.</p>
                  <p>IV. There is nothing
but vanity under the
Sunne, nothing that a man


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109507:106"/>
can please himself with,
take comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in, but it hath
a worm in it, like <hi>Jonah's</hi>
Gourd: A man (while<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

either to be deprived of

then should I be troubled

                     </gap>y
life?</p>
                  <p>V. A mans life hath
very little that is desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in it. It is a life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </gap>,
sicknesses, losses, and
which is worst of all, of
sinfull weaknesses, and
inward perplexities. Not
my body onely, but my
soul, my darling labou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

should be sweet unto
thee, O my soul, when

                  <p>VI. Jesus Christ hath
tried the strength of death,
and conquered it. By
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ying, he overcame death,
and him that had the
power of death, which
is the Devil. There Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
was out-shot in his
own Bow, and catcht in
his own Snare. What
hath he got by bringing
Christ to the Crosse, to
the Grave? By getting,
he hath lost the victory.
A happy Paradox. Death
shook the Lord Jesus
with its sting, but lost its

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ing by striking of him.
<hi>Oh death, where is thy


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109507:107"/>
sting? O grave, where is
thy victory? The sting of
death is sinne, the strength
of sinne is the Law. But
thanks be to God who hath
given us the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hath given us the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>y
which he hath gotten.
What? Shall a conquered
enemy, disanimate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour?</p>
                  <p>VII. Nay, Jesus Christ
hath not only conquered
death, and disarmed it,
but hath blessed death,
and sanctified it. He hath
made it not only Not an
enemy,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22</note> but a friend, a
priviledge to beleevers.
Come my soul and play
with death by faith. Esteem

out from the man, and
where God is he makes
a Palace of a Pest-house.
However it is but death.
(The Plague cannot make


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:109507:109"/>
it another thing) and deaths
a friend.</p>
                  <p>XIV. For the pains of
death, I should not be
troubled, God can make
death easie. Some feel lesse
in death, then in other
diseases, and commonly
more in the sicknesse before
death, then in death which
follows the sicknesse. But
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the worst, though
sharp, yet they are short,
and not intollerable. All
the Saints have endured
them, and therefore, O
my Soul, do not give back
for a little pain. That
God which hath carried
so many through this gulf,
is able to carry thee with
faith and patience tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Say with the holy
Singer, <hi>Though I walk tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:109507:110"/>
the valley of the shadow
of death, yet will I fear no
ill, for thou art with me.</hi>
Lord be with thy servant in
that hour, that I may not
fear.</p>
                  <p>XV. There may be sore
temptations, and on-sets of
Satan at that time, when
the body is weakest. And
indeed some precious
Saints have been in great
darknesse before their
death, and it may be so
with me. It is true, O
my Soul, and thou hast
deserved the withdrawings
of God at such a time,
because thou hast not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
his presence in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times. If thou fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
this, let it be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Now take heed of
grieving the Spirit. But


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:109507:110"/>
consider, though some of
the faithfull have been
called out to such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
before death, yet
their Conflicts have been
crowned with Conquests;
God hath made their light
break forth of obscurity,
and put them into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or rather Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, whiles they have
been yet upon earth. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this is the comfort;
Though Satan may trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Saint, yet he shall
not conquer him: And
therefore trust in the Lord,
O my Soul. It lies upon
Jesus Christ, the Captain
of thy Salvation, to keep
all that which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him of the Father.
He would neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> have sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if he had meant that


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:109507:111"/>
Satan should go away with
the harvest. It cost him
his bloud to redeem thee.
Do not think he will part
with that easily, which he
hath purchased at so dear
a price. He never yet left
any of his Saints in death,
I trust he will not make me
the first.</p>
                  <p>XVI. Though death
will make a separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
soul and body, yet
death shall not separate
from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus.
This <hi>Paul</hi> was perswaded
of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And so am I
upon the same grounds.
Gods love is not changable
in it self, nor conquerable by
death. He loved thee, O my
soul, notwithstanding thy
unworthinesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:109507:111"/>
be assured, he will
not separate thee from his
love, because of thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse.
And now I
see what it cannot do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
Lord keep me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dismay'd at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
that it can do against
me.</p>
                  <p>XVII. If death take
away some outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
from me, or rather
me from them, <hi>viz.</hi> Wife,
Children, Friends, Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
This is my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
God hath suffered
me to enjoy them, whiles
I had need of them, or
could have benefit by them;
when I am taken from
them, I shall then have
no more need of them.
And why then should I
care for not having what I


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:109507:112"/>
do not want. It is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to have them, but
speaks the imperfection of
our state to need them.
It is better be in a state of
perfection without them,
then still to have them and
be imperfect.</p>
                  <p>XVIII. It is true,
death will strip me of some
outward accomplishments,
but it shall do me as good
a turn, to deliver me from
all my troubles. And I
would have thee know,
O my Soul, that the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of this life of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
pain, losse, sorrow,
fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may very well
lie in the balance against
all earthly enjoyments: It
is a saving match at least,
to sell our outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
to be freed from


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:109507:112"/>
our this lifes miseries.</p>
                  <p>XIX. Though death
take away some uselesse
moveables which have
served my turn whiles I
had need, yet as a friend
it leaves me my best Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.
My Soul, thou shalt
still enjoy thy precious
graces, and glorious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
when death hath
taken thee from thy cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more troublesome
luggage. Death will not,
cannot meddle with thy
best treasure. And wilt
thou not be content to part
with those, since it leaves
thee these?</p>
                  <p>XX. What I leave of
outward things when I
die, I leave to others that
stay behinde. There will
still be use of them to


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:109507:113"/>
those that live to use
them. They will not be
lost, because I leave them.
And when my turn is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
why should I grudge
that others should be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as well as I?</p>
                  <p>XXI. I shall know no
more sensible pleasure and
contentment here, but I
am well content, because
I shall sinne no more in
the enjoyment of such
pleasure. I have paid dear
enough for all that I have
had, whiles I had it. The
sinne of my pleasure, hath
devoured all the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my pleasure, that
working me more smart
after my pleasure, then
all my pleasure was worth,
whiles I was enjoying it.
My Soul, be content to


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:109507:113"/>
rejoyce no more amongst
the living, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that death will
free thee from sinning any
more amongst them.</p>
                  <p>XXII. In death there
will be no more remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of me: But it is
no matter, I hope when I
am forgotten, my sin and
shame will be forgotten
also. I am content the rest
should be forgotten, so that
my folly and weakness may
be no more remembred.
And yet my Soul be not
discouraged, The Scripture
saith: <hi>The memory of the Just
is blessed,</hi> Psa. 10. 7. <hi>And the
righteous shall be in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
remembrance,</hi> Psalm
11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>2. 6. God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that our Names
should live, when our


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:109507:114"/>
flesh consumes. The rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Name is a
curse entailed upon those
that are rotten in their
lives.</p>
                  <p>XXIII. I shall lie in
the pit, and not know
what is done under the
Sunne. Darknesse will
cover me in the grave:
But if I lie in the pit I
shall be safe; No body
will envy, No body will
hurt me there. And though
it be a dark place, it is
the better for a sleeping
place. I tell thee, O my
Soul, the recompence of
not knowing what is done
under the Sunne. Thou
shalt not know the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
the blasphemy,
the oppression and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
that is done there.


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:109507:114"/>
Since thou canst not know
a little good, without the
knowledge of so much
evil under the Sunne,
which is so great a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
be contented to
be eased of thy burthen
by not knowing what is
done.</p>
                  <p>XXIV. Worms may
perhaps consume my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but that is no great
matter neither. I shall
not feel their gnawings
of my flesh. What though
my body cannot escape
those feeble creatures, when
it is dead, yet blessed be
God, that hellish worme
of an accusing Conscience,
shall not be suffered to
disrest my Soul. There is
more mercy in being freed
from one worm, then from


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:109507:115"/>
a thousand. The wormes
feed upon my body: I
remember <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>He
was a worm.</hi> A King, and
yet a worm. Sure I must
be something below a
worm: But if a worm, let
the worms feed upon their
fellows; I am glad that
worms may be better for
me when I die. It is my
grief that men have been
so little better for me
while<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> I lived.</p>
                  <p>XXV. My treasure is
in Heaven, my best goods
are there; they were not
sent thither, laid up there
for me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>arry long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.
I must go from
hence before I can come
thither. And I must tell
thee, O my Soul, I like
not to lose my treasure


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109507:115"/>
by staying here.</p>
                  <p>XXVI. When death
puts an end to this life, it
will give an entrance into
eternall life. The ending
of one is the beginning of
the other: Who would
not be willing to be at
the end of a worse, to be
at the beginning of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of a blessed life? Lord,
make thy servant not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
willing, but covetous of
this.</p>
                  <p>XXVII. When I die,
I go to rest, to rest from
my labours. I shall be
out of the reach of care,
trouble, sorrow, sicknesse,
temptations, persecution.
Here I am, as other of
my brethren, the But of
Satans rage, of the malice
of wicked men. I have


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:109507:116"/>
not been free to speak or
deliver my Masters Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
without danger. Men
have laid wait to ensnare
me in my own words, to
make my tongue my trap.
These shall follow me but
to my grave; There they
will lose the Sent. O my
Soul, Thy grave is thy
Burrow, in death thou shalt
be quiet.</p>
                  <p>XXVIII. As soon as
breath goes out of my
body, I trust my soul shall
be mounted upon the
wings of Angels into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
And this will not
be long in doing; Who
would not ride on such a
Chariot, to such a place
Great things are spoken
of Heaven; And I have


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109507:116"/>
spoken as great as I could,
to make it an attractive, a
powerfull Argument to
draw other men to the
love of Holinesse. If I
be not willing to go to
Heaven, I betray my faith,
I shame my practice. Shall
not he that preacheth
Heaven, be willing to die,
that he may be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
My Soul, thou
wouldst be loth to have
all thy Heaven upon earth.
And therefore when Gods
time comes, Wilt thou not
be willing to part with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arth, that thou maist en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

                  <p>XXIX I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
sle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p a speciall
blessing of God for the
refreshing of Nature; My
sleep hath been the image


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:109507:117"/>
and similitude of my death.
When I have slept, I have
been like to one that is
dead for that time. Death
is the truest sleep: As
when I slept I was as one
that were dead, so when
I die, I shall be but as one
that is asleep. And though
I shall sleep longer in my
grave, then in my bed; yet as
when I have slept, I awake
and rise again, so after this
sleep of death, when it is
off, I shall awake and rise
again. O my Soul, when
I am weary of the day, I
willingly lay me down t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
sleep. Thou art content
the body should have rest,
I pray thee be as willing,
when this wearisome day
of thy natural life is at an
end, in the night of death


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:109507:117"/>
to let thy body lie down
to sleep in its bed of earth,
till the morning of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
comes. To
die unto a Saint is but
to undresse, and go to bed.</p>
                  <p>XXX. Whiles I am
here in the world, I am
but in a moveable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
alwayes flitting and
shifting, from one house
to another, from one place
to another. And this hath
been very irksome. But
I think God hath wisely
ordered it, that by moving
to many places, I might
be in love with none. If
I have liked my house
never so well, I have been
forced to leave it, either
because none of mine, or
because my work hath been
ended in the place where I


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:109507:118"/>
have pitched. How often

a better house then any
the world affords, not
made with hands; an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
house, whose builder
and maker is God. An
house that wants no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.
An house that is
ready and amply furnished.
If thou wert there, O my
Soul, thou shouldst not
need to flit, it is thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
by gift, and he
that gave it will not put
thee out. Shall I not be
willing to live in mine own,
rather then a strangers, in
an heavenly then in an


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:109507:118"/>
earthly house; in an house
of Gods buildings then of
mans; in an eternal, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then in a falling rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
habitation? While I
live here, I shall be put
to shift, when I die I shall
make but one remove, and
never flit again. Let me
remove once, and do it
cheerfully, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
no more.</p>
                  <p>XXXI. But what do I
speak of an House, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
(my Soul) there is a
Kingdom, Not like the
Kingdoms of this world,
not a narrow, envied, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,

Not subject to any

is not of this world,

Why should I desire to
continue in this world, and
not go where my Kingdom
is? Would any man that
is heir to a Kingdom desire
to live any where but in
the Kingdom to which he
is an heir? Especially, if
his own be such, that in

others that may be brought
to make comparison. Lord,

me to walk worthy of the
dignity, and hopes of a
King, whiles I live, and
let not this beggarly life,
nor any thing that belongs
to it, keep me from being
willing, nay desirous to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

worm may speak such a
word, To say he is a King;
I beseech thee make me
willing, or else when the
time comes, stay not for
my willingnesse, but set
me upon the Throne, bring
me to the Kingdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.
Put, oh put that
pure Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that incorruptible
Crown of Glory upon my

to be a King. Ambition
makes graceless men, whose

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:109507:120"/>
daring to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Shall not grace make thee
willing to put off thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
life, to put on this
living and immarcessible
Crown?</p>
                  <p>XXXII. The Scripture
speaks admirable things of
the glorified estate of the
Saints, what is reserved in
Heaven for them, what
they shall enjoy there. At
present it tels us we know
but in part, and we know
it tels us true by our great
ignorance. It cals all that
we have on this side Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
our tastes and earnests
of what we shall have.
We are now the sons of

here (O my Soul) thou
hast but a poor imperfect
glimpse of that which lies
wrapt up in the promise.
Thou livest by faith not

And therefore since this is
not the place for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
thy happinesse, be
thou carried out with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be in that place,
where thy happinesse may

                  <p>1. I desire to know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally,
what it is to
be in a state that is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
free from trouble,
fear, sorrow, sicknes, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
enemies, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

thing is that? Here I know
little else but sinne and
sorrow. Lord, let me know
what it is to be freed from
these, what it is to sin no

more, to weep no more.
It is in the promise, <hi>Rev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
1. 4. Oh let me have it in
performance.</p>
                  <p>2. The Scripture speaks
of the spirits of just men
made perfect. Those just
men are no where but in
Heaven, and there they
have their souls accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht
with perfection. They
have their natural faculties
enlarged and filled, they
have the image of God,
all their graces, that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> cals
it) compleated to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree. It is now with
them, as it was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
they are like unto
God himself, and in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
similitude, according
to the measure of creature-perfection.
Oh my Soul,


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:109507:122"/>
dost thou not desire experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
to know and enjoy
this happiness, to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and compleatly san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
to have all thy
graces shining in their lustre
and glory? Oh me thinks
thou shouldst long to know
what this is to be like unto
God that made thee, who
when he made thee, made
thee like himself.</p>
                  <p>3. I hear great things
spoken of Heaven, what a
glorious place it is, and
how farre it excels all that
is visible on this side. Art
hath raised many glorious
structures, which do very
much catch the senses, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
the beholders. But
that part of the visible Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
which is the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God drawn over


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:109507:122"/>
our heads, the beautifull
ground-work, and curious
enamelling of the Sunne,
Moon and Starres, doth
exceedingly shame all the
invention and art of man.
These I have seen, and been
sometimes much taken
with them. But I have not
seen what is the glory of
the highest Heavens, the
Paradise of God. I have
not seen the City of the
great King, the glorious
high Throne on which
Christ Jesus fits. Oh my
Soul, why dost thou linger?
Art thou not willing to
leave this world, that thou
maist know, behold, and
live in that place of Glory,
which so farre transcend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all that thou hast seen, and
which thou canst not see


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109507:123"/>
until thou leave this world?
Wouldst thou not fain see
that mansion that Christ
went to prepare for thee?</p>
                  <p>4. My Soul, thou hast
very reverend thoughts of
the Saints departed, of the
Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that died in the
faith long ago, and of the
Saints and Martyrs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

thou hast onely heard of
these, thou hast not seen
them. But now, my Soul,
when thou goest to Heaven,
thou shalt behold and


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:109507:123"/>
know all these, with all the
rest of those glorified Saints
that went before thee.
Thou shalt sit down with
<hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>
in the Kingdom of Heaven;
and those whom thou now
so much admirest, shall be
thy Companions. If thou
leave behinde thee some
precious Saints, whom
thou lovest, there will be no
losse of Company, there
thou shalt finde others
more worthy of thy love,
in Heaven all is exchanged
for better. Thou knowest
those already that are here.
There thou shalt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qainted
and familiar with
those thou never knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</p>
                  <p>5. The Angels are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
glorious Creatures, All

Spirit, exceeding holy, they

                     </gap>erity, are
Instruments to do God
great service; yea though
we see them not, yet are
they ministring spirits unto
the heirs of salvation.
Doubtlesse they now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
many good offices for
us, which are not yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by us for whom
they are performed. My
Soul, these glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whose feet a man
can hardly now behold and
live, thou shalt in Heaven
have the full knowledge of
them, of their Natures,
Office and Ministry. Thou
shalt converse with them
familiarly, and not be afraid
of them. Here thou art but


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:109507:124"/>
a Companion for men, and
many of those men amongst
whom thou livest have
scorned to be thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
Let this make thee
willing to leave this world,
to go to Heaven, where
thou shalt be a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Angels, and shalt not be
scorned by them.</p>
                  <p>6. The Scripture saith,
<hi>Our light afflictions which
are but for a moment, do work
for us a far more exceeding,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 17.</note>
and eternal weight of glory.</hi>
My Soul, thou dost not at
present enjoy this; nay, I
am sure thou canst not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
what lies in this
expression. It is spoken for
thee to wonder at, Glory,
a weight of Glory, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
weight of Glory, a
nore exceeding weight of


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:109507:125"/>
Glory, a farre more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
weight of Glory, a
farre more exceeding and
eternal weight of Glory.
My Soul, dost thou know
what this means? Sure it is
some wonderfull thing,
which the Apostle, guided
by the Spirit, heaps so many
words upon, as if it were
something that did exceed
the most exceeding expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
Oh my Soul, though
now thou dost not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the expression, but
admirest something which
thou dost not understand,
yet when thou comest to
Heaven, thou shalt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand the phrase,
but possesse the thing.
Art thou not willing to
take thy wings and flie from
hence, that thou maist no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

only understand, but be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with this blessed bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
which the Spirit cals
an exceeding weight of
Glory? Who would need
Arguments to perswade,
that might be assured by
going to such a place to
have leave to carry away
his lading of gold or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
treasure? Why, my
Soul, if thou wilt go to
Heaven, all thy burthen
shall be thy glory: This
Glory is ten thousand times
more precious then gold.
And it hath this advantage,
though it be a weight of
Glory, yet it is no burthen,
shall never weary him that
carries it.</p>
