         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Of the inscription of this Booke.</head>
                  <p>1.<seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hy the first booke of Samuel is so named, there may be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reasons giuen; as both because the booke beginneth with the storie of Samuels natiuitie, as the Hebrewes vse to name the bookes of Scripture of the beginning; as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it containeth Samuels acts principally; and besides, Samuel is held to haue beene the writer thereof, till that place where mention is made of his death. 2. But of this second booke there is greater question, why it should beare the name of Samuel: for neither are Samuels acts therein described, neither was he the penne-man thereof: but it was written by some of the Prophets, as by Nathan, and Gad, who supplyed the rest of the historie, that followeth Samuels death, or by some other of the Prophets: some thinke they were collected by Hezekiah; some by Ezra. 3. Now why yet this booke is intituled by Samuel, two reasons may be yeelded, both because it sheweth the accomplishment of Samuels prophesie concerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Dauid, and the consummation and perfection of that argument, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne with Samuels anointing: <hi>Genevens.</hi> as also for that this booke is but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the former historie: and therefore the Hebrewes doe not diuide it from the former. <hi>Pellic.</hi> 4. But whereas <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh in his Hebrewe traditions, that this booke of Samuel is like to be that, which is called the booke of the <hi>righteous,</hi> it hath no probabilitie: <hi>Mar.</hi> for we finde mention made of that booke, before this historie was either done, or written: Ios. 10.13.</p>

                  <head>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Of the Argument of this Booke.</head>
                  <p>1. As the former booke containeth the historie of such things as were done vnder Samuel and Saul, so this setteth forth the acts of Dauid: and specially three things in generall are handled in this booke: the beginning, increase, and flourishing of Dauids raigne: then the manifold troubles, treasons, and oppositions against his kingdome: as also Dauids fall, and his rising againe, and reconciling vnto God. 2. And further, herein is obserued a notable difference betweene the raigne of Saul and of Dauid: for Sauls kingdome beganne with great glorie and renowne, but ended with shame: but contrariwise, Dauids kingdome had but small beginnings, yet encreased more and more. <hi>Borr.</hi> 3. In which respect Dauid was a liuely type of Christ, who found many enemies in the world, which sought to suppresse his kingdome in the infancy thereof: But his dominion preuailed, and from a corner of the earth, hath ouerspread all the world. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p>1. This booke in generall affoardeth that profit, which all the Scriptures do yeild, which are profitable either for doctrine, to confirme the truth, and improoue error; or for manners, to correct vice, and to instruct in righteousn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s: as S. Paul sheweth, 2. Timoth. 3.16. 2. In this booke, as also in the former, are set forth vnto vs many graue and worthy examples of vertuous acts, which doe mooue much, and perswade vnto vertue, and doe longer remaine in memorie then bare precepts. 3. These histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries serue to expound the writings and oracles of the Prophets, but especially the booke of the Psalmes, shewing the occasions whereupon many of those Psalmes were indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, which maketh much to the true vnderstanding of them. 4. Further, whereas these bookes are alleadged in the Gospel: the knowledge hereof is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vnderstand the precepts and sermons of our blessed Sauiour. 5. And lastly, the wisedome of God doth wonderfully appeare herein, in tempering the Scriptures to euery ones capacitie: for them which are seuere and austere, and are addicted to graue things and matters of rigour and authoritie, the fiue bookes of Moses were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested: some men are delighted with a pleasant style, and flowing speech, such the Psalmes and Canticles specially are for: others doe more respect graue and wise sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, such as the Prouerbs of Salomon, and the booke of Ecclesiastes containe: Some are delighted in antiquaries, to them the holy histories are specially applyed: Others loue to heare of Gods iudgements and threatnings against sinne, who are to be sent to the Prophets. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The former booke containeth not so many yeares, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> computation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth: for hee giueth 38. yeares vnto <hi>Sauls</hi> raigne, whereof he raigned 18. yeares while <hi>Samuel</hi> yet liued, and 20. after: for adde vnto this 40. yeares of <hi>Eli,</hi> for so long hee iudged Israel, 1. Sam. 4.18. and 20. yeares at the least, for Samuel before Saul was anointed, as is gathered, 1. Sam. 7.2. see the question vpon that place: so should the whole summe of yeares make an 100. within two: which cannot stand with that account, 1. King. 6.1. which setteth downe 480. yeares to be runne in the 4. yeare of <hi>Salomon</hi> from the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt, vntill the building of the Temple. This number consisteth of these particulars: 40. yeares vnder Moses, 17. vnder Ioshuah, 299. vnder the Iudges, 44. vnder Dauid and Salomon: all which make but 400. yeares: there remaineth then but 80. yeares, whereof 40. were vnder Eli, 1. Sam. 4.18. then there are but 40. more to be diuided betweene Samuel and Saul, Act. 13.21. the first booke then containeth the historie of 80. yeares, and no more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then the computation which <hi>Pet. Martyr</hi> followeth, can not be true: that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth 366. yeares from the departure of Israel out of Egypt vntill Eli, which can not be: from the beginning of Elies 40. yeare to the 4. yeare of Salomon, are yeares 124: whereof 40. were vnder Eli, 40. vnder Samuel and Saul, and 40. vnder Dauid, and 4. of Salomons raigne: which summe of 124. being put to the former summe of 366. will make in all 490. yeares: whereas the Scripture accounteth but 480. 1. King. 6.1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Historie then of this booke, is onely of 40. yeares vnder the raigne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, and certaine moneths: whereof he raigned 7. yeares, 6. moneths in Hebron, and 33. yeares in Ierusalem, 2. Sam. 5.5. <hi>Iun.</hi>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. Whether the Amalekite lied in telling vnto Dauid, that hee slew Saul.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe Hebrewes doe thinke, that this Amalekite lied vnto Dauid, and that all this cunning tale was but deuised, to insinuate himself vnto Dauid: but it seemes that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18791:5"/>
all was not fained, as that he tooke the crowne from Sauls head, before he was dead, beeing fallen to the ground: for he had the crowne there present to shew.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some doe thinke that he spake the truth: and that when Saul had fallen vpon his sword, this Amalekite also at Sauls motion, fell vpon him: so <hi>Iosephus, Genevens. Bor.</hi> and the <hi>Chalde</hi> interpreter seemeth to be of the same opinion, reading v. 15. <hi>The sinne of thy slaughter be vpon thine owne head:</hi> but this is not like to be so: for these reasons: 1. Saul fell vpon his sword, 1. Sam. 31.5. but here he is said to leane vpon his speare, that is, thrust himselfe in with the speare. 2. Sauls armour-bearer saw Saul dead first, before he killed himselfe, 1. Sam. 31.6. but here the Amalekite telleth, that life was in him, when he stood ouer him to make an end of him. 3. It is not like, that Saul hauing runne vpon his sword, had memorie to aske him so many questions: first to call him to him, then to enquire who he was, and thirdly to make his request to him. 4. This young man expected a reward at Dauids hand, c. 4.10. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is probable that he lied: for a flatterer, and a lier, for the most part, goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some of the Hebrewes thinke, that this young man was Doegs sonne, whom they suppose to be Sauls armour bearer, and that he before he killed himselfe, gaue Sauls crowne, and bracelet to his sonne: But this young man was an Amalekite, Doeg was an Edomite, therefore this supposall hath no ground.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore the more probable opinion is, that this Amalekite lied vnto Dauid in the most part of his tale: yet herein he may be thought to speake as it fell out; that he was the first, that came vpon Saul beeing wounded to death, and seeing no hope of life in him, rifled him, and tooke away his crowne and bracelet. <hi>Osiand.</hi> It will be obiected, that if he had not killed Saul, Dauids sentence had beene vniust to put him to death. <hi>Ans.</hi> the confession of his owne mouth was sufficient to condemne him, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially seeing he bewraied a willing and resolued mind to lay his hands vpon the Lords annointed, whether he did it or no.</p>

                  <p>1. The word here vsed <hi>Shabatz,</hi> signifieth a garment made with eies or hoales like net-worke, it also is taken for <hi>greife</hi> or <hi>anguish:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diuerse rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> there are then three interpretations of this place. 1. Some vnderstand it of the horsemen, which were armed with such coates, that now had ouertaken Saul: as <hi>Vatab.</hi> readeth <hi>cornua, the band or troupe hath ouertaken me:</hi> but the words following shew, that Saul speaketh of himselfe, of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that had befallen him: because he saith, <hi>my life is yet whole in mee.</hi> 2. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to Sauls garment, that hindered the entering of his speare: <hi>Iun.</hi> but the next verse sheweth, that Saul hauing runne vpon his speare or sword, was fallen to the ground, and not like to liue, by the Amalekites owne confession; therefore the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon had entered to the purpose: and againe, the word <hi>achaz,</hi> signifieth properly to hold, possesse, or apprehend, rather then to let or hinder. 3. Therefore the vsuall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is to be preferred, <hi>Anguish hath caught hold of me, apprehended, or possessed me: sic C.S.L.A.P. cum caeter.</hi> the anguish of the wound and hole, which the speare had made.</p>

                  <head>3. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 10. <hi>Of these words:</hi> Because I was sure he could not liue.</head>
                  <p>1. Some make this a reason of the words following; because he was sure he could not liue after he was fallen, <hi>he tooke the crowne, &amp;c. B.G.</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Diuerse rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> when the Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kite had giuen him his deadly wound, and saw he could not liue, then he rifled him: but the Hebrew distinction, <hi>athnach,</hi> at that word <hi>after his fall,</hi> which is a perfect peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, breaketh off this clause from the words following. 2. Therefore the meaning is, that when he sawe Saul to be fallen vpon his sword, and not like to liue, that the Amalekite was perswaded to make an hand of him, <hi>Vatab.</hi> and so the rest also doe ioyne it as a reason of the former words, <hi>I came vpon him, and slew him.

                  <head>3. <hi>Quest. vers.</hi> 12. Why Dauid mourned for Saul and Ionathan.</head>
                  <p>1. Dauid and his whole band wept and mourned together at the first, hearing of the lamentable ende of Saul and his sonnes, v. 12. but afterward Dauid by himselfe mourned more, when he vtt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>red that song of lamentation. 2. Dauid mourned for Ionathan, as for his friend, and a good man; and for Saul, because though he were an enemie to Dauid, yet he was a valiant defender of the Israelites against their enemies, and whom Dauid had twice spared himselfe, and would not lay his hands vpon him, he mourneth to see how he came to this miserable end. 3. Many benefits came vnto Dauid by the death of Saul, as the ende of that cruell hatred and persecution, and the accomplishment of Gods promise towards Dauid; but Dauid in this his lamentation, looketh vnto the originall of this calamitie, the wrath of God, which was the cause of his mourning. 4. Dauid gaue God thankes, that had iudged his rebuke against Nabal, but here he reioyceth not for Sauls ouerthrowe; for the case was not alike, neither did God sustaine any dishonour, nor the commonwealth any losse by the death of Nabal, as both are hindred by the lamentable fall of Saul. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <head>4. <hi>Quest. vers.</hi> 15. Whether Dauid did iustly in commanding the Amalekite to be put to death.</head>
                  <p>1. If this young man spake the truth, and made a true relation, he was worthily slaine; both in respect of Saul, who was the Lords anointed, and therefore he should not haue laid any hand vpon him: in respect of himselfe, he was a Proselite conuerted to the faith of Israel: and Dauids person also considered, who was now the lawfull Magistrate. 2. But if this were a deuised tale, which he telleth, his condemnation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was iust, for he was iudged by his owne mouth: and hereunto agree the imperiall lawes:<note place="margin">ff. ad leg.

And whereas it will be obiected, that one ought not to die, but by the testimonie of two or three: that is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood where there is no confession,<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> but the fact is denied: but the voluntarie confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the partie may suffice, without further witnesse: as Iosuah caused Achan to be stoned vpon his owne confession. 4. And further it must be considered, whether the confession be voluntarie, or forced and extorted by torment: for in this case the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall lawes prouide,<note place="margin">ff. de quaest. leg. 1. §.

                  <head>5. <hi>Quest. vers.</hi> 17. How and when Dauid bad to teach the children of Israel to shoote, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>1. Some thinke that this verse hath no reference to Dauids song that followeth, but doe interpret it thus, that Dauid before he sung this song had exhorted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his tribe, to learne to shoote in the bow: <hi>Vatab. Borr.</hi> 2. Some by the <hi>bow,</hi> vnderstand this mournefull ditie, because it maketh mention of the bow of Ionathan, v. 22. so the Latin interpreter: <hi>vt docere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t filios Iudae planctum, to teach the children of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el to mourne.</hi> 3. But the third interpretation is the best, that these words are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly any part of the song, but shew the end, why Dauid vttered it: to the intent, that this song beeing vsed and frequented in the tribe of Iudah, it should serue as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement and prouocation to the tribe of Iudah to learne to be skilfull in shooting: <hi>Iun.</hi> seeing that Saul and Ionathan were now ouercome by the archers and shooters among the Philistims. <hi>Borr.</hi> 4. By this example of Dauid, who in the middes of his mourning forgetteth not, what was necessarie for the good of the Commonwealth: we are taught, not to be so ouercome with griefe and pensiuenes, as to forget our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to neglect the meanes: <hi>Mart.</hi> as Iaakob saith to his sonnes, when they were readie to be famished, and looked not about to helpe themselues: <hi>Why gaze yee one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an other</hi>?<note place="margin">Morall observ.</note> Gen. 42.1.

                  <p>1. Concerning the name of this booke, <hi>Iasher</hi> signifieth, <hi>the iust or righteous:</hi> so called as some thinke of the persons whereof that booke intreated, namely of the acts of the Patriarchs and iust men. Some of the matter, because it contained a true narration of such things as were written therein. But it is more like to beare the name of <hi>Ieshurun,</hi> which is the name of Israel, Deut. 32.15. and the Prophet Isai calleth Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el by the same name, c. 44. v. 2. which word also signifieth, the <hi>righteous</hi> people: this booke was called <hi>Iasher,</hi> because it was as a publike chronicle and record of Israel: <hi>Mus. in Iosu.</hi> 10. 2. But what booke this was, it is further questioned: the Chalde vnderstandeth the booke of the lawe, which was called <hi>Iashar, right, iust,</hi> because it prescribed what things were iust. Others take it for the booke of Genesis, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth an historie of the acts of the righteous fathers. <hi>Vatab.</hi> But how could Dauids song be recorded in that booke made so long before? Others thinke it was some booke made by Nathan or Gad, wherein this song was written: but there was a book called <hi>Iashur</hi> long before their time, Iosh. 10.13. Therefore it is more probable, that this booke of <hi>Iasher,</hi> was a generall Chronicle of the acts of that nation, which was continued from time to time by the Prophets, which is now wanting, as many such historicall bookes are. <hi>Iun.</hi> These Chronicles were laid vp in the Temple, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Many such historicall writings are mentioned in bookes of the Kings and Chronicles composed by the Prophets, Nathan, Gad, Iddo, Semaias, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias the Silonite, which are now not to be found. It seemeth that after Ezra had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested the holy Scriptures into order, that these bookes were not thought so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: the Lord hath yet preserued for the vse and benefit of his Church, so much as he seeth to be sufficient for the instruction of the people in the knowledge of his will, and toward the attaining of euerlasting life. <hi>Andr.

That no partialitie be shewed, in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one before an other, in setting forth the praise of a rich man, or of a kinsman, and not of a poore man, or one not allyed, they beeing all of like desert; which is the greatest exception that can be taken to funerall sermons, in mine opinion: when as a man that hath ten shillings bequeathed him for a funerall sermon, will commend such an one, and an other of as good example of life, wanteth that solemnitie. 3. It must be done without superstition; they must not imagine, that the dead receiue any solace, benefit, or releefe, by such funerall solemnities: but such commendations, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the praise of the dead, must altogether redound, and be referred to the praise of God, and to the vse, exhortation, and comfort of the liuing. 4.

In that Dauid passeth ouer Sauls faults in silence, and onely toucheth his vertues, it teacheth vs to hate the errours and infimities of others, so farre as with a good conscience we may: <hi>Osiand.</hi> 3. This was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and worthie commendation of Saul, both beeing from the mouth of so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a man as Dauid was, and beside, one vnto whom Saul had alwaies beene a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemie. And the testimonie and commendation of an enemie is much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Caesar, when he saw Pompey his enemies head, is said to haue wept: and Hannibal in that great slaughter of the Romans at Cannas, sought diligently for the bodie of Paulus Aemileus the Romane Captaine there slaine, to haue giuen it honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable buriall.

Dauid, though he had a promise of the kingdome, yet would not take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof, though Saul were dead, without direction from God: as Iaacob did not make an escape from Laban, before he was admonished by the Lord in a dreame: which teacheth vs, not to enterprise, or take any thing in hand, without the warrant of Gods word, and prayer. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.

                  <p>1. This Citie was famous in diuerse respects: both for the antiquitie, it was built seauen yeares before Zoan in Egypt, Numb. 13. thither also came Ioshua and Caleb, when they were sent as spies to search the land: it was one of the Cities of refuge, which belonged vnto the Leuites: but it was most of all honoured, because the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Patriarks Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, were there buried, to whom the promises concerning the land of Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Iudah, and he held it now by the gift and graunt of the King of the Philistims: therefore he desireth to remooue to some other Citie of Iudah, more inward in the countrie, <hi>Pellic.</hi> 3. He taketh with him his two wiues, that as they had beene his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in his troubles, so they should partake with him in his happie estate: <hi>Bor.</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Dauid also was a type of Christ, who maketh them partakers of his glorie with him, which did follow him in his afflictions: as he saith to his Apostles, <hi>Yee are they, which haue continued with mee in my tentations, therefore I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my Father hath appointed vnto mee,</hi> Luk. 22.28.29.</p>

Herein also Dauid was a type of Christ, whose spirituall anointing to be our Messiah, was often testified, and declared vnto the Church for our further confirmation: as by the predictions of the old Prophets, by the pointing out of Iohn, by Gods own voice from heauen, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse signes and miracles. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p>1. Some thinke, that this fact of the men of Iabesh Gilead was discommended vnto Dauid, as beeing too much addicted vnto his professed enemie: <hi>Mar.</hi> but it seemeth rather that Dauid made enquirie after the bodies of Saul, and his sonnes, to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon them honourable buriall, and by that occasion hee vnderstood of this thankefull seruice, which the men of Iabesh Gilead had done: <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. Dauid in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending this dutifull regard in them of Saul, sheweth himselfe farre vnlike to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of those heathen Captaines and commanders <hi>Sylla, Marius, Antonius, Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> who sought reuenge vpon those, who had taken part against them. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid wisheth that God would shew againe mercie and truth vnto them: Gods mercie and goodnesse is seen in promising reward vnto our faithfull seruice, and his truth and fidelitie in performing: there is then no desert at Gods hands, but he crowneth and rewardeth in mercie the faithfulnesse of his seruants. <hi>Borr.</hi> 4. Dauid also promiseth for his part, to recompence their kindnesse shewed toward their Master:<note place="margin">Controv.

                  <p>1. Abner offended three waies in making Ishbosheth King. 1. Because he did it of an ambitious mind: he set vp one that was simple, and of meane parts to beare the name of a King, but Abner ruled all: as Abner, not Ishbosheth is said to haue made all his power for the house of Saul: c. 3.6. And that Ishbosheth was but a meane man, and of a cowardly nature appeareth: for he went not to battle with Saul, as beeing vnfit and vnapt thereunto: wherein his age can yeild him no excuse, he beeing now 40. yeares old: <hi>Borr.</hi> 2. Abner did herein against his conscience, beeing not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that God had appointed <hi>Dauid</hi> to be King, as he himselfe confesseth, c. 3.18. 3.

                  <p>1. Some translate this word appellatiuely, for the <hi>Host,</hi> or <hi>Campe:</hi> as <hi>L.S.A.P.</hi> but it is rather the name of a place on the other side of Iordan, so first called by Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, because there he met the Lords host. Gen. 32. so <hi>C. Vat. Iun.</hi> 2. The cause why he fled with Ishbosheth to Mahanaim, was as <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, that he might be safe from the Philistims, whose countrie was on this side of Iordan bordering vpon the Sea: but beside this, two other reasons may be yeelded thereof: because Abner sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, least the men of Iabesh Gilead, whom <hi>Dauid</hi> had entreated so kindly should fall away from Ishbosheth; and therefore he thought it the best course, that the king should reside there, to retaine and continue their affections: as also Mahanaim being in the Land of Bashan, a fruitful and fertile countrie, was in that behalfe verie fit to be the Kings Citie. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. That part of Israel is also described, ouer the which Ishbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth raigned: Gilead is taken for all the countrie beyond Iordan, a part beeing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the whole; the countrie of Ashur was the furthest toward the North: Iezrahel containeth the middle region of Ishachar, Zebulun, and Nephtali: these with Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im and Beniamin did inhabit in al the breadth of the land between Iordan and the sea: so in a manner it containeth a description of all Israel on each side of Iordan, Iudah excepted. <hi>Iun.</hi>

                  <p>Whereas Ishbosheth is said to haue raigned two yeares ouer Israel; and <hi>Dauid</hi> seauen yeares in Hebron, before he obtained the kingdome ouer all Israel, it seemeth that the kingdome of Israel lay vacant 5. yeares: to reconcile these places, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue this doubt,<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> 1. Some thinke that this <hi>interregnum</hi> or vacancie of the kingdome for fiue yeares followed immediately after Sauls death, before Ishbosheth beganne to raigne. <hi>Osiand.</hi> But it is not like that they which tooke part with Dauid, would suffer the house of Saul all that while to make a way for the kingdome: and it seemeth by the order of the storie set downe, v. 7.8. that as soone as Dauid had beene anoynted King by the men of Iudah, Abner tooke Ishbosheth, and made him King ouer Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. <hi>Iosephus</hi> also thinketh that this was done presently after Sauls death. 2. Some thinke that these fiue yeares followed after Ishbosheths death. <hi>Pellic.

Therefore the best exposition is, not that Ishbosheth raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely two yeares in all: but that he had raigned two yeares vntill this time, when Abner went out against Ioab, as it followeth v. 12. <hi>R.

This skirmish was begunne by Abner: who, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, was angrie with the tribe of Iudah, for making Dauid King, and therefore seeketh to be reuenged of them. 3. Yet Dauid would not for his othes sake, goe against his brethren himselfe, but sendeth Ioab, who also doth protract the time, and deferreth to fight, not for that he was the weaker, but it is most like he did it by Dauids direction, to shew how vnwilling he was to haue any warre with them. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. It is simply vnlawfull, to set one to one, or a certaine number of men against the like number, to trie it by dint of sword, and shedding of blood, as the Romans &amp; Albanes, did put the triall of their gouernement vpon the aduenture of the three <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratij</hi> on the one side, and the three <hi>Curiatij</hi> on the other. 1. It is a tempting of God, when as they put all vpon such an hazard, there beeing other meanes beside for the triall of matters. 2. They put their confidence in the arme of flesh trusting vnto their owne strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Such cumbates are against charitie, one seeking an others life. 4. And against faith all such actions are, hauing no warrant in the word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diuerse causes may be pretended of such monomachies, and single cumbates: which are not yet sufficient to iustifie them or make them lawfull: first, they alleadge, that when it can not otherwise be knowen to whom the right belongeth in the trialls of title, and in other criminall causes, who is guiltie, who innocent, that in such doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full case, the matter may be decided, by such a cumbate. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. There are fowre waies prescribed in Scripture, whereby to sift out the truth: by testimonie of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by euidence of writing, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 32.10. by confession, Iosh. 7. Achan acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his offence: or by the oath of the partie, Exod. 22.11. if by none of these meanes the truth can come to light, the partie accused is to be freed, and the matter left vnto the iudgement of God. 2. This were to tempt God, to shew a miracle in giuing the victorie vnto the innocent: as sometime they vsed to walke vpon an boat yron bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, or to put their hand into scalding water for the triall of their innocencie. 3. And this is an vncertaine way to trie out the truth: for oftentimes it falleth out, that in such fights the innocent partie is slaine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, an other cause is to trie their manhood, and make ostentation of their v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, though such exercises are tolerable, which are kept without danger of life, as the running at tilt, and such like, yet the life of man is more precious in the sight of God, then for publike ostentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be brought
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18791:10"/>
into apparant perill: and beside, such challenges are against charity, because certainly the one of them dieth.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, some thinke, that when a battell is pitched, it were better that a few men should trie it for the whole campe, rather then there should be a generall effusion of blood. <hi>Contra.</hi> If the cause of such warre be iust (as without a iust cause no warre ought to be enterprised) this were to betray the goodnes of the cause, in committing such a triall. And further, the meanes should be neglected, which God offreth, which is by a iust battell, to decide the cause.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, if the Magistrate beeing corrupt, doe giue sentence against the Innocent to die, vnlesse he will trie it by the sword with his aduersarie, in this case also some giue allowance to such cumbates. <hi>Contra.</hi> The innocent is rather with patience to abide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the hardest sentence of the vniust Magistrate, then to commit sinne in the killing of an other: for we ought rather to die, then sinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will now on the other side be obiected, 1. That seeing warre is lawfull, and these manomachies are but a kind of warre, they are as lawfull. 2. Lots were lawfull, but these singular cumbates are but a kind of lot. 3. Dauids cumbate with Goliah was lawfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. There is great difference betweene warre, and a monomachie, or sole fight: because there the battell is ioyned together by the strength and helpe of many, one companie seconding another: but here the aduenture lieth vpon a few: and in Scripture we haue presidents of the one, but not of the other. 2. In the casting of lots there followeth no slaughter, as in this case, therefore they are vnlike: for though Ionas were taken by lot, yet he was cast ouer board by his owne direction hauing a propheticall instinct. 3. The like is to be answered concerning Dauid, that he tooke that enterprise in hand by the extraordinarie motion of Gods spirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet there is a kind of Monomachie that is commendable in a Christian, which is the spirituall and internall cumbate betweene the spirit and the flesh: whereof the Apostle speaketh, <hi>I see an other law in my members, rebelling against the law of my minde:</hi> Rom. 7.22. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p>1. This Asahel was brother vnto Ioab, and Abishai, who were all in this battell, and he is numbred among Dauids Worthies, 1. Chron. 11. <hi>Mar.</hi> he is said to be swift as a roe, by a kind of hyperbolicall speech: as Saul and Ionathan are said to be swifter then Eagles, chap. 1.23. <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth he was so swift, that he did not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with men, but with horse in running. 2. Here in Asahel we see that saying of the Preacher verefied, <hi>That the race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the strong:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 9.11.</note> the swiftnes of Asahel, to the which he trusted too much, was the cause of his ruine: which teacheth, that we ought not to be too confident vpon our strength, or any other gift,<note place="margin">No man is to trust in his strength or swiftnesse or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or external gift.</note> either inward, or outward.

                  <p>The Sunne beeing now set, and so by Gods prouidence the opportunitie of further prosecuting the battell beeing cut off: and beside Abner and his men standing vpon their gard, both flocking together on an heape, and taking the aduantage of the place vpon an hill: <hi>Iun.</hi> then Abner beganne to mooue Ioab to cease pursuing them, and thereunto he vseth three reasons. The first is from humanitie, that he should not suffer the sword to deuoure alwaies: for warre beeing one of those things, which is not desired for it selfe, but as it tendeth to peace, it must be vsed in measure: such things as are to be desired for themselues, can not be too much followed, as vertue, honestie; but those things which are desired and sought to some other ende, must be limited and confined. The second is, that euen such victories, are not without losse, and griefe, euen vnto those that haue the better: as the Israelites when they did fight against Beniamin, though they ouercame them at the length, yet they were twice foyled before, Iudg. 20. <hi>Mart.</hi> Beside, saying, <hi>it will be bitternes in the ende,</hi> he sheweth, that his souldiers beeing in despaire of victorie, if they were still vrged and pursued,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18791:11"/>
might in the bitternesse of their heart be prouoked, and so seeke to reuenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: as a beare rageth, beeing robbed of her whelps. <hi>Pellic.</hi> His third reason is from their affinitie, because they were brethren. The Romane Chronicles make mention, that in the battell betweene <hi>Sylla,</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. In that Ioab by Dauids authoritie did encounter with Abner, and his men, and obtained victorie of them, and smote of Abner and his men, 360. men; we see, that it is lawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Christians now also vpon iust occasion to wage battell, as may appeare by these reasons, and places of Scripture. 1. Iohn Baptist, when the souldiers came vnto him, did not bid them renounce their calling, but onely saide, <hi>Doe violence to no man, neither accuse any falsly, &amp;c.</hi> he would onely haue them to keepe within their bounds. 2. Cornelius the Centurion, Act. 10. pleased God in that calling, and his prayers were heard, and almes accepted before God. 3. God gaue diuerse lawes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people concerning warre: as Deut. 20.6.7. it is prescribed, who should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted and freèd from battell, and in what manner they should behaue themselues in battell, v. 10. but if it had beene vnlawfull at all to make warre, it would rather by law haue been altogether prohibited and restrained, then by certaine orders and rules commended. 4. Warre also is ascribed vnto God, as Exod. 17.16. <hi>The Lord will haue warre with Amalek:</hi> and Dauid is said, <hi>to fight the battels of the Lord,</hi> 1. Sam. 25.28. But God is not the author of euill.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But as it is lawfull to wage battell, so yet euerie kind of warre is not lawfull. These conditions then therein are required. First, that warre is not to be attempted without the authoritie of the Magistrate: for to him the sword is committed; as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <hi>He beareth not the sword for naught.</hi> Rom. 13.4. therefore it is not lawfull for priuate men of their owne head to beare armes: but in case of extreame necessitie, as where the enemies make sodaine inuasion, when there is no time to consult with the Magistrate: who yet haue the secret consent and authoritie of the Magistrate, whose will is, that his subiects should be preserued from wrong. Secondly, the cause
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18791:11"/>
of warre must be iust and honest, as to deliuer the oppressed, to suppresse the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, to recouer things wrongfully taken away, and for such like causes. Thirdly, it must be enterprized with a good minde; not to seeke reuenge, or with a desire to the spoile of the enemies, or to grow rich by warre, as mercenarie souldiers for no other cause loue warre: but first all honest meanes must be vsed for peace before warre be attempted; and then the other conditions concurring, they must proceede to battell, setting before them chiefely the glorie of God, to the ende they may liue in peace.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Christ in the parable would not haue the tares weeded out, but to remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time of haruest, therefore warre is not to bee taken in hand for to purge the euill.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Christ saith vnto his Apostles, <hi>My peace I giue vnto you:</hi> Christs kingdome is peaceable, of the which the Prophet Isay saith, <hi>they shall breake their swords into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, and their speares into sythes,</hi> Isay. 2.4. How is this Prophesie verified, if now Christians vnder the kingdome of Christ should defend themselues with speares and swords?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The warfare of a Christian is now spirituall: as the Apostle sheweth, <hi>That wee wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principallities and powers, &amp;c. against spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wickednesses:</hi> and therefore he would haue vs put on the armour of God. Such are their reasons, which are thus briefly answered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contr.</hi> 1. Our Sauiour in that place speaketh not of the authoritie of the Magistrate, but of euery priuate mans dutie, that they should be readie to suffer wrong, if they see it make more for the glorie of God, and the winning of their brother: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise our Sauiour himselfe did not keepe it according to the letter: for when he was smitten vpon the one cheeke, he did not turne the other: and S. Paul beeing smitten vpon the face, Act. 23. answered againe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. S. Peter also was a priuate man, and beside, he vsed the sword in his heat, with a reuengefull minde, and therefore he receiued that answer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apostle doth not simply forbid to goe to Lawe; but two things he findeth fault with: the one, because they drewe their brethren before the tribunall of heathen Iudges: the other, for that they were apt vpon euerie occasion to goe to lawe, and would not suffer any wrong at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that parable our Sauiour intreateth not of the dutie either of Magistrate or Minister: but sheweth the present condition of the Church what it is, that it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be without tares: for if that were the meaning, as they pretend, then there should be no place left for any ciuill punishment, or Ecclesiasticall censure.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Christ indeede left peace vnto his disciples, both the internall peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the externall also to them, which are his true followers: neither betweene Christian Princes and kingdomes, which truely professe the Gospel of Christ, doth there vse to be warre: If Christians then were such as by their profession they ought to be, that prophesie would haue his effect here in this world: but now because there are many carnall men in the Church, which mooue debate and dissention, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for vs, that this promise of peace beeing but in part begun here, be respited for the full and finall accomplishment thereof vnto the next life.</p>

                  <p>1. Gods prouidence herein notably appeared, that Dauid all the while he was in exile had no children, but now beeing setled in his kingdome, he hath sonnes borne vnto him. <hi>Mart.</hi> 2. But in that of sixe wiues he had but sixe sonnes, this may bee obserued, that the marriage of many wiues was not blessed with fruitfulnesse: Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon had 700. wiues, and 300. concubines, yet but one sonne Rehoboam. As though nature it selfe gaine saied such mariages, as beeing contrarie to the first institution in the creation. <hi>Pellic.</hi> 3. Dauid had small comfort by these children: his eldest sonne Ammon committed incest, and was slaine by Absalom: Absalom rebelled against his father: Adoniah for affecting the kingdome was put to death by Salomon: So good men may be crossed in their children: and parents to whom God sendeth children, must therefore pray vnto God, to make them good children. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>1. Some thinke that Dauid offended God in this mariage, and therefore he was punished in his rebellious sonne Absolom the offspring of that mariage. <hi>Borr.</hi> 2. But it is rather to be thought, that Dauid herein did not doe any vnlawfull thing: for they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18791:12"/>
were onely forbidden to ioyne in mariage with the nations of the Cananites, Hiuites, Iebuzites, Pherezites, and the rest: now the Geshurites were none of them, but were a people of the Amalekites, 1. Sam. 27.8. And it was permitted by the law, for the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites to haue to their wiues the captiue women, which were taken in battell, Deut. 21.13. though such kind of mariages were rather tolerated, then commanded and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the law. 3. So it seemeth that Dauid tooke this <hi>Maacah</hi> among the captiues of the Geshurites, whome he inuaded: whome it is like he had taken to him before he came to Hebron: but yet shee was not then accounted among his wiues, as beeing not yet fully purged from her superstitious Gentilisme. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>1. Some thinke, because shee was but of base parentage, and was not by any other thing commended, then that shee was Dauids wife, she is so called, <hi>Vatab.</hi> but there are diuers other of Dauids wiues also, as <hi>Haggith, Abital,</hi> of whome no honourable mention is made, sauing that they were Dauids wiues. 2. Some thinke that this Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah was Michol, called the wife of Dauid, because shee was chiefe among them, as Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel was Iaakobs principall wife: and that shee was barren from that time, when shee mocked Dauid, chap. 6. but she might notwithstanding haue had a child before. <hi>Mar. Pellic.</hi> But it is not like shee was Michol, seeing shee is still called by the name of Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, 1. Chron. 3. and the Scripture euidently sheweth, that shee had no child till the day of her death. 3. Some are of opinion, that this Eglah was one of Sauls wiues: but it was not lawfull for Dauid to marrie his father in lawes wife: the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees beeing forbidden as well of affinitie, which are of consanguinitie. 4. This clause then, <hi>his wife,</hi> is to be vnderstood in generall, that euery one of these six was Dauids wife: and that he had these sonnes in Hebron by his wiues, beside those which he had by his concubines, 1.

                  <p>1. The Hebrewes thinke that Abner would haue had her to wife, which they hold to haue beene a thing vnusuall, and intolerable, that any should marrie her, that had beene the Kings wife: <hi>Pellic.</hi> and therefore Salomon tooke exception to his brother Adoniah, as affecting the kingdome, because he desired to wife Abishag. 2.

But it is rather like, that this was a false surmise, and suspition, without any ground: for Abner doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward instantly denie it: <hi>Iun.

Genevens.</hi> But it is shewed before, that it is like that this was but a meere suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Abner. 2. Yet his pride and ambition appeareth, that could not abide one contumelle or reproach at Ishbosheths hand: that neither reuerence to the kingdome, nor yet neerenes in blood, could containe him in his dutie, but he must breake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to disloyaltie. <hi>Pellic.</hi> 3. Beside, his leuitie and inconstancie is manifest, that vpon so small an occasion turneth from Ishbosheth, to take part with Dauid: to whom he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to ioyne, not of conscience, because he was the Lords annointed; but of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against Ishbosheth.

                  <p>1. The thing which <hi>Abner</hi> now went about was not vnlawfull, to bring the kingdom vnto Dauid, to whom the Lord had giuen it, though Abner did it of an euill minde: as Rahab did not euill in not discouering the spies, and so betraying the citie, Ios. 2.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18791:13"/>
nor the men of Luz, in shewing the way into the citie, by which meanes it was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, Iudg. 1.23. This therefore not beeing an euill act of it selfe, Dauid might therein vse Abner. And so, that which is done by an other not without sinne, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God may make vse of without sinne: as Iacob vsed the benefit of Labans oath, that sware by his gods, Gen. 31. as the tenne men, whom Ismael would haue slaine with the rest, saued their liues, in feeding their enemies couetous desire, allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that they had treasures in the field of wheat, and barley, oyle, and honie, which they would discouer vnto them, if they would not slay them.<note place="margin">Ierem. 41.8.</note> So a poore man is excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in taking vp money vpon interest for his necessitie, though the vsurer be not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in blamelesse. 2. But this libertie holdeth onely in things, which are not in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euill: for in such, we can no way consent, or giue liking, but we must sinne. 3. Hitherto then Dauid offended not, in beeing contented to take aduantage of this message of Abner: but herein Dauid was ouerseene: first, that in so waightie matter as this, he did not first aske counsell of God: secondly, because he maketh a couenant with a wicked ambitious man, and of a suspected life. <hi>Pet.

                  <p>The reasons, which mooued Dauid were these. 1. In respect of himselfe, because she was his first wife, and he had obtained her, with his great danger; for an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistims: he gaue 200. not 600. as <hi>Iosephus,</hi> 1.

                  <p>1. Abner did not content himselfe with that message, which he had sent before, because things are better dispatched by personall presence, then by the ministerie and mediation of others: and because he would certifie Dauid, how he had dealt in his behalfe with all the Elders of Israel, and how he had preuailed with them: for these reasons he commeth himselfe in person to Dauid: <hi>Iosep.</hi> 2. But Dauid did not well in making him a feast: both because he had not first consulted with God, but followed onely humane counsell, and therefore it tooke no place: <hi>Pellic.</hi> as also Abner beeing an euill disposed man it was not meete, that Dauid should haue eaten with him: <hi>Mar.</hi> This feast therefore ended afterward with mourning: teaching vs what vncertaintie there is in these earthly ioyes, that we may learne to vse them soberly, and with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>Borr.</hi>

                  <p>1. When Ioab had accused Abner to the King, that he went but about to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him, and seeing that the King could not be induced to deale against Abner: then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18791:14"/>
he bethinketh himselfe to take a course to be reuenged, and sendeth for him backe as it seemeth in the Kings name, and so thinketh <hi>Iosephus.</hi> 2.

Ioab smiteth Abner in the same place, where he had smitten Asahel before: and though Ioab herein committed that which was both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy himselfe, and his master the King, and for the which he worthely suffered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward vnder Salomon: yet the iudgement of God was iust vpon Abner, a wicked and bloodie man: and the Lord turneth it to the great good of Dauid, in taking out of the way a new reconciled enemie, who would hardly haue prooued faithfull. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p>Whereas Dauid accurseth Ioab and his posteritie, and laieth vpon them an heauie burthen of fiue calamities and miseries: the running issue, the leprosie, weaknes, and faintnesse to goe with a staffe, vntimely death by the sword, and penurie and want of bread: wherein Dauid sheweth himselfe more seuere against his owne seruant and kinsman, then he was either against Saul or any enemie he had.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some therefore thinke that Dauid did curse Ioab of impotencie and weaknesse of affection, beeing in anger and greefe, and that therefore all these euills did fall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his posteritie: for they say, that Rehoboam had a <hi>running</hi> issue, Vzziah was a leper, Asa had the goute, Iosias was slaine with the sword, and Iehoiakim wanted bread: so the <hi>Rabbines.</hi> But these Kings of Dauids line were thus punished for their own sins, not for Dauids. <hi>Mar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some thinke, that this was no imprecation, but a prediction by the spirit of God of such euills, as should befall Ioab, and his posteritie: but the forme of speach and the manner of phrase, <hi>let the blood fall, &amp;c.</hi> sheweth it to be a verie imprecation, and malediction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some doe make question, whether this curse of Dauid beeing vttered in his heat and affection, did afterward take place, or no: <hi>Mar.</hi> But seeing Dauid was a Prophet, and here the reason is giuen of this iudgement, because both the brethren consented to kill Abner in time of peace, because he killed their brother in battell, v. 30. all which circumstances doe exaggerate the offence: it is not to be doubted, but that this curse tooke place vpon Ioab and his familie, as that other of Dauid vpon the mountaines of Gilboa, where Saul and Ionathan were slaine, tooke effect, 2. Sam. 1.21. and the leprosie of Naaman, by the Prophets sentence did cleaue vnto Gehezi. And that this Propheticall curse was effectuall, it seemeth to be the opinion of <hi>Iun.</hi> and <hi>Bor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It beeing then resolued vpon, that Dauid both as a Prophet accursed Ioab his sinne of blood so deseruing, and as a wise man, that it might appeare to all Israel that Dauid was no way consenting to this fact: yet these doubts further will be made: First, why Dauid laieth this curse vpon the whole familie, not excepting the innocent: whereas in the law, the Lord is said to visit the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to the third and fourth generation of those that hate him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This condition is alwaies included in such propheticall curses, though it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18791:14"/>
be not expressed. 2. or Dauid might foresee, that there should be alwaies some in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abs familie, whose sinnes might be worthie of those plagues: 3. and yet in temporall chastisments the children may beare the iniquitie of the fathers, without any impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods iustice.<note place="margin">2.

                        </gap>.</note> So the Prophet imposeth the plague of leprosie vpon Gehezi and his seed for euer, without any exception.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it will be obiected, why Dauid doth pronounce this execration rather against Ioab, then against Saul, which put the Lords Preists to the sword. <hi>Ans.</hi> Saul was the Lords anoynted, and therefore Dauid was no more to curse him, then to lay violent hands vpon him: againe, he should haue seemed to doe it in his owne cause: but the case was diuerse here: for Ioab beeing herein but a priuate person kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Abner, contrarie to the Kings faith and safe conduct giuen him: and did by this meanes, as much as in him lay, if Dauid had not caried the matter wisely, hinder the establishment of Dauids kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, but why did not Dauid then, hauing obtained the kingdome, himselfe take condigne punishment vpon Ioab. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Both because it would haue weakned his gouernment, if he should at the verie first haue shewed seueritie toward a man of his owne kinred, and which had deserued so well of him: and Ioabs sinne was not yet come to the full: he afterward killed Amasa also in the like case: so that his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, though a while deferred, was the more heauie and greeuous when it came, <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <p>1. Ioab might be thought to reioyce, and be glad, that Abner was ouerthrowen, and therefore he might seeme a very vnmeete man to celebrate Abners funerall: Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid therefore, in forcing them thereunto, some may thinke, did make him play the hypocrite: But, it was fit and requisite, that Ioab beeing a principall man vnder Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, should not be wanting in this solemnitie: Dauid then requiring him thereunto, did that, which was fit: if Ioab therein dissembled, it was his owne fault. So Princes may enioyne their subiects to come to the exercises of religion:<note place="margin">Princes may compell thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d. 2. Dauid might enioyne this dutie vnto Ioab, as a part of punishment: that he is constrained publikely to bewaile him, whom in his rage he had slaine. 3. And this might be a meanes also, to bring Ioab to acknowledge his sinne, seeing the great lamentation, which was made for Abner, whom he had slaine: <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p>Dauid lamenteth, and fasteth till euen, to shew and expresse his greefe for Abner, and that thereby he might content all Israel, and cleare himselfe as not beeing acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to his death: but no mention is here made of any prayers made for Abner: yet the Romanists dare auouch, that this fasting and mourning of Dauid was for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of Abners soule: and that for this cause the Patriarks desired to be buried in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18791:15"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. It is euident by the text, that all this lamentation of Dauid, was to shew his griefe, <hi>that there was a great man fallen in Israel,</hi> v. 38. neither is there one syllable of any prayer made for Abner: it is then great boldnesse to ground that error vpon Scripture, which is altogether silent in that behalfe: neither were there any sacrifices in the lawe (there beeing so many diuerse kinds prescribed) appointed for the dead. 2. Neither was that any cause of their desire to be buried in the land of Canaan: but onely to shew their hope, in the certaine expectation of the promises of God: and to be a monument to their posteritie, that the Lord would bring them thither: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, seeing the Israelites continued in Egypt almost 200. yeares after Iacobs buriall in Canaan, if he had intended to be helped by the prayers of the Church, he should haue desired to haue his bones kept in Egypt, &amp; then caried thence at their departure, as Ioseph did, that he might haue had the benefit of the Churches prayers, which yet was to soiourne there. 3. And the cause is euident why Dauid ceaseth to pray any longer for the infant being dead, because he knew, that then he should not be brought to life againe. The childs soule indeed had no need of Dauids prayers, no more had the soules of the faithfull departed: and for the rest, that died in their sinne, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their iudgement, and by the prayers of the liuing could not be releeued.</p>

                  <p>1.

Some other doe make this the sense, that whereas Dauids kingdome was but yet weake, these two men shewed more inhumanitie and inclemencie, then was for the safetie of his kingdome. 3. But it is euident by Dauids words, that he hath relation to himselfe, that they were too hard for him: it was not in his power to punish them, as their fact deserued, and therefore he committeth the reuenge of this cause vnto God.</p>

                  <p>1. Some are of opinion, that Dauid offended herein, and of a partiall affection spared Ioab, whereas he ought to haue beene put to death: and thus they doe reason. 1. By the law, he that slaieth a man presumptuously, is to be taken from the Altar, and to be put to death, Exod. 21.14. his punishment is not to be deferred or suspended. 2. It was the ruine of Eli his house, because he was too remisse toward his children. 3. And the King of Israel is reprooued, because he let Benhadad goe, when the Lord had giuen him into his hands. <hi>Mart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Neither did Dauid pardon Ioab, but he gaue charge vnto Salomon concerning him, who caused him to be slaine at the Altar: and that law commandeth not that which is not possible, or not in the Magistrates power to performe: as if a murderer flie the countrie, and so be out of the Magistrates power, he doth not break the Law, in not putting him to death: so neither doth he, that can not reach the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, without great tumult, and danger to the common wealth, but watcheth his conuenient time to doe it; which was Dauids case here. 2. Eli might haue corrected his sonnes without any danger, so could not Dauid. 3. And so was Benhadad deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Kings hand, who beeing a forren enemie might with lesse trouble haue beene put to death, then Ioab a domesticall freind, and much fauoured among the people.</p>
                  <p>2. The better opinion then is, that Dauid did prudently forbeare to punish Ioab: not so much because he was his kinsman, and had beene faithfull vnto him in the time
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18791:15"/>
of his affliction, <hi>Pellic.</hi> or that he had many wayes well deserued of him, and could not well spare his seruice: <hi>Borrh.</hi> but for that they were too hard, and strong for him. And it seemeth in the historie of Absalom, c. 18.19. that Ioab did beare greater sway among the souldiers and militarie men, then Dauid himselfe: therefore it is a wise mans part, as well to consider, what may be done, as ought to be done: <hi>Iun.</hi> This then was in Dauid no conniuence or winking at Ioabs sinne, which he bare in mind, and charged his sonne to see iustice executed. But Dauid prudently deferred the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment onely, which could not presently without great daunger be inflicted. At o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, when it was in his power, he delaied not to doe iustice; as vpon the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekite, that said he had killed Saul, and vpon those two, that killed Ishbosheth. The like example we read of Iacob, who when his two sonnes Simeon and Levi had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that shamefull murder vpon the Sichemites, did not proceed against them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a Magistrate in his owne familie: but deferred the censure till his death, Gen. 49.5. for both his children being stubburne and vnruly were too strong for him, and beside there was then no time, to make a stirre in his owne familie, they beeing round about beset, and enuironed of their enemies.</p>

                  <p>1. Some thinke, that this is rather a prediction of Dauid, what should befall the wicked, then an imprecation.

Good workes are no cause of their reward, but they are crowned in mercie: but euill workes are meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous causes of their punishment. 3. Neither doth God recompence all euill doers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their workes, but such onely as are obstinate and impenitent. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p>1. This narration is inserted, to shewe the purpose and drift of these two captains in killing of Ishbosheth: they saw that none remained of Sauls house, who was likely to succeed in the kingdome, and to reuenge Ishbosheths death, but onely Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, who was a lame man: <hi>Iun.</hi> and beside, he was but a child; not aboue 12. yeare old: for 5. yeare old he was at the time of Sauls death, and Dauid had now raigned toward seauen yeares in Hebron: Saul had other sonnes by Rispah his concubine, but they could not be heires to the kingdome: <hi>Borr.</hi> 2. Further, hereby appeareth the prouidence of God, so disposing all things for Dauids good, that the kingdome might be deuolued vnto him, without his owne seeking: for seeing there was none left of Sauls house, sauing Ishbosheth, who was afterward killed, and Mephibosheth, the one lame in bodie, the other impotent in mind, the people of necessitie were now to looke after Dauid, and to desire him to be their King: as it followeth in the next chapter. <hi>Pellic.</hi>

                  <p>1. The Chalde thinketh that they came as merchants to buy corne, so also <hi>Vatab.</hi> but if they had beene strangers, it is not like they should haue had such readie accesse. 2.

                  <p>1. Though it seemeth to haue beene vsuall in those countries, to haue their after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone nappes, as we read of Dauid, c. 12.3. both because the nights were short, and therefore they tooke vp some part of their sleepe in the day: <hi>Mar.</hi> and the heate of the day, which is verie feruent in those countries, made them also drowsie: <hi>Ioseph.</hi> 2. Yet this heauie sleepe of Ishbosheth, beeing now left naked, and without defence (Abner beeing slaine) sheweth both his securitie touching his owne estate, and his negligent administration of the kingdome: so Ionas slept in the ship when the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest arose, and great daunger was at hand; and the disciples were asleepe, when their master was in his greatest agonie.<note place="margin">Matth. 26.40.</note> 3. But sleepe it selfe is not to be accused: for as some are ouertaken in their sleepe; so sometime it is a meane of deliuerance, and to escape danger: as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath a storie how <hi>Mithridates</hi> sent one <hi>Oltacus</hi> to kill <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who comming thither as to doe a message of some importance, and answer beeing returned, that he was asleepe, and it was against his health to be awaked; he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fledde away, least he should haue beene further sifted. 4. And seeing Ishbosheth was thus slaine in his sleepe, it teacheth vs to commend our selues vnto God, when wee goe to our rest, because we knowe not what may happen vnto vs in our sleepe. <hi>Martyr.</hi>

                  <p>1. <hi>Dauid</hi> vttereth three excellent sentences: the one in saying, <hi>as the Lord liueth, who hath deliuered me:</hi> shewing that vnlawfull meanes must not be vsed to hasten the Lords worke, but that we must with patience waight vpon God: the other, that we must not reioyce in the destruction of an enemie, as Dauid did not neither in Sauls death, nor Ishbosheths: the third, that honestie is to be preferred before profit and vtilitie, and that the counsels and enterprises of the wicked must not be approoued, though they be for our profit: <hi>Borr.</hi> 2. Dauid will much more be avenged of these men, then of the Amalekite that said he killed Saul; both in respect of their persons, who were seruants to Ishbosheth, and of the same tribe, whereas the Amalekite was a stranger, and not of Israel: as also of him that was slaine, who was a righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: in respect of them which conspired against him, he had deserued well of them; so had not Saul of the Amalekites, whom he had destroyed, and Saul had alreadie his deaths wound, and could not recouer, but Ishbosheth was then a sleepe, and in good health: the one was killed in the field, the other in his owne house: and thirdly, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid was then but as a priuate man, when he commaunded the Amalekite to be killed, but now he was anointed King in Hebron: therefore in all these three respects, there was greater cause why he should put them to death, then the other.</p>

                  <p>1. Dauid either caused their bodies which were hanged vp, to be taken downe before night, according to the Law, Deuter. 21. and as it was practised by Iosuah, c. 7. <hi>Mart.</hi> or else he hung vp onely their hands and feete ouer the poole in Hebron,<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their bodies were taken downe, both in detestation of that horrible murder, and to be a spectacle to others: <hi>Borr.</hi> An example is made of those parts, which were the speciall instruments of contriuing this villanie, their feete in going to shedde blood, and their hands in cutting off his head: <hi>Mart.</hi> 2. This cutting off the hands and feet, was beside the prescript of the law, which commanded the murderer onely to be put to death: but as the sinne might be more hainous, so the Magistrate might also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the punishment; as they cut off Adonibezeks thumbes of his hands and feete.

                  <p>1. Though the number be not here expressed, it is at large set downe, 1. Chron. c. 12. v. 23. to the ende of the Chapter. The particular numbers out of euerie tribe that came to Dauid were these; out of Iudah, 6800. out of Simeon, 7100. of Leui 4600. of Beniamin, 3000. of Ephraim, 20800. of the halfe tribe of Manasseh, 18000. of Issachar, 200. captaines with their companies, the number whereof is not set downe: of Zebulun, 50000. of Nephtali 1000. captaines, and with them 37000. of Dan, 28000. of Asher, 40000. and of them beyond Iordan an 120000. The whole number beeing summed together, maketh about 300000. 2. But Iosephus somewhat differeth in his account; for the odde 800. yeares of Iudah, he reckoneth but 600. for the odde 600. of Leui, he writeth 700. he numbreth of Issachar, 20000. which is not expressed in the text: and the number of 30000. out of Nephtali he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth: from them beyond Iordan, he accounteth but 22000. who made 120000. 3. Of all these the most backward are noted to haue beene of Beniamin: for of that tribe came the smallest number, but 3000. for they yet held with the house of Saul: the most forward were they of Zebulun, as it appeareth by their number of 50000. which was the greatest of any one tribe: and they are directly mentioned not to haue bin of a double heart.<note place="margin">Iosep. l. 7. antiq. cap. 2.</note> And <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth that this tribe onely came whole to Dauid.</p>

                  <p>The whole time is said to be 40. yeares: whereof he raigned 7. yeares six moneths in Hebron, and 33. yeares in Ierusalem: which make in all 40. yeares sixe moneths. 1. Some thinke that these sixe moneths are not summed, because so long the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Dauid was intermitted by the rebellion and sedition of Absalom: so the Hebrewes. 2.

                  <p>1. The Hebrewes haue here a fabulous narration of two images, one of Isaac, who was blind, and the other of Iacob, who was lame, by whom a league was made with Abimelech, in which league the Iebusites also were comprehended: so that in effect the Iebusites which held the tower of Sion, say thus much, that vnlesse they first would violate that couenant, they were not to come vp thither: But this conceit hath no probabilitie: for Abimelech was King of the Philistims, not of the Iebusites: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the league rather appertained to them, then vnto the other. 2.

                  <p>1. The word translated Idols, is <hi>ghatzabehem,</hi> their idols, or images: which word properly signifieth <hi>griefe</hi> or <hi>terror</hi>; for the superstitious adoration of images bringeth no true comfort, but griefe and terror to those that worship them: <hi>Iun.

As Iacob burned them vnder an oke, and so tooke them out of the way: and Moses burned the golden calfe, and beat it to pouder, that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of offence and stumbling might vtterly be remooued out of the way: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we read, that they which preserued or erected such superstitious monuments, put a stumbling block before the people, as Micah did by making him images, Iudg. 17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. The superstition also of the Philistims herein shewed it selfe, who carried their Idols with them into their campe, thinking thereby to be protected: therein, as it seemeth imitating the Israelites, who carried the Arke into the host, 1.

                  <p>WHereas the storie is rehearsed, 1. Chr. 13. before Dauid had the former battell with the Philistims: 1. <hi>P. Mart.</hi> onely propoundeth this doubt, and saith, <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storia videri possit nonnihil perturbata:</hi> the historie seemes to be put somewhat out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but he giueth no solution of this question. 2. Certain it is, that Dauid <hi>parta pace,</hi> hauing obtained peace, <hi>Osiand. deuictis hostibus,</hi> and his enemies ouercome, <hi>Pellic.</hi> then did settle himselfe to reforme religion: and therefore the historie is here set downe in the right order of time, howsoeuer it is reported in the Chronicles. 3. Therefore the best answer is this, that Dauid had assembled together the cheife of Israel twice to this ende, and consulted with them to bring home the Arke: the first time was after he had surprised and taken the fort of the Iebusites in Ierusalem: which purpose and consultation of Dauid, was hindered and interrupted by the inuasion of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims; then after Dauid had vanquished them, he called them againe, and therefore it is here said, <hi>Dauid gathered together againe the chosen men, &amp;c. Pet.

Chron. 13.1.5. 4. But yet this doubt remaineth, because in that place all this rehearsed to be done in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to v. 10. is set downe before Dauids battell with the Philistims: whereunto this answer may be giuen, that mention beeing made there of that consultation, which Dauid had before the Philistims battell, that narration is finished together, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vse of Scripture, which more respecteth the coherence of argument, then the order of time.</p>

                  <p>In the Chronicles the certaine number is not expressed, how many were gathered together, but here they are said to be 30. thousand: As here the bounds and limits of the land are not described, how farre and from whence they were called, as there it is said, that Dauid gathered them together, from Sichar of Egypt vnto the entring in of Hamath, that is, from the South bounds of the land to the North: <hi>Borr.</hi> The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of this great assemblie were these. 1. <hi>Vt solenni pompa, &amp;c.</hi> that with solemne pompe, and due deuotion they might bring the Arke: <hi>Pellic.</hi> 2. <hi>Vt ad manum habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret paratos milites,</hi> that he might haue souldiers readie at hand, if the enemie should haue attempted to disturbe them: <hi>Osiand.</hi> 3. <hi>Vt pium &amp; moderatum Principem decuit, &amp;c.</hi> as it became a moderate and godly Prince, he would haue the consent of the states and the people: not like vnto the Pope and his Cardinalls, and the Papall prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, who take vpon them without the aduise of the ciuill state, to innovate and change matters of religion of their owne head: <hi>Mart.</hi> 4. <hi>Rupertus</hi> maketh this solemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the Arke, which was a type of Christ, a type and figure of the solemne prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and publishing of the resurrection of Christ by the Apostles through the world. 5. So the first thoughts and counsell of Dauid, after he was established, and setled in his kingdome, was to seeke after God, and to reforme religion. But in Sauls time they sought not the to Arke of God, 1. Chr. 13.3. for Sauls head was troubled and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the succession of the kingdome, and the pursuing of Dauid: and in stead of consulting with God at the Arke, hee went vnto Witches, which was his ruine. <hi>Martyr.</hi>

in these two respects. 1. Because as these imitated the Philistims, so they doe borrow many of their rites and vsages from the Iewes, or Gentiles. 2.

                  <p>1. The instruments of Musicke are described by their matter; they were made of firre tree, some take it for cedar, some for boxe: the word is <hi>berash,</hi> which vsually is taken for the firre: <hi>V.A.P.I.</hi> which is an fit wood to make instruments of, as is vsed to this day; the diuerse kinds also of these instruments made of firre are named, as <hi>Harpes, Psaltaries, Timbrels.</hi> 2.

And by the Epistle of <hi>Plinie</hi> to <hi>Traiane</hi> the Emperor, it seemeth that euen from the Apostles times, <hi>in sacro vsu habuisse Musicam,</hi> that they had a sacred vse of Musicke, euen from the Apostles time. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. Beside the custome of the countrie, the <hi>pedagogie</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of those times, which was full of types and shadowes, did commend this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vse of Musicke in religion: whereby were represented, those <hi>cantiones spirituales,</hi> spirituall songs, and hymnes, which the Apostle speaketh of: <hi>singing and making melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vnto the Lord in your hearts,</hi> Ephes. 5.13. <hi>Borrh.</hi> 4.

But the text giuing this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>because the Lord hath smitten Vzzah</hi>; sheweth that this indeed was the cause of Dauids greife: therefore the meaning is, that <hi>displicuit Dauidi,</hi> it displeased Dauid: <hi>I.G.B.</hi> or Dauid was mooued and troubled, as Samuel was mooued, when the Lord had cast off Saul, and cried vnto the Lord all night, 1.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <head>17. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 16. Why they sacrificed, when they had gone sixe paces.</head>
                  <p>1. The <hi>Rabbines</hi> thinke, that they sacrifice now at six paces, because Vzzah was smitten, when they had gone six paces: but whether that were so or not, as soone as they set forward and perceiued, that God was present with them, and none of them were smitten, they offered sacrifice in signe of thanksgiuing. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 2. Some of the Hebrewes thinke, that the Leuites felt not the Arke heauie as they did beare it, and therefore beeing mooued with this miracle they sacrificed: but it is dangerous deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing miracles without Scripture. 3. It is most like that he which was set ouer the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, who caried the Arke by turnes, appointed them their stations, how farre the parties or bearers should goe before they rested, which was six paces: therefore it is said, 1. Chron. 15.26. when the Lord eased and helped the Leuites, that is, when they rested them, at the appointment of Chenamah, who was set ouer them, 1. Chron. 15.22. then they offered sacrifice. 4. And, they offered these sacrifices vpon some Altar made vpon the suddaine, either of earth, or of rough stone according to the law, Exod. 20.24. <hi>Iun.</hi> 5. The cause why none of them were now smitten was, for that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fault and ouersight was redressed, the Leuites now did beare the Arke vpon their shoulders according to the Law, 1. Cor. 15.14.</p>

                  <p>Here the text saith they offered a bullocke and a fat beast, that is, but one: but 1. Chron. 15.26. it is said they offered seauen bullockes, and seauen rammes. 1.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18791:22"/>
the other number of seauen bullocks, and seauen rammes: but seeing the words are here put in the singular number, they are not fitly translated in the plurall, there bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no such necessitie. 3. I approoue rather <hi>Osianders</hi> solution: who thinketh that there were certaine stations, which are called paces, at the end of six of them the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites set downe the Arke, and others carried in their place: and at the end of euery six of these stations, they offered a bullocke, and a ramme: and this they did seauen times till they came to the Citie of Dauid: So in all at these seauen seuerall times they offered seauen bullockes, and seauen other fat beasts, that is rammes; for at euery six spaces or stations ende, they offered a bullocke, and an other beast.</p>

                  <p>1. It was the custome and vse of the seruants of God, when they would shew their exceeding ioy, to expresse the same with their outward gesture, and that with daunsing: as Elias, when the raine came, that had beene restrained three yeare and six monthes,<note place="margin">1. King. 18 46.</note> did gird vp his loines, the Spirit of God beeing vpon him, and ranne before Ahabs chariot. 2. But whereas there are diuerse kinds of daunsing; as there is a graue motion of the bodie, which sometime is vsed by the Auncient: and there is a wanton and light kind of daunsing: this gesture, which Dauid vsed in leaping and stirring his bodie, was of the first sort. 3. Beside, his example was extraordinarie: for otherwise it might haue seemed not befitting the person of a King to daunce in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like view, and sight: as <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> among the Romans, were blamed of all for dauncing publikely in the theater, beeing Emperours: when Kings and publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are mooued by the like spirit, they may doe as Dauid did: otherwise they must <hi>vsitata ratione Deum colere:</hi> worship God after the vsuall, and ordinarie manner. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p>1. <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh, that Dauid was so addicted to the seruice of God, that hee put on a preistly garment: he taketh it to be such a linen Ephod, as the inferior preists vsed to weare: as 1. Sam. 21.18. But Dauid hauing beene so lately taught by Vzzahs presumption, who beeing but a Leuite medled with the preists office, in touching the Arke, would not aduenture to were those garments which were peculiar vnto preists. 2. Neither yet was it a meere ciuill garment, such as they which are preists or Leuites did sometime weare, <hi>honoris causa,</hi> for honour sake: <hi>Borrh.</hi> for Dauid as it were aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and humbling himselfe in the sight of God, as he saith, v. 22. <hi>I will yet be more vile then thus,</hi> did lay aside in all likelihood his garments of honour and state. 3. I thinke it therefore more probable, that it was neither a preistly garment, nor yet altogether ciuill or prophane: but such as <hi>vulgus Deo deuoturum,</hi> they which were deuoted vnto God, though they were neither Leuites, nor preists, did vse in the seruice of God, &amp; religious actions: See more of the Ephod, 1. Sam. c. 2. qu. 5. and c. 22. qu. 13. So Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid here did not shew himselfe as a Preist, as they say <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. in his solemne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Bononia did put on a linen vesture to please the Papal societie, as though he were consecrated one of their preists: but he put it on not onely to be the lighter, and to daunce the more nimbly, <hi>Mart.</hi> but to shew his deuotion. 4. Yet did he not strippe himselfe of his princely robes, as thinketh <hi>Mart.</hi> as Saul was naked before the Prophets, that is, hauing laid aside his princely robes: for vnder the linen Ephod, he had a silke cloake or robe; for so it is said, that he had a silke robe, and then vpon that a linen Ephod, 1.

                  <p>1. Though it be not like, that Dauid here, and Salomon who blessed the people also at the consecration of the Temple, vsed that forme of blessing, which is prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, Numb. 6.24. <hi>The Lord blesse thee, and keepe thee,</hi> which onely was appointed for the Preists to vse: yet Dauid after some other holy manner blessed the people, and wished well vnto them. 2. And he doth not onely wish well vnto them in words, but performeth the same also vnto them in deeds; making a feast vnto all the people, he gaue vnto euery one, a cake of bread, and a peece of flesh, and a bottle of wine: <hi>Iosephus</hi> omitteth the wine, and speaketh of a wafer cake, beside the bread, that should be giuen vnto euery one: but the text is of more credit with vs. 3. Dauid did not shew such bountie when he was confirmed in the kingdome by the people, c. 5. to shew that he more reioyced in the true worship of God, then in the honour of his kingdome: <hi>Mart.</hi> 4. Dauid here executeth part of the preistly, part of the princely office: hee blesseth as a Preist, and giueth bountifully to the people as a King.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. She is called the daughter of Saul, because indeed herein, <hi>refert ingenium patris,</hi> she did shew the qualitie of her father. <hi>Iun.</hi> he was an hypocrite, and vaine glorious, and sought onely the praise of men: whereas Dauid referreth all vnto Gods glorie: <hi>Pellican.</hi> yet in the meane time shee forgetteth, how her father Saul had in like sort behaued himselfe among the prophets, prophecying naked, that is, without his prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly robes before them, 1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had vncouered himselfe in the eyes of the handmaides: not that either of purpose Dauid shewed his bare and naked bodie in dauncing, beeing verie bewtifull, as some thinke: or that his bare flesh was seene, <hi>vestibus ex tripudio diffluentibus,</hi> his garments in dauncing flying abroad, <hi>Osiander,</hi> so also <hi>Iosephus:</hi> but for that he had shewed light behauiour, not beseeming the grauitie of a King, in so much, that the very maides scorned him, and made iests of him. 3.

                  <p>1. Michol at once committed a treble fault, she derided Dauid, beeing both king, and a Prophet, and her husband: and her reproachfull speech redounded to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God, and therefore Dauid iustified that which he had done: <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids defence consisteth of these three parts: for as Michol had obiected three things, vncomelines in not behauing himselfe as a King, that he had exposed himselfe to the scorne of the maids, and made himselfe equall vnto vile and base fellowes: Dauid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth vnto euery part, 1. He did this before the Lord, before whom Kings are as other men: and therefore it was no dishonour vnto him, so to abase himselfe in the presence of the King of kings. 2. Remembring the mercie which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the Lord, in preferring him before Saul and his house, hee could not shew himselfe too vile and low in his owne eyes, to testifie his thankfulnesse vnto God. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siander.</hi> 3. And he would still more humble himselfe, and by this meanes he should be honoured not onely of the maides, from among whom he afterward tooke wiues and concubines: <hi>Osiand.</hi> but of all the Israelites, whom she called his seruants, euen with them, <hi>ghimmam,</hi> which beeing in the masculine, must be referred to the men, not to the women: <hi>Iun.</hi> yea not onely of Israel, but of all other nations shall I be had in honour: <hi>Pellican.</hi> according to that saying, 1. Sam. 2.30. <hi>them that honour mee, will I honour. Iun.</hi> 3. Thus our Blessed Sauiour beeing derided and scorned vpon the crosse, was more exalted in his glorious resurrection. And when <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour laying aside his Imperiall maiestie, submitted himselfe to publike penance, though hee might for the present be derided, yet to this day is more honoured.

                  <p n="1">1. Some Hebrewes thinke, that she had a child at the time of her death, and died thereof, as Rachel did, and as the wife of Phinehes the sonne of Heli: But this phrase <hi>vntill the day of her death,</hi> is as much in effect as neuer, and it putteth in a perpetuall barre: as 1.

                  <p n="2">2. Some thus vnderstand this place, that from this time, wherein she shewed such contempt, she had neuer after any children; but before she might haue: for they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that this Michol is the same, which is called Eglah, c. 3.5. whose sonne by Dauid was <hi>Ithream: Borrh.</hi> but that Eglah and Michol were not the same, as is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, cap. 3. qu. 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, that Michol had fiue sonnes before by an other man, but none by Dauid: but those fiue sonnes said to be Michols, were not hers but her sister Merabs: who, and not Michol, was married to Adriel; for Michol was giuen vnto Phaltiel: therefore where it is said, the fiue sonnes of Michol, &amp;c. which she bare to Adriel: there must be supplied, the <hi>Sister</hi> of Michol, as shall be shewed in that place.</p>

                  <p>1. Dauid knew well enough, that God dwelled not in houses made with hands, neither that any Temple could be made to comprehend his maiestie: yet because the Arke was a visible symbole of Gods presence, he thought, that the reuerent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment thereof tended to Gods honour. 2. And this desire of Dauid, as all other good thoughts and purposes proceeded from the spirit of God: <hi>Pellican.</hi> onely Dauids ouersight was this, because he would runne before the Lords commandement. <hi>Mart.</hi> 3. Yet this worthie lesson is learned from Dauid, that men should not be more addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the setting forth of their owne pompe, and garnishing of their owne houses, and in the meane time neglect the place of Gods seruice: as the Prophet <hi>Hagge</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth the Iewes, because they themselues dwelled in sicled houses,<note place="margin">Hagg 3.4.</note> and suffered the house of God to lie wast. 4. Dauid also in not resting vpon his owne counsell, though he were a wise and holy man, but tooke counsell with Nathan the Prophet, therein is an example vnto Princes and Magistrates, to consult and aduise with wise and religious men. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p>1.<hi>D.

Therefore Dauid onely in familiar manner consulting with him, Nathan maketh him an answer, not as a Prophet, but as one giuing priuate aduise: for the Prophets had not alwaies the spirit of prophesie vpon them, but spake sometime as priuate men: as Samuel, when Eliab Dauids eldest brother came before him, thought at the first, that he was the Lords annointed: So Elisha said, when the Shunamite lay at his feete, beeing grieued for the death of her sonne,<note place="margin">2.

                     <hi>The Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Nathan was herein deceiued, because he sawe that God was with Dauid, that therefore he could not be deceiued: he reasoneth, as they say in Schooles, <hi>à dicto secundum quid, ad simpliciter,</hi> because God was with him at this time, and prospered him in some things, therefore he was with him in all. <hi>Mart.</hi> 4.

                  <p>1. Dauid, as here he consulteth with Nathan about building of God an house, so he earnestly vowed the same: as Psal. 132.2. it is said, <hi>He sware vnto the Lord, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the mightie God of Iacob: I will not enter into the Tabernacle of mine house, &amp;c. nor

                  <head>5. <hi>Quest.</hi> Wherefore the Lord would not haue Dauid build him an house, <hi>v.</hi> 6.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The first reason which the Lord vseth, is in respect of himselfe, that he had dwelt in no house since he brought Israel out of Egypt, and yet he was present with Israel, and contented himselfe to dwell in tents; he was all this while notwithstanding their Almightie God: therefore in respect of himselfe, there was no cause why Dauid should be so carefull to make God an house.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againe, in respect of Dauid himselfe there was iust cause, seeing there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes and Gouernours before him, vnto whom the Lord gaue no such comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, neither was he angrie with them for not building the Lord an house: Dauid therefore should not thinke, that it concerned him more, then any of the rest, which went before him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. An other reason is yeelded by Salomon, 1. King. 5.3. why it pleased not God, that Dauid should build him an house, because he had warre with the nations round about, and therefore he had no leisure nor opportunitie to enterprise such a great worke.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And beside, Dauid himselfe sheweth that the Lord forbad him to build him an house, because he was a man of warre, and had shed blood, 1. Chron. 28.3. not as though it had beene vnlawfull for Dauid to fight the Lords battels, or that he had beene defiled therewith: but because the building of the Temple, was a type of the spirituall building of the Church by Christ, the Prince of peace, it was requisite, that the Temple should be built by peaceable Salomon, that the figure and shadow might be correspondent to the bodie.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But this was no cause, as the Romanists imagine, because Dauid by shedding of blood, and waging of battell, became irregular: for then many of their Popes, which haue beene warriers and warlike men, should haue beene irregular; yea, and many of the founders of their Abbyes, which had beene murtherers, should haue much more incurred the same censure; for Dauids warres were iust, but they killed vniustly. <hi>Mar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. But in that God would not suffer Dauid to build him an house, we see that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are of no vertue or force, but as they haue their strength from the word of God: and therefore <hi>Ieremie</hi> reprooueth the hypocrites of his time, for hauing such confidence in the materiall Temple: who thought whatsoeuer sinnes they were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of, that they were deliuered in comming to the Temple, Ierem. 7.10. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <head>6. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Dauids desire to build God an house, were simply in it selfe acceptable.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. That Dauid did well therein, and that the Lord was well pleased with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpose, Salomon sheweth, 1. King. 8.18. so that generally in it selfe it was a good purpose and desire: but yet failed herein, because hee had no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18791:24"/>
particular direction from Gods word to doe it: for God may approoue some acts, which notwithstanding he will not haue done at all times and seasons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. True it is, that the Lord purposed to haue an house built, as is euident, Deut. 12.11. but the circumstance of time, and place, beeing not expressed, they were to waite for further direction and warrant from God: for it is not in these ceremoniall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as in morall; for where any morall precept is generally propounded, it must be executed without expecting any other commandement; as the Apostle saith, Philip. 4.8. <hi>Whatsoeuer things are true, whatsoeur things are honest, whatsoeuer things are iust, &amp;c. thinke of these things:</hi> but ceremonies and sacraments, must haue a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution from God: of which kind the building of the temple was.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And though Dauid here be inhibited to build Gods house, yet the Iewes in Haggies time were worthely reprooued for their negligence therein: not that God is contrarie to himselfe, in forbidding and commanding the same thing: but the reason of the difference is, because Dauid had no word of God to warrant this enterprise: but the Iewes were commanded by the Prophets, and so had the word of God, which they stubburnely disobeyed.</p>

                  <head>8. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 8. Why the Lord maketh mention, that he tooke Dauid from the sheepcoate.</head>
                  <p>The Lord to a diuerse end remembreth this here, then afterward, when he had committed that sinne in the matter of Vriah: where the Lord rehearsing the benefits which he had done for him, as how he had anointed him King ouer Israel, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him out of the hand of Saul, c. 12.7. vpbraideth Dauid for his vnthankefulnesse. But here, 1. the Lord by putting Dauid in mind of these benefits, he thereby doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, not to thinke that this inhibition to goe forward in his purpose to build God an house, proceeded from any disfauour, seeing he had heaped so many bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings vpon him: but that the Lord had another meaning in it. <hi>Mart. Osiand.</hi> 2. And beside, hereby the Lord doth stil keepe him in hope, that he will haue an house built, though not by him, nor at that time. <hi>Borrh.</hi> 3. And the Lord here also to this end ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a rehearsall, and commemoration of these benefits, therein commending and setting forth Dauids thankefulnesse, that in a thankefull remembrance thereof, would haue erected an house vnto the Lord: <hi>placet Dauidis institutum &amp; gratitudo</hi>; Dauids purpose and thankefulnesse, is pleasing vnto God. 4. And the Lord by rehearsing how Dauid was called to the place of gouernment, saith thus much in effect vnto him: <hi>reliquam partem officij exequere,</hi> execute the other part of thy office, <hi>Iun.</hi> thou hast other matters of the kingdome wherein thou maiest occupie thy selfe, be secure for this.</p>
                  <p>5. Fowre benefits the Lord rehearseth, which he had done for Dauid: 1. his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation from so lowe and meane an estate: 2. Gods continuall assistance, as when hee encountered Goliah, went against the Philistims, and tooke 200. of their foreskinnes. 3. God destroied all his enemies, as Saul, Doeg, and the rest. 4. And made his name famous, and renowned all abroad. And therefore as God had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blessed him, so hee would not leaue him: hee should not then thinke, that the Lord had refused him in this worke, as though his fauour were chaunged toward him. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>1. Some thinke that this promise for Dauids sake was peculiarly made to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, but the text is euident, that the Lord intendeth this blessing here promised to all the people of Israel. 2. And whereas the Lord had planted them before in the land of Canaan, <hi>D. Chimhi</hi> vnderstandeth this promise of the encrease of those former blessings, that the land should be blessed with greater fruitfulnes, and the kingdome with a more sure estate, then before. 3. This planting of the people here spoken of, hath relation also vnto the Temple, which the Lord would cause to be built in a sure place. <hi>Osiand.</hi> 4. And whereas the people after this were afflicted of the Aramites, the Assyrians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, by whome they were carried into captiuitie: this promise must both be vnderstood by way of comparison, that yet they endured not such afflictions and captiuitie, as in Egypt, and in the time of the Iudges. And these promises haue a condition included, that if they continued in obedience, and kept the law of God, they should enioy these promises; otherwise the Lord doth not so bind himselfe, as to stoppe the course of iustice. <hi>Mart.</hi> 5. And whereas it will be obiected, that in the daies of Ehud one of the Iudges, the land had rest 80. yeares, which may be compared for length with the peaceable yeares vnder Dauid and Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:<note place="margin">Iudg. 3.30.</note> it may be answered, that yet those daies are not to be compared with Dauids times: for vnder the Iudges, the Cananites still dwelt among the Israelites, so that their peace was not perfect: whereas they were expelled and finally vanquished by Dauid and Salomon. 6. But these blessings in part fulfilled in Dauid and Salomons raigne, yet haue their full accomplishment spiritually in the Messiah. <hi>Borr.</hi>

                  <p>1. The Hebrew phrase, to make an house, is to giue one issue and posteritie: and so the meaning is, that the Lord would giue vnto Dauid a succeeding posteritie, and an enduring family, which should possesse the kingdome after him. <hi>Vatab.</hi> 2. This priuiledge was not graunted to any of the Iudges, nor vnto Saul: the Kings of Israel after the kingdome was diuided, had some of them a succession in their posteritie, but it continued not long. Among the Romane Emperours from Iulius Cesar to Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, none of them left a sonne to succeede in the Empire. Vespasian had two sonnes, Titus, and Domitian, which were Emperours after him, but they could not leaue it to their sonnes. 3. The Turkes haue had a succession in one family aboue 250. yeares, but it is by parricide and crueltie, the father killeth the sonnes, one brother an other: but Dauids kingdome continued 400. yeares, in a lawfull gouernment. <hi>Mart.</hi>

As <hi>Augustine</hi> would perswade by these reasons: because the Lord promiseth that his kingdome should be for euer,<note place="margin">Lib. 18. de ciuit.

                     <hi>Ambrose</hi> addeth further, that Salomon was anointed King, his father yet liuing, whereas the Lord speaketh of Dauids seede, which he would set vp after him. <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. The eternitie of this kingdome was indeed fulfilled in Christ: but yet the other may be, and are vnderstood of Salomon. 2. By a faithfull house, is meant a sure &amp; stable house: for the word <hi>neman,</hi> signifieth both. 3. Though Salomon were anointed King, while his father liued, yet he was onely appointed then to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede his father in the kingdome, the gouernment was still in Dauid while he liued.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Iewes doe also vnderstand this prophesie of the Messiah, that he should build a materiall Temple, which should continue for euer: but of Christ they say it can not be meant, for he built no Temple. <hi>Contra.</hi> As though there is no other Temple, but that which is made of lime and stones? Christ hath built vnto the Lord a spirituall house, the Catholike Church: and so is <hi>house</hi> taken in Scripture, for a spirituall buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: as when the Scripture maketh mention of the house of Abraham, Isaak, and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,

they are not so blind and absurd, as to vnderstand it of an externall house.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some againe mislike, that this should at all be applied to the Messiah, obiecting, that when we can not otherwise interpret a place, we runne into allegories. But as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories deuised of man, are vncertaine, and prooue not: so yet such allegories as are warranted by the Scripture, doe make euident demonstration: as that of Ionas, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three daies in the bellie of the Whale: and that allegorie of the free woman, and bondwoman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.

                  <p n="4">4. Wherefore the safer way, is both to reteine an historicall sense, in ascribing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salomon these things, which agree vnto him: and vnto Christ, that which cannot be giuen vnto any mortall man: as that his kingdome shall be for euer, that God will be his father, that his dominion shall be to the endes of the world, that kings shall worship him, Psal. 72.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But some things here spoken of, can by no meanes be referred vnto Christ: as these words, v. 14. <hi>If he sinne, I will chasten him with the rodde of men:</hi> which some not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding would thus apply vnto Christ: he is said to sinne, because our iniquities were laid vpon him, <hi>tanquam ipse iniquè ègisset,</hi> as though he had done euill himselfe: <hi>Osiand.</hi> or because whatsoeuer is in the members, <hi>videri possunt aliquo modo pertinere ad caput,</hi> may seeme to belong to the head: <hi>Mart.</hi> And Salomon they say was not thus chastised, because he had a flourishing kingdome.</p>

                  <p>1.

Some thinke that this gesture betokened a quiet minde in Dauid, and prepared for attention: for sometime the prostrating or standing of the bodie doth disturbe the minde: <hi>Mart.</hi> 3. <hi>Vatablus</hi> thinketh that this was the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Kings, that they might pray before the Lord sitting. 4. <hi>Pellican</hi> noteth, that the gesture of the bodie in prayer is indifferent: sometime Dauid praysed God daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, sometime lying in his bed, sometime kneeling: there by shewing, that it is the spirit which prayeth, God regardeth not the position and site of the bodie. 5. But the best sense here is, that Dauid did sit, that is, remaine before God, <hi>Geneuens. Iun. Osiand.</hi> for he continued a long time in this his prayer in the Tabernacle before the Arke: for concerning the gesture of his bodie, <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh he fell downe flatte before the Arke.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Some, in that the word <hi>eelohim,</hi> gods, is here put in the plurall, doe vnderstand it in respect of the opinion of men, who thinke there are many gods: according to that saying of S.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Chimhi</hi> thinketh, that Dauid thus speaketh of God in the plurall for more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour sake: but this custome of vsing the plurall for the singular for more honour and dignitie sake, was not taken vp in those dayes: and if that had beene the reason, why doth the Prophet Dauid afterward throughout his prayer, vse the singular number speaking vnto God?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some by <hi>gods,</hi> here vnderstand Moses and Aaron, which went to redeeme the people: <hi>Chaldè paraphrast.</hi> for so Magistrates and gouernours, are sometime in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called by the name of Gods: but it is euident, that the Prophet speaketh here of God himselfe: as in the verse following, <hi>Thou hast redeemed vnto thy selfe thy ptople Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4.

in any place, so neither doth he goe from place to place. But God is said to goe to a place, when it pleaseth him to make some visible demonstration of his presence, as he did by those wonderfull and fearefull works which he shewed in Egypt, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered his people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This also may most fitly bee applyed to the incarnation of the Sonne of God, who then came and visited vs, when he tooke our humane nature vpon him. And so God went and redeemed his people, which was the worke of the whole Trinitie, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet our nature was assumed onely to the person of the Sonne, not to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Father, or the holy Ghost: the internall workes of the Trinitie as they are called,<note place="margin">How the works of the Trinitie are diuided and distinguished, how they are vndiuided</note> are peculiar to the persons, as to the Father to beget, to the Sonne to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, to the holy Ghost to proceede from them both: but in externall works they ioyne together, as the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost created the world, and whatsoeuer is done in the world by God, is wrought by the vndiuided and ioynt power of the Trinitie.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet the Sonne of God is onely said to be incarnate, in respect of the worke it selfe: but if the action of his incarnation be considered, therein the whole Trinitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred: for God gaue his Sonne for the redemption of the world, the holy Ghost o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uershadowed Marie, when Christ was conceiued: and Christ also is said to haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen himselfe, Galat. 2.10. So Ioh. 10.36. the father is said to <hi>sanctifie Christ:</hi> and, Ioh. 17.19. he saith, <hi>I sanctifie my selfe:</hi> likewise, Ioh. 2.13. Christ saith, <hi>Destroy this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in three dayes I will raise it vp againe:</hi> and the father also is said to raise him vp, Rom. 8.11. Then in the action of the incarnation of Christ, the blessed Trinitie did worke, but <hi>opus ipsum,</hi> the worke wrought, the incarnation it selfe was appropriated to the person of the Sonne onely: <hi>Mart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Further, the diuine essence or nature is to be considered two wayes, either ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely in it selfe, as it is common vnto the three persons of the blessed Trinitie; and so the diuine essence was not incarnate: or <hi>vt est determinata in vna aliqua</hi>

The end of Dauids prayer, which he propoundeth, and setteth before his eyes, is the glorie of God; let thy name be magnified: he seeketh nothing else, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of Gods glorie. 2. The reason which mooued Dauid to pray, was his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and sure perswasion of the goodnesse and mercie of God toward him, who had reuealed vnto Dauid this thing, which he prayeth for, the establishing of his house: and he confesseth God both to be able to doe it, and is assured he also will doe it: he is fully perswaded both of his power and truth, saying, v. 28. <hi>thou art God, and thy words are true.</hi> 3. Thirdly, the thing which Dauid prayed for, is, <hi>that the house of thy seruant be established for euer:</hi> v. 26. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <head>22. <hi>Quest.</hi> Why Dauid prayeth so earnestly for that, which the Lord had promised to doe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Some of Gods promises are conditionall, some are absolute: the promise made to Dauid concerning the Messiah, which should come of his seede was absolute, and so likewise was the continuance of his posteritie vntill the Messiah: for Gods decree herein could not be altered: but the promise of the outward prosperitie of his seede, and the possessing and holding of the kingdome was conditionall, so his sonnes wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in obedience before God: therefore Dauid prayeth that such grace might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto his posteritie, as that they might haue a prosperous gouernment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Further, although God doe certainely purpose to giue those things, which he hath promised, <hi>vult tamen interponi media,</hi> yet he will also haue the meanes vsed: as our Blessed Sauiour, praying, <hi>Father glorifie thy Sonne,</hi> did not doubt of his glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but it became him for our example, to shew his obedience, to pray for the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his fathers will, whereof hee was most assured: and so Dauid prayeth here. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <head>23. Quest. v. 29. Why Dauid so often repeateth the same thing in his prayer, <hi>now let it please thee to blesse the house.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. Dauid vseth no vaine repetitions in his prayer: for conceiuing great ioy vpon the Lords liberall and gracious promise toward him, and his house, he was so rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he thought he could not sufficiently expresse his affection: the mind of those which are deuoutly affected, is not contented, <hi>semel desiderata postulâsse,</hi> we once to aske the things desired. <hi>Pellican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it will be obiected, that our Blessed Sauiour teacheth his Apostles not to vse vaine repetitions, nor many words in their prayers: to this it may be answered: that our blessed Sauiour forbiddeth such vaine &amp; tedious repetitions vpon these two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. 1. That they be not like to the Heathen, which thinke to be heard for their much babling sake; men must not thinke to be heard for any merite in their prayers, but of Gods mercie. 2. They must not vse such repetitions, as thinking thereby to informe God of their necessities, and as it were to beat them into his eares: for as our blessed Sauiour there saith, <hi>God knoweth before we aske, what things we haue neede of,</hi> Mat. 6. in this manner to vse many words in prayer, it is not acceptable vnto God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And further, concerning the length of prayer, no other rule can be giuen, then to looke vnto the affection, and intention of the heart:<note place="margin">August. ad Probum.</note> as <hi>Augustine</hi> hereof thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently writeth: <hi>si videmus studiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nostrum &amp; impetu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. incipere flaccessere, &amp;c.</hi> if we see our desire and earnestnes in prayer to beginne to abate, we must not dull the edge thereof, with much speach: <hi>at si attentio nostra erecta sit, non est abrumpenda,</hi> but if our intention doe hold out still, our prayer must not be broken off: so he concludeth, <hi>oratio multa esse debet, loquutio pauca,</hi> our prayer must be much, but our words few, &amp;c. that is, he which prayeth with his heart, though he pray long, is much in prayer, few in words: but he who prayeth with lippe-labour, though his prayer be short, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much, and prayeth little. <hi>Mart.</hi> Dauids prayer then, proceeding from a zealous and deuout heart, though it were much in his desire, was not long in speach.</p>

Martyr</hi> thus applyeth it, because the smaller townes are as daughters, and the great citie as a bridle; the meaning is, that Dauid tooke <hi>Gath,</hi> which was as a bridle to the rest, and the villages hee also tooke as the daughters. 3. But <hi>Iunius</hi> commeth neerer the sense, taking <hi>Ammah</hi> here for the proper name of an hill among rhe Philistims, where <hi>Gath</hi> stood: of which word <hi>Amma,</hi> and <hi>Gor,</hi> or <hi>Gerar</hi> commeth the word <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> the name of an hilly tract among the Philistims, whereof <hi>Plinie</hi> maketh mention, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 13. So then by the bridle of Ammah, is vnderstood <hi>Gath,</hi> the cheife citie in that hilly coast of the Philistims, which was as a bridle, and defence, and fort vnto all the countrey: <hi>Ammah</hi> is found also to be the proper name of an hill, cap. 2.24.</p>
                  <p>6. Here spiritually in Dauids victorie is shadowed forth the spirituall kingdome of Christ, by the power whereof, the bridle of sinne and Sathan is taken away, that they shall haue no more dominion ouer the seruants of God.</p>

                  <p>1. This <hi>Hadadezer</hi> called in the Chronicles <hi>Hadarezer,</hi> is said to bee king of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah, where <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith the people called <hi>Sapheni</hi> inhabite, a large countrey beyond Taurus betweene the two Armenias. 2. This Hadadezer, the most thinke, went to recouer his border at the riuer Euphrates, and to inuade Iudea: so <hi>Mart. Vatab. B.G.</hi> with the rest. <hi>Iunius</hi> thus interpreteth, <hi>when he went to turne backe his hand towards the riuer Euphrates:</hi> that is, not when <hi>Hadadezer,</hi> but when Dauid went to repell the forces of <hi>Hadadezer,</hi> who was to passe through some parts of Dauids countrey, as he went to fight against <hi>Tai</hi> the King of Hamath, as is shewed afterward, ver. 10. <hi>Iun.</hi> But the former interpretation seemeth to be the more agreeable, by comparing this place with that 1. Chron. 18.3. where it is thus said: <hi>as he went to establish his hand, or power:</hi> which cannot be vnderstood of Dauid, for the border or bounds of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome yet extended not so farre: <hi>Iunius</hi> there readeth, <hi>when Dauid went, ad inijcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam manum suam, &amp;c.</hi> to set or oppose his hand toward Euphrates: but the word <hi>iat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zab,</hi> signifieth to settle, to establish, not to oppose or set against: and there he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>iado,</hi> his hand, to Dauid, whereas here he vnderstandeth it of <hi>Hadadezer</hi>; but it must haue the same sense in both places: likewise there is great affinitie betweene the word <hi>Iashab,</hi> here vsed, which signifieth to constitute, or place, and <hi>iatzab,</hi> to settle, establish. 3. It seemeth therefore that Hadadezer rather sought to inuade Dauids bounds, then onely to passe through them; for that had beene no iust occasion of warre: and by this occasion, that prophesie, Genes. 15.18. was fulfilled, that the Lord would giue vnto Abrahams seede that land, euen vnto the great riuer Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates.</p>

                  <p>1. It is said that Dauid houghed all the chariots, that is the chariot horses, sauing an hundred: this Dauid did, to make them vnfit altogether for the seruice of warre: as Ioshuah did the like by the Lords direction, c. 11.6. It was not lawfull for Dauid to take them all to his owne vse, because the king is directly forbidden to multiplie horses, Deut. 17.16. least they might put their confidence in horses: neither was Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid to destroy them all, because they were not <hi>Cherem,</hi> that is, <hi>anathema,</hi> vowed to destruction. Dauid therefore taketh a course betweene both, neither to destroy the horse, nor yet to reserue them for his owne vse, but to hough them, and so make them vnfit for warre, though they might serue for other workes of tillage and husbandrie. 2. Yet Dauid reserueth an 100. chariots, that is, fowre hundred horse: for foure horse went to a chariot, as the Hebrewes gather out of that place, 1. King. 10.29. where it is said, that Salomon gaue 600. shekels for a chariot, that is, an 150. shekels for an horse. These Dauid might reserue for his owne vse; for in respect of the whole ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the kingdome, 400. horse were not many: <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>Thai king of Hamath, who had continuall warre with Hadadezer, whome Dauid

It is here then to bee considered, how farre it is lawfull to reioyce in the fall of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, in the spirituall fall of an enemie, as into sinne and wickednesse, it is not lawfull to reioyce, but therein we ought much to be grieued, as S. Paul bewayled them, which sinned among the Corinthians, 2. Cor. 12.21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In other temporall calamities, some thinke it is not lawfull to reioyce ouer the ruine of our enemies, as long as the will of God is not reuealed in the iust punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such: but when God hath euidently declared his will in the iudging of such, then they hold it lawfull to reioyce: as Moses did triumph in the ouerthrowe of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, and of the Egyptians in the red Sea.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But this matter must otherwise be considered of: for when God doth iudge an enemie, we must consider, whether we ioy therein in respect of our own priuate quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, or as it concerneth the glorie of God: for it is vnlawfull for vs in any priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to insult ouer our enemies fall: as the wiseman saith in the Prouerbs, <hi>Be not glad when thyne enemie falleth, &amp;c. least the Lord see it, and it displease him:</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Yea it often falleth out that these two affections of griefe and ioy together may concurre in Gods seruants: that their naturall compassion may be mooued to shewe their sorrow in the calamitie and ruine of their foes; as Dauid mourned for Saul: and yet in respect of Gods glorie, and the truth, which was hindred by such, they may be gladde that they are taken out of the way: as Dauid, no doubt in the ouerthrowe of Saul, did thankefully and humbly acknowledge Gods mercifull and fatherly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ouer toward him.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18791:30"/>
we must not so easily admit an error in the originall, where an other answer may bee found.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some thinke that the Aramites and Idumeans did ioyne their forces together, and therefore they are called in one place Aramites, in the other Edomites: <hi>Genev.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Pet.

                  <p n="4">4. Thus therefore these places are reconciled: 1. For the persons, Dauid is said to haue smitten them, because he did it by his captaines Ioab and Abishai. 2. For the number: Abishai first slewe 6. thousand, and then Ioab renewing the battell twelue thousand more, as it is in the title of that Psalme: so that both the brethren together put to the sword 18. thousand. 3.

                  <head>4. Quest. v. 7. Of the kindnes which Dauid shewed to Miphibosheth.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. It will be said that Dauid in restoring vnto Miphibosheth the lands of Saul, did performe no great matter, seeing they were of right due vnto him, as the next heire: to this <hi>R. Salomon</hi> answereth, that it was in the power of the King, to take from whom he would, and giue vnto another, at his will and pleasure, as Samuel describeth the office of a King, 1. Sam. 8.12. <hi>Hee will take your feilds and your vineyards, and your best oliue trees, and giue them to his seruants:</hi> And therefore Dauid did shew great kindnes, in giuing these lands to Miphibosheth, which he might haue bestowed vpon another. But <hi>D. Chimhi</hi> herein opposeth himselfe to <hi>R. Salomon,</hi> shewing that it is not in the power of the king, to dispose of mens grounds and possessions at his pleasure: as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, though a wicked king, yet would not by violence take away Naboths vineyard: the fruits of their lands were to serue the kings vse, they were thereof to giue toward the prouision of his house, but their possessions simply he was not to dispose of. But it was otherwise in this case: for Ishbosheth hauing rebelled against Dauid the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full king, might iustly haue beene depriued, and likewise Miphibosheth for taking part with him, as is most like, <hi>Iun.</hi> of all the right which they had in the goods and possessions of Saul: and therefore Dauid sheweth herein great mercie, in restoaring of them vnto Miphibosheth. <hi>Mart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will further be obiected, that Dauid was bound to doe this by vertue of the former league made betweene Ionathan and Dauid: and therefore he was in a manner forced to shew this kindnesse. It is true, Dauid was tied vnto it by the force of the league: yet Dauids faithfulnesse is therein no whit lesse to be commended, that was so mindfull of the couenant: these circumstances specially considered: as 1. that Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan was now dead, and could not challenge Dauid. 2. The house of Saul had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted him, and put him to much trouble, which might haue seemed a iust cause for Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid to haue violated that league. 3. And some might haue pretended policie, that it was not safe to aduance the house and familie of a contrarie faction: Dauid notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all these obiections, which might haue bin pretended, extendeth his kindnes and therein sheweth his goodnes and faithfulnesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But Dauid promised Ionathan, that he should be the next and second vnto him in the kingdome: 1. Sam. 23.17. he therein kept not his promise with Ionathan: yes, Dauid made good herein that promise to the full: for Miphibosheth is nourished at the kings table, as one of the kings sonnes: who were cheifest in reputation, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewed, c. 8.18. and Miphibosheth was counted among them: But in that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth was not imployed in any place of gouernment, it was not Dauids fault, but because hee in respect of his lamenesse was not fit for any such employment. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Miphibosheth so calleth himselfe, as vile and contemptible in diuerse respects. 1.

                  <p>It may seeme that Miphibosheth did more abase himselfe then he needed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed himselfe to be that, which he was not, which giueth occasion of this question:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18791:32"/>
which may thus be resolued.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not lawfull for any to lie of himselfe, to expresse his humilitie: for S. Pauls rule is generall,<note place="margin">Rom. 3 8.</note> 
                     <hi>that we must not doe euill for good to come thereof:</hi> neither is it lawfull to make a lie,<note place="margin">Ibid. v. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>that the veritie may now abound thorough my lie vnto his glorie:</hi> nay it is not lawfull for to make a lie for Gods cause: for then as the Apostle saith, <hi>wee should be found to be false witnesses of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.8.

                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.13.</note>2. But Saint Pauls example will be obiected, that saith he was, <hi>peccatorum primus,</hi> the first, or chiefe of sinners: and yet there were greater sinners then hee. And the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> saith of himselfe,<note place="margin">Prov. 30.1.</note> 
                     <hi>that hee was more foolish then any man:</hi> yet was not he the foolishest among men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some here answer, that they thus spake in respect of their own weakenesse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing they had no strength at all of themselues but from God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may further be added, that they thus confessed in their owne opinion, who thought themselues to be inferiour vnto all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But here is a difference to be made betweene a generall confession of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and impotencie of our nature, which the most perfect in this world may truely ackowledge, and a particular ackowledgement of some actuall sinne, which no man is to confesse of himselfe, beeing not guiltie thereof: as S.

                  <p n="4">4. Saint Paul also speaketh by way of comparison with those which were called, that none of them had so persecuted the way of Christ, as he had done, &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none of them had so greatly sinned in that behalfe; so also the Prophet <hi>Agur</hi> doth acknowledge his ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce not simply, but in respect of the high things of God, which he was not able to comprehend. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p>The occasion of this question is this: v. 10. <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Thou, and thy sonnes, and thy seruants, shall till the land, and bring in, that thy masters sonne may haue foode to eate; but Miphibosheth thy masters sonne, shall eate bread alwaies at my table:</hi> how did Ziba prouide food for Miphibosheth, seeing he fed at the kings table in Ierushalem? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, v. 11. <hi>Ziba</hi> saith, <hi>All that the King hath commanded, &amp;c. so shall thy seruant doe, that Miphibosheth may eate at my table, as one of the Kings sonnes</hi>: if he did eate at Zibahs table; how was he fed at the kings table?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some answer to the first doubt: that v. 10. in the first clause, by his <hi>masters sonne,</hi> is meant <hi>Micah</hi> Miphibosheths sonne, who is mentioned v. 12. so <hi>Iunius:</hi> but seeing <hi>Miphibosheth</hi> is afterward said, to be his masters sonne, that is, Sauls nephew, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be taken in the same sense before: And then in the first place he meaneth not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheths person, but his familie, whereof his young sonne was a principall part: that though Miphibosheth himselfe liued at Dauids table, yet his familie with his son should be maintained with <hi>Ziba. Osiand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the other place, v. 11. some read, <hi>at thy table:</hi> so <hi>Lat. Osiand.</hi> but the word is <hi>shulcani,</hi> at my table, 2. Some so take it, as though Miphibosheth was fed at <hi>Zibahs</hi> table: <hi>Pellican:</hi> but that is contrarie to the text, v. 13. Miphibosheth did eate bread continually at the kings table. 3. Some giue this sense: Miphibosheth is said to eate at the kings table, because he had meate sent him from the kings table: <hi>Sa.</hi> but he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sat himselfe at the kings table, because hee dwelt at Ierushalem, where the kings house was: and as Dauid in Sauls time, did eate at his table: so Dauid would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the like kindnesse to Miphibosheth to eate at his table. 4. Some giue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: that <hi>Miphibosheth</hi> may eate at my <hi>table:</hi> that is, may haue all things at commandement, as one of the kings sonnes, as if he sat at my table: <hi>Genevens.</hi> but the phrase is taken here in the same sense, as it is before, v. 10. where Dauid saith that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18791:32"/>
Miphibosheth should indeed eate at his table, not to haue all things at commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the kings house.</p>
                  <p>5. There remaine three other interpretations: <hi>Iunius</hi> maketh them the words of Zibah spoken in this sense, <hi>Though Miphibosheth eating at my table, should be as one of the Kings sonnes:</hi> so also <hi>Peter Martyr:</hi> that is, if it had pleased the King, that Miphibosheth had beene at my finding. I would haue giuen him entertainment as one of the Kings sonnes: but it is not like, that Zibah would haue called it his table, seeing he was but a seruant to Miphibosheth: neither would hee seeme to contradict the king, who had said before, that Miphibosheth should eate at his table: and to what end should Ziba make mention of the Kings sonnes, which had no allowance at his table?</p>
                  <p>6. Some take these words vttered by Zibah, but in the kings person; <hi>Miphibosheth shall eate at my table, &amp;c.</hi> as the king saith. <hi>B.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. But <hi>Vatablus</hi> better taketh these words as spoken by Dauid, that he said, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his former words, <hi>Miphibosheth shall eate at my table:</hi> And this may seeme the more probable, because the former clause vttered by Zibah, endeth with the perfect distinction <hi>athnah.</hi>

                  <head>1. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 2. How Dauid shewed kindnesse to the King of Ammon, and why.</head>
                  <p>1. DAuid hauing now shewed his gratefull mind toward some at home, beginneth also to practise the like abroad, and sendeth a freindly and comfortable mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the king of Ammon, after the death of his Father: <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. Though it were not lawfull to enter into any publike league with the Ammonites, which is directly forbidden, Deut. 23.6. yet priuate amitie might be reteined: and Dauid might shew his thankfulnes vnto them. <hi>Osiand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. What pleasure <hi>Nahash</hi> the former King of Ammon shewed to Dauid, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: the Hebrewes thinke that this was the kindnesse, that after the King of Moab had put to death Dauids parents, the rest fled vnto the King of Ammon, and were there succoured: but of this there is no certaintie: it is like that Nahash beeing a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed aduersarie to Saul, whom he had before discomfited, when he besieged Iabesh Gilead, gaue freindly entertainment in the daies of Saul vnto Dauid,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 9.</note> whom Saul ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pursued. <hi>Iun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Now whereas Dauid is said before to haue subdued the Ammonites, c. 8.12. it seemeth, it is set down there by <hi>anticipation</hi> and preuention in the historie: for if Dauid had before this vanquished the Ammonites, Dauid would haue sent no such freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and familiar message to his professed enemie. <hi>Mart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Pellican</hi> obserueth, that the euill successe which Dauid had in this embassage sheweth, that God was not pleased with Dauid, because he sought the freindship of an heathen king. But things are not to be measured by the euent. It was not amisse for Dauid to shew his kindnes and thankfulnesse for a benefit receiued: if the wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him euill for good, it bewraieth the vilenes of their nature, rather then the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnes of Dauids act. <hi>Martyr.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. These peruerse men, which perswaded Hanun the King, that Dauid did not send this message of good will, but in craft and cunning, measured others by their owne foote: because they themselues were fraudulent and deceitfull, they so iudge of others. <hi>Pellican.</hi> And beside, they discouer their hatefull mind toward the people of God: that as their forefathers afforded the Israelites their brethren, no releefe in the desert, Deu.

24.5. beeing descended of Lot, as the other of Abraham, who called Lot his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And as <hi>Nahash</hi> their king required of the men of Iabesh Gilead their right eies: so they still bewraie an hatred as it were hereditarie in them against the people of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They challenge them vntruely to be spies, as Ioseph did sometime his brethren: but that was onely in pretense: not that it is a thing in it selfe vnlawfull to be a spie: for when there is iust battell waged, it is lawfull to bee a spie: as Moses sent Caleb and Ioshua with others to espie and search out the land of Canaan: but vnder colour of amitie and freindship to spie out the state and condition of others, is a thing odious. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <head>3. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 4. Of the despight offered by the Ammonites to Dauids messengers, in cutting their beards and garments.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. In that they offer such contumelie and disgrace vnto Dauids Embassadors, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they offended against the law of nations, and therefore they receiued afterward condigne punishment: The Romans destroyed <hi>Corinthus</hi> a famous Citie of <hi>Grecia,</hi> because they vsed their Embassadors contumeliously in words.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are two speciall ornaments of the bodie, one is naturall, namely the beard, the other artificiall, the garments, which couer the nakednes: in both these the King of Ammon seeketh the disgrace of Dauids seruants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The reason whereof may be this: the Israelites were forbidden to cut their beards, Leuit. 19.27. as a signe of mourning: and especiall prouision was made by the law, that their nakednesse should not appeare: and therefore they were forbidden to make any Altar with staires, Exod. 20.26. the more then to despight them, they offer them this ignominious disgrace in despight of their owne law. <hi>Mar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now in that they are bidden afterward by Dauid to stay till their beards were growen: it is euident, that the vse then in Israel was not to shaue their beards: for then they might haue cut away the other part also: howsoeuer then this tricke of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of beards be superstitiously vsed among the Romanists, it is certaine, that the Israelites custome was not to shaue their beards:<note place="margin">Controv. Against shauing</note> for they might more easily haue cut off the rest of their beards, which was remaining, then haue staied till they were growen: <hi>Pellican, Osiander.</hi> The heathen indeede had a fashion to cut their beards: as <hi>Adriane</hi> the Emperour is noted to haue beene the first among the Romane Emperours that did spare his beard, and suffered it to grow long. But this superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vse was not taken vp by the people of God. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <head>4. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 6. From whence the Ammonites hired their souldiers and assistants.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Here are fowre countries named, whence the Ammonites had their supplie, from the Aramites of Rechab, which was a citie at the foote of Libanus the vtmost bound of Syria toward Palestina, whereof mention is made Numb. 13.22. from the Aramites of Zaba: from the King of Maacah, who was also subiect to Hadadezer king of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah: of the Maacahthites read 3.14. And from the men of <hi>Tab,</hi> as <hi>Iun.</hi> rather then <hi>Ishtob,</hi> making it all one name, as the rest doe reade: <hi>Tab</hi> was the countrie where Iepthah dwelt, Iudg. 11.3. Beside they had some helpe from Aram Naharaim, 1. Chr. 19.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All these belonged to Aram, or Syria, which was diuided into Syria beyond the riuer, v. 16. and Syria on this side: <hi>Borrh.</hi> which is subdiuided into these foure regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Camagena, Damascena, Coelosyria, Phoenicia: Mar.</hi> which are here called by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names.</p>

                  <p>Here is nothing wanting in Ioab which is requisite in a good Captaine. 1.

                  <p>2. As he is not daunted or dismaied himselfe, so by his couragious speach hee ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth others; saying, <hi>let vs be strong and valiant for our people, &amp;c.</hi> like as Moses set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe in the waging of battell, how the priest should encourage the people: <hi>Let not your hearts faint, neither feare, or be amased, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>6. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this were true fortitude in Ioab.</head>
                  <p>True fortitude consisteth in the vndertaking, and bearing of great and suddaine dainger in a good cause, and for some honest and commendable end: wherein diuerse things are to be considered. 1. The obiect or matter, wherein true fortitude is seene: which is not in those euills which are internall, as in auoiding of vices and sinnes: for these a man falleth into by his owne default: nor yet is it properly seene in such daungers, which are involuntarie, as in sicknesse, shipwracke, and such like: though to beare these things patiently is an excellent vertue: but fortitude is exercised chiefly in such dangers, as are outwardly incident, and in those most of all which are suddain: as this daunger of battell, wherein Ioabs fortitude did shew it selfe, was vnexpected and vnlooked for.</p>
                  <p>2. The end of fortitude must not be praise, vaine glorie, profit, such as the valiant Heathen propounded to themselues, who shewed their valour to get themselues a name: and many aduentured themselues because of those rewards which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised vnto them, that did fight for their countrie: but the end of this vertue, is some honest cause, as to defend our parents or countrie, to deliuer the oppressed, especially to maintaine true religion and worship of God. <hi>Mart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. There are diuerse kinds of fortitude. 1. There is a warlike valour, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by skill and experience in militarie affaires. 2. There is an other kind which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of confidence, which a man hath in his strength. 3. An other proceedeth from ignorance of the greatnesse of the danger. 4. Another, which riseth from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or rage, when one is inflamed to reuenge himselfe: but all these are farre off from true fortitude: which is a vertue not giuen by nature, but wrought in men by the spirit of God, whereby they are resolued in an honest cause to attempt difficult labour, and endure the vtmost dangers: so that there are two offices of a Christian fortitude, <hi>ferre, &amp; aggredi,</hi> to beare and suffer, and to attempt or enterprise: but the first rather, wherein the fortitude and patience of the Martyrs was tried in enduring vnspeakable and intollerable torments for the name of God.</p>
                  <p>6. Although Ioab were a treacherous and bloodie man, yet he might haue this morall vertue at this time, as many common graces of the spirit are oft to be found in the wicked. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>Here mention is made of seauen hundreth chariots, and 40. thousand horsemen: but in 1. Chron. 19.18. there are said to haue beene destroied 7. thousand chariots, and 40. thousand footemen.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some doe thus reconcile the places, that the principall of the chariots are here rehearsed, but the whole number there; and that the horsemen are here onely spoken of, there the footemen. <hi>Mart. Bor. Genev.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Iunius</hi> giueth a better solution of the first doubt: that the number of 700. is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for so many troupes or bands, which made in all 7000. chariots, counting ten to a troupe or companie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But for the latter doubt, <hi>Iunius</hi> solution seemeth not to be so good, who thus readeth, 7. <hi>hundreth chariots (and</hi> 40. <hi>thousand footemen) of horsemen:</hi> referring <hi>horsemen,</hi> not to the 40. thousand immediatly going before, but to the 7. hundreth chariots first mentioned: but this reading seemeth not to be so fit, both because the words are not so distinguished in the Hebrew: and there was great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the chariots and horsemen: as c. 18.4. <hi>Dauid tooke from Hadarezer, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand chariots, and</hi> 7. <hi>thousand horsemen, and</hi> 20. <hi>thousand footemen:</hi> the horsemen, then can not be referred to the chariots. And it is euident that the Ammonites hired both chariots, and horsemen, 1. Chron. 19.6. there were then both chariots, horsemen, and footmen in the host of the Aramites: here the chariots and horsemen are numbred, which were destroied; and in the other place the chariots and footemen.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But whereas the Latine translation speaketh of 58. thousand men, which fled before Israel, v. 19. there is no such thing in the originall: so that therein there is a manifest corruption in the Latine.</p>

But seeing the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the adulterie of Dauid, what impudencie is it for any thereby to seeke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense of their sinne? yea the heathen by the light of nature held adulterie to be a most grieuous sinne, as Pharaoh king of Egypt, Gen. 12. &amp; Abimelech king of Gerar, Gen. 20.

                  <head>3. Quest. v. 2. Of Dauids idlenesse and securitie, vpon these <hi>words,</hi> Dauid arose from his bed.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The beginning of Dauids fall proceeded from his idlenes and securitie; he rose from his bed, wheron he vsed to rest in the afternoone: which as the Physitians hold to be vnwholesome to the bodie, <hi>Osiand.</hi> so was it a signe of Dauids great security, who gaue himselfe to ease and rest, his captaine and souldiers beeing occupied in dangerous battells abroad: Dauid vsed not to goe forth with them as he had in fore time. <hi>Pellican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are diuerse kinds of ease: some doe sequester themselues from busines to giue themselues to contemplation, as our blessed Sauiour preached in the day, &amp; prayed in the night, Luk. 21. Some keepe an holy rest from sinne: But there is beside a lasciuious and wanton rest, or idlenesse, which is the mother of lust: as one of the sinnes of Sodome was aboundance of idlenesse,<note place="margin">Ezeck 18.</note> As <hi>Ambrose</hi> fitly resembleth idle persons to the oyster, who while he openeth his shell in the Sunne, is assaulted by the crabbe or creavish, which commeth and thrusteth his clawes between the shells, and so deuoureth the oyster: so idle persons are tempted and seduced, &amp; made a pray of Sathan.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But as idlenesse is hurtfull to al, so it beseemeth not the person of Princes, who though they neuer plow or digge, yet are to watch ouer the people to see them wel gouerned, and to prouide for them good lawes. And as in Dauid, this pleasant ease brought forth adulterie: so the idle life of Monkes, feeding and pampering their bellies, was the cause of that filthie vncleannes and vile corruption, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected to be among them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then seeing Sathan is so vigilant to catch euery oppertunitie to supplant vs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about like a roaring lion, as S.

                  <head>4. Quest. v. 2. Of the wandring of Dauids eyes, vpon these words, Hee saw a woman washing her selfe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Dauids curious eyes wandring, falling vpon such a pleasant obiect, did intangle his affection, and enflame his desire: Dauid at this time had forgotten that prayer, Psal. 119.37. <hi>Turne away mine eyes from regarding vanitie; Borrh.</hi> first, seeing her he committeth adulterie with her in his heart, then he resteth not till hee had acted his vncleane desire. <hi>Osiand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This sinne of Dauid appeareth the greater, if it be compared with Iosephs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie: Ioseph was young, and a single man, and was entised of his mistresse, yet consenteth not: Dauid was of good yeares, hauing many wiues, which might haue contented him; and beside he was a soliciter of a woman one of his subiects, whose chastitie he ought to haue defended. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. We see then hereby, how dangerous a thing it is to suffer the eyes to wander: Iob therefore made a couenant with his eyes, not to looke vpon a maide: <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath a good saying, <hi>qui externo oculo abutuntur, digni sunt quibus internus oculus offus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetur,</hi> they which abuse the outward eye, are worthie to haue the inward eye darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

                  <p n="1">1. Though Dauid were entised by this pleasing obiect, yet therefore is not beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and fairenesse of it selfe an euill thing, which is a gift and worke of the creator: for beauty is defined to be <hi>apta coniunctio membrorum cum suauitate coloris:</hi> an apt ioyning together of the members with a pleasant colour. So in Scripture vertuous men, as Ioseph, Dauid; and women, as Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, are set forth and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by their beautie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But this gift of nature or rather of the God of nature, is made an occasion of stumbling through the corruption of our nature; as the light of the Sunne, though in it selfe it be comfortable, yet is offensiue vnto bleare eyes: so is mans corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affected with such obiects; therefore as Phisicians when they cut or launch any patient, will haue their schollers present to make obseruation thereof for their own practise: so we beholding the cure which God made vpon Dauid, in launching this his spirituall sore, should teach vs to beware; and to set a doore before our eies: it was the fall of the old world, when the sonnes of God, euen they which came of the righteous race, gazed vpon the daughters of men, and saw they were faire, and so were seduced: <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. As the beautie of the bodie entangleth a carnall eye; so the Angels that fell were proud of their spirituall beautie, wherein they were created, and so were tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough pride cast downe from heauen: <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Some think that it was great boldnesse in her to wash her selfe abroad in open view: whereas it had beene more beseeming her womanly modestie, to haue kept her within her doores: <hi>Mart.</hi> But it is more like that Dauid espied her washing in her house, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, through the windowes; so thinketh <hi>Vata.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Pellican</hi> noteth this for a fault also, that while her husband was watching abrod in the campe, she at home <hi>abutitur quiete sua,</hi> abuseth her rest, and giueth her selfe to washing and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. But herein was Bathsheba her great fault, that being sent for to come vnto the King, so easily consenteth: which shewed either some euil affection toward her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, from whom she desired to be diuorced; or an ambitious desire to be the kings wife. Much vnlike was she here vnto Susanna, who did rather choose to die, then to commit adulterie. Beside, in that she sendeth as in feare to Dauid, that she was with child, being the apter to conceiue after her monthly purifying, she sheweth an vnwillingnes and griefe that it was so, and bewrayeth a desire to haue had it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.

                  <p n="1">1. Dauid beside the adulterie which he had committed, falleth into diuerse other faults: first into hardnesse of heart, that neither he, nor yet Bathsheba doe bethinke themselues what they had done, neither repent them of their sinne, but onely think to hide and colour it; then he sheweth the right guise and fashion of hypocrites, who while they may hide their sinnes from men, doe not reuerence the sight of God; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>intrudit silium suum in agros Vriae,</hi> he would thrust his own sonne to be an others heire, and so abuse Vriah that way also. <hi>Mart.</hi>

And to that ende Dauid seeing Vriah to refraine the first night, watching among the rest at the Kings doore, made him the next day to eate and drinke, and to be drunken that his lust to his wife might be enflamed: But all this tooke no place; God so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, that Dauids sinne should come to light: for there is no counsell against God, but his purpose shall stand: <hi>Mart.

                  <p n="1">1. Vriah giueth this reason, why he refused at this time to lodge in his own house, because the Arke, and the host of Israel, and his Lord Ioab remained in tents: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he sheweth by his example, that in time of common warre men should giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to prayer and fasting, not to ease and feasting: <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Dauid is yet so farre from seeing his sinne, that he addeth one wickednesse to an other: his idlenes followeth a wanton eie, his wantonnes is accompanied with lust, which bringeth forth adulterie; then there is a deuise to make Vriah the father of an adulterous seede: to this Dauid addeth an attempt to make Vriah drunke: this not taking place, he contriueth his death, and that in betraying him into the hands of his enemies, and that with the losse of many beside.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wherein Dauid for this one act exceedeth the violent course which Achab v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against Naboth: hee coueted but his vineyard, Dauid desireth an others wife: Achab wrought this onely by his wicked wife Iezabel, but Dauid doth this himselfe. <hi>Martyr.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And Vriah his innocencie maketh Dauids sinne more grieuous; hee which all his life before hated fraud and deceit, now hateth simplicitie and truth: hee which spared his cruell enemie Saul before, now pursueth vnto death a most faithfull friend and dutifull subiect.</p>
                  <p>And further, he maketh Ioab accessarie to his sinne: who though his sinne was the lesse, because the Kings authoritie forced him, yet is it not thereby excused: It might be Dauid pretended some capitall offence to haue beene committed by Vriah: yet Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab was not ignorant of the Lawe, that none were to bee put to death, but vnder two or three witnesses: hee therefore should herein haue obeyed God, rather then man. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. In that God suffred a iust and innocent man in this manner to be cut off, it need no more to call Gods iustice in question, then that he suffered Iohn Baptist to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> to be slaine: Euerie one is borne to die, for death is the stipend or wages of sinne: God therefore whose counsells are most secret, yet most iust, doth for some causes best knowne to himselfe, giue way sometime to vnlawfull attempts.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Nothing is defined directly concerning this matter in the Scripture; for Leu. 18. where many impediments of marriage are rehearsed, and diuerse prohibitions of marriage; yet no mention is made of this barre of adulterie going before: but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof may be this, because the adulterer and adultresse by Moses Law were to be stoned vnto death: and so there could be no question of this matter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it hath beene decreed by many Pontificiall decrees, that the marriage of such who committed adulterie before, should be actually void, as is extant in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant</hi> in diuerse places:<note place="margin">Extrav. titul. de eo qui dux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eratt vxorem quam polluerat, &amp;c. &amp; in tit. de convers. infidel. can. laudab.</note> But this example of Dauid convinceth that opinion, whose marriage with <hi>Bethsheba,</hi> the Lord ratified and confirmed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wherefore the best resolution is this, that such mariages are indeed altogether vnfit and inconuenient: for if this were vsually permitted for the adulterer and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse to marie together, it would giue occasion for one of them to practise against the life of an other: yet though such mariages are not conuenient, and may with good cause be letted and preuented, and such by the Magistrate may be punished: yet such marriages beeing consummate, are not for any such pretense to be dissolued, for then Dauids mariage had beene vnlawfull: <hi>Osiand.</hi> it is adulterie following after, not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, that breaketh mariage knot; see more of this question, <hi>Synop.

                  <p>DAuid had a sonne called Nathan, c. 5.14. but he could not bee Nathan the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Mar.</hi> as may appeare by these reasons: 1. Nathan was borne vnto Dauid in Ierusalem: and therefore in respect of his yeares could not then be a Prophet, when Dauid consulted with Nathan about the building of God an house, which was in the beginning of his raigne in Ierusalem, c. 7. 2. Nathan the Prophet is here sent to tell Dauid of his sinne, and to declare the iudgements of God against him, <hi>That the Lord would raise vp euill against him euen out of his owne house:</hi> Dauids owne sonne had not beene a fit messenger of such hard tydings, neither would his speech haue beene so much regarded at Dauids hand. 3.

                  <head>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> How long after Dauids adulterie Nathan was sent vnto him.</head>
                  <p>1. It is euident that Dauid slept in this sinne toward 10. moneths: <hi>Mar.</hi> for the child conceiued in adulterie was born presently after this admonition of the Prophet: after so long a time Nathan was sent vnto him, not as some thinke, as watching his best opportunitie; because when the heate of mens affections is allayed, it is the fittest dealing with them, for the more one is grounded by continuance in his sinne, the more hardly is he brought to repentance. 2. Neither is it like, that Dauid in the mean time was otherwise admonished and put in minde of his sinne, as by reading the scriptures, and by remembring himselfe of Vriah his words vnto him: <hi>Mart.</hi> for it appeareth by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18791:37"/>
Dauids answer to Nathan, wherein he giueth sentence against himselfe, that Dauid was not yet awaked from his sinne. 3. But it pleased God thus long to deferre the Prophets comming vnto him, that herein might appeare the weakenesse and impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of our nature, which is neuer able of it selfe to rise vnto repentance: <hi>Osiand.</hi> 4. And God herein also manifesteth his loue toward his elect, in that he will not suffer them to lie downe in their sinne, but euer calleth them home in time: <hi>Pellic.</hi>

               <div n="3" type="question">
                  <head>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> Why Nathan speaketh to Dauid in a parable</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh this to be the reason thereof, because Nathan beeing a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, considered that Princes were headstrong, <hi>dum affectibus suis rapiuntur,</hi> while they are carried with their affections, and therefore he concealeth at first the threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of iudgement: but Nathan had experience of Dauids mild nature, specially in matters to God-ward, and therefore this was not the cause.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Nathan speaketh in parable, 1. both to keepe a meane and measure in his reprehension, that it should not be too sharpe: <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. <hi>Non invadit durius, quia prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouerat conuertendum:</hi> hee doth not set vpon him roughly, because he knewe that he should be conuerted: <hi>Pellic.</hi> 3. And by this kind of couert speech, Dauid is brought to giue sentence against himselfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some thinke that Nathan spake this vnto Dauid in the hearing and presence of his captaines and Princes: but it is more like that Nathan did admonish him priuately the more easily to winne him: <hi>Mar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And Nathan reuealing vnto Dauid his sinne in particular, as though he had bin therein of his counsell, receiued this direction (no doubt) from the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though Dauid himselfe were a Prophet, yet a Prophet is sent vnto him, <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam medicus ad medicum, sed sanus ad aegrotum:</hi> as one Physitian to an other, but the sound to the sicke, as Chrysostome saith.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Rupertus</hi> by this stranger, vnderstandeth the deuill, who came vnto this rich man Dauid, who would not be entertained, with any of Dauids owne wiues, whom Dauid might lawfully vse, but stirreth him vp to desire strange flesh.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. But it is not necessarie to presse euery part of a parable, it is sufficient if it hold in that, wherein the application consisteth: as the purpose of the prophet here is to lay open the wrong which Dauid had done, in taking his neighbours only wife, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hauing many.</p>

               <div n="5" type="question">
                  <head>5. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 5. Whether the sentence of death pronounced by Dauid, were according to the Lawe.</head>
                  <p>The Lawe of Moses against theft was, that the theife should restore fiue oxen for one, and fowre sheepe for one, Exod. 22.1. but here Dauid giueth sentence of death against the oppressor.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some thinke that Dauid thus speaketh onely to exaggerate the offence, not as meaning he should die: like as a Iudge may say to shewe the greatnesse of the male-factors offence, that he is worthy of a thousand deaths: but it appeareth by Nathans answer afterward vnto Dauid vpon his repentance, v. 13. <hi>thou shalt not die,</hi> that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids meaning was, that such an offender indeede was worthie to die: and so <hi>Iosephus</hi> also vnderstandeth it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some answer that it was in the Iudges power to adde to the punishment, or take from it <hi>pro ratione circumstantiarum,</hi> according to the circumstances: <hi>Martyr:</hi> which may indeede bee safely affirmed in punishments of the same nature and kind: as in pecuniarie mulcts, and corporall castigations: but to change the kind of the punishment, as to inflict death vpon the malefactour, where the lawe imposed not the penaltie of death, might seeme an open and apparant transgression of the lawe.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:18791:37"/>3. Therefore the best answer is, that euen by Moses law, some kind of theft might be censured with death; as he that did breake thorough an house, he might be slaine, Exod. 22.3. this theft then beeing ioyned with rapine and violence; and beeing a theft of wantonnesse, not of necessitie, as when one stealeth to satisfie his hunger, might iustly receiue the sentence of death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And beside Dauid adiudgeth, that he should restore foure fold, according to the Law, Exod. 22.1. but some vnderstandeth dubble fourefold, that is eightfold, because the word <hi>arbaghtaim, fowrefold,</hi> is put in the duall number: so <hi>Vatab.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t that is no good reason: the like word <hi>shobhghathaim,</hi> seauenfold, is likewise put in the duall number, Isay. 30.26. and yet signifieth there onely seauenfold, not twice seauenfold: <hi>Iun.</hi> Indeed, it is probable, that the Iudge might award restitution in a greater proportion then fourefold, according to the qualitie of the sinne: as Prov. 6.30. <hi>The theefe, if he be found, shall restore seauenfold:</hi> though some by seauenfold in that place, vnderstand <hi>often: Iun.</hi> that the theefe as often as he is found, should make restitution. But in this place there is no necessitie so to vnderstand the word, specially seeing the punishment was aggrauated by the sentence of death.</p>

                  <p>1. By his Lords wiues, to vnderstand women, which were Gods creatures, and so by the Lord, God himselfe, is a coact and forced exposition. 2.

                  <p>Whereas Saint Iames saith, <hi>God giueth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man,</hi> c. 1.5. and yet the Lord seemeth here to vpbraid Dauid with the benefits receiued: 1. Some answer, that the Apostle speaketh onely of prayer, that though one should aske a thousand times of God, he doth not put them by, as men vse to say to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate suitors, that they had that or this graunted them before: but this doth not fully satisfie, for the Lord neither in prayer, or otherwise, is an vpbraider of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the Apostles meaning is, that God vseth not to cast any in the teeth, as men vse to doe, to shame them, and reproach them; God vseth a commemoration of his benefits to an other end, to stirre men vp to thankefulnesse, and by the consideration thereof, to bring them to repentance: to the which end the Lord putteth Dauid in mind here of the benefits which he had conferred vpon him. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Some doe extend this time, vnto the comming of the Messiah, that the sword should not depart from Dauids house vntill then; but this seemeth to be against that rule of Gods iustice, who threatneth to visite the iniquitie of the father vpon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

Some doe vnderstand this prophecie of Dauids posteritie, which succeeded in the kingdome, vntill the captiuitie of Babylon: for they were continually scourged with the sword of the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and other nations: but this threatning is rather to be referred to the domesticall bloodie contentions, that should fall out in Dauids house among themselues.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="1">1. This is said to be Gods act, not that the Lord is the author or worker of any sinne: but in these respects. 1. Not onely because God did permit Abshalom so to doe, <hi>Osiand.</hi> neither did hinder him, but withdrew his grace from him. 2. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because God had an ouerruling hand, directing and disposing this act of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaloms to such end, as the Lord intended. 3. And this fact in Abshalom, must be considered partly as a sinne, partly as a punishment of sinne: in which respect God had an hand in it, as it serued for the chastisement of Dauid. 4. Beside, in euery act there are two things to be considered, <hi>actio, &amp; defectus,</hi> the action, and defect: the naturall power of acting or effecting any thing, is of God; the defect, is from man. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. But although God concurred here as a iust Iudge in the fact of Abshalom, yet he is no whit therein excused: for he respected not Gods will or counsell therein; but of a rebellious and despightfull mind, did it to disgrace his father: as Iudas, though Christ were deliuered ouer according to the decree and determination of God, yet was lead of a couetous and treacherous mind to doe it, and his sinne was not any way qualified or lessened thereby.</p>

                  <p>The punishment which is imposed vpon Adulterie, is either diuine or humane: and this is either Ciuill, or Ecclesiasticall: which shall be breifly shewed in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Diuine censure, is either that which is grounded vpon the law of nature, or declared more euidently in the Scripture. By the first law of nature euen the Gentiles and others before the law written, iudged adulterie worthie of death: as <hi>Abimelech</hi> decreed, that whosoeuer touched Isaak or his wife should die the death, Gen. 26.11. <hi>Potiphar</hi> adiudged Ioseph for the like suspicion, though most false, vnto the place &amp; prison of capitall offenders, Gen. 39. <hi>Iudah</hi> gaue sentence that <hi>Thamar</hi> who had plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whoore, beeing promised, and so espoused to <hi>Selah,</hi> to be burned. By the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue and written law of Moses, the adulterer and adulteresse were to die, though the one were not actually maried, but onely betrothed, Deut. 22.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Humane Ciuill lawes were of diuerse sorts; some were corporall in the chastis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bodie without death. The Egyptians, as witnesseth <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> did cut off the nose of the adulteresse, and did beate the adulterer with many stripes almost to death. <hi>Zalenius</hi> among the <hi>Locrensians</hi> made a law, that the adulterer should loose both his eyes: and it so falling out, that his sonne was taken in adulterie, he to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the law, caused one of his sonnes eyes to be put out, and one of his owne: as <hi>Aelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> testifieth, <hi>lib.</hi> 13. Among the Germanes (witnesse <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi>) the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse was stript naked, her haire beeing cut off, and her husband beat her vp and down with a staffe. The people called <hi>Laciadae,</hi> as Suidas, or <hi>Placiadae,</hi> did punish the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer about his priuie parts.</p>
                  <p>Some punished adulterie with publike shame, and infamie, as <hi>Plutarke</hi> writeth how the people <hi>Gortinei</hi> would bring them forth into publike view,<note place="margin">Plut. in Prob.</note> which were taken in adulterie, and crowne them with wooll, shewing thereby their effeminate nature: the Cumians set the adulteresse vpon a stone, where she was mocked of all the people, and then caried about vpon an asse, and euer after that was in disdaine, called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, an asse-rider. Among the Romans, the law of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> called <hi>lex Iulia,</hi> thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided against those which committed adulterie. 1. The adulterer and adulteresse were both held as infamous persons, the adulteresse straight after she was deprehended in the fact, the adulterer after he was publikely condemned. 2. They lost the dowrie and marriage gift. 3. The accuser in this case could not be agreed with for money, as in other capitall crimes. 4. The woman could not accuse the husband of adulterie, but the husband the wife, or her father, or her brethren. 5. It was not lawfull for the man to kepe his wife conuicted of adulterie, but he was held as a bawde to his own wife: neither was it lawfull for any to marrie her. 6. By this law, they were punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which did but sollicite others to adulterie. 7. The souldiers which committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, were discharged from their coulors.</p>
                  <p>Beside this ignominie and shame among the Romans such incurred, the adulteresse was brought forth publikely in her husbands gowne: and sometime such were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the brothelhouses and stewes.

And beeing himselfe detected of adulterie, hauing by an oration in his owne defense almost perswaded the people to haue compassion toward him, he voluntarily leaped into the fire.

                  <head>13. <hi>Quest.</hi> What may iustly be excepted against in the former constitutions against adulterie.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. In the Ciuill punishments, which were inflicted among the Heathen, these things were amisse. 1. They punished adulterie with death, leauing other greater sinnes vnpunished; as their Idolatrie, and blasphemie against God, which was the fountaine and very beginning of all vncleannes.</p>
                  <p>2. They were partiall, giuing the man libertie to accuse the woman, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was denied that priuiledge to accuse the man.</p>
                  <p>3. They for euer seperated the adulterer, and adulteresse: whereas the rule of charitie and Christian religion alloweth reconciliation vpon repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the Ecclesiasticall Canons, it was to bee misliked: 1. That they vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the communion in some places vnto adulterers: for Dauid hauing repented of his sinne, was receiued againe to the peace of the Church.</p>
                  <p>2. In that they allowed no reconciliation betweene a Clergie man and his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wife: for why should lesse mercie be shewed and practised among them, then in other callings and degrees?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In vtterly making vnlawfull the marriage betweene the adulterer, and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse: indeed, if they contracted marriage, the former wife and husband liuing, it was not fit: for it might giue occasion of suspition, that they might practise against, and lie in waite for their life: but such marriages in other cases beeing consummate, are

not to be dissolued: for then had the mariage betweene Dauid and Bathshebah bin vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The greatest fault now is in shewing too much lenitie to adulterous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: they should for a time bee excluded from the Church, with the incestuous younge man among the Corinthians, till they are sufficiently humbled, and vpon their teares, and repentance, and true contrition, be receiued into the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>

                  <head>15. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether a man ought to accuse his wife beeing dismissed for adulterie.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. It is here to be considered, whether the partie offending continue in the sinne of adulterie stil; for in this case, after priuate admonition by freinds, taking no place, Christs rule then is to be followed, to tell it to the Church, that by publike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie the partie may be reclaimed and amended.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the partie be penitent, yet if the sinne be notorious and publike, and the innocent partie therein should seeme, by silence and conniuence to boulster out the others sinne: or if there be an adulterous seede, which is like to be taken for the heire of the familie, if the sinne be kept secret: in these cases the Church is to be made acquainted, for the preuenting of both these mischiefes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where none of these dangers are feared, it is better for the innocent partie to follow Iosephs example, who thought secretly to send Marie away, being yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, how she became with child. <hi>P. Martyr.</hi>

                  <head>16. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether adulterie be a more grieuous sinne in the man, or the woman.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Some doe thus obiect, to shew that the sinne is greater on the womans behalf: 1. Because by the Iulian law among the Romans, it was lawfull for the man to accuse the woman of adulterie, but not for the woman to accuse the man: and before that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18791:40"/>
law it was lawfull for the man to kill his wife taken in adulterie, but not for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to doe the like to the man.</p>
                  <p>2. It was lawfull by the auncient Romane laws for the man to diuorce or seperate his wife, but not for the wife to be diuorced from her husband.</p>
                  <p>3. By the law of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth, the woman that did companie with a seruant, became her selfe bound, but the like seruitude was not laid vpon the man offending in the like.</p>
                  <p>4. In Ecclesiasticus, cap. 7.27. and in other places of that booke, great charge is giuen vnto parents to keepe their daughters; but the like care is not enioyned for their sonnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra.</hi> These arguments may easily be answered. 1. These were but humane laws, &amp; some of them were vniust and cruell; as to giue libertie to men to slay their wiues taken in adulterie: and the Romans themselues by the Iulian law abolished that cruell custome: the other lawes, which giue preheminence vnto the man, res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the politicke state, which was more hindered, by the adulterie of women, in the confusion of families, and suborning of false heires: in which respect indeed, the fault is greater on the womans side.</p>
                  <p>2. So also it was made lawfull by some Imperiall lawes, for the women to seeke diuorce and separation from their husbands: as appeareth by the law of <hi>Theodosius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">C. de repudijs in L. Cons.</note>3. The Romane lawes did more punish the womans offence, for the aforesaid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because the politike state receiued greater dammage thereby.</p>
                  <p>4. Parents also are there charged to giue vnto their sonnes good education: but the daughters are more carefully to be kept, because by their fall, their fathers house is defiled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now that the mans offence is the greater, it may be thus argued. 1. because the womans sex is weaker, and so much the more to be pitied. 2. The man is the head of the woman, and ought to giue her a good example. 3. The marriage faith is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually giuen, and therefore it is broken on the mans behalfe as well as the womans. 4. Men vsually are agents and entisers of women, and they are entised.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wherefore the best resolution is this, that in respect of the mutuall bond of mariage and faith of each giuen to other, the offence on both sides is equall; but their persons considered, the man sinneth more, because he is the head. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the commonwealth, the womans fault is more daungerous, in the confusion of families, and in obtruding false and supposed heires.</p>
                  <p>Now yet the causes why the womans offence is counted more odious, the case being the same, are rendered to be these two: <hi>quia viri liberius agunt &amp; non habent peccata latentia vindictam,</hi> the men are more readie &amp; free to accuse their wiues: wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not so forward,<note place="margin">Caus. 32. qu 5. cap. 23.</note> beeing restrained by the modestie of their sex; and the mens faults are more secret, and so escape vnpunished: See more of this question, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, whether adulterie is to be punished by death, to the which opinion <hi>P. Martyr</hi> enclineth here, <hi>Hexapl. in Exod. qu.</hi> 8.9. vpon the seauenth commandement. c. 20. but somewhat of the same question shall here be inserted.</p>

                  <head>17. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the sinne of adulterie ought to be punished by death.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> laboureth by these reasons, to prooue the affirmatiue part.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Death by the law of Moses is inflicted vpon the adulterous persons, Leuit. 20.10. the adulterer, and adulteresse are both to die.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The order of the commandements sheweth as much; for all the transgressions of the first table, as idolatrie, blasphemie, violating of the Sabbath, and of the two first commandements of the second table, as disobedience to parents, murther, were punished by death, so also adulterie: then at the eight commandement the sword staieth, so likewise neither the 9. or 10. commandement were inforced with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie of death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing adulterie is more against the politike state, then theft simply, it should rather be punished by death, then the other: for who had not rather loose part of his goods, then his wife her honestie?</p>
                  <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:18791:40"/>many intricate questions doe arise: as whether by diuorce the band of marriage bee dissolued: whether it be lawfull to marrie after diuorce: whether the innocent party only is to be suffered to marrie: whether the parties offending ought to be reconciled.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the lenitie of punishment adulteries encrease, and this vice groweth to be publike and common.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. That law of Moses was iudiciall and politike: it specially concerned the policie and state of that commonwealth, as shall be shewed afterward: therefore it simply bindeth not now.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither doth the sword beare sway now vnder the Gospel, in the punishing of the transgressions of all the former commandements vnto the seauenth by death: for it were too much rigour, to giue sentence of death for euerie breach of the Sabbath, or for euerie disobedience to Parents: neither doth the sword stay at the 8. commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: for some kind of theft by the lawe of God is iudged worthie of death, as followeth presently to be shewed: and some kind of false witnesse: for he was to be done vnto, as he thought to doe vnto his brother, Deut. 19.18. If hee were a false witnesse against his brothers life, his owne life should be payed for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Adulterie is more against the commonwealth, then simple theft: but not then euerie kind of theft. And there are fowre kinds of theft by the law of God censured by the sentence of death. 1. theft of men, Exod. 21.16. 2. theft with violence, as breaking into an house, Exod. 22.3. and of the same sort is all kind of robberie. 3. sacriledge, the stealing of things consecrated to holy things; which was Achans case, Ios. 7.4. and wanton theft, when one stealeth not of necessitie to satisfie his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but of wantonnesse: as he which hauing many sheepe of his owne, tooke his poore neighbours onely sheepe, 2. Sam. 12.3. Dauid iudgeth such an one worthie of death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such questions are not superfluous and vnnecessarie: for then our blessed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our would not haue medled with them, to shew in what cases it was lawfull for a man to dismisse his wife, and marrie another, Matth. 5. and 19.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not for that adulterie is not punished by death, but because either straight punishments are not laid vpon adulterers, and too much lenitie is shewed, that this sinne so ouerfloweth in the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now on the contrarie it may thus be reasoned, that adulterie is not now neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily to be sentenced by death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Moses Iudicials doe not now necessarily bind, but in regard of the morall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of them: <hi>P. Martyr</hi> saith, <hi>non magis not astringere ciuiles leges, &amp;c. quàm cermoniales:</hi> but that cannot be safely affirmed: for Moses ceremonialls are absolutely and simply abrogated, and to reuiue them, were to violate and infringe the libertie of the gospel: but the Iudicialls are left indifferent, Christian Magistrates as they are not simply bound to retaine them, so they may vse them as they see it to bee fitting to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: Now that this was one of the Iudicialls of Moses, it is euident by this: because it was peculiar to that state and pollicie, that the tribes and families should be distinguished and not confounded or mixt together: therefore it was fit that adulterie should be seuerely punished, by the which commeth the confusion of houses, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blood, subornation of false heires.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other iudiciall and penall lawes annexed to the morall precepts, are not nowe in force: as to put to death euerie one that violateth the Sabbaticall rest, or euery one that is stubburne against their Parents.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By Moses lawe onely that adulterie was punished which was committed with an other wife, Leuit. 20.10. for the man to take a concubine to his wife, or one wife to another, was not then counted adulterie, nor yet was punished by death; for then it would follow, that Abraham, Iacob, Dauid, with others vnder the law that had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiues, or some concubines beside their wiues, liued in adultery, which is no waies to be admitted: and the word <hi>adulterium,</hi> properly signifieth, <hi>alterius adire thorum,</hi> to goe vnto an others bedde. But now seeing Adulterie is either <hi>simplex,</hi> simple, when one of the parties is married, or <hi>duplex adulterium,</hi> double adulterie, when both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are married: there is no warrant from Moses lawe to punish single adulterie on
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18791:41"/>
the mans behalfe with death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our blessed Sauiour, Ioh. 8.11. did dismisse the adulterous woman, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing direction, that she should be stoned to death. But here diuerse answers are made. 1. That because they came to tempt Christ, either to accuse him of too much seuerity in condemning her, and so he should loose the fauour of the people, who commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for his clemencie: or as a transgressor of the law, if he freed her: he doth so answer the Pharises, as that they should neither way haue aduantage against him. 2. He doth not condemne her, because he medled not with the Magistrates office. 3. He sawe her penitent, and therefore absolueth her. 4. He was no witnesse of her sinne, and therefore could not accuse her. <hi>Mart.</hi>

Our blessed Sauiour did not ambitiously seeke the fauour of the people, that he needed in that behalfe to suspend his iudgment concerning the rigour of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lawe: they could haue taken no exception vnto Christ, in ratifying of Moses law, if it had pleased him, that the rigour thereof should haue remained still: therefore that was not the cause of his silence therein.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though as a Magistrate he would not inflict punishment, yet as a teacher hee might haue giuen direction, as he did in an other case concerning the bill of diuorce, Matth. 19.</p>

                  <p>1. One reason was, because Gods will now appeared, that hee would not retract his former decree concerning the death of the child: <hi>Osiand.</hi> for then if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued praying still, he should seeme to haue spurned against Gods will. 2. Though Abraham beleeued that God could haue raised vp Izaak from the dead, when he was commaunded to sacrifice him:<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.19.</note> yet Dauid had no such hope here, because hee had no such promise of this child, as Abraham had of Izaak: <hi>Mart.</hi> 3. An other reason why Dauid ceaseth mourning, is because no singular thing had befallen the child: he was borne to die, and Dauid himselfe should also follow after. <hi>Pellic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Some doe gather a third reason, why Dauid stayeth mourning, because he was perswaded the child was well: for he saith, he should goe vnto him: but of his owne saluation he doubted not: the rest of our writers doe interpret this phrase generally, <hi>of beeing dead</hi>: as likewise that which the counterfeit Samuel said to Saul, to morrow thou and thy sonnes shall be with me.<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>5. But why doth not Dauid mourne for this infant, and yet made such lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Saul, Ionathan, Abner, Absalom?

                  <p n="1">1. Here Dauid is said to call his name Salomon; but, 1. Chron. 22.9. the Lord is said also to haue giuen him that name: so Dauid gaue it by direction from God, by the hand, that is, ministerie of his Prophet Nathan: by whom also the Lord sent and called him by an other name, <hi>Iedidiah,</hi> that is, beloued of God.

                  <p n="2">2. And here it is to be obserued, that the Lord vseth the ministerie of Nathan, as before in sending an heauy message to Dauid, so now in bringing comfortable newes: as Isaias to Hezekiah was a messenger both to tell him of death, and againe of the prolonging of his dayes, least there might be thought some difference and variance betweene the Prophets, if the Lord should haue vsed any other messengers then them. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="3">3. Some thinke that the citie consisted of diuerse parts, whereof one that was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with water, and so stronger then the rest, was held by the king, which Ioab
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18791:43"/>
had now taken: <hi>Borrh. Vatab.

                  <p n="3">3. It was too massie to bee worne vpon any ones head: for there was as much gold in it, as went to the making of the golden candlesticke in the Sanctuarie, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 25. therefore some thinke that there was a load stone in the crowne, and so it was drawne vp with yron, and hung in the aire: but this is a meere deuise. <hi>Hierome</hi> taketh here the word <hi>molcham,</hi> which is translated their king, for their idol <hi>Milchom,</hi> for so they vsed to set crownes vpon their gods heads: but the word is <hi>molcham,</hi> their king, not <hi>milchom,</hi> which was the name of the idoll: this massie crowne therefore was not vsually worne, but it was a crowne of estate, which was onely set vpon the heads of their kings at their coronation, and other solemne times.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now Dauid conuerted this crowne to his priuate vse, and yet transgresseth not that commandement, whereby they were charged not to bring into their houses the things consecrated to idols, Deut. 7.25. not because Dauid tooke it not himselfe, but it was brought vnto him by an other, which is R. <hi>Chimhi</hi> his conceit: for if it were not lawefull to take it himselfe, neither was it lawefull to receiue it at an others hands: But that charge was onely concerning the idolatrous implements of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanites, which they were not to meddle with: the spoiles of other nations they might take, so that they purged them with water or fire: and so they conuerted to their vse the spoile of the Madianites, Numb. 31.23. <hi>Lyran.

                  <p n="1">1. We shall find that the seruants of God imployed to fight his battels, did shew the like examples of seueritie vpon the enemies of God.

                  <p n="3">3. They are cruell, which without cause doe shew seueritie, and delight in blood: but this sharpe course, which Dauid followeth belongeth vnto iustice: the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites were guiltie of most grieuous trespasses: 1. Beside the old grudge which they had against the people of God, in not releeuing them in the wildernesse, when they came out of Egypt. 2. They had broken and violated the law of nations, in abusing Dauids messengers. 3. They had taken occasion by the slaughter of Vriah, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to blaspheme, and insult against God. 4. They had disturbed all the nations round about, stirring them vp, and hiring them to ioyne with them against Dauid, c. 10. 5.

                  <p>1. AS Nathan had before told Dauid of two grieuous crosses, that the sword should not depart from his house, and that his owne concubines should be defiled by another, as he had committed two grieuous sinnes of murther, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, so Gods iustice which sleepeth not beginneth now to shew it selfe: three great calamities follow one in the necke of another; the deflouring of Thamar by Amnon, and his slaughter by Absalom, the defiling of Dauids concubines by Absalom, and his vnnaturall rebellion against his father. <hi>Borrh.</hi> 2. And in this first punishment, Dauid is paied home by the law of retalion: as he killed Vriah, hauing first committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie with his wife, and betraied Vriah into his enemies hand: so here his daughter is rauished, his sonne Amnon slaine, and that also in the same manner by the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his brother. 3. Thus in Dauids familie, who was a worshipper of God, those foule enormities breake forth, which sheweth, that the Church of God is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect here in earth, but many offences may be raised euen among the people of God: whereby appeareth the errour of the old <hi>Novatians,</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> and of the new <hi>Brownists</hi> (so called) which doe seperate themselues from the Church of God, because of the imperfections thereof. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>Among other vncleane acts none are more odious, then incestuous copulations,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18791:44"/>
when within the degrees forbidden any dishonest act is attempted: which incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous coniunctions either by marriage or otherwise, are restrained for diuerse reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is for the reuerence which is to be yeelded vnto our kinred, not to come neare them to vncouer their shame: as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> writeth, that it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, for the father and his daughter to wash themselues one in the sight of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againe, by this restraint and prohibition, the families are kept chast: whereas if such commixtions betweene kindered were permitted, euery house would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By this meanes loue is encreased by marriage with straunge families: whereas, if mariage were lawfull in the same kinred, many loues would bee swallowed vp together, both the naturall and matrimoniall loue.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yea we see that such coniunctions are against the law of nature: for euen the more ciuill nations among the heathen, abhorred to come neare their owne kinred.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But aboue all, the law of God ought to take place, which most straightly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth such incestuous mariages, Leuit. 28.20. and though the lawes of men should be silent herein, the iudgement of God will ouertake such: as is manifest here in the example of Amnon. So in the Romane Histories, <hi>Claudius</hi> that defiled his sister, was slaine of Milo: and <hi>Domitiane</hi> the Emperour guiltie of the like fault, was also slaine.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thus Dauid is chastened in the deflouring of his daughter, and in the slaughter of his sonne: wherein the Lord doth iudge him not onely for the adulterie and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he had committed, but for his rash marriage, which hee made with Maa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah the mother of Absalom, the daughter of an idolatrous king. c. 3.3. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. There were two reasons of Amnons pining away, because two waies was his desire hindered: Thamar was his sister, and therefore he could not marrie her; and she was a virgin, and most surely kept: <hi>Osiand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. His affection thus languishing, his bodie was distempered: for the affections are in the grossest and basest part of the mind, which hath greatest affinitie with the bodie; and thereof it is, that the vehemencie of the affections bringeth the bodie into weakenesses, and diseases.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is written that <hi>Seleucus,</hi> when his sonne <hi>Antiochus</hi> was in loue with his step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother his fathers wife, &amp; pined away for loue, by the perswasion of the Phisitian <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasistratus,</hi> his father was content to part with his wife, and giue her vnto his sonne, rather then he should languish vnto death: But Amnon could not expect for the like at his fathers hand, beeing a man that feared God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Heathen say, there are three remedies against inordinate loue: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>: hunger and abstinence; time, that men should not hastily giue way vnto their affections, but doe all with mature deliberation: and the third is an halter: such was their doctrine, that ended with despaire: but Amnon here neglected indeed the right meanes, namely these, first in time to haue resisted his affections, and not to haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen way vnto them: <hi>Pellican.</hi> secondly, to haue giuen himselfe to abstinence and some honest exercises, which might haue occupied his mind: then by some lawfull matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall loue, to haue ouercome his vnlawfull lust, and to haue praied vnto God for grace. <hi>Mar.</hi>

Then from entreating, she falleth to aduise and counsell him; that he would speake vnto her father, to giue her vnto him, But all these reasons would not content or satisfie his wicked mind: he still proceeded in his vile purpose to haue his will of her. 5. Now whereas the law was, that the virgin which was forced in the towne should crie out, Deut. 22.24. it is like that Thamar cried out, but none would come to deliuer her; or that Amnon kept her from crying. Some thinke that she held her peace, because she would not bring her brother to shame, or vpon hope of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: but hope of marriage she could haue none, because it was against the Law, and shee was more to respect her owne fame, and honest name, then her brothers.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Lyranus</hi> with some others is of opinion, that Thamar was not Dauids daughter by Maacah, but that she was with child by another, when Dauid tooke her captiue in battell, and so Thamar beeing neither Amnons sister by father or mother, might be Amnons wife. But this is not like, for Amnon called her his sister, v. 6. and it seemeth that Thamar was borne after Absalom; as the phrase giueth, <hi>when Absalom had a sister:</hi> or, <hi>when to Absalom was a sister,</hi> v. 1. <hi>Iun.</hi> D. <hi>Chimhi</hi> thinketh also, that Thamar was Dauids daughter: but conceiued by him before she was conuerted to the faith of Israel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Pellican</hi> giueth this exposition: that Thamar secretly vnderstood this condition, <hi>si fieri posset,</hi> if it might be, Dauid would not denie her to him: if it could not be done by marriage, much more vnlawfull was it out of mariage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Problemes giueth this reason why inordinate loue is many times turned to hatred: as <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife, when she could not haue her desire hated Ioseph, as much as she loued him: and Nero after hee had abused his owne mother, so hated her that he killed her. The reason hereof Philosophers yeeld to be this: because the bodie is much altered in such acts of raging and burning lust, and the affection is chaunged withall. But if the reason hereof were naturall, it would alwaies haue the same effect: yet it hath not: for after that Shechem had rauished Dinah Iacobs daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he loued her ardently still, and affected her mariage.</p>

                     </gap>hat this was the cause; Thamar had hurt Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non in striuing with him, and she had railed vpon him, calling him foole, and giuing him such other opprobrious termes. But it appeareth by Thamars answer, that there was no cause at all giuen on her part of so great hatred, v. 16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> thinketh the reason thereof proceeded from the trouble and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie of his conscience, beeing ashamed of that which hee had done: as the Apostle saith, <hi>What fruit had yee in those things, whereof yee are now ashamed?</hi> Rom. 6.22. But if Amnon had had any remorse, or feare of any shame before God, or men, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for his owne credite sake haue thrust her out in such disgrace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But one reason hereof is the difference betweene inordinate and vnlawfull lust, which endeth with hatred, and lawfull loue, which still more increaseth: and such are the baites and allurements of sinne, which haue a pleasant tast at the first, but in the end bite like a serpent: therefore one well-saith, <hi>voluptates non venientes sed abeun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes contemplandas:</hi> that pleasures must be considered not as they come, but as they go. <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Some doe thinke that Dauid did purpose to punish his sonne for this follie, or villanie rather: but like a wise man he deferred it, watching his best opportunitie, as he dealt with Ioab and Shemei. <hi>Osiander.</hi> But it seemeth otherwise, that Dauid had no such intendment, for it was two yeares after before Absalon was reuenged of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An other opinion is, that Amnon might repent him of his sinne, and therefore Dauid pardoned it: but though repentance doe make reconciliation betweene God, and the offender; yet they which publikely transgresse should not be freed from the punishment, which is afflicted for the good example of others: <hi>Mart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some thinke, that it was not death to force a maid not betroathed: for that law Deut. 22.25. is concerning such as are espoused. But it must further be considered, that she was his sister, and so he committed incest, which was worthie of death. And beside, it was death for a virgin to play the whoare in her fathers house, Deut. 22.21. the like penaltie also lay vpon the sonne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Others excuse Dauid, because this matter was not proceeded iudicially before him. Thamar accused not her brother vpon Absaloms aduise, and therefore Dauid, the fact beeing not prooued iudicially before him, could doe nothing. <hi>Borrh.</hi> In this case Dauid should haue sifted out the matter himselfe: otherwise Heli might haue bin by the same reason excused for his lenitie toward his sonnes.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. But Dauid can not be herein excused: he was too remisse and indulgent toward his children. As he was vnwilling that Absalon should be slaine after he was entered into that vnnaturall and rebellious action: neither did he punish Adoniahs aspiring mind, that while his father yet liued, would haue taken vpon him to be King. And herein most of all Gods worke is to be considered, <hi>quod Dauid corrigere noluit Deus punivit,</hi> God punished that, which Dauid would not correct.

                  <head>15. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 36. Of these words, The King wept exceeding sore: how that the children of God are not without their passions.</head>
                  <p>But here this question may be mooued: how it commeth to passe, that many among the heathen in the like calamitie, when they heard of the death of their children, were not mooued, and yet Dauid here sheweth himselfe full of passion: as <hi>Horatius Pulvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> as he was dedicating a temple, heard of the death of his sonne, yet proceeded in the dedication: <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> hearing the like of his sonne, made onely this answer, <hi>scio me genuisse mortalem,</hi> I knew I begot a sonne to die: <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> when his sonnes were slaine, and the publike businesse went well forward, gaue thankes to the gods that he had his prayer, that the calamitie imminent might fall vpon his familie, so that the commonwealth were deliuered.</p>
                  <p>The reasons of this difference may be these. 1. The heathen did thinke that these calamities fell out by necessitie of nature, or by chance, and they looked not vnto Gods prouidence, neither beleeued any thing of the state of the soule after this life: and therefore as naturall men, only considering the time present, and not well waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause of all these calamities, which is our sinns, they seemed not to be mooued. But it is otherwise with the seruants of God: they knowe that all things fall out by Gods prouidence, and that calamities are sent by him as punishments of sinne, and this is the cause of their mourning. And to this purpose may be applyed that saying of Aristippus, who beeing in danger of shipwracke in the sea, and much afraid, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as an other rude man, yet hardie, feared nothing, and being asked why he was so fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beeing a Philosopher, made answer; <hi>non debuisti sollicitus esse tu de anima nebulonis, ego videbam Aristippum philosophum periclitari,</hi> thou hadst no reason to take care for the soule of a knaue, but I knew that Aristippus the philosopher was in danger, &amp;c. So the heathen had no such cause to be mooued: for they knew not what should become of their soules, neither were they of such price with God, as the soules of his seruants, whom he reserueth for a better life.</p>
                  <p>2. An other reason of this vacuitie of passion among the Heathen, was that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued opinion of the Stoicks, who held that there should be in a wise man, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an absence of all passion. The Peripatetikes held, that passions and affections were to be moderated: the other, would haue them to bee quite rooted out: But this were to blame the God of nature, who created man with passions and affections, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God made, was good: and the affections of anger, zeale, desire, sorrow, with the rest, are many times the instruments of vertue beeing well vsed. Indeede the holy Martyrs of Christ in the midds of their torments, seemed to be without sense of griefe, not as though they were without any feelling or passion: but the exceeding great ioy which they had in the contemplation of a better life, did swallow vp all their other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: and this strength in them was extraordinarie and supernaturall: but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is here, of the ordinarie state and condition of the faithfull. This then is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christian religion, <hi>be angrie, but sinne not,</hi> Eph. 4.26. that men should vse their affections, but yet moderate them and keepe them within their bounds.</p>
                  <p>3. And concerning the patience of the Gentiles, with other their vertues of iustice, fortitude, temperance; they were but <hi>speciosa peccata,</hi> goodly sinnes, because they were without faith: and without faith it is not possible to please God, Heb. 11.6. So that we doubt not, but that Dauid with his passionate teares, which proceeded of faith, was more accepted of God, then the vnpassionate heathen, which had no faith. <hi>Mart.</hi>

Our blessed Sauiour as he was perfect God, and so without passion: so was he perfect man, and so tooke vpon him true humane affections, as of ioy, sorrow, anger: for that all these were in him, the Gospel doth abundantly testifie: otherwise he had not beene a perfect man: as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>neque cum verum corpus hominis &amp; animam habuit, habuit falsum affectum humanum,</hi> neither when he had the true bodie and soule of a man, had he false affections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Therefore those sayings of <hi>Hilarie</hi> are warily to be read, and considered; <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum ad patiendum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 10. de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit.</note> 
                     <hi>non ad dolendum corpus habuisse,</hi> that Christ had a bodie to suffer, not to grieue: and the crosse of Christ the speares and nailes he saith, <hi>impetum passionis fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisse in Christo, at non dolorem,</hi> did force passion in Christ, but no sense or griefe; as when a man smiteth the water, there is a passion and suffering in it, but no sense or feeling, &amp;c. These assertions are dangerous, and against the Scripture: the bodie of Christ is not to be imagined to haue such stupiditie, as things without life and sense: He had a perfect humane soule, and therefore affection also and sense.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But there is great difference between the affections which Christ had, and ours. 1. in respect of the obiect: our affections doe turne into sinne, but Christs were neuer occupied in any sinfull or imperfect act. 2. All Christs affections were in him volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, they did rise in him when he pleased to shew them, and they appeared not, when he pleased to suppresse them; but in vs, they are often involuntarie, and they rise whether we will or no. 3. Our affections are so precipitate, that may times they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule reason: but so were not our blessed Sauiours. <hi>ex Mart.</hi>

One reason hereof may be the alteration of times, that may seeme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in one age, which is not so allowed of in an other: then their lamentations were solemne and publike, and with many ceremonies, and much preparation, which vsages doe not beseeme these times. 2. But it may better be answered: that they did more attend the terrene promises of the land of Canaan, and the good successe and encrease of their posteritie, though they had also a sight of the true spirituall rest, but not so cleare as we haue: therefore they sorrowed more for the losse of externall things. But now because wee by faith are nourished into a more lively hope of the things to come, we ought lesse to be mooued with temporall losses and crosses. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. IOab sawe Dauids affection well enclined toward Absalom: not turned against Absalom, as <hi>Osiand.</hi> for the last verse of the former chapter sheweth that Dauid was comforted for the death of Amnon, and longed for his sonne Absalom: Dauid was well affected toward his sonne, yet would not yet send for him to returne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the lawe of God, he that killed an other wifully was to die: Ioab beeing a cunning courtier, and obseruing Dauids minde, beganne to worke with him in this cunning manner, in suborning a subtill woman to speake vnto the King. <hi>Mart.</hi>

But it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Ioab did it to pleasure Absalom, as appeareth, ver. 22. where Ioab giueth great thankes vnto the King for graunting his request. And afterward Ioabs minde might somewhat change toward Absolom, as he sawe the kings minde to alter; and because the king would not haue him see his face, neither would Ioab visit him: and courtiers beside are forgetfull of their friends, and variable.

                  <p>Whereas there are two kind of examples; some are true, some are fained: the fained are of two sorts, either parables or fables: and parables sometime are vsed for illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely, sometime for proofe and demonstration; this parable is of this latter sort: <hi>Borrh.</hi> which Ioab here putteth into the womans mouth for these causes. 1. Parables doe mooue much, and leaue a vehement impression behind them. 2. They were very vsuall in those dayes. 3. But the cheifest reason of all was, <hi>opus erat obliqua petitione in causa mala:</hi> in an euill cause it was necessarie to vse an oblique and indirect petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Osiand.</hi> for it would haue seemed an harsh and vnsauourie petition, at the first to request a parricide of his brother to be restored. <hi>Antonius Caracalla</hi> after he had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his brother Geta, would haue had <hi>Papinian</hi> the lawyer to defend the fact, who made this franke answer, <hi>paricidia facilius committentur, quàm defenduntur,</hi> that parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides are more easily committed then defended: but for this his free speach hee was slaine. <hi>Mart.</hi> 4.

Ioab therefore maketh choice of this woman, whom he knew to be of a subtile wit, and readie speech, to put forth this parable to the King, and to take vpon her the person and habite of a mourner: which part was fittest to be played by a woman full of passion, and so able to mooue compassion.</p>

                  <head>4. <hi>Quest.</hi> Of the womans speach in generall.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The womans parabolicall narration consisteth of two parts, of the proposition of the parable, to v. 12. then the reddition, and accomodation of it to Absalom, v. 12. to v. 21. <hi>Borrh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reasons, which the woman vseth to perswade compassion, are specialy three; taken, <hi>ab honesto, vtili, facili,</hi> it was an honest thing which she desired, profitable, and easie to be done: first, it was honest, both by the lawe of nature, which teacheth a man to defend himselfe, and to repell wrong by force and might, as this her sonne did defend himselfe from his brothers wrong: it was honest by the written lawe, which appointed cities of refuge, for such inuoluntatie offenders. It was also a thing profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to her house, that her sonne should liue, otherwise her sparke should be put out, if both her sonnes should be taken way. And it was an easie matter for the King to determine, who was as an Angel of God, that is, of great dexteritie in hearing good and bad.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The woman alleadgeth many vnlike things in her parable, which were not true in the case betweene Amnon and Absalom. 1. One of these supposed sonnes did not intend an others death, but they fell out vpon the sudden; but Absalom had purposed Amnons death long before. 2. one of these inuaded an other, but Amnon did not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault Absalom. 3. there no witnesses were present, here all the Kings sonnes were assembled together. 4. the cities of refuge were not appointed for wilfull murderers, such as Absalom was. 5. she pretended that if her other sonne died, all hope of poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie should be cut off: but though Absalom should neuer returne, the King had more sonnes. <hi>Mart.</hi> Thus she of purpose inserteth into this her oration some vnlike things, least the King should at the first perceiue her purpose. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

                  <p>1. Some thinke that she cunningly turneth the speach and curse vpon her selfe, which she meaneth toward the King: that if he did not helpe in this case, and deliuer her sonne from them that pursued him, that God would require it at his hand: <hi>Borrh. Mart.</hi> But it is not like, that she would either apertly or couertly vse any such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, all her speach beeing petitionarie. 2. Therefore this rather is her meaning, that if it were so, that the king should offend in redeeming her sonne, that had killed his brother, she would before the Lord, take all the fault vpon her selfe, and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie: the King and his throne should be innocent: <hi>Iun.

                  <head>6. Quest. v. 11. Why the woman saith to the King, Remember the Lord thy God.</head>
                  <p>1. The Chalde paraphrast seemeth to giue this sense, that he would remember what is written in the law of God concerning the pursuit of blood, that they should not pursue deadly the innocent. 2. <hi>Osiander</hi> giueth this sense, remember the Lord thy God, to imitaate him in shewing of mercie. 3. But it appeareth by Dauids immediate answer which he bindeth with an oth, that the woman for her better assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly desire it of the king: <hi>Iun. Vat. Mar.</hi> 4. And whereas the king seemed but to speake of one reuenger of blood, ver. 10. <hi>bring him to me that speaketh against thee:</hi> she desireth a more generall graunt of the king, <hi>that he would not suffer the reuengers of blood to be multiplied:</hi> that not onely one, but all it might be inhibited by the King. <hi>Pel.</hi> 5. The King by this oath was not tied to graunt her request following for Absalom, for his was a diuerse case from this here propounded by the woman, and confirmed by Dauids oath. 6. Neither did the King abase himselfe in swearing to the woman to confirme his promise, it beeing so waightie a matter: seeing that God did so much condi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. She returneth the Kings words vpon himselfe, that seeing hee had giuen sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that her sonne should be spared, he should be found faultie himselfe, if he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the like mercie to Absalom. <hi>Iun.</hi>

                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:18791:48"/>2. Her second reason is, v. 14. taken from our mortall state, and the necessitie of death; seeing such is our condition, as that wee must all needes die, and there is no turning againe in this world; like as water which is spilt cannot be gathered vp againe: she hereby mooueth compassion, that Dauid would not take away Absaloms life before the time. <hi>Mart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. An other reason in the same verse is taken from Gods prouidence, <hi>neither hath God taken away his life, &amp;c.</hi> that is, God hath preserued Absalom aliue, and hath <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed meanes,</hi> that is, put into the peoples head to make request for him, that is bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: <hi>Iun.</hi> and here also shee hath relation to the cities of refuge, which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the rescue of involuntarie man-slayers; <hi>Mart.</hi> and secretly shee insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, how the Lord had spared Dauid, and did not take away his life after he had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Osiand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. She further vrgeth the common perill and danger of the people; saying, v. 15. <hi>the people haue made me afraid:</hi> their state and condition is to be feared, if Absalom the hope of the kingdome returne not: <hi>Vatablus</hi> thus interpreteth, the people terrified me, and told me, that if I should directly make request for thy sonne, thou wouldest be angrie, and this is the cause of my couert speech. <hi>P. Mar.</hi> thus; the people thought I should make request in vaine, yet I was bold to speake. <hi>Osiander,</hi> the people vrged me, after I had entreated for mine owne sonne, to make mention of Absalom also, and that if I did it not, I should greatly offend. But the first sense is most fit, for so the application of the parable to Absalom shall be correspondent to that, which shee alleadged for her sonne, that if he died, her sparke should bee put out, and so Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom was the hope of the people.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Further, vers. 16. shee sheweth the inconuenience that would followe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it in her person, and her sonnes: that as they should be cut off from their inheritance, for her sonne beeing slaine, she should not liue long after: so Absalom beeing in exile, should be destroyed from the inheritance of God, and so fall away to idolatrie: <hi>Mart.</hi> this argument Dauid in the same tearmes had vrged against Saul, 1. Sam. 26.19. <hi>They haue cast me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, goe serue others gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then she propoundeth the common profit, <hi>the word of my Lord the King shall now be for rest:</hi> that is, <hi>ad publicam tranquilitatem,</hi> it shall be for the common tranquilitie and peace.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. She proceedeth and inserteth the commendation of the King, comparing him to an Angel, both in vprightnesse of iudgement, and in dexteritie of iudging: <hi>Bor.</hi> not doubting, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. Dauids conniuence herein, in not causing Absalom to be put to death, for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his brother Amnon, neither is absolutely to be condemned, as transgressing the lawe, which requireth capitall punishment to bee laid vpon those which committed wilfull murder: to the which opinion <hi>P. Martyr</hi> enclineth; adding further, <hi>non de suo sed de Dei iure largitur qui homicidae parcit:</hi> he which spareth a man-slayer, doth not giue any thing of his owne right, but of Gods, &amp;c. for Dauid did what hee could, he caused him to liue in banishment three yeares, cap. 13.38. then he was hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to giue him leaue to returne: and at his returne he would not suffer him to see his face for two yeares more, v. 28. Dauid could not put him to death, because he was beloued of the people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor yet can this fact of Dauid be iustified, that he did well in sparing of Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, and not punishing of him: the example of Cain, who killed his brother Abel, and yet was spared by his father Adam, is nothing like: for God gaue speciall dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation at that time to Caine to prolong his dayes, but to his greater confusion: and beside, Cain was preserued for the necessitie of procreation in those dayes: there is not the like reason, why Absalom should be spared here.</p>

Therefore the meane way is best, neither to condemne or iustifie this fact of Dauid, as seeming to impugne the lawe of Moses, nor yet to justifie it: excused it may be by diuerse circumstances: 1. there were no accusers or reuengers, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this crime against Absalom. 2. he was the kings sonne and desired of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 3. he considered that it was Gods iustice vpon Amnon. 4.

Dauid would not at the first suffer Absalom to see his face, least he might haue bin thought <hi>scelus homicidij leuiter aestimare,</hi> to make but small account of man-slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Osiand.</hi> 2. And by seeing Absalom, the memorie of Amnons death might bee reviued. 3. It is like also that it would haue beene an offence vnto Amnons friends, and they might hereby haue beene prouoked to seeke reuenge: <hi>Mart.</hi> 4. And Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid did it to this ende, <hi>vt melius filios in officio contineret,</hi> that he might by this example of seueritie the better containe his children, and bring them to doe their dutie: <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.</hi> 5. And Dauid thought it good not to restore Absalom all at once, he knew him to be of an insolent nature: hee would haue him therefore by little and little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue more hope of pardon. <hi>Pellic.</hi>

                  <p>1. Mention is made here of Absaloms beautie to shewe his pride, that grewe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent and ambitious in respect of his beautie and fauour, that he not long after aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the crowne. 2. Beautie is no vertue, and yet it is in it selfe a commendable gift of nature, especially if it be accompanied with these two things, humanitie and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie: as Ioseph beeing a beautifull person excelled in both these, he was courteous toward his brethren, and chast to his mistris: But both of them were wanting in Absolom, he was both cruell, and of a murderous mind, and verie vnchast, that hee did not forbeare his fathers concubines. 3. Beautie and comelinesse is not alwaies ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with vertue: Saul was a comely tall person, yet prooued a tyrant: <hi>Alcibiades</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Athenians was a comely man, but caused many tragedies: Isocrates was wont to say of such, that had beautie but no vertue: that they had <hi>navim bonam, sed gubernatorem malum,</hi> a good ship, but an euill gouernour: Chrysostome compareth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to faire trees in the wood,<note place="margin">In Psalm. 50.</note> that bring no fruit but for swine.

                  <head>12. <hi>Quest.</hi> Of Absalom haire. <hi>v.</hi> 16.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Some thinke that Absalom was a Nazarite, and therefore polled not his haire: but the Nazarites did not cut their haire once euery yeare as Absalom did, but when their vow was at an end. It is like as <hi>D. Kimhi</hi> thinketh, that he had a pride in his haire, and did glorie in it. 2. In some countries the vse was not to poll their haire, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Lacedemonians: and they did it for this reason, if they were comely the haire would adde grace vnto them, if they were deformed it would make them terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their enemies. But among the Romans they as much abhorred those, which did weare long haire. There was a certaine tree, whereon the young men and virgins did hang their first haire, which they consecrated vnto the gods: Absalom in nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing his haire followed therein no custome, but did it onely of pride.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His haire waighed 200. sicles, which as <hi>Iosephus</hi> counteth, was fiue pound: but some Hebrews better value the pound at 25. sacred sicles, that is, so many halfe ownces: this was esteemed after the kings, that is, the ciuill and common sicle, <hi>Iunius.</hi> which is held to be but two drammes, that is a quarter of an ownce. <hi>Iosephus</hi> is here in an errour, who thinketh hee polled his head, at euery 8. monthes end, whereas the text saith, it was at the end of euery yeare: and it being too heauie for him, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 200. common sicles, that is, an 100. halfe ownces, and 50. whole ownces, which maketh about 4 l. weight, counting 12. ownces and an halfe to the pound; he then cut it off. But if the sicle contained halfe an ownce, as <hi>Montanus</hi> thinketh, then the waight of his haire was as much more. Some thinke, that it was sold for 200. sicles, not that it waighed so much: <hi>Emm. Sa.</hi> But the valuation of it, at such a reckoning would seeme more strange, then the weight thereof at such a summe. In Saul and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom two men of goodly stature, but of badde conditions, we haue the right descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hypocrites, who beare a faire shew outwardly, but within are corrupt. <hi>Borrh.</hi>

His mother also beeing a straunger, and his kindred were not so much (it may be) respected, and therefore he also sought their aduancement.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And herein God had a secret worke, that Nathans prophecie might take place, that the sword should neuer depart from Dauids house. Further, herein Dauid was a type and figure of the Messiah, against whom one of his Apostles lift vp his heele. <hi>Borrh.</hi>

And by this glittering shew, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to be aduanced of the people, who are much affected with nouelties, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted vsages, <hi>Mart.</hi> It was maruell, that his father perceiued not, to what this tended, but hee was blinded with fatherly loue, and affection toward him. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

The next thing whereby he insinuateth himselfe, is his diligence and paines: he would rise vp earely euery morning, and goe and stand in the gate: ambitious men will spare no trauaile or paines to atcheiue their purpose: which may teach vs to be diligent in following of good causes, if the ambitious are so diligent and studious in prosecuting of euill.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then followeth his flatterie, he would commend euery ones cause that it was verie good: and would giue them faire promises, wishing that hee were set to be a Iudge ouer them, he would then minister iustice vnto euery one.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He slaundereth also his Fathers gouernment, and accuseth his officers of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and iniustice: as the propertie of ambitious men is, to dispraise all but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh, those yeares to take beginning from Dauids first annoynting by Samuel: but that beeing done priuately, could not well be a rule of the publike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Vatablus</hi> (so also <hi>Genevens.</hi>) reckoneth those yeares from the time, when the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites asked a King, which was three yeares, as he thinketh, before Dauid beganne his raigne; and he taketh this to be the 37. yeare of Dauids raigne. But it was more then 40. yeares from thence, for Samuel and Saul gouerned Israel 40. yeeres, Act. 13.21. Neither was there any cause why the yeares of Dauids raigne should be counted from thence, seeing hee was no way accessarie to the sinne of the people in that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. An other account is to beginne these yeares from the slaughter of the preists by Saul in Nob: but the Scripture vseth not to put the yeares of two kings raignes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Iosephus</hi> for fourtie yeares readeth <hi>fowre,</hi> but that is contrarie to the text.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And to count these 48. yeares as runne of the Iubile, is without ground, because we find not that account to be vsed in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The best reckoning then of these yeares, is to count them from the beginning of Dauids raigne: But not as <hi>Pellican</hi> thinketh, that this might be done two or three yeares before the end of Dauids raigne, for so few yeares (he thinkeeth) breake no great square in such a summe: this account is better taken precisely and exactly, that this fell out in the last yeare of Dauids raigne: for all the rest of the storie which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth to chap. 21. seemeth to haue beene done in a veire short time: thus therefore the yeares may be diuided; two yeares Absalom was at Ierusalem before he sawe his fathers face, and three yeares before that in exile: two yeares (before that) were past from the deflouring of Thamar to the slaughter of Amnon: these make 7. in all, and it is thought that 3. or 4. yeares before, that Dauid committed the sinne with Bathsheba in the 59. yeare of his age, and about the 29. yeare of Dauids raigne: for Dauid raigned 40. yeares, and was 70. yeares old when he died: so that the 59. yeare of his age will concurre with the 29. yeare of his raigne. And it is held of the Hebrewes, that Salomon was but a 11. yeares of age, when hee beganne his raigne. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. First, there went with Abshalom 200. men: these were inuited to Abshaloms feast, but knew nothing of his conspiracie: the text saith, they went in their simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. These were in no fault to goe with Absalom, for his father had giuen him leaue: and after they saw, what Abshalom intended, then they could not withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <hi>sine praesentissimo vitae periculo,</hi> without most present daunger of their life. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But before this Abshalom had sent messengers secretly into all the Tribes, to feele and solicite the mindes of the chiefest men, and to appoint to meete at He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then he sendeth for Achitophel, who it should seeme was of counsell with him in this action, but had withdrawen himselfe into his owne countrie, that there might be no suspition, and from thence came to Hebron, beeing acquainted with the whole proiect of the businesse before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But it is most to bee wondred at, that the people did flocke so fast to Absalom: it is like that Achitophel or some other vsed some perswasion to the people, shewing the imperfections of Dauids life, and gouernment, and how beside the adulterie of Bathsheba, and murther of Vriah, he had suffered Amnon to goe vnpunished for his incest: and had dealt hardly with Abshalom for reuenging his sisters wrong. By such perswasions the people might be caried, being of themselues desirous of noueltie, and longing to see a change. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>Dauid hauing armed men with him, and beeing in a strong citie, might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there still more safely, yet he did chuse rather to flie, for these reasons. 1. He would spare the effusion of blood; for he said, <hi>least hee smite the citie with the edge of the sword:</hi> he had rather hazard his owne person, then that many should be brought into danger: hee knew how cruelly ambitious men were set, that they would not spare, nor haue any compassion, till they had accomplished their desire. Hereof the Ciuill warres of Scilla and Marius, and betweene Augustus, Antonie, and Lepidus in the Romane state may make demonstration: <hi>Mart.</hi> Antisthenes was wont to preferre hangmen and executioners before Tyrants, for they did but put malefactors to death, the other did not spare the innocent.</p>
                  <p>2. An other reason of his departure was; hee beganne to consider that this was the hand of God vpon him, according as Nathan had foretold him, that the sword should not depart from his house, and therefore he submitteth himselfe meekly to the Lords mercie.</p>
                  <p>3. And by his departure, an other prediction of Nathan tooke effect; hee left his concubines behind, whom Abshalom defiled.</p>
                  <p>4. Dauid with all his people went on foote, as is gathered v. 17. <hi>R. Leviben Gerson</hi> thinketh the reason thereof was, that he might not be discerned, going as a common souldier: but rather Dauid did it to shew his afflicted estate: <hi>Mart.</hi> And Dauid ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying himselfe thus humblie in this calamitie, continued not long therein, but was soone restored to his former estate. <hi>Pellican.</hi>

Wherefore I thinke rather with <hi>Iunius,</hi> that these were no other then the garison souldiers, which kept Gath, which Dauid had taken not long before from the Philistims, c. 8.1. and Ittai was their captaine: who is called a stranger, because he was so in respect of his habitation: Hee was one of Dauids principall captaines to whom he committed the third part of his armie, c. 18.2. 5. Now Dauid would not haue Itthai goe with him, because he was lately come, and his men wearie: and though such helpe had beene necessarie for Dauid, yet he was not a man that altogether respected his owne commoditie: and he trusted in Gods defense, that he would deliuer him. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Some thinke Dauid sent backe the Arke, because the peculiar place appointed for it, was at Ierusalem from whence it should be no more remooued. <hi>Borrh.</hi> But that is not so: the peculiar place for the Arke was not yet assigned, but afterward in the threshing floore of Araunah where the Angel appeared to Dauid. And before this in Dauids time, the Arke was carried to battell against the Ammonites, and therefore Vriah said to Dauid, <hi>that the Arke remained in the field,</hi> because it was in the campe. c. 11.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some thinke that Dauid was afraid to carrie the Arke with him, least some such casualtie might befall them, as before, when Vzzah was smitten.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some are of opinion that the Preists consulted with God, and receiued no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and therefore Dauid sendeth backe the Arke as vnprofitable: but that is not like.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Others iudge this to be the reason: the Preists went with the Arke, and Dauid remembring what the preists had suffered for his cause before at Nob, would not haue them brought into the like daunger now, and therefore sendeth them backe with the Arke.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But the reason is set downe in the text, why the Arke was returned to Ierusha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, because Dauid thought good to send backe the Preists, who attended vpon it: that they might out of the citie giue Dauid intelligence, as occasion serued. v. 27.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thus Dauid, though he knew that the Arke was a worthie Sacrament, and a visible testimonie of Gods presence, and well remembred, what great things the Lord had wrought by the Arke: how the waters of Iordan were diuided before it, the walls of Iericho fell downe: yet Dauid was contented at this time to forbeare the presence of the Arke: hauing his confidence in God, and not relying altogether vpon the externall Sacrament. Contrarie is the superstitious practise of the Pope, who when he iourneieth must haue the consecrated hoast carried vpon a white palfrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,<note place="margin">Controv. The grace of God not tied to the signe.</note> that if any should chaunce to be suddenly stricken with sickenesse, hee might presently be housled therewith: the like opinion they haue of the necessitie of baptisme, that infants are damned, that are not baptised: and thus they tie Gods grace to the outward signe and Sacrament: Dauid doth not so here, who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to haue Gods presence, though hee had not with him the visible signe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Pet. Martyr</hi> saith, <hi>videntem vocat, quia prior aderat,</hi> he calleth him a Seer, because he was there first: but the name Seer is taken for a Prophet: as Samuel was so called, 1. Sam. 9.9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The reason hereof was this: Abiathar and Zadock had their times to serue in course, as was appointed by Samuel and Dauid, 1. Chron. 9.22. and this weeke Zadock serued, and therefore Dauid calleth him Seer. And thus much in effect he saith vnto him, that he was the publike Minister to giue attendance vpon the Arke for the seruice of the whole Church, and therefore it was not fit, that he should onely follow the King, <hi>priuata conditione fugientem,</hi> now flying away, as in a priuate state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. <hi>Iun.</hi> And further, Dauid in effect saith thus much vnto him: <hi>Art not thou a Seer</hi> which doest vse to aske counsell of God by Vrim and Thummim? thou maiest stand me in more stead in returning, and abiding with the Arke to consult with God for me, then to be with me still here. <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <p>1.

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. Some are of opinion, that whereas there are three kind of lyes, <hi>iocosum, officio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, perniciosum,</hi> a lie in iest, an officious, and a pernicious lie: the two first they hold to be lawfull: and that to make a charitable lie to doe good to some, and not to hurt others, is not vnlawfull. But this is no sound opinion: for euery lie with what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense so euer it is made, is an offence: because we doe not speake the truth from the heart: and S. Pauls rule must be obserued, we must not doe euill, that good may come of it. See more hereof, 1. Sam. c. 21. qu. 13. qu. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh that this dissembling of Chushai was an officious kind of lie, which was not against charitie, but it tended to preserue the life of the King, and the state, and therefore neither Dauid therein sinned in giuing this aduise, nor Chushai in following it. But if it be graunted that Chushai here made a lie, it must needes follow, that it was not without offence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Pellican</hi> resolueth thus, that Chushai did here tell no lie: for hee had done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed faithfull seruice to Abshalom, if he would haue beene ruled by him, and surcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to pursue his father: and his counsell was also in effect profitable to him: for it was better that Abshalom was slaine, then he should haue killed his father. But it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Chushai had no such intendment to profite Absalom by his counsell, but to ouerthrow all his deuises.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wherefore either with <hi>Iunius</hi> it may be answered, that Chushai <hi>ambiguo sermone ludificatur,</hi> doth with ambiguous speach dally with Absalom, and so telleth not a lie: See c. 17.16.18.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Or else, as <hi>Pet. Martyr</hi> concludeth, Dauid might herein haue Gods direction, and then hee sinned not; for God is aboue his owne law: as Abraham in attempting to sacrifice his sonne, the Israelites in taking f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om the Egyptians, sinned not, because they did it by Gods direction. So if it be graunted, that Chushai here lied and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, if he did it <hi>humano impulsu,</hi> by a mans meere deuise, he cannot altogether be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused. But if it were by Gods direction, they offended not: as it may be gathered by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18791:52"/>
this, both because presently after Dauids prayer, that God would turne Achitophels counsell into foolishnesse, Chushai is offred vnto him, as the man, by whom his praier should be effected: and Dauid speaketh as a Prophet confidently, that by this means Achitophels counsell should be brought to nought. It seemeth then that Dauid here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was not without some diuine instinct. But we need not run here to such extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie instinct to seeke defense or excuse of this fact: the former solution may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that Chushai did not tell a lie; nor is guiltie of vntruth in his speach, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed a doubtfull and ambiguous kind of speach: first hee saluted Absalom, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God saue the King,</hi> which he might as well vnderstand of Dauid, as of Absalom. c. 16. v. 16. Againe he saith, <hi>whom the Lord and all Israel, and all this people shall choose, his will I be</hi>: who else was that, but Dauid? And further he addeth, <hi>as I serued before thy father, so will I be before thee:</hi> hee professeth in effect himselfe still Dauids seruant. His whole course of speach is ambiguous: he may be thought somewhat to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which in it selfe simply is not vnlawfull; but hee is not conuinced of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</p>

                  <head>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Of Dauids rashnesse in giuing vnto Ziba Miphibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheths goods and lands.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Dauid is assaulted in this Chapter with two contrarie temptations, of flatterie by Ziba, of rayling by Shemei: hee ouercame the greater, and was ouercome of the lesse. So many times Gods children stand out in great temptations, and giue out in lesse; which sheweth their humane infirmitie, and what they are, being left vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. 2. But there is great difference betweene the slippes of the righteous, and the fall of the wicked: for these are caught in the snare of temptation, and cannot wind themselues out, but though the righteous stumbleth, yet hee recouereth himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; as Dauid afterward made restitution vnto Miphibosheth of that, which he had hastely taken from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Dauid sheweth himselfe verie rash in precipitating his sentence against Miphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth, his cause beeing vnheard. It was a likely tale, that hee told of Miphibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, who was the onely heire left of Sauls house: but all things that are likely, are not true.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Beside Dauid here sheweth his vnmindfulnesse of Ionathans kindnesse in time past, and forgetteth the couenant which was made betweene them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By this we see, how daungerous a thing it is for a Magistrate to receiue gifts, which blind euen the eyes of the wise. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

Sam. 2. 2. He maketh Dauid an vsurper, as though he had inuaded and thrust himselfe to raigne in Sauls stead; whereas Dauid not once dreaming of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was thereunto called by the Lord, and anointed by Samuel. 3. He iustifieth wicked Abshalom, saying, that God had deliuered Dauids kingdome into his hands, which was most vntrue; Absalom was a most vniust and ambitious man, and thought to depriue his father of his kingdome. 4. He saith that Dauid was punished for his wickednesse, which was true, but not for those things whereof Shemei before chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged Dauid.</p>

Abishai is here carried away with a preposterous zeale, as often the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are: So Ionas waighted still to see the destruction of Niniueh: Iames and Iohn, Luk. 9. would haue had fire come downe vpon the Samaritans: This then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from any diuine or religious charitie, but from an humane affection. 3.

                  <p>1. Dauid looketh vnto Gods prouidence, who had so disposed to trie Dauids pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by Shemei his rayling tongue. 2. He thus reasoneth by way of comparison: he had endured the troubles and trialls procured by his son, who sought his life: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Shemei was a stranger vnto him, and did but raile vpon him in words: much more was it fit he should beare this reproach. 3. He sheweth the fruit that might come of it, <hi>it may be that God would do him good for his cursing:</hi> not that this affliction was the cause of his reward: but it is an order and course, which the Lord obserueth to raise them vp, whom he had humbled; so he dealt with Ioseph and Iob. 4. And hee speaketh doubtfully, because we haue no certaintie of these temporall things: but of his spirituall state, his euerlasting saluation Dauid made no doubt at all.</p>

                  <head>6. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 10. Whether Dauid did well in bearing Shemei his reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words: and what a reproach is, and how to bee borne.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. A reproach is offered either in word, as Shemei reuiled Dauid, or in deede, as Abshalom defiled his fathers concubines, not so much of lust, as to disgrace his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. Reproaches, some are meere slaunders, as those were, which Shemei obiected to Dauid: some are true, as when one obiecteth such crimes as are true, but after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull manner. 3. Some reproachfull words are vttered by way of disgrace, and they are sinne: some onely are by way of discipline to amend and correct, and make one ashamed of his sinne: as when Magistrates rebuke offenders, and ministers in their sermons sharpely reprooue sinne: as the Prophet Isay called the cheife of Israel, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Sodome, c. 1.10. and S. Paul saith, <hi>O yee foolish Galatians:</hi> and such kind of reproaches are not sinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reproachfull and reuiling words proceede either from anger and desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, as here in Shemei; or from pride, as in Rabsake against Hezekiah; or from foolishnesse, as Nabal reuiled Dauid.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How we are to behaue our selues in bearing of reproaches, these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are necessarie: 1. that generally we must followe that rule of Christ; if one smite
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18791:53"/>
vs on the one cheeke, wee should turne to him the other also, that is not alwayes to doe so in fact, for Christ beeing smitten vpon one cheeke did not turne the other: but our heart must alwaies be prepared for Christs sake to suffer all wrongs in word, and in deed.</p>
                  <p>2. Yet there is a time when a foole must be answered in his foolishnesse, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiler must not bee suffered to goe away without a rebuke; as if either his reproach tend to the hinderance of our good name or our brothers, and they which heare it, are by our silence apt to beleeue the slander; and if a discreet reproofe may be a means to make him see his sinne.</p>
                  <p>3. And there is a time, when a foole is not to be answeared in his foolishnesse, <hi>least we be like him</hi>;<note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note> if we thinke that we shall growe too hotte and cholerike, and exceede measure in reproouing, it is better for vs to hold our peace: and when we see in respect of the slaunderer, that his word is of no credit, and our defence needeth not in respect of the standers by: or if the reuiler is like to be more prouoked by our admonition: in all these cases it is better to be silent.</p>
                  <p>4. And where defence is needefull, it is not onely lawful for vs priuately to rebuke the slaunderer, but to make complaint vnto the Magistrate, to preserue our good name; as a theife of our goods may be brought before the Magistrate, so much more he that stealeth away our good name.</p>
                  <p>5. And as concerning Dauid, it was a worthie and commendable part in him to beare Shemeis slaunderous speach: for hee was innocent, he therein considered the Lords purpose to trie him; it was then no time for him to seeke reuenge: he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie offred afterward to meete with this reuiler. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <head>7. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 10. How the Lord is said to haue bidde Shemei curse Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, and how sinne standeth with the will of God, and whether he is any way the author thereof.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. First, that God is no way the author of sinne, by these and such like reasons it is made plaine. 1. God is not the author of any thing, whereby a man is made worse: for if an artificer will not marre his owne worke, much lesse God; but by sinne man becommeth much worse.</p>
                  <p>2. God is the reuenger of sinne, therefore not the author.</p>
                  <p>3. God hateth nothing which he hath made, but he hateth sinne.</p>
                  <p>4. He that doth or procureth sinne is a sinner: but God cannot without horrible blasphemie be said to be a sinner.</p>
                  <p>5. If God should prouoke vnto sinne, we should make him a dissembler &amp; an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, who forbiddeth one thing, and yet doth an other.</p>
                  <p>6. The Lord saith by his Prophet Hosea, <hi>thy destruction is of thy selfe,</hi> then sinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the cause of destruction is of our selues.</p>
                  <p>7. Our Sauiour saith, that when the deuill speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his owne, sinne then is peculiar vnto the deuill, therefore nor to God.</p>
                  <p>8. Christ wept ouer Ierusalem, beeing grieued for the calamitie that should befall it: much more was he grieued for sinne, which was the cause thereof: then is he not the author of sinne.</p>
                  <p>9. Tyrants make seuere lawes, and then compell men to breake them, that they may punish them: So God should be a tyrant, if he procured or made men sinne and transgresse his lawes.</p>
                  <p>10. If God were the author of sinne, he could not be the Iudge of the world.</p>
                  <p>11. If God any wayes should stirre vp vnto sinne, there must needs be two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wills in God, one whereby he willeth sinne to be; the other, whereby he disliketh it, and is displeased at it.</p>
                  <p>12. The wicked should be in no fault, for they might turne all the blame vpon God.</p>
                  <p>13. Men had no reason to be grieued for their sinne, but to reioyce, seeing they doe that which God is the author of: if he were the author or worker of sinne.</p>
                  <p>14. If God would haue men saued, then hee would haue them also vse the meanes vnto saluation: then would he not haue them sinne, which doth hinder their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18791:53"/>
saluation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, the reasons on the contrarie, that God may be charged with sinne, are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Apostle saith, Rom. 1.26. that God gaue vp the Gentiles to vile affections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord is saide to haue hardened Pharaohs heart: and Isa. 6.10. to make the eyes of the Israelites heauie, and to shut their eyes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We say in the Lords prayer, <hi>Lead vs not into temptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that is the cause of the cause, is the cause of the effect, procured by that cause: But God is the cause and creator of mans will and affections, which are the cause of sinne: he may seeme then to be the cause of sinne.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord said to the spirit, that offered to goe &amp; be a false spirit in the mouthes of Ahabs Prophets, <hi>goe and prosper,</hi> 1. King. 22.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sinne is an action: but all actions proceed from God, the first moouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner: <hi>for in him we liue, mooue, and haue our beeing,</hi> Act. 17.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Lord saith by his Prophet Ezechiel, c. 14.8. <hi>If the Prophet be deceiued when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord haue deceiued him, &amp;c.</hi> so Ieremie saith, cap. 4.10. that the <hi>Lord had deceiued his people</hi>: so Isay saith, 63.17. <hi>O Lord, why hast thou made vs erre from thy wayes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Psal. 105.25. <hi>Hee turned the heart</hi> (of the Egyptians) <hi>to hate his people:</hi> Iosh. 11.20. <hi>It came of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battell:</hi> 2. Thess. 2.11. the Apostle saith, <hi>Hee shall send them strong delusions to beleeue lies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. As God willeth the end, so also hee willeth the meanes which tend vnto that ende: but it was Gods will that Christ should be deliuered vp vnto death, and that the members of Christ, as the holy Apostles and Martyrs should be tried: thereof it was Gods will also that Iudas should betray Christ, and that the tyrants should raise persecution against his Church, which were sinnefull acts.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If God can hinder a man from sinne, and will not, and take away from him the helpes, which should keepe him from sinne, he should seeme to be accessarie vnto it: as if we see a man readie to fall into a pit, and forwarne him not of it; or take from one a staffe whereon he leaneth, so that he falleth: we should be guiltie of his hurt: so it should seeme to be betweene God and man; if he should withdraw from him his grace, whereby he might stand.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Seeing God doth bring forth substances by vnhonest action, as children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in adulterie; why may he not as well produce actions, <hi>per malam voluntatem,</hi> by the euill inclination and will of man?</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The Apostles say in their prayer, that Herod and Pilate had assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues together, <hi>to doe whatsoeuer thine hand and counsell had determined before to bee done:</hi> By these and such like places of Scripture, and reasons, some shew may be made that God hath some hand in the sinfull workes of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the third place the diuerse opinions must be touched of this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some doe indeede most blasphemously make God the author and worker of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, as the Libertines: which blasphemie is to be abhorred, and to be condemned to hell with the authors thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are that vnderstand these places of Scripture of Gods permission onely.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some doe thinke that God is an agent euen in euill actions, which as they proceede from man are euill, but as God concurreth it is iust, the reason whereof if we cannot comprehend, we must rest in the iudgement of the Scripture: this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall afterward be more fully declared and confirmed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Further, it must be considered what sinne is; it is not a substance, nor yet any subiect or habit in a subiect, but onely a defect and priuation, as blindnes is of the sight: and <hi>malum esse non potest nisi in bono,</hi> euill cannot be but in that which is good, as blindnesse is in the sight: euill is of two sorts, it is either <hi>culpa,</hi> the fault, or <hi>poena,</hi> the punishment: the fault is the absence or priuation of some vertue or grace, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is the priuation of some benefit, as sickenesse is of health: and there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is both a sinne and punishment, as originall sinne.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:18791:54"/>5. Now more fully and distinctly to determine of this question, these conclusions following shall be set downe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God properly is not the cause of euill, nor author of sinne: for the habite neuer of it selfe produceth the priuation, as light bringeth not forth darkenesse: but if the light be remooued, then the darkenesse followeth of it selfe. But like as the Sunne is not the cause of darkenesse; but the Sunne beeing remooued from our hemisphere, then darkenesse of it selfe succeedeth: so when God taketh away his grace (which he do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h to make man know and vnderstand, that he can do nothing without grace) then followeth darkenesse and ignorance in our hearts. So that God is not properly the cause of sinne, but onely <hi>remouens,</hi> the remoouing cause: So that there neede no effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or positiue cause to be made of sinne, as the Maniches made two Princes, the one of light, to whom they ascribed, why was good, and the others of darkenesse, whom they made the beginning of euill: for by the absence of light and grace, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and euill doe succeede of themselues by the corruption of our nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we must consider of a threefold action of God. 1. One is generall in the works of his prouidence, whereby euerie thing is preserued and maintained in it kind and nature: for in him we mooue, we liue, and haue our beeing. 2. An other is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and particular, whereby he worketh all good things in his Saints. 3. The third is betweene both, whereby God carrieth an ouer-ruling hand in all actions, making all things good and bad, reasonable and vnreasonable creatures to serue vnto his glorie, and to be instruments of his will. And thus God disposeth euen of the sinnefull acts of men, that thereby his will is effected and accomplished, and yet he is no way acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to their sinne: so that in the same act, God and mans will may concurre, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a diuerse manner: God may iustly will that, and to a good end, which man wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth wickedly and vniustly; as God determined the death of Christ for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind, but Iudas betrayed him of a wicked mind, and Sathan prouoked Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das as an enemie vnto God and the truth. And <hi>Augustine</hi> further sheweth how in the same thing God willeth and man willeth,<note place="margin">Euchirid. ad Laurent. c. 10.</note> but diuersly, by this instance. A wicked sonnes father is sicke, Gods will is he shall die, and so the wicked sonne desireth hee should die also, but to an other ende, that he may enioy his inheritance. So likewise one may will that which God willeth not, and yet bee without sinne: As the good child of loue toward his father desireth his life, whom Gods will and pleasure is shall die of that sickenesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God may minister an occasion which of it selfe is good, but the wicked abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it, are thereby stirred vp to doe euill: as when Moses and Aaron brought a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage vnto Pharaoh to let his people goe: Pharaoh thereupon was incensed to oppresse the people more grieuously: so God might be said to harden Pharaohs heart, but <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionaliter,</hi> and <hi>accidentaliter,</hi> by ministring an occasion, and accidentally onely.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord also <hi>permissiue,</hi> by way of permission, may be said to haue on hand euen in euill actions, which he permitteth to be done; which his permission is in him a kind of will: for if he permitted or suffered any thing <hi>nolens,</hi> against his will, it would shew an impotencie and want of power; but euen in Gods permission his power appeareth: so permitting euill to be done in the world, as he knoweth how to make it serue for his glorie: and so he permitteth sinne, as that he so disposeth, that it shall not rage or raigne in all, nor in all times, nor further then he seeth it to be for his glorie: But good actions the Lord willeth after an other sort: not onely permitting them to bee done, but effecting, working, finishing, and perfitting in vs euery good worke.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Further, there are three things to be considered in sinne: 1. The guilt of sinne, which is nothing else, but <hi>obligatio ad poenam,</hi> a binding and tying of him that sinneth vnto punishment: and this is an act of Gods iustice, who after one hath sinned, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him guiltie of punishment. 2. Then there is the act of sinne, which is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; and this God is the cause of, who giueth power to mooue, to will to doe this or that vnto his creatures, which power hee restraineth not, but suffereth euerie thing which he hath made, and enableth it also to exercise the naturall properties and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof: Thus God is the author of the action, but the euilnes of the action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from mans corrupt nature: like as the soule and life in the body, is the cause
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18791:54"/>
it mooueth, but the lamenesse of the legge or other part affected, is the cause of the halting thereof: So God as an vniuersall agent, giueth life and motion to his creatures, as the soule doth to the bodie, but the abusing and deprauing of these actions, ariseth from the corruption of mans nature. 3. There is in sinne the punishment to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: So God is said to punish sinne with sinne, as the Apostle sheweth how the Lord gaue ouer the Gentiles to a reprobate sense; and to vile affections as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Idolatrie, Rom. 1.</p>
                  <p>In this manner, as hath been shewed, how the Lord may be said to haue to do with sinne: but he is no way the author thereof, or properly the cause: And that is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in God, that he cannot sinne, nor will sinne, but it is his perfection: who beeing perfect goodnesse it selfe, cannot abide any thing that is euill: for if he should will sinne to bee, he should turne men from himselfe, which were to denie himselfe, which as the Apostle saith, God cannot doe; <hi>God cannot denie himselfe,</hi> 2. Tim. 2.13. This th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n is the summe of all, that God is not properly the cause of euill, but 1. either by remouing and withholding his grace. 2. by disposing in his infinite wisedome and power, euen of euill actions to serue his glorie. 3. by ministring occasion, which the wicked may abuse and peruert to their further hardening. 4. in permitting things to be done, as farre as hee seeth expedient for the vniuersall good. 5. the guilt of sinne in iustice he procureth. 6. the generall action he causeth. 7. as it is a punishment, he inflicteth it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now according to these conclusions set downe, the former reasons which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make God accessarie vnto euill, may thus be answered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God is said to giue vp the Gentiles to vile affections, because hee left them to themselues, and iustly depriued them of his grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hardened Pharaohs heart, and blinded the Israelites eyes, <hi>occasionaliter,</hi> by ministring the occasion, which they abused: Gods workes were an occasion of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs hardening, and his word of the others blinding, but not of themselues: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through their peruersnesse tooke occasion to doe euill, where none was giuen, and turned that which was good, to be an occasion of euill.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord is said to lead into temptation, because the deuill, who is the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, can doe no more then God permitteth: God tempteth not to euill, as hee is not tempted, Iam. 1. And we of our selues are tempted of our owne concupiscence: therefore our Sauiour saith to his Apostles, watch and pray, <hi>least yee enter into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Matth. 26.41.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God is the creator of mans will, but not of his corrupt will, which is the cause of sinne, and not his will simply, as God created it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When God saith to the euill spirit, <hi>goe and prosper,</hi> that is to be referred to the ende, which was the death and punishment of Ahab: but the meanes which was by beeing a lying spirit, God willed not nor commaunded to be done, but hindred not the doing of it, because the Lord knewe how to vse it to his glorie.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is not denied, but that the subiect of sinne, which is the action in generall is from God, who is the moouer of all things: but it followeth not that the euilnesse of the action therefore is from God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. God is said to deceiue the Prophet and people, not in respect of the cause thereof, which proceeded from their owne corrupt heart: but in regard of the euent, because God vsed that seduction for their punishment.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. God is said to turne their hearts to hatred, because the prosperitie of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, which God caused, gaue occasion of enuie and hatred to the Egyptians: the hearts of the Canaanites were hardened, <hi>non emolliendo,</hi> because God mollified them not. And so God gaue them which beleeued not the truth, strong delusions, as a iust iudge punishing their hardnes of heart and vnbeleefe, with blindnes &amp; peruersnesse.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. God willeth the meanes, but after an other manner: his will is, that persecutions should be, not simply, but as they tend to his glorie, and to the propagation of the truth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It is crueltie in man, if he suffer one to fall and helpe him not, because a man is bound in charitie to doe it: but God is bound to none: many graces he giues vnto the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18791:55"/>
wicked, which they abuse: he is not bound to giue all, he may doe with his owne, as it pleaseth him.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. God is the author of the action, which bringeth forth euill; but not of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilnesse of the action.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Concerning the death and suffering of Christ, God willed it in respect of the ende, which was our redemption: the meane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1.

Achitophel giueth counsell contrarie to the word of God: he would haue Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalom lie with his fathers concubines or wiues, which was forbidden by Gods law: but he respecteth his owne profit, more then the glorie of God. 2. For this was his pollicie, to make Abshalom odious to his father, that there might be no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: for he feared, least if that Abshalom should be receiued to his fathers fauour, all they that tooke his part, should goe to wracke. 3. This was very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but not necessarie: for though Ruben had defiled his fathers bed, yet Iacob did not vtterly cast him off from beeing counted among his brethren, though he depriued him of his birthright. And Dauid notwithstanding this villanie, yet altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew not his affection from his sonne, as appeareth by his mourning for him. 4. The Hebrewes thinke that Achitophel herein did reuenge his own quarell, because Dauid had committed adulterie with Bathsheba, who was Achitophels neece by his sonne Eliam: who was the sonne of Achitophel, and is numbred among Dauids worthies, c. 23.14. 5. This Achitophel was such another craftie man, and wicked counseller to Abshalom, as Ionadab before was to Amnon. If Dauids house were not void of such flaterers and wicked counsellers, it is no maruell, if they abound in Princes Coures in these daies. 6. Abshalom here now bewraieth himselfe by this abominable act, that he was not reuenged of Amnon so much for his incest, as of malice and spight, seeing here he committeth more grieuous incest himselfe: <hi>Mart.</hi> 7. But this fell out by Gods prouidence, as the Prophet Nathan had told Dauid before, that he should be thus corrected for his sinne of adulterie. <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <head>12. <hi>Quest.</hi> How this incest of Abshalom might stand with Gods will.</head>
                  <p>1. It is certaine, that all things which are foreseene of God, shall necessarily come
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18791:56"/>
to passe, <hi>&amp; praevideri non quia futura sunt,</hi> and that they are foreseene, not because they shall come to passe, but therefore they shall come to passe, because they are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene. 2. It also followeth that nothing falleth out by chaunce, but according to the decree and foresight of God. 3. But further, there is great difference betweene the ineuitable necessitie of the counsells of God, and necessitie which is by compulsion and coaction: notwitstanding God foreseeth the sinnes of men, which therefore are ineuitable, yet they commit them freely and willingly, as Abshalom did this incest here. As God is by an ineuitable necessitie good, and Sathan euill: the one can not be otherwise then good, nor the other then euill: yet God is freely good without compulsion, and so is Sathan euill: <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <p>1. <hi>Iunius</hi> referreth it to this present counsell of Achitophel, which though it were in it selfe most horrible and wicked, yet it was applauded by the vngodly, as most sound counsell: but the text speaketh not onely of this time, but of his former coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells in the daies of Dauid. 2. So that Achitophels counsell is not so called onely in respect of that authoritie which it had in the opinion of men: <hi>Osiand.</hi> 3. But because of the good successe, which his counsell vsed to haue. <hi>Genevens.</hi> And this counsell, which he giueth now, though it were wicked, yet it was for the present time verie perilous and pestilent. 4. His counsell was so esteemed of in Dauids time also: but with this difference; Dauid approoued of his counsell, as hee found it agreeable to Gods word: but Abshalom and his companie follow it howsoeuer, if it serued their turne: yet this is an hyperbolical speach, <hi>comparatio est non aequiparatio,</hi> it is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison onely, not an equalizing of his counsell vnto the oracle of God, vnlesse it were in the opinion of carnall and worldly wise men. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. And such a wise man was Achitophel, carnally or worldly, not religiouslly wise: such wisedome as may be and is giuen many times to wicked men. <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <p>1. COunsell of it selfe is a sacred thing, and commended in the Scripture; and as it is of necessarie vse in all affaires, so specially in battell, which must be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised by counsell, Prou. 24.6. But here it is abused by this craftie man. 2. Who offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth three waies in this his counsell: in the matter, which is consulted of, the means, and the end. 1. For the matter, there are two things, that doe not fall vnder consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; either such as are certaine and necessarie, and cannot be preuented, or things which are subiect to chaunce, and haue no certaintie at all: but of such things counsell is taken, which are electiue, and incident into humane affaires: herein then first Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophels counsell faileth, because he giueth counsell in a thing impossible: God had determined, that Dauids kingdome should be established. 2. The meanes in delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration should be honest, but these which he propoundeth, are most dishonest. 3.

                  <p>3. Now the speciall cause, why Achitophel is thus bent against Dauid, was for that hee ambitiously aspired to honour and riches: as he was reputed a wise counseller, so now he taketh vpon him to be the Captaine and leader of Abshaloms armie, that he might every way grow great, and in high reputation with Abshalom and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Hebrewes giue another reason of his hatred against Dauid, because of Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba, which is touched before, c. 16. qu. 11.</p>

                  <p>1. Chushai verie wisely doth not discommend Achitophels counsell in generall, least he might haue beene thought to speake of enuie, or be suspected as a dissembler: but he doth <hi>(at this time)</hi> onely take exception to his counsell, as giuing him the praise of a wise counseller at other times. <hi>Mart.

Chushai verie wisely among other suggestions, which were improbable, mingleth diuerse things which are true, as v. 8. that his father was a valiant man, and expert in warre, and of great courage: for he knew, without the inserting of some things euidently true, hee should hardly perswade the rest. <hi>Mart.</hi> 4.

He is warie also and circumspect: for though his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell were approoued, yet he would not trust Abshalom; hee might thinke his minde might alter, and therefore hee sendeth word presently vnto Dauid. v. 15.</p>

                  <head>4. <hi>Quest.</hi> Of the seuerall and particular points of Chushai his counsell.</head>
                  <p>First, Chushai doth infringe Achitophels counsell by fiue seuerall arguments. 1. He alleadgeth that Dauid was himselfe a valiant man, and the rest of his people, that were with him. 2. And beside their ordinarie valour, beeing thus suddenly assaulted, they would be so much the more fierce, as a beare robbed of his whelpes: not <hi>her whelpes,</hi> as <hi>B.G.L.S.</hi> for the word <hi>dobh</hi> is put in the masculine, as is euident by the participle <hi>shacul</hi> put in the masculine: for the hee beare, as well as the shee doth helpe to hatch vp their young, and both doe rage, when their whelpes are taken away: <hi>Borrh.</hi> 3. Thy father is an expert warrier, and a warie man, he hath his watch, he will not lodge as a common souldier with the rest, but will withdraw himselfe. 4. Hee vrgeth the inconueniencie of the place, <hi>hee is hid in some caue,</hi> so that their labour should be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in seeking him. 5. Hee sheweth the daunger, that if they should presently ioyne battell in the night, if but a few of Absalons men should be slaine, it would be noised, that al his forces were discomfited. <hi>Mar.</hi> And in this maner <hi>Chushai</hi> shewed the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Achitophels counsell.</p>
                  <p>2. Then hee commeth to giue contrarie aduise: in euerie point opposing himselfe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18791:57"/>
to Achitophel. 1. Whereas Achitophel had aduised to follow after Dauid presently that night, Chushai would haue some further time taken till more forces might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together. 2. Achitophel required but 12. thousand; Chushai would haue all the people gathered together, as the sand of the sea in multitude. 3. Achitophel would goe himselfe as Captaine of the armie, but Chushai perswadeth Abshalom to goe in his owne person. 4. Achitophel pretended to take the King his father onely, v. 2. but Chushai sheweth a course to be taken, that neither hee nor any one of his men should be left: <hi>Borrh.</hi> 5. And the better to perswade, hee sheweth the facilitie of this enterprise: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ow easily they shall vanquish him, either in the field, by falling vpon him, as the dew in multitude, or if he get himselfe within a citie, they will pull it with ropes, that is, engines of warre fastened with ropes into the riuer, that is, the ditches and trenches filled with water, which enuironed the walled townes. <hi>Mar.</hi>

                  <head>5. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 14. Of the approbation of Chushai his counsell before Achitophels.</head>
                  <p>1. By this example we see, that it is not enough to haue good counsell propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but it is necessarie to haue a good iudgement to discerne of counsells which is the best: Achitophel gaue here most daungerous, and pernicious counsell, but Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalom was blinded, that he saw not, what was good for himselfe. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. It is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the good counsell of Achitophel, not that it was simply good, for the Lord then would not haue destroyed it; but it was good and profitable for Abshalom, not that any thing indeed is good and profitable, which is not honest, but this is so said according to the phrase and speach of men, which vse to call those things good, which are commodious and profitable. 3. This came of God, that Achitophels counsel should be reiected: so that Chushai can not be here accused, <hi>mendacij &amp; simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis improbae,</hi> of lying and wicked dissembling, it beeing by Gods direction. <hi>Borrh.</hi> 4. And the end is shewed, why the Lord destroied the counsell of Achitophel, that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalom might be punished: who was guiltie of two horrible sinnes, rebellion and parricide intended against his father, and incest in the highest degree: therefore he was worthily punished, and by Chushai his counsell, hee was brought into that battell, where he was slaine.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. If Chushai were not sworne to keepe secret this counsell, therein there was no offence at all: nay he had sinned, if hee had not reuealed it, seeing the king and the commonwealth were now in great daunger: otherwise it is the part of counsellers to be faithfull in keeping to themselues the counsells of the kingdome:<note place="margin">In ff. de re mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. l. omni.</note> by the Ciuill law it was made death, to betraie the secrets of the state, especially in warlike and militarie affaires: <hi>Papinus</hi> is commended in the Romane Histories, because hee would not reueale to his mother, beeing but a child, the secret consultations of the Senate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yea though Chushai had taken an oath to be secret in this case, he might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully breake his oath: seeing it was an vnlawfull oath against the glorie of God, and tending to the ruine and subuersion of the Commonwealth. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>1. The Preists within the citie, Zadok and Abiathar could not themselues goe forth of the citie, without suspition, the gates beeing kept and watched, but they sent a maid with the message vnto their sonnes, that waited in the field, of whose fidelitie they had experience: so Dauids safetie depended here vpon the faithfulnesse of a maid: God many times vseth weake meanes to deliuer his seruants by. 2. This matter is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by a young man, not (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith) by Abshaloms horsemen, as the Deuill neuer wanteth instruments in such case<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to worke mischiefe. 3. But by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the messengers escaped, and were hid in a drie pit, where it seemeth there was small store of water, such an one, as that was, into which Iosephs brethren let him downe: which beeing couered with a cloth whereon ground corne was spread, by the wife of the house, was not discerned: the woman making a present excuse (as that sex

Thus, although that God had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely determined, that Dauids kingdome should be confirmed, and the Lord had promised him by his Prophet Nathan, that hee should not die: yet all cautelous meanes, and circumspection is vsed of euery side, that Gods decree might take place: for though wee be sure of Gods fauour, yet the meanes must not be neglected.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>R. Dauid Kimhi</hi> thinketh hee was an Israelite: but the text saith, that he was of Rabbath of the children of Ammon.</p>

                  <p>1. Dauid is persecuted of his sonne, and his nephew Amasa his sisters sonne is the Captaine of the host against him: he findeth more fauour at the hands of strangers, euen of the Ammonites, which had beene his enemies, then of his owne kinred: as Christ was receiued of the Samaritans, when the Iewes reiected him. <hi>Mart.</hi> 2. Their mercie is much to be commended in these three respects: they minister releefe vnto Dauid vnasked, they come of themselues, Shebi, Machir, Barzillai: <hi>Mart.</hi> and they succour Dauid in great extremitie, when the people were both hungrie and thirstie, v. 29. and at such a time, as was most daungerous, the conspiracie against Dauid bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so strong. 3. And this is worthie to be considered, that such a victorious and rich King as Dauid was, now hath not a bed to lie on, or any earthen vessell to wash his hands in; for all these things were brought him: which is a mirrhor for Princes to see the vncertaintie of their estate, and how soone their honour may be laid in the dust. 4. And herein Dauid was a type of the true Dauid, who in the dayes of his flesh was hungrie, wearie, thirstie, and ministred vnto by others: <hi>Pellican.</hi>

                  <p>THey come vnto him partly with those his freinds, which brought him victualls, c. 17.28. partly the tribes of Ruben, Gad, and Manasses, which inhabited beyond Iordan came flocking vnto Dauid, for these reasons: 1. They abhorred such vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall disobedience in the sonne against the father. 2. They were more remote from the Court, and loued the King the better. 3. And beeing farre off, they were not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and entised with Abshaloms flatterie, as the other were. <hi>Pellican.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. They knew that Dauid was the man, that was sought for, as Achitophel had said before, that they would smite him alone, c. 17.2. and therefore they will haue him stay at home. <hi>Pellican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Hushai had giuen counsell, that Achitophel should goe in person, because the Lord had determined to bring vpon him destruction, c. 11.14. so it falleth out by Gods direction, that Dauid should not goe into the battell, that hee might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <p>1. Some expound it thus, <hi>for there are about tenne thousand of vs: Vatab.</hi> but beside that, there is no certaintie of the number, which <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, exceeded not fowre thousand: in this sense it hath small coherence with the words before going, <hi>though halfe of vs were dead, they would not passe for vs.</hi> 2. Some of the Hebrewes doe thus vnderstand it, <hi>though ten thousand such as we should be slain, they would not care:</hi> but here beside that these words <hi>should be slaine,</hi> are not in the text, this in effect they said before, <hi>if halfe of vs should be dead,</hi> how many soeuer they were. 3. Others thus, <hi>though as we are now we should be tenne thousand: Iun.</hi> that is, ten times so many as we are, they would not care: but if this were spoken by way of comparison, their meaning should be, if they were tenne thousand times more, not ten times more. 4. Therefore I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the vsuall reading, <hi>bur,</hi> thou art <hi>as tenne thousand of vs,</hi> by the enterlacing of these words, <hi>thou art</hi>: for beside that most interpreters consent herein, the <hi>Chald. Septuag. Latin. Pagnin. Pellic. Borrh.

                  <p>5. Now they say, Dauid was as ten thousand; 1. both because his counsell, and the efficacie of his prayers would stand them in as much stead as ten thousand: <hi>Pellic.</hi> 2. and in respect of his dignitie and excellencie, he was worthie so to bee esteemed. <hi>Borrh.</hi> 3. as also in respect of his enemies, who had rather haue his life, then the liues of tenne thousand: <hi>Iun.</hi> 4. and the commonwealth should sustaine greater losse by his death, then if ten thousand of them were slaine. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, there were about foure thousand of them, and not aboue: but that is not like, because Dauid appointed captaines ouer hundreds, and ouer thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands; and beside ranged his host into three battells, v. 2. this sheweth that his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was greater then of foure thousand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. It may be also coniectured, that they were 20. thousand, because they made mention of the halfe part of them before, and now giuing this instance of tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18791:59"/>
to the which they preferre Dauid, it may be supposed that to be the halfe part; <hi>sic fere Pellic.</hi> But this opinion is refused for the reason before alleadged.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wherefore, as their number is like not to haue beene so small as of foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, so neither is it probable it was so great as of ten or twentie thousand: I therefore take the middle scantling; there might be some sixe thousand, or somewhat more, but vnder ten: to each of the three wings two thousand or thereabout might be assigned: for if the number had been so great, the victorie had not beene so glorious: and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids host consisted most of his domesticall followers and friends, and therefore they are called his seruants, v. 7.</p>

Ioab had good experience of Absalom alreadie, whome he had twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to his father, and still broke his faith, and therefore had no hope of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement. 2.

                  <p>1. Some thinke, that whereas it is said before, c. 14.27. that Absalom had three sonnes and a daughter, that all his children were now dead: <hi>sic Geneuens.</hi> but it is not necessarie to thinke, that all of them were taken away, but onely his sonnes, as the words of the text are, <hi>for he said, I haue no sonne, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Iosephus is of opinion, that his sonnes were not dead alreadie, but he prouided, if they should chance to die without issue, that by this pillar he should be remembred: but the text is plaine, that they were dead at this time, as the Chalde well expresseth, <hi>non est mihi filius superstes, &amp;c.</hi> I haue no sonne left. 3.

                  <p>It is without question, that Ahimaaz was not ignorant of Absaloms death: for Ioab had yeilded that as a reason, v. 20. why he would not send him with the message to the King, because the kings son was dead. But Ahimaaz of purpose concealed it for these reasons. 1. Because as before he had brought heauie newes to Dauid, c. 17.20. so now he desireth to bring good newes. <hi>Bor.</hi> 2. He would not all at once tell the king of his death, least he might haue bin oppressed with grief, but leaues him in suspence, that he might by little and little digest his sonnes death. 3. Ahimaaz did it also in respect of

himselfe; for he knew that as the euil tidings is not welcome, so neither is the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thereof accepted; like as the patient doth loath the very cup out of the which he drinketh his bitter potion. 4. By this then we are taught these points of good discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: first, that we put off the relation of euill newes to others, where we are not vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by necessitie: secondly, that when we doe tell hard newes, we should doe it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: for many vpon the sudden report of heauie things haue presently died. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

                  <p>1.

                  <p>1. He feared least his sonne dying in his sinne without repentance, died out of the fauour of God: his owne death he feared not, beeing assured that he should die in Gods fauour, and therefore he desired by his corporall death, that he had redeemed his sonnes life, that he might haue liued to repent him: <hi>Osiand.</hi> 2.

                  <p>1.

                  <p>1. Whereas they which before had left and forsaken the King, doe now striue, which should be the most forward in bringing him againe: beside the inconstancie and leuitie of the people here to be noted, Gods prouidence is to be considered in swaying the affections of the people toward Dauid, which were of late estraunged from him with so great hostilitie, that Dauid might acknowledge that his state and kingdome depended onely vpon God. <hi>Pellican.</hi> 2. The men of Iudah alleadge two reasons in their defense, both because they were nearer in kinred to Dauid, then the Israelites, and for that their affection was more sincere: for they respected not their owne profit, neither were hired or waged to doe that they did, but came of a dutifull mind, v. 42. the men of Israel stood partly vpon their number, they were tenne for one, partly vpon the prioritie of their counsell, they first made the motion to bring backe the king, v. 11. 3. The men of Iudah were sharper in words, then the men of Israel, both being confident vpon their cause, (as hauing the better part) and the kings fauour, <hi>Osiand.</hi> as beeing emboldened with the guard of Dauids souldiers, called his men, v. 41. <hi>Iun.</hi> But this their insolent speach toward Israel, and the neglecting of them, bread a greater inconuenience afterward, and gaue occasion of falling away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the Israelites, as the next Chapter sheweth.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That a man is not bound to render the matrimoniall debt, where the faith of wedlocke is broken, by any adulterous or incestuous act, it is cleare by the example of Iacob, who is thought not to haue companied with Billah after Ruben had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted incest with her: for Iacob saith his bed was defiled, Gen. 49.3. <hi>Borrh.</hi> So also Dauid vpon iust cause refrained from the companie of those concubines. 2. But it is an harder question, whether the husband or the Magistrate may enioyne vnto the offending wife perpetuall widdowhood after the husbands death: which I rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to thinke ought not to be for these reasons. 1. Because the husband hath no longer power ouer his wife, then while he liueth; as the Apostle sheweth, Rom. 7.2. <hi>If the man be dead, shee is deliuered from the power of the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againe, this were to denie vnto the weake partie the remedie against fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is marriage, and so they might be occasioned to liue in sinne still: and therefore the Apostle alloweth euery woman to haue her husband, 1. Cor. 7. c. 3. It is against nature to inhibite the procreation of children, in restraining women from marriage apt for procreation: these two latter reasons are vrged by the law of <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> made on the behalfe of widdowes, not to be enioyned widdowhood:<note place="margin">Cod lib. 6. tit. 42. leg. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. Herein the Ciuill law seemeth to be more equall, then the Canons, which decree thus: <hi>Adultera non nubat, etiamsi mortuus fuerit vir eius, &amp;c.</hi> the adulteresse shall not marrie no not when her husband is dead, but doe penance all the daies of her life: <hi>Caus.</hi> 32. <hi>qu.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 22. likewise, if a man had lien with his wiues sister, they did both <hi>permanere sine spe coniugij,</hi> continue without hope of marriage: <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 23. so was it also decreed in the Triburian counsell, that if one lay with his mother in law, <hi>neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ad coniugium peruenire potest:</hi> neither of them can come to marriage: <hi>Ibid. c.</hi> 29. But the Apostle enioyned no such thing to the incestuous young man, that had taken his fathers wife, 1. Cor. 5.1. but onely tooke a course that he should be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Likewise the imperiall constitution ordained, that, if a man gaue a legacie to his wife, vpon condition she should not marrie, that she would enioy the gift, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she did marrie: and in the same imperiall constitution, the Iulian law is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18791:63"/>
that gaue the widow libertie to marrie againe, taking an oath, that she did it for procreation sake: the law saith, <hi>tale iuramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conquiescat, &amp; lex Iulia cedat, &amp;c.</hi> such an oath shall cease, and the Iulian law giue place: and libertie is there giuen, for the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow without taking such oath, to betake her to second marriage.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But the example of Iepthah is vrged, that according to the opinion of the most and best Interpreters, did consecrate his daughter to perpetuall virginitie: to the which it is answered, first that Iepthah in so doing shewed himselfe ignorant of the law, which alloweth the redemption both of male and female for money, Leuit. 27.4. and therefore Iepthah saying he could not goe backe, declareth his ignorance of the lawe in that point: secondly, Iepthahs daughter herein consented to her father, to become a votarie and perpetuall virgin vnto God, so that it was voluntarie in her, and not compulsiue.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And touching this example of Dauid, in sequestring his concubines during their life: these considerations are to be weighed. 1. That men had greater power then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their wiues then now: for Moses, as our Sauiour saith, for the hardnesse of heart allowed them to make a bill of diuorcement. 2. There is a difference betweene a wife and a concubine: that may be enioyned a concubine, which is not to be imposed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wife: the one beeing as free, the other bound. 3. This was a particular and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall case concerning the King: these concubines offended two wayes, both in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting incest, and in violating the Maiestie of the King: for both which they were worthie of death: wherein though Dauid shewed them clemencie, yet it was fit that otherwise an example should be made of them. 4. The women themselues were asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be seene abroad, but it seemeth were contented to lead a priuate life, and so to be sequestred from the world during their life.</p>

Rather Dauid vnderstandeth Ioab the Captaine of the host: <hi>Genev.</hi> but that is not so like, for he was Abishai his brother: and at that time Abishai had the charge of the armie, and therefore in that behalfe Ioab can not be said to be his Lord. 3.

                  <head>1. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 1. Of the time when this famine was sent vpon the land.</head>
                  <p>1. THe generall opinion is, that this famine followed immediately after those ciuill warres ended with Absalom and Sheba: <hi>bella fame excipiuntur,</hi> the warres en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with famine: <hi>Borrh.</hi> so also <hi>Pellican,</hi> with others: but that this cannot be, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by that place. c. 15.7. where Absaloms rebellion falleth out toward the end of the fortieth yeare: which must be vnderstood of the raigne of Dauid, as hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that place: for Dauid raigned but 40. yeares in all: but by this account, if the three yeares famine followed after Absaloms rebellion, Dauid must haue raigned 43. yeares and aboue. 2. This is the onely doubt, how all these things set downe in this booke from c. 15. to c. 21. could fall out in so short a time, in the ende of the fortieth yeare of Dauids raigne: But this may easily bee answered: for Absaloms rebellion continued not long, and immediately vpon that followed the rebellion of Shebah: so that all these things might very well fall out in the compasse of not many moneths. 3. So then the more probable opinion is, that these stories of the three yeares famine, c. 21. and of numbring the people, c. 24. are transposed; as the like is apparant in the 3. last chapters of the booke of the Iudges; the order of time then is not obserued, in the setting downe of these histories: for the Scripture rather respecteth the coherence of the matter and argument, then the consequence of time: <hi>sic fere Iunius.</hi>

Some doe read, that Dauid sought the Lord: <hi>Vatab. Geneuens.</hi> but to seeke the face of the Lord, is somewhat more then to seeke the Lord. 3. Some, <hi>he consulted with the oracle of God: Latin.</hi> expressing the sense in part, but not wholly: for beside that he receiued answer from the oracle of God, he went to the place of his presence. 4. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh that Dauid consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God by the Prophets, and by them receiued an answer. 5. But it is rather to be vnderstood not of that extraordinarie reuelation by Prophets, but of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meanes, which was prescribed to aske counsell by, which was by the high Priest, who gaue iudgement by his Vrim; as the Lord himselfe appointeth, Numb. 27.21. <hi>Iun.

                  <head>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> Wherefore this famine was sent, and of the causes thereof.</head>
                  <p>1. Although this famine was caused by drought, as is euident, v. 10. that Rizpah tooke this as a signe, that the wrath of God was appeased, when the raine fell: yet Dauid considereth an other ouerruling cause, the prouidence of God, and therefore he resorteth vnto him by prayer: so faithfull men doe see further into the cause of Gods iudgements, then naturall and worldly wise men commonly doe: <hi>Borrh.</hi> 2. The cause which procured this punishment, was for the great iniustice and crueltie shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the Gibeonites, whom Saul oppressed contrarie to the oath made vnto them by Ioshua, Iosh. 9. 3. Beside, herein God punished the people also for their sinne: they for their thrice rebelling against Dauid their lawfull gouernour, once vnder Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth, againe vnder Absalom, thirdly in conspiring with Shebah, suffer three years famine: <hi>Pellic.</hi> and by this meanes also the Lord taketh occasion to cut off the posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Saul, least they might still haue practised against Dauids house and kingdome, which the Lord had promised should continue: <hi>Borrh.</hi> 5. So then by this example we see that famine is sent as a iust punishment of sinne: as in Germanie for gluttonie, and drunkennesse; in Italie for filthie and vncleane lust: as also that sometime for the sinne of one wicked man, many temporally are punished. <hi>Osiand.</hi>

                  <head>4. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 1. Why, and at what time Saul slew the Gibeonites.</head>
                  <p>1. Some thinke that he slewe them of malice against the Priests, when they were put to the sword in Nob; because the Gibeonites were seruants to the Tabarnacle, for the cleauing of wood and drawing of water; but he is said to doe it of zeale, vers. 5. therefore not of malice, and consequently not then, nor at that time: <hi>Iun.</hi> 2. Some thinke, that he did it of zeale to the Israelites, to conuay vnto them the inheritance, lands, and possessions of the Gibeonites, that they might haue more commodious dwelling: <hi>Vatab. Osiand.</hi> but this had beene rather of a couetous minde, then of zeale. 3. Some thinke that his zeale was herein, because they had in Ioshuahs time consened and deceiued the Elders of Israel, therefore he would be reuenged of them now: <hi>Borr.</hi> But it is not like, that after so long a time he would punish them for that error which Ioshuah and the Elders of Israel then pardoned; when it was first committed, and fresh in memorie. 4. Therefore it is more probable, that when Saul of zeale did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell sorcerers and witches out of Israel, that vnder that pretence, because the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and Cananites were giuen to such deuillish studies, he also sought to root out the Gibeonites, who were a remnant of the Cananites and Amorites: especially for that they were charged to root out the Cananites from among them: <hi>Iun.</hi> 5. By the which we learne, that zeale without knowledge, and a good intention without warrant from Gods word, is not acceptable vnto God. <hi>Borrh.</hi>

But it is more likely, that because the Cananites were mingled together, and the Amorites were the more valiant people, that the rest had the denomination from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the more principall: as Gen. 15.16. the <hi>wickednesse of the Amorites is not yet full:</hi> where the rest of the Cananites are vnderstood by the Amorites, as the more principall part: <hi>Mercer.</hi> So aso Ezech. 16.2. the Prophet saith, <hi>thy kinred is of the land of Canaan, thy father was an Amorite, thy mother an Hittite</hi>: by the which it is euident, that the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nations of the Cananites were mixed together, and ioyned in affinitie, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morite as the predominant. And further, it seemeth that the Amorites and Hivites did more specially commerce and conuerse together; as Iacob speaking of Shechem, saith he got it out of the hand of the Amorite, Gen. 48.22. whereas pecularly it did belong to Hemor, who was an Hiuite, Gen. 34.2. as there the Hiuite is named to be an Amorite, so also in this place.</p>

Further, in temporall chasticements it is not vniust with God to punish the sinnes of the parents in the children: both because euerie man hath sufficient matter in himselfe in respect both of his originall and actuall sinnes for Gods temporall iudgements to worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and for that by the example of such corrections vpon the posteritie of the wicked other receiue admonition, to take heede least by their sinne they bring the curse of God vpon them, and their seede: <hi>Osiand.</hi> 3.

Some giue this solution, that this lawe did onely bind the Hebrewes, and not the Gibeonites: <hi>Osiand.</hi> but that is not like,<note place="margin">Reconcil.</note> for the Proselytes of the Gentiles that were conuerted to their religion, were bound to the same lawes, Exod. 12.49. 2. Therefore I thinke rather, that as this was reuealed to Dauid by extraordinarie reuelation from God; so they had also speciall direction, that the bodies should hang till God should shew himselfe to be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: which may appeare by this, that Rispah waited till the raine came, which she knew by the oracle of God giuen to Dauid, to be a signe that God was appeased: <hi>sic Pellican.

                  <p>1. The most thinke, and so read, that <hi>Harapha</hi> was the proper name of the gyant, father vnto those fowre gyants here named: <hi>Ar. Pag. Lat.</hi> 2.

There was then yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a generation of those gyants, and men of great stature, that were before the flood: as <hi>Plinie</hi> also writeth, that in his time he sawe a man called <hi>Gabbara,</hi> brought out of Arabia, vnder the Empire of <hi>Claudius,</hi> who was 9. foot and nine inches high: he hath also a stranger report of a man found in Creta, in the opening of a monument by an earthquake, that was 46. cubites long: <hi>ex Borrh.</hi> And as some men exceede in stature, so others haue beene found as little, as <hi>Borrh.</hi> in the same place maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a perfit man, that was but a cubite, that is, halfe a yard high, that was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in a parrets cage. 4. But let it be further obserued, that these gyants for the most part, were found among the vncircumcised nations, that were enemies to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both that God might shew his power in beating downe the pride of such as vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselues in their owne strength, and that his owne people should not haue any confidence in flesh and blood. 5.

And as Dauid was a type of Christ, so many things in this Psalme are to bee vnderstood of Christ: for here he prophesieth of the passion, resurrection, ascension of Christ, of the reiection of the Iewes, and the calling of the Gentiles: as the Apostle, Rom. 15.9. alleadgeth the 49. vers. of this Psalme, <hi>I will praise thee among the nations, &amp;c.</hi> to proue the vocation of the Gentiles: <hi>Osiand.</hi> 3. But there may be a double errour committed in the interpretation of this Psalme: if either all be historically applied to Dauid, or all mystically vnderstood of Christ: therefore what is historically set downe, must be historically applyed to Dauid, and what is figuratiuely vttered, must bee also figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely expounded of the Messiah. <hi>Borrh.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Whereas Dauid saith, with the <hi>pure thou wilt shew thy selfe pure,</hi> we must not thus think, that first man is pure, and then the Lord sheweth himselfe to be so toward man: for the beginning of our purenesse and goodnesse is from God: as our Blessed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our saith to his Disciples,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Yee haue not chosen mee, but I haue chosen you:</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.10.</note> herein is loue, <hi>not that we loued him, but that hee loued vs:</hi> therefore first God maketh vs pure, and putteth his spirit into vs. This saying therefore must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, not of our first election and vocation, which followeth thereupon, but of the fruites of our regeneration, and sanctification: that after our hearts are purified by faith, and so we bring forth the pure and acceptable workes and fruits of faith, the Lord in mercie crowneth and rewardeth them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet the goodnesse of our workes is not the cause, that the Lord sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe pure and mercifull: but it is the condition, which the Lord requireth, and an order, which God hath set, that his children should shew their obedience, before they haue their reward.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But in peruerse workes this difference is not obserued: for the wicked haue the prioritie, they first shew their frowardnes, before they feele Gods iustice: and the reason of the difference is this, because the euilnes and peruersnes of man is from his owne corruption, but the beginning of goodnes is from God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Againe, these sayings must be so vnderstood, not that God presently rewardeth the obedience of his seruants, or punisheth the peruersenesse of the wicked: both the one may a long time be afflicted, and the other prosper in this world: but the Lord in his due time will performe both the one and the other, either in this world, or in the next. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>Here Dauid speaketh as a type and figure of Christ, to whom this propheticall speach is most properly applied: as may appeare by these reasons. 1. The former say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, v. 50. <hi>I will praise thee among the nations,</hi> S.

                  <head>1. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 1. Why these are said to be the last words of Dauid.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Chalde</hi> paraphrast seemeth so to vnderstand these words, because they should be fulfilled in the last times: but then many of Dauids Psalmes beside might be called his last words, which doe prophecie of the kingdome of the Messiah, which should be reuealed in the latter age of the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some giue this sense, they are called the last words, because Dauid doth make this as his last will and Testament, which he chaunged not, though he spake and did many things after: it was a confession of his constant and vnchaungable faith touching the Messiah, which he held vnto the end: <hi>Mar. Osiand.</hi> But in this sense many of the first words of Dauid, as that prophecie of the Messiah Psal. 2. might be called his last words, because Dauid held that faith to the end.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Diuerse doe take them to be Dauids last words in respect of the rest of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: this was made last of them all. <hi>Vatab. Borrh. Genevens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But I rather thinke with <hi>Iunius,</hi> that these were the last solemne words which Dauid vttered, after he had charged his sonne Salomon, and commended him vnto God, by that prayer Psalm. 72. herein imitating Iaacob, and Moses, who beeing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to die blessed the 12.

                  <head>2. <hi>Quest. v.</hi> 1. Of the fowre titles, which Dauid here giueth himselfe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Dauid nameth himselfe by his father Ishai, as not beeing ashamed of his meane parentage, and the obscuritie of his familie, from the which he was aduanced to the kingdome; <hi>Osiand.</hi> As also he maketh speciall mention of him, because he was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, out of whose stocke and familie should come for the present the Kings of Israel, and for the time to come the Blessed Messiah, as Isai. 11.1. <hi>There shall come a rod forth of the stocke of Ishai. Borrh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, he setteth forth his dignitie, he was set vp on high, that is, exalted to the regall dignitie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His vocation also is expressed, the Annointed of the God of Iaacob: the <hi>Latine</hi> readeth, <hi>cui constitutum est de Christo, &amp;c.</hi> to whom it was appointed concerning Christ: that is, who was assured and confirmed concerning the Messiah to come of his seed: <hi>Osiand.</hi> But the words in the originall will not beare this interpretation: for there is onely expressed the <hi>Messiah,</hi> not, <hi>of</hi> or <hi>concerning</hi> the Messiah; he was then the Annointed of God, to the kingdom of Israel, but therin also a type of the Messiah the verie Anointed of God for the euerlasting kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The last title is taken from his propheticall gift of singing: he was most sweet in the songs of Israel: in making songs for the vse of Israel, which they vsed to sing in the Tabernacle to the praise of God: <hi>Borrh. Iun.</hi> and they were sweet, <hi>non solum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positione &amp; modis,</hi> not in the manner of making onely and measure, but in their force and efficacie; for as they were effectuall to allaie Sauls maladie, so they are most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to a perplexed and troubled conscience. <hi>Mart.

                  <p n="1">1. Some referre these words, <hi>bearing rule ouer men, beeing iust, and ruling in the feare of God,</hi> vnto God himselfe: that the strength of Israel, the iust ruler and gouernour, God himselfe thus said vnto Dauid, that the Messiah that Iust and righteous King should take flesh of his seed: <hi>Osiand.</hi> but if this be vnderstood of God that speaketh, then nothing is expressed, that here should be spoken vnto Dauid.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some doe referre it to the Messiah, that the Lord here spake to Dauid and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him, that the Messiah should come of him, who should gouerne the people vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly in the feare of God. <hi>Chalde, Pellican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But it is better vnderstood of Dauid: not that it was so much a prophecie or prediction of him by Samuel, that he should gouerne the people in iustice, <hi>Vatablus:</hi> for Dauid failed diuersly in his gouernment: but it was rather a commandement, which the Lord gaue vnto Dauid, that he should both in ciuill matters gouerne the people iustly and vprightly, and for religion, in the feare of God: and as this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on Dauids behalfe: so the Lord for his part promiseth vnto Dauid a sure house, as it followeth in the next words, v. 4. <hi>Iun.</hi> But herein Dauids gouernment beeing iust but in part, and in some measure, was a type and figure of the most perfect kingdom of the Messiah: whereof the Prophet speaketh, Psal. 45.6. the scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of righteousnesse.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Some make this the sense: that here are two similitudes briefly put together: the one taken from the bright morning Sunne shine without clouds, the other, from the Sunneshine mingled with clouds and raine, which causeth the grasse to grow; to the first Dauids house is compared, not to the second, which is an imperfect light cast o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and obscured with clouds: <hi>Vat.

                  <p n="2">2. Therefore the better exposition is, that here are two similitudes produced to the same effect, to set forth the flourishing state of Dauids house, which shall be like vnto the morning sunne without clouds, and the growing grasse after raine. <hi>Iun. Borr. Osiand.</hi>

But it is euident that this particle <hi>(lo)</hi> is neuer vsed in the Hebrew, but negatiuely: and so is it taken in that place giuen in instance: which is read thus, <hi>not so, but thou didst laugh:</hi> and beside there the words are <hi>lo, chi,</hi> not <hi>chi lo,</hi> as here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some reading here negatiuely, expound thus: <hi>so shall not mine house be,</hi> that is, not like the grasse, which groweth speedily, and soone fadeth, and withereth againe: <hi>Mar. Genevens.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Osiander</hi> following the Latine translater, thus interpreteth, <hi>neither is my house so with God, that hee should make with mee an euerlasting couenant</hi>: that is, I acknowledge that it is not of my worthinesse, that God should make such an euerlasting couenant with me, that the Messiah should come of my seed: so also <hi>Emmanuel Sa.</hi> But this seemeth rather to be the reddition to the former similitude, which otherwise were

The <hi>Chalde,</hi> whom <hi>Borrhaius</hi> subscribeth vnto, deriueth the sense to that which followeth, v. 6. <hi>the wicked shall be as thornes:</hi> that Dauids whole desire is, that the wicked doe not grow: but beside that this was not Dauids whole happinesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that the house of the wicked should not flourish, but rather that his owne house might prosper: this should be put out of place, seeing hitherto Dauid extendeth the first similitude of the prosperitie of his owne house: and then in the next place, he commeth to speake of the vnprosperous state of the wicked.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Latine translator, whom <hi>Emman.

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Iunius</hi> thus openeth the words; though for the present mine house doe not grow and increase, as was before by those two similitudes set forth, vers. 4. because of my sinne, yet my whole health or saluation and desire is in the accomplishment of Gods promise: hee then thus readeth: <hi>my whole saluation and desire is therein, seeing hee doth not cause it to grow.</hi> But in this sense Dauid should seeme to complaine, that hee sawe not the accomplishment of Gods promises toward him: where in his former song he celebrated the praise of God, for shewing such mercie and louing kindnes toward him, c. 22.51. and for rewarding him according to his vprightnes, v. 21.</p>

In that the names and acts of these worthie men are not suppressed, but committed to memorie, it sheweth that the Lord will not forget the faithfull seruice and labour of his Saints. 5.

But it will be obiected, that if Dauid were at Ierusalem, or neere the fort of Sion, he could not haue beene driuen to such extremitie, as to want water to quench his thirst. <hi>Ans.</hi> Indeed some thinke, that Dauid longed for this water, beeing weary and thirstie: <hi>Vatab. Genevens.</hi> but that is not like, for Dauid could not haue wanted water, but all the host must be in distresse beside, which extremitie Dauid was not dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto in any battel against the Philistims, after he was established in the kingdom, that we read of: therefore it is more like, that Dauid was <hi>captus desiderio, &amp;c.</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of that water, not of any such necessitie; but because it was excellent for the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and wholesomenesse, and preferred before other waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p n="3">3. An other doubt is, that it is said, 1. Chron. 11.15. that these three went downe to a rocke to Dauid in the caue: how could Dauid be then in the caue, if he were on the rock. <hi>Ans.</hi> The preposition is, <hi>ghal,</hi> which may be as well interpreted, they went down vpon a rocke, or by a rocke, or to a rocke: <hi>Iunius</hi> readeth, they descended from a rocke: or the caue of Adullam, might be in the hollow of a rocke.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Further, there seemeth to be some contradiction in the storie: for vers. 13. it is said, the Philistims pitched in the valley of Rephaim, and v. 14. that the garison of the Philistims was then in Bethlehem: the places are thus reconciled,<note place="margin">Reconcil</note> the maine battell or host of the Philistims was encamped in the valley of Rephaim: but some garrison of them did beset the way and passages toward Bethlehem. <hi>Iun.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. His second exploit was in slaying a lyon, which fact is amplified by two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: both of the place, he slewe him in the middes of a pit, where the roome was streight: and in the time of snowe, when lyons are most fierce, by reason they want their pray, the sheepe and cattell beeing then shut vp in time of hard weather: <hi>Mart. Iun.</hi> This may seeme to haue been too bold and rash an enterprise: but it is like that this lyon was hurtfull to all that countrey, and vsed to pray vpon their cattell: and as <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, the lyon beeing fallen into a pit, roared, and so might be fearefull al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to all the inhabitants thereabout.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the third place he killed an Egyptian of great stature: which fact is also set forth by these three circumstances: he was of great stature, euen fiue cubits high, his speare was as a weauers beame, and Benaiah came against him onely with a staffe, and tooke his speare out of his owne hand, and killed him therewith, 1.

Chron. 4.4. is there called Sibbecai: Zalman the Arhochite, is there Hilai: Cheleb is there Cheled: Hiddai not of the riuer, but of the valley of Gahash, is there Churai: Abi Alban the Arbathite, there Abiel: Asmaueth the Baochumite, there the Bachonu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, of Bachmini of Beniamin: Iashen, v. 32. there Hashem, v. 34.

                  <p n="2">2. Beside the difference of names, the number also doth varie: for here there are but thirtie in all beside Asahel: there are numbred 47. or thereabout. <hi>Iunius</hi> conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is, that all those there rehearsed after Vriah, sauing Zabad, v. 41. whom he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to come in place of Elika here mentioned, v. 25. (who might be slaine) were the captaines that kept the confines and borders of Israel.</p>

Chron. 11.27. is here called a Charadite of <hi>Charad,</hi> Iudg. 7.1. the other Shammah called an Hararite, v. 33. was the sonne of Shageh the Harite, 1.

                  <p>Whereas there are but 31. rehearsed with Asahel, beside the other fiue which make but 36. the doubt is, how the number of 37. is made vp.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh that there were in all 38. in which number it seemeth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth those three, whose valiant acts were before expressed, c. 21. <hi>Elhanan, Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bechai,</hi> and <hi>Ionathan:</hi> but the number cannot bee made vp with them, because they are here reckoned among the thirtie, and so they should be twice counted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>D. Kimhi</hi> thinketh that there are 36. beside Benaiah, and that he was none of the two rankes of threes, but is numbred beside them; but the text is euident, v. 22. that he was accounted among the three worthies of the second sort, though he were not reckoned among the first.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Vatablus</hi> his opinion is, that Asahel with the rest make 31. and that there were 6. worthies beside: but there are onely fiue worthies named beside Asahel: therefore he must be comprehended to make vp the sixe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Pet. Martyr</hi> thinketh, that either some one must bee supplyed of Dauids wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, or that the wanting of one is no great matter in the number. But it is neither like, that any here not named are numbred: and where a iust number is set downe in Scripture, we must not admit the least error or failing in the summe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Wherefore, this number of 37. is made vp with Ioab, who was the captaine of the rest: <hi>Kimhi</hi> thinketh that he is not named among them, because he was the cheife captaine: but it is so much the more like that he was not omitted. And whereas <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> coniectureth, that he is not set downe, because he had disgraced himselfe by those two treacherous murthers of Abner and Amasa, and made himselfe vnworthie of any memorie, that was no let, why his valiant acts should not be remembred: for here is mention made of Achitophel, whose son Eliam, was one of Dauids worthies. And beside honourable mention is made of Ioab, v. 18. Abishai is said to be the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Ioab. Therefore seeing Ioab is named in this chapter, and there is no other found to make the number of 37. and Ioab was also a valiant and worthie man, it is most probable, that he is included in the number. <hi>Iun.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>RVpertus</hi> thinketh that the anger of God was kindled against Israel, because of the iniurie done to Vriah, who is named immediately before in the last verse of the former chapter: but it seemeth by the words of the text, that it was some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sinne of the whole land: for it is said, <hi>the wrath of God was kindled against Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some thinke that the people had at diuerse times before sinned against God, in the dayes of Saul, and in ioyning with Absalom, and last of all in following of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah, c. 20. and that the Lord doth now punish them for all: But it seemeth it was some newe prouocation, whereby the wrath of God was againe and a fresh as it were kindled against Israel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There may therefore be two causes assigned specially of this great wrath: first the Israelites liuing now in ease and tranquilitie, abused it, <hi>&amp; defluebant luxu,</hi> and gaue themselues to riotous liuing: <hi>Mar.</hi> likewise hauing obtained so many victories against

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Iunius</hi> interpreteth this place by that 1. Chron. 21.1. that <hi>Sathan stood vp against Israel, and prouoked Dauid:</hi> which is certaine, that Sathan did here principally tempt Dauid vnto euill: but in this place the nominatiue case is rather to be sought in the words going before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But seeing the Scripture else where ascribeth as much vnto God, as Isai. 19.14. <hi>The Lord hath mingled among them the spirit of errors,</hi> and the same Prophet saith, c. 63.17. <hi>O Lord, why hast thou made vs to erre from thy wayes:</hi> we need not be afraid to speak as the Scripture doth, that the Lord stirred vp Dauid, as before c. 16. Dauid saith, that the Lord bid Shemei curse him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <head>3. <hi>Quest.</hi> Wherein Dauid sinned in causing the people to be numbred.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh, that Dauid offended herein, because he had forgotten in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the people to leuie the summe of halfe a sickle vpon euery one according to the law, Exod. 30. but this was not the reason, for the people were numbred againe by Moses, Numb. 1. and yet paied not that halfe sickle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some thinke it simply vnlawfull to number the people, wherein the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be <hi>innumerable</hi> as the starres of the skie, and the sand of the Sea: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it belonged vnto God onely to number that, which was innumerable: but this is not so, for they were there numbred by Moses, Exod. 38. Numb. 1. Numb. 26.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some iudge that Dauid purposed to haue imposed some taske vpon the people, and so he sinned in coueting: as <hi>Dion</hi> writeth of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> that he appointed a taske ouer all that pertained to the Romane Empire. But Ioab brought Dauid the summe of the people, yet no such imposition is mentioned so much as to haue beene intended.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Dauids fault was then first in entring into a needelesse action, wherof there was no cause, but onely Dauids curiositie: he would haue it done, <hi>that I may know, saith hee, the number of the people,</hi> v. 2. for the mustring of the people was vsed among the Romans, (which custom was first taken vp by <hi>Seruius Tullius</hi> the King) for these foure ends.</p>
                  <p>1. To know who were fit for warre: 2. to know euery ones substance, to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different rates: 3. that the people thereby might acknowledge their subiection: 4. and that a view might be taken of the peoples faults. But Dauid here propounded none of these ends.</p>
                  <p>1. Warre he had now none in hand. 2. Neither intended he to make any collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18791:74"/>
3. And they needed not by this meanes professe their subiection, seeing he was taken, and acknowledged of all for their King.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And they had other magistrates to watch ouer the peoples faults: the Leuites to instruct them, and the Elders to correct them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So then it is cleare that Dauids heart was lifted vp to reioyce in the number and strength of the people: for the which the Lord was angrie with him, and sent a plague among the people.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Rupertus</hi> maketh this numbring of the people a liuely shadow of the carnall Iewes, who trusted to the workes of the law, as Dauid here reioyceth in the multitude of men, and in the arme of flesh.</p>

                  <p>1. Hee sheweth that it belonged to God to increase the people, and that it was Dauids part thankefully to acknowledge Gods blessing therein: and not as it were to take vpon him Gods office, as though the people by beeing numbred could be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. <hi>Borrh.</hi> 2. And secretly hee insinuateth, that Dauid should take heed, least by this meanes the numbers of the people might be diminished, which he desireth God to multiplie, and increase.</p>
                  <p>3. Hee further insinuateth that there was no end of numbring the people: for they all professed alreadie to be Dauids seruants, 1. Chron. 21.3. and therefore to that end, they needed not to be numbred.</p>
                  <p>4. Further, he foretelleth that this would be an occasion of trespasse in Israel; <hi>ibid.</hi> and that God beeing thereby offended, would punish his people: not for that they were numbred without that leauie appointed by Moses, as <hi>Mart.</hi> for Moses himselfe did not alwaies leauie that summe when he numbred the people, but Ioabs heart gaue him, because this proceeded from pride and carnall confidence, that the Lord would punish it. <hi>Genevens.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then they turned about on the North side by <hi>Daen Iaan</hi> called simply <hi>Dan,</hi> Iosh. 19.47. and by the ground and fields of Zidon: for the citie the Cananites possessed still, as they did likewise Tyrus.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So they compassed all the West coast along from Tyrus by the cities of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites and Cananites.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And then turned Southward to Beersheba: Ioab was 4. moneths and two daies in taking this suruaie, whereas the spies, which Moses sent, Numb. 13. returned in 40. dayes: for they staied not in any place to take the number of the people, as Ioab here did.</p>

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:18791:74"/>2. Some thinke that Ioab thorough griefe gaue not vp the full number, which was taken, but as it is here: <hi>Genevens.</hi> in 1. Chron. 22. But the text saith, that Ioab gaue vp that number, 1. Chron. 21.5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Osiander</hi> thinketh that in the account of 800. thousand the principall onely are reckoned: but in the number of an 1100. thousand the whole multitude: but here the number of Iudah is greater, then that in the Chronicles by 30. thousand: it is not like, that in the one number the principall onely should be counted, in the other the whole companie.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some thinke that Ioab did make the number lesse then it was, least Dauid might haue beene lifted vp too much, after he knew the full number of the people, <hi>Emma. Sa.</hi> But it is said, 1. Chron. 21.5. that Ioab gaue vp the greater number also of Israel, and a lesse of Iudah: therefore this reason can not serue for both.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> thinketh it may be thus, because Ioab did not number the Leuites, nor the Beniaminites, and it may be also he had not mustred those, which were in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, that the greater number was made vp afterward with them: and for Iudah, hee thinketh that the iust summe was 470. thousand, which is made vp here iust 500. thousand, because it is not vnusuall in Scripture, to set downe a round and perfect number for a more readie account, though somewhat be wanting, as to make vp 70. thousand to an 100. thousand. But it is euident in the Chronicles, that euen in that great summe which Ioab gaue vp to Dauid, neither the Leuites nor Beniamin were counted; the summe then is not made out of them: and concerning the number of Iudah, it were much, that there wanting 30. thousand of an 100. thousand, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should set downe an 100. thousand.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Borrhaius</hi> saith, that whereas there is the oddes of 300. thousand betweene the number here rehearsed, and the other 1. Chron. 21. that in this smaller summe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie companies are not reckoned which serued by their turnes, 24. thousand eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moneth: which beeing multiplied by 12. according to the number of the moneths, maketh 288. thousand: then the Captaines set ouer them, which might haue euery one vnder his charge 24. maketh 12. thousand: and so the whole summe of 300. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand is made vp. Concerning Iudah, he thinketh that the number here is set downe, which was taken before the plague, the lesse number afterward: for there might die in the plague 30. thousand.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Iunius</hi> approoueth the first part of this last solution, touching the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the numbers of the people for Israel: for the ordinarie companies of 24. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, which were in a readinesse euery moneth by course, as is described 2.

                     </gap>nd hundreds, and other officers, which might make vp that summe of 300. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Iudah, it is not like, that there dying 70. thousand of the pestilence in all, 30. thousand, almost halfe that number, should be of Iudah. And beside, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was giuen vp before the plague.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Iunius</hi> maketh vp this number of 30. thousand, with the thirtie compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which belonged to the 30.

                  <p>1. Dauid had continued in this sinne aboue nine moneths, all the time that Ioab spent in numbring the people: but now the sinne beeing full and compleat, his heart smiteth him: <hi>Mart.</hi> It is the propertie of Sathan, to extenuate sinne in the beginning, but when it is committed, then he doth aggrauate it, the more to terrifie the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <hi>Osiand.</hi> 2.

repentance, when it pleaseth God to mooue it: <hi>Pellican.</hi> 3. <hi>Iosephus</hi> thinketh that this remorse was wrought in Dauid, <hi>Prophetis referentibus,</hi> diuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This smiting of Dauids heart, and confessing of his sinne, seemeth to haue beene in the night: for the Prophet came to Dauid, when hee was vp in the morning: for it was Dauids godly vse to call himselfe to account in the night: as he saith, Psal. 6.6. hee watered his couch with his teares in the night.</p>

                  <p>In the Chronicles, c. 21.12. three yeares of famine onely are spoken of: 1.

                  <p>2. Therefore we must here vnderstand, that three yeares of this famine were past alreadie, which was sent vpon the land for the crueltie of Saul toward the Gibeonits, c. 21.1. and this present yeare they had some relaxation from the famine by seasonable weather, and three yeares of famine should follow afterward. <hi>Iun.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Dauid hauing here confessed his sinne, receiued not the like answer now by the Prophet Gad, as before vpon the like confession of his sinne: the Prophet Nathan said vnto him, <hi>the Lord hath put away thy sin:</hi> the reason of which difference is this, that there Dauid slept in his sinne, till the Prophet awaked him: but here Dauids heart smote him, and he had prayed, that the Lord would take away his sinne, which he was assured of, so that there remained nothing, but some temporall chasticement, and correction, which the Lord purposed to send vpon Israel, and therefore this onely was giuen in charge to the Prophet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And whereas hee propoundeth simply these iudgements of warre, famine, and pestilence, yet many other calamities must be vnderstood to concurre with them: as in warre, burning of the cities, spoyling and laying wast of their grounds, rau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. But it will be asked, why the Prophet doth not as well giue him direction, what to choose, as to make the offer: the Hebrewes thinke, whereas the last word of Gods speach is <hi>dabhar, what word shall I answer to him that sent me:</hi> that in that word he insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth, what Dauid should make choice of: for the same word <hi>dabhar,</hi> with the chaunging of some points, signifieth the <hi>pestilence.</hi> But this obseruation seemeth to be somewhat curious.

                  <p n="1">1. Although the other two calamities of the sword, and of famine, are sent by the hand of God, and are gouerned by him, yet in them he vseth other instruments, as of the sword of men in warre, and of other deuouring creatures in famine: hee chooseth therefore to fall into the hands of God onely: for the pestilence is immediatly sent of God, and onely is his worke.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the pestilence, which God smiteth with, there is more mercie then when the

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3.

The number which died of this plague within the compasse of these three daies, was 40. thousand: so many men died, that Dauid might be punished in the same thing, wherein he had sinned; hee was lifted vp in mind because of the multitude and numbers of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>1. The Lord is not as man, that hee should repent: but he is so said to repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the effects of those which repent, which is to cease and to giue ouer, as they doe, which doe repent them of any thing: and in that sense the Lord here repenteth, because he biddeth the Angel stay his hand. <hi>Mart.</hi> 2.

                  <p>1. It pleased God that the Angel should be seene in a visible shape with a sword in his hand, that Dauid thereby might be mooued and stirred vp to humble himselfe: and that the Lord thereupon might shew mercie. 2.

                  <p>1. It pleased God to make choice of this place, because it pleased him there to haue a house built vnto himselfe: and why here rather then at Gilgal, Silo, Nob, Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pah, Gibeon, where the Tabernacle was at this present? no other reason can be giuen, then because it so pleased God: as in the daies of Elias, there were many widowes, yet the Prophet Elias was onely sent to the widowe of Sarepta: <hi>Mart.</hi> 2. This bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principall cause, yet other things concurred: this was the same place the hill Moriah, where Abraham would haue sacrificed Isaac: and in the same place, namely at Ierusalem, Christ the sonne of God offered vp himselfe in sacrifice. 3. And in this place the benefit was receiued: there the Angel held his hand, and put vp his sword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his sheath, as it is said 1. Chron. 21.27. therefore in that verie place Dauid offered sacrifice to shew his thankefulnesse. 4. And an other reason is yeilded why in that place Dauid built an Altar, because beeing afraid of the sword of the Angel, and the daunger beeing present, he could not goe vnto Gibeon, where the Tabernacle then was. 1. Chro. 21.30.</p>

                  <p>1. Hee is called also <hi>Ornan,</hi> 1. Chron. 21. it was no straunge thing in those daies for one to be called by diuerse names: or he beeing a straunger his name might be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what altered in the pronuntiation, as names are when they are vsed or taken vp in a straunge language: <hi>Mart.</hi> 2. For his nation and kinred, <hi>Kimhi</hi> thinketh he was not a Iebusite, for they were Cananites, and commanded to be rooted out: he rather ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, he was of the race of Abimelech: But the text saith he was a Iebusite, which is of a more credite, then any other humane coniecture: though he were a Iebusite, yet he might be spared, beeing conuerted to the faith of Israel. 3. Some thinke, he had beene the King of the Iebusites, <hi>Vatab. Osiand.</hi> and that by his meanes the fort of Sion was deliuered vp: but these things are vncertaine: he is in deed called a king, v. 23. in respect of his princely liberalitie, v. 23. <hi>Genevens.</hi> and it is like he was some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall man among his owne nation, and of great authoritie. <hi>Borrh.</hi> for it seemeth by this that all the Iebusites were not expelled Ierusalem, but there remained some either conuerted to their faith, or else they became tributarie and seruants vnto them: sure it is, that he was one of Dauids chiefe freinds, and was spared, when the rest of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busites were ouercome at the taking of the fort of Sion: <hi>Ioseph.</hi> 4. In that Dauid commeth to build an Altar in the ground of a straunger, it was an euident type of the vocation of the Gentiles, among whome the Lord would haue his Church. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Araunah in this bountifull offer to the King, to giue him both oxen for the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and other instruments for wood, sheweth the liuely fruites of faith in those that are truely conuerted vnto God: <hi>Mart.</hi> and he was a type of the Gentiles, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to the faith of Iesus, thought nothing too deare for Gods seruice: <hi>Pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Yet Dauid would not accept of this kindnesse, both in regard of Araunah, whose ground he would not take from him: for beeing once consecrated vnto the worship of God, it could no more returne to the former owner, or be priuately vsed: and in respect of himselfe, he would not offer vnto God a meane thing, not in it selfe, but because it cost Dauid nothing: and so the seruice should haue beene done rather by Araunah then by Dauid: Dauid therefore here according to that saying of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; <hi>Honour the Lord with thy riches,</hi> Prov. 3.9. would offer vnto God of his owne, and not of an others. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  <p>Here it is said that he bought the threshing floore and the oxen for 50. sheckles of siluer: but 1. Chron. 21.15. it is thus written, that he gaue for the place 600. shekles
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18791:77"/>
of gold by weight.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Hebrewes say, that because this place was to serue for a publike vse to build a Temple in, euerie tribe gaue 50. sheckles, which counting 12. tribes, maketh in all 600. sheckles: and that the sheckles were gathered in siluer, and by Dauid tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into gold: But this purchase was made vpon the present: Dauid had no time to make any such collection among the tribes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some thinke that Dauid gaue 50. sheckles at the first, vpon the purchase, and afterward 600. sheckles of his liberalitie: <hi>ex Martyr.</hi> but it is not like, that Dauids franke gift should so much exceed the iust price.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some thinke that Dauid gaue 50. sheckles for some part, and bought as much afterward, as came to 550. sheckles more: <hi>Genevens.</hi> but these two summes can not be put together: for the 50. were of siluer, and the 600. of gold.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Neither was the 50. sheckles for the oxen, and the 600. sheckles of gold for the threshing floore: <hi>Borrh.</hi> which amounteth to a 1500. dollors, that is, so many ownces of siluer or fiue shilling peeces: <hi>Iun.</hi> for it is like that not the bare threshing floore was valued at so much.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Therefore the best solution is, that he gaue 50. sheckles of siluer for the oxen onely, which make about 12. dollors: and for the whole place, and ground with the houses, where the Temple was afterward built, 600. sheckles of gold. <hi>Iun.

                  <p>1. Dauid did not this of himselfe: for Gad was admonished by the Angel to speake vnto Dauid, there to build an Altar: So it is like, when the holy men of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the high places, that they did it not without Gods direction, though it be not alwaies expressed: 2. Now whereas the Tabernacle was at Gibeon at this time, where most of the Preists gaue their attendance: yet there were also diuerse, and the cheefe of them, as Zadok and Abiathar, which kept with the Arke at Ierusalem: c. 15.25. 3. Beside an other reason is yeilded, why Dauid could not goe to Gibeon: because he was afraid of the sword of the Angel, and it might be was stricken with some infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, at the least he was in great feare, because of the present daunger. 4. This Altar here built was a type of the true Altar Christ Iesus, who was to suffer at Ierusalem: So the Apostle calleth Christ the Altar, Hebr. 13.10. that place therefore serueth not to prooue, that there ought to be still any materiall altars in the Church. But <hi>Tonstall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth: <hi>that of that Altar they haue no authoritie to eate,</hi> but Christ is to be eaten: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not meant by that altar. <hi>Contra.</hi> The words following must be weighed: <hi>they haue no authoritie to eate, which serue in the Tabernacle:</hi> but they which are vnder the Gospel, doe eate of this Altar. <hi>Mart.</hi>

This sacrifice wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
