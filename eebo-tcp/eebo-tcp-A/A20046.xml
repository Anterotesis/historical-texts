            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Now as touching the Dialect or phrase it selfe, I sée not that it is grounded vpon any certaine rules; And no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if it haue none, for sithence both the <hi>Father</hi> of this new kinde of Learning, and the <hi>children</hi> that study to speake it after him, haue beene from the beginning and stil are, the <hi>Breeders</hi> and <hi>Norishers</hi> of albase disorder, in their liuing and in their <hi>Manners:</hi> how is it possible, they should obserue any <hi>Method</hi> in their speech, and especialy in such a Language, as serues but onely to vtter discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of villanies?</p>
               <p>And yet (euen out of all that <hi>Irregularity,</hi> vnhansom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; Fountaine of <hi>Barbarisme)</hi> do they draw a kinde of forme: and in some wordes, (aswell simple as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds) retaine a certaine salte, tasting of some wit and some Learning. As for example, they call a cloake (in the <hi>canting</hi> tongue) a <hi>Togeman,</hi> and in Latin, <hi>Toga</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a gowne, or an vpper garment. <hi>Pannam</hi> is bread: &amp; <hi>Panis</hi> in Lattin is likewise bread, <hi>cassan</hi> is cheese, and is a worde barbarously coynd out of the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue <hi>caseus</hi> which also signifies chéese. And so of others.</p>
               <p>Then by ioyning of two simples, doe they make almost all their compounds. As for example: <hi>Nab</hi> (in the <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>

                  </gap>e: and so may that word be marryed to many others besides.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Coue,</hi> or <hi>Cofe,</hi> or <hi>Cuffin,</hi> signifies a Man, a Fellow, &amp;c. But differs something in his propertie, according as it meetes with other wordes: For a Gen, tleman is called a <hi>Gentry Coue,</hi> or <hi>Cofe:</hi> A good fellow is a <hi>Bene Cofe:</hi> a Churle is called, a <hi>Quier Cuffin; Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> signifies naught, and <hi>Cuffin</hi> (as I said before) a man: and in <hi>Canting</hi> they terme a Iustice of peace, (because he punisheth them belike) by no other name then by <hi>Quier cuffin,</hi> that is to say a Churle, or a naughty man. And so, <hi>Ken</hi> signifiing a house, they call a prison, a <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ken,</hi> thats to say, an ill house.</p>

Its a Gold-Finch that fildome flies to these Ordinary Nests, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a hundred or two hundred pound in twenty shilling péeces about him. After the tearing of some seauen paire of Cardes, or the damning of some ten baile of Dice, steps hée vpon the Stage, and this part he playes.

If my yong Estrich gape to swallow downe this mettall (&amp; for the most part they are very gréedy, hauing such prouander set before them) then is the gold powred on the board, a Bond is made for repaiment, at the next quarter day when <hi>Exhibition</hi> is sent in: and because it is all gold, and cost so much the changing, The Scriuener (who is a whelpe of the old Mastiues owne bréeding) knows what words will bite, which thus he fastens vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and in this Nette the Gull is sure to be taken (howsoeuer:) for if he fall to play againe, &amp; loose, the hoary Goat-bearded Satyre that stands at his elbow, laughes

For the day being come when the bond growes due, the within named <hi>Signior Auaro</hi> will not be within: or if he be at home, he hath wedges enough in his pate, to cause the bond to bée broken, or else a little before the day, he féeds my young Maister with such swéet words, that surfetting vpon his protestations, hée neglects his paiment, as presuming hée may do more But the Law hauing a hand in the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bond, laies presently hold of our yong Gallant with the helpe of a couple of Serieants, and iust at such a time when old <hi>Erra Pater</hi> (the Iew,) that lent him the money, knowes by his owne Prognostication, that the Moone with the siluer face is with him in the waine. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then can frée him out of the phanges of those bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, but he must presently confesse a iudgment, for so much money, or for such a Manor or Lordship (thrée times worth the bond forfeited) to be paid or to be entred vpon by him, by such a day or within so many moneths after he comes to his land.

Thus the liberallitie of a Nobleman, or of a Gentleman is abused: thus learning is brought into scorne and contempt: Thus men are cheated of their bountie, giuing much for that (out of their free mindes) which is common abroad, and put away for base prices. Thus villanie some-times walkes alone, as if it were giuen to Melancholly, and some-times knaues tie them-selues in a knot, because they may be more merry, as by a mad sort of Comrades whome I see leaping into the Saddle, anon it will apeare.</p>

                  </gap> all the Horse-coursers (that roost about the Citty) flie one after another. And whereas in buying all other commodities, men striue to haue the best, how great so euer the price be, onely the Horse-courser is of a baser minde, for the woorst hors-flesh (so it be cheape) does best goe downe with him. He cares for nothing but a fayre out-side, and a hansome shape (like those that hyre whores, (though there be a hundred diseases within: <hi>he</hi> (as the <hi>other)</hi> ventures vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all.</p>
               <p>The first lesson therefore that a Horse-courser takes out, when he comes to one of these Markets, is to make choyce of such Nags, Geldings, or Mares, especially, as are fatte, fayre, and well-fauor'd to the eye: and because men delight to behold beautifull coullors, and that some coulours are more delicate (euen in beasts) then others are, he will so néere as he can, bargaine for those horses that haue the daintiest complexion: as the Milke-white, the Gray, the Dapple-Gray, the Cole blacke with his proper markes (as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the goodlier proportion y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beast carries or the fayrer markes or coulour that hee beares, are or ought to bee watch-words as it were to him that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards buyes him of the horse-courser, that he bee not coozend with an ouer-price for a bad peny-worth, because such Horses (belonging for the most part to Gentlemen) are seldome or neuer solde away, but vpon some fowle quallty, or some incurable disease, which the Beast is falne into. The Best coulours are therefore the best Cloakes to hide those faults that most disfigure a Horse: and next vnto coulour, his Pace doth often-times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and goe beyond a very quick Iudgement.</p>
               <p>Some of these <hi>Horse-hunters,</hi> are as nimble Knaues in finding out the infirmities of a Iade, as a Barber is in drawing of téeth: and albeit (without casting his water) hee does more readily reckon vp all the Aches, Crampes, Crickes, and whatsoeuer disease else lyes in his bones: and for those diseases seemes vtterly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like him, yet if by looking vpon the Dyall within his mouth, he finde that his yeares haue struck but fiue, sixe, or seauen: and that he prooues but young, or that his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases are but newly growing vpon him, if they be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or haue but hayre and skin to hide them, if they bee inward, let him sweare neuer so damnably, that it is but a Iade, yet he will be sure to fasten vpon him.</p>
               <p>So then, a <hi>Horse-courser</hi> to the <hi>Merchant,</hi> (that out of his sound iudgement buyes the fairest, the best-bred, and the noblest Horses, selling them againe for breede or seruice, with plainnesse and honesty.) is as the <hi>Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> to the faire <hi>Gamester:</hi> hee is indeed a meere Iadish <hi>Nonopolitane,</hi> and deales for none but tyred, taited, dull and diseased horses.

and in Smith-field a common forsworne Uillaine. Hee will sweare any thing, but the faster hee sweares, the more danger tis to beleeue him: In one forenoone, and in selling a Iade not worth fiue Nobles, will hee forsweare himselfe fifteene times, and that forswearing too shall bee by <hi>Equiuocation.</hi> As for example, if an ignorant Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man comming to beate the price, say to the Horse-courser your nagge is verie olde or thus many yeares olde, and reckon ten or twelue; hee claps his hand presently on the buttocke of the beast, and praies he may bee damb'd if the Horse be not vnder fiue, meaning that the horse is not vnder fiue yeares of age, but that he standes vnder fiue of his fingers, when his hand is clap'd vppon him. These <hi>Horse-coursers</hi> are called <hi>Iynglers,</hi> and these <hi>Iynglers</hi> hauing laide out their money on a company of Iades at some drunken fayre, vp to London they driue them, and vppon the Market day into Smithfield brauely come they prauncing. But least their Iades should shew too many horse trickes in Smith-field, before so greate an Audience as commonly resort thither, their maisters doe therefore Schoole them at home after this manner.</p>
