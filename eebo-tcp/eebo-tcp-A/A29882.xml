            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

At last, after we had nothing to trust to, nothing to confide in, and knowing not where to cast our Anchor, we turn'd our eyes upon this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent King, hoping that the disuse of his Coin might have made him forget his Title, <hi>Regnante,</hi> and we might have steer'd in <hi>Regente</hi> Carolo.</p>

               <p>We had some reasons to make us so impudent as not to dread but hope better things; the Declarations from beyond the Seas, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mildness of the Prince's temper, and the unthought of kindness of

I resign'd up a place that gave me opportunity of shewing forth that Talent of Utterance God had so signally endued me with, though but in the language of the Beast, but now I shall endeavour to quench that gift of the Spirit, (though in gud faith) it even boy leth within my breast, and longeth even with the longing of a Woman to breath forth upon the Sons of Men, but now it behoveth us to act, and not to let the light of the day go down upon our words, with the Kiss therefore of Charity I enstate you in the name of the whole people of the Lord, this day to be our Governour, and to take the Proposals that may tend for theirs and our gud and God's glaury; and consider from whence this honour accrews unto you, not so much from your own worth as from the meer grace of God's people, remember therefore, to whom you must give an account when the day is spent and the night cometh.</p>

               <p>That this honour in this venerable Assembly so soon returns to me again, I must acknowledge God's hand in directing your hearts, in pitching upon me, as a man that have not shown my self (I thank God) obstinate to any thing but Monarchy <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I, if any one has cunning to write it, but he will certainly smell it out; If we should start a subject that should raise his bloud (that possibly we might pitch upon) yet we should never aright imitate their smooth periods, interwove with pretty sophisms, and their vivacity mix'd with a seeming passionate seriousness and extraordinary concern; our stiff easie imitable style is so far wide that no one so much us'd to it, as all us are forc'd to be, can ever bend his head easily to act their part.</p>

set a foot two Factions to counter plot one another, but his interest to damn both, but 'tis the cunning of one party not quite to vanquish (onely or'e top the other) lest they should presently be rooted out themselves, like two Hares, one continually pops before the Hounds when the other was almost spent, so they preserv'd one another, otherwise they had both successively gone to pot, the Plot at this rate will do us as much mischief as we expected good from it, I hope our swift runners will bethink themselves in time, and not pursue the Game so hotly, we shall be undone else.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But what if you have not his Consent? (or if you have he should repent, and think himself bubbled out of Three Kingdoms, but we shall injure him in such a supposition) and the neighbouring Nations of the same perswasion you would by all means have him to be of, (and that may be a cause to induce him to be so) should disrelish your une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual proceedings, and should rise up against you.</p>

               <p>Are those the Bugbears? do you think the Protestants are not able to cope with the Papists? nee'r fear, we would make a Battel Royal for Religion, and make <hi>Europe</hi> to be but one Cock-pit.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But we know there are some that are no Papists, that can disrelish injuries done to Monarchs, our Trade felt that in <hi>Moscovy</hi> after our King's barbarous murther, so that this side wants no real Fears, no more than your other Jealousies; but supposing the Three Estates of <hi>Scotland</hi> should not joyn with the King to turn him out there?</p>

               <p>And we had nothing else before, I wish we could do it but once, but they that should have not gone about it the right way, they never yet offer'd any thing more for that, and passing whatever Bills they should think needfull, which perhaps might have been an hard bargain, but the relieving <hi>Tangier,</hi> and standing by him in all the Alliances and Foreign Leagues he should make, had they offer'd him his Ship-mony, his Courts of Wards and Liveries, to have a perpetual hanc upon his two Houses again, with his free Quarter, that they got by slurring on him, and a<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> round sum in hand, somewhat might have been done; in order thereto our Coyners had grafted a story upon the Duke's last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, that with tears in his eyes he should bid his Brother remember if he did part with him to sell him as dear as he could, we thought to have set the last Parliaments a bidding for him as for a Stock at Gleeke.</p>

               <p>But they found his Majesty never design'd any such thing, none of his Friends in the House ever gave the least glimpse to it, but he promis'd 'tis said an Earl to doe it if he could but satisfie his Conscience as well as he told him they could satisfie the Laws.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Conscience in Kings, they should, as Ambassadours are sent abroad to lie for the good of the Nation, be damn'd or stand fair for it, for the good of their people, but we can sear that up, and I wonder he told not his Majesty so, we could have made a Fast for that, besides their Politick Capacity excuses 'em.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>As thus; The Crown may be dispos'd of by some Authority, but the King with the necessary concurrence of the three Estates must not, because that might do us perhaps more injury, therefore the King alone may.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>This is an Argument onely to convince those that long to be convinc'd with never so small a one, this is made for your selves, how would you convince the next Heir put by as to the right of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>We would convince him by dint of Sword.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But how would you convince the other part of the world, that might look upon this as a piece of injustice, and perhaps right him in his Cause, we are making again a Cock-pit of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>If it come but once to that, we have those that shall draw De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations as well nay much better than their Swords.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But would not the Elder Brothers of the Nation, ('tis they that constitute the two Houses of Parliament) have taken it ill to have had the next Heir have put their Noses out of joint, by the importunities of their Fathers pretended Friends, because they fancy'd the Eldest would have prov'd the hardest Masters?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>How sillily you talk now, that could not be done, the Laws of the Land were their security, they lay not at the pure will of their Predecessours, their Estates are most of them entail'd upon them, and you know in an entail'd Estate a superiour power is requisite towards the cutting them off, either the Courts of Judicature, a special Act of Parliament, or the King's consent together with the Parents as in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of Honours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I profess I highly admire the Law, as being the effects of great Reasoning, nay so great a friend it is to it that it disowns it self, if it comes otherwise, or any ways contradicts what we hold reasonable to be believ'd, our Religion in the whole or in its parts; Now that Law thinks that in an entail'd Estate (which I presume modestly the Crown may be thought to be, the best holding in <hi>England</hi> sure) the next Heir cannot be put by, without an Authority supream to the Paternal (or that deriv'd from it) Now in private Estates, there is a supreme to the immediate Paternal power, such as Courts of Judicature, and special Acts of Parliament, by vertue of which they hold those, and keep them from other people, but in the case of the Crown there is no power su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme to the Possessour but the power of the Donor, which is God himself, so that we must have in reason we see a Revelation first before a Disinherison, and if any thing is done contrary to Reason, the Law

               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>Here are two or three things in which I fear you have over-shot your self in, as first what is all this to the purpose if in private Estates the Laws require a supreme power, we can make a Law that shall wipe off all that, and enact quite contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If you can make Acts of Parliament against the Common Law of the Land, which was in being before the Parliament, I hope you can't make them against Reason too, this Law was thought ever reasonable; and the contrary may look suspicious.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>W.</speaker>
               <p>We can make a Law that that Law it self that invalidates all other Laws if not reasonable shall be kick'd out of doors: but another thing you say there is no supreme power to the Possessour's but the Donor's which is God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how then can yone King By his powerfull inherit, as I have heard a great many that would be thought most Loyal and most Orthodox maintain; but I believe they were men that fear'd the consequences of a Popish Successour as bad as they hated the growth of Parliamentary power.</p>
