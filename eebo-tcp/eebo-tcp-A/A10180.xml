         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Maior part of our Ecclesiasticall Commissioners,
who yet determine of Haeresies, false Doctrines,
Scismes, and the sense and meaning of our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
yet no man quarrels or excepts against them.
Why then should they deny this power vnto Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
because they are but Lay, which they
acknowledge, and admit in these? Especially,
since all our Churchmen are virtually included in
our Parliament, and so suffragate to its Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Is it because Parliaments want Conusance or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

of Religion? How then was Popery heretofore

<pb facs="tcp:15708:5"/>

no sufficient disability, either in the Members, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
Skill, or requisite Abilities of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament, to censure or examine the Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our established Articles, and Religion, or
to settle, protect, define, declare, and ratifie the
proper sense and meaning of our Articles, and the
vndoubted Doctrines of our Church: I see no
cause why any Clergy men (vnlesse they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Sophisticating, or betraying the Truthes,
and Doctrines of our Church; and therefore
feare the doome of Parliaments, from which there
is no euasion) should quarrell, or except against
your pious progresse in matters of Religion,
(which most of all concerne vs) nor yet repine at
Laicks (as they do) for writing in their iust defence.</p>
            <p>This stumbling-blocke of Parlimentary Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in causes of Religion, (which stickes and
takes with many) being thus in briefe remoued;
and your present Honourable proceedings in the
examination of the innouations, and violations of
the ancient Religion, and the resolued Doctrines of
our Church, absolued from the vniust exceptions
of ignorant, obnoxious, or ill-affected Spirits, who
only censure and dislike them: It may be here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
what Doctrines, what Religion are now to
be established? Surely no other but those Ancient,
Orthodox, and Dogmaticall Conclusions, which
the Church of England, since her Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath alwaies constantly embraced, ratified,
and defended as her owne; but those especially,
<pb facs="tcp:15708:6"/>
which Popery and Arminianisme haue of late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded.
Yea, but how may Parliaments infallibly
discerne what Tenents are our Churches genuine
Doctrines, when as both sides lay equall claime,
and title to our Church? Arminians now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to Her, aswell as their Opposers.</p>
            <p>For resolution to this <hi>Quaere,</hi> I shall first of all
take two things as vndoubted Theories.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that the Church of England hath some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
positiue, particular, established, receiued, yea
resolued Doctrines, which shee may truely call her
owne: in which, all necessary Truthes, (especially
such, wherein the very marrow, efficacy, life, and
power of grace, and all true Christian comfort
doe subsist) are actually, euidently, and fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended:
Else it will ineuitably follow, that as
yet shee hath no sound Religion in her, and is as
yet no true, no Christian Church.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that all these seuerall Doctrines, are,
not onely cognoscible in themselues; but likewise
publikly, indiuidually, and distinctly known in our
Church: else all our Articles, Preaching, writing,
and Disputes, (together with the bloud shedde of
our famous Martyrs, and all Apologies for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion)
from the beginning of reformation to this
present, are in vaine; and wee haue yet no other,
but an indefinite, confused Religion: an ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
implicit, Popish Faith, (which in truth is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
no Faith at all:) and so our danger is,<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 11. 21. <hi>to</hi> 25. Luke 10. 12. <hi>to</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>our
condemnation shall be greater, then euer Sodomes or
Gomorrahs were,</hi> who neuer had such meanes, such
light as we.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15708:6"/>
These two irrefragable Conclusions being thus
praemised: This <hi>Quaere</hi> may be thus resolued: The
onely infallible way to determine, to finde out
the ancient, the vndoubted Doctrines of our
Church, is to compare them with the Rules of
triall: The originall Touch-stone by which all
Theologicall Conclusions must bee examined, is
the Scriptures: and these, (together with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, and approued Councels) wee dare
to challenge as our owne, if the naked truth of
our Assertions were the thing in Issue: But our
present inquirie being of a different nature, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the true Ancient Doctrines of our Church,
and distinguish them from pestilent vpstart Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
wee must heere proceed by other Triers;
euen the <hi>Articles, Homilies, Common Prayer Booke;</hi> the
publike <hi>Euidences, Records,</hi> and <hi>Declarations;</hi> with
the concurrent Testimony of all the learned <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
of our Church: the onely Grand-Iury-men to
try, the best Euidences, the sole Witnesses to proue,
the most impartiall and able Iudges to determine
the Doctrines of our Church. That which all
these doe ioyntly, cleerely, fully vote, confirme,
approue, and testifie, a Parliament may safely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
and ratifie to bee; that which they all, or
most disclaime, a Parliament may iustly censure
not to bee; the vndoubted and resolued Doctrine
of our Church.</p>
            <p>If then all these giue vp their ioynt and seuerall
suffrages for our Anti-Arminian Conclusions; If
they all passe Sentence against their opposite Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian
Errors, (as this present Treatise will vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<pb facs="tcp:15708:7"/>
prooue them to haue done) you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
declare, resolue, re-establish the one, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
exile, yea damne the other, as not being, the
Ancient, receiued, and vndoubted Doctrine of
our English Church.</p>
            <p>And why should you now make any doubt or scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of passing such a sentence? Neuer were there
any truthes more copiously confirmed; more
constantly defended; more posit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uely resolued;
more aboundantly propagated; more generally
Preached; more vnanimously imbraced; more
vncontrolably published, more peremptorily esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in our Church, then these Anti-Arminian
Tenents, which I heere present vnto you: There
is scarce one publike (whether Ancient or Modern)
Act, Record, or Euidence of our Church, since
her Reformation hitherto, but doth <hi>in terminis,</hi> at
least in substance, guie iudgement for them: Scarse
a learned or godly Martyr of note or eminency in
our infant Church, but hath planted them with
his hand, watred them with his bloud. Scarce one
Diuinity Professor in either of our Vniuersities;
hardly an Orthodox or renowned Writer in our
Church, from the beginning of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the 6. his Raigne till this very present: but
hath subscribed them with his hand and feale, and
transmitted them to posteritie in some publike
Worke. Not one constant Preacher of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
who hath not proclaimed them in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.
Scarce a Graduate in Diuinitie, but hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Lectures or Disputes, defended them in the
Schoole. Scarce an Act, or Commencement hath
<pb facs="tcp:15708:7"/>
passed in either of our Famous Academies, wherein
all, or some of them, haue not bene publikely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in Diuinity Exercises. Not one authorized
or approued Writer of our Church (for I count
not<note n="*" place="margin">Three of their bookes were not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed.</note> 
               <hi>Barret, Thomson, Mountague,</hi> or <hi>Iackson</hi> such, the
only opposites to them, that I know off, and those
generally opposed, by all our Orthodox Diuines)
who did euer once oppugne them: Yea al such who
haue formerly but barked against them in their
inconsiderate Sermons, haue beene forced to sing
a publike Palinodie for their paines: as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations</hi>
of <hi>Barret, Sympson,</hi> and others largely
testifie: And shall wee now beginne to question,
whether they are the Doctrines of our Church or
no? because some pur-blinde, squint-eyed, ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Arminian Nouellists, begin for to dispute it?
What is this but to make a scruple, whether the
day be light, or no; because Buzzards, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
cannot see it? or sottishly to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Sunne stands centred in one constant cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
whiles the massie Earth wheeles round; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
one brainesicke <hi>Copernicus</hi> out of the sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his quintessentiall, transcendentall Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
hath more senselesly, then Metaphysically,
more ridiculously, then singularly auerred it?
Shall others wilfull, gainefull, and aspiring blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
make vs to doubt our eye-sight? or shall the
absurd and idle <hi>Quaerees</hi> of some Romish or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing
Spirits, so vnsettle vs in our long-profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
faith, as to cause vs now to question the most
positiue, palpable, and resolued Principles of our
reformed Religion? Yea so farre to besot vs, as
<pb facs="tcp:15708:8"/>
to put vs to this irrationall, this frantique scrutinie;
Whether that bee the vndoubted Doctrine of our
Church, which shee hath alwayes hitherto belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
embraced, professed as a truth: or that rather
which she hath alwaies Diametrally opposed, yea
censured as an Error? O let not vs be so vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly,
so Atheistically wauering in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
all Tenents of our long-professed Faith, as

which our Church was neuer yet suspitious, in
the least degree. Proceede, therefore as you
(Gods name be blessed) haue already done: to
inquire out the Heads, the Nurseries, rootes, and
grand Protectors of our Popish, our Arminian
mungrell rabble, (which swarme like Locusts in
our Church of late) combining both together
(as is iustly feared) to eate out our Religion
by degrees, to spoile vs of these temporall
immunities, of those coelestiall treasures of Gods
sauing truth, which are farre dearer to vs, then
our dearest soules: and when you haue once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
them (as you may quickely doe, since
practise, fame, and iealousie haue made them so
notorious,) it will be worth your labour to hew
them downe with speede, both root and branch,
at once; else all your superficiall hacking of some
smaller Issues, will but increase their growth, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their strength, and multiply their fruit,
their branches, and al-daring practises, when the
time, the feare of lopping are but passed ouer.
Trampling we know on Camomile stalkes, doth
but make them grow the thicker, spread the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
it is the breaking, not the bruising of the
roote that kills it. The mowing down of weedes,
of grasse; the lopping off of lesser branches
doth neuer hinder, but aduance their growth; not
lessen, but augment their number: The rootes
must first bee stocked vp, or else the blades, the
stalkes, the branches will not, cannot wither, or
<pb facs="tcp:15708:11"/>
giue ouer budding. Strike therefore at the roots,
as well as at the branches of these preuailing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
else all your lopping, will turne but into
pruning: your launching into festring; your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine

               <hi>CHristian Reader,</hi> I heere present vnto thy view, and
prostrate to thy Censure, a compendious Summary of
those scattered Euidences; a concise Catalogue of those emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Writers, and illustrious Witnesses of our Mother
Church, since the beginning of her Reformation to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant;
who haue positiuely maintained, and punctually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
those 7. <hi>Anti-Arminian Theses,</hi> which I heere
prooue: but diametrally oppugned, yea constantly condemned
their 7. opposite erronious Arminian Tenents which I here
disprooue, to be, the ancient, established, and resolued Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of our English Church. The multitude of my other
distractions, and ineuitable interruptions, together with the
narrow scantling of those few Winter dayes, I had for to
compose it in, haue denyed it that exact mature Summer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which others may expect, my selfe desire. Accept
it therefore as a Winter fruit, impatient of a tedious Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ripening, which might perchance adde much vnto its
fulnesse, but derogate from its seasonablenesse. The Wise
man hath informed:<note n="a" place="margin">Eccl. 3. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

hoping that its seasonable and timely birth (if the

excuse, will salue its hasty, its immature Natiuity. This

to keepe this petty Treatise from swelling into an excessiue
Volume, which it must needs haue done, had I transcribed
the one moity of the ensuing Quotations in their latitude.
Secondly, because the most, the chiefe of all these Bookes,

so that their bare Quotation is sufficient, their Transcript
needlesse. Thirdly, to encourage learned Readers, (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,

which seeke to shrowde themselues vnder the fraudulent

and graue Aduice of his, I haue made choice to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,

of those <hi>Arminian Tenents,</hi> which would willingly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
themselues, vnder the roofe and Patronage of the
Church of England, whose Doctrines they of late prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
they are. The issue which the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15708:30"/>
               <hi>Anti-Arminians</hi> (if I may so stile them) are now come to
ioyne, and on which they must receiue their final doome,
is onely this: Whether the Arminian or Anti-Arminian
Positions, be the receiued and vndoubted Doctrines of
the Church of England? The onely Euidences, and
Grand-Iury-men to try this Issue; are the Articles, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
Common-prayer Booke, and the authorized
Writings of all the Learned Orthodox Writers of the
Church of England, from the beginning of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this present. If all these suffragate or passe their
Verdict for the Arminians, and their erronious Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
let iudgement then be openly pronounced for them,
we will foorth with yeeld vp to them without any more
dispute, both cause and right at once. But if all, or either
of these giue euidence against them, as in truth they
doe: If they all yeeld vp a ioynt vnanimous verdict for
Anti-Arminians, and their authentique Positions; I
hope they shall then receiue, not only a speedy and finall
iudgement on their side, which no subsequent <hi>Reuiew,</hi>
nor <hi>writ of Error</hi> shall hencefoorth reuerse: but likewise
a <hi>Parliamentary Decree,</hi> to establish them in their ancient
and long-continued peaceable possession, without distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
for all future times. For triall of this waighty Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
which will put a period to our praesent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies,
and stablish peace and vnity both in Church and
State; I haue heere Epitomized into this compendious
Briefe, the seuerall scattered Euidences, and most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Witnesses that the Church of England hath affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to this purpose, since her Reformation to this
present; all which giue punctuall testimony, and vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
sentence against our new Arminian Assertions: dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering
them to bee, not onely nouell, and erronious;
but diametrally repugnant to the anciently established,
and professed Doctrine of our reformed Church, as the
sequell will eftsoone demonstrate.</p>
            <p>The Method which I shall obserue in the legall deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this Issue, is this: First, I shall set downe at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15708:30"/>
large, the seuerall grand Charters (to wit, The <hi>Articles
of the Church of England:</hi> The <hi>Articles of Lambheth:</hi>
The <hi>Articles of Ireland:</hi> The <hi>Common Prayer Booke:</hi> The
<hi>Homilies Established in our Church:</hi> The <hi>Chatechisme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by King Edward the</hi> 6. and <hi>Barrets Recantation,</hi>)
which entitle the Anti-Arminian Tenents to the Church
of England, and the Church of England vnto them;
and withall disproue the meere pretended title of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian
Tenents to our English Church, which neuer yet
gaue colour or allowance to them. Secondly I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Anti-Arminian Orthodox Assertions in their
order, applying these seuerall Charters to them, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable
euidences; and likewise quoting to them the
workes and names of all such Orthodox and learned
Writers of the Church of England, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Reformation to this present, that haue hitherto
come vnto my hands; who giue direct and punctuall
testimony either on their side, or against their opposites,
or both; as irrefragable witnesses, to vindicate and proue
them, to be the ancient and vndoubted; and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Arminian Tenents, the spurious and pretended Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
onely, of the Church of England.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with the first of these; and in that, with
the established and allowed Articles of the Church of

body of Christ, is the blessed company of all faithfull
and elect people, and none else but they; as the next pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the Collect on good Fryday, and the places quoted
in the first Position, prooue. And whereas the Minister
in distributing the Bread and wine, saith particularly to
euery man: take this in remembrance that Christ dyed
for thee: drinke this in remembrance that Christs bloud
was shed for thee; it cannot imply that Christ dyed
effectually for all men; but the contrary, that hee dyed
only thus for the Elect and faithfull: because our Church
<note n="b" place="margin">The Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation before the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> prohibites all such as want true faith and repentance,
or liue in any grosse and knowne sinnes, to come to the
Sacrament, admitting none but true and faithfull peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
to it: so that the Minister and our Church doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15708:40"/>
looke vpon all Communicants, as the elect and
chosen Saints of God, endued with true faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and so they may well apply (at leastwise in the
iudgement of Charity) the efficacy and merits of Christs
death vnto them. I will conclude this point with the
passage of A Prayer necessary for all men. Iesus Christ
thy onely Sonne hath perfectly fulfilled thy Law, to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

I will giue thee an heart to knowe mee, that I am the
Lord, and they shall bee my people, and I will bee their
God, for they shall returne vnto mee with their whole
heart.</p>
            <p>Both the Priesthood and the Law being changed wee
ought to acknowledge none other Priest for deliuerance
from our sinnes,<note place="margin">Folio 267.</note> but our Sauiour Iesus Christ, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
soueraigne Bishoppe, doeth with the Sacrifice of his
Body and Blood, offered once for euer vpon the Altar of
the Crosse, most<note n="5" place="margin">5</note> effectually cleanse the spirituall le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie,
and wash away the sinnes of all those that with
true confession of the same doe flee vnto him.</p>
            <p>These seuerall passages quoted out of our Homilies do
aboundanty testifie: that ther is an eternal and immutable
Praedestination of certaine men vnto eternall life, out of
meere grace and mercy; and likewise a praetermission
or reprobation of others to eternall death, out of Gods
meere pleasure. That there is no Free-will, or sufficient
grace communicated vnto all men, whereby they may
conuert, and saue themselues if they will. And that man
without the speciall assistance of Gods grace and Spirit,
is so weake and impotent, that hee can neither doe nor
thinke any thing that is good, or prepare his heart to
seeke for grace: That Christ Iesus hath dyed suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
for all men, but effectually for none but the Elect,
and such who are enabled through faith to apply his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
to their soules. That Gods grace and Spirit doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
worke effectually in the hearts of his Elect, in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15708:46"/>
the act of their conuersion, which they can neuer fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
nor totally resist. And that the Elect and truely
regenerate can neither fall finally nor totally from the
state of grace which is firme and stable. If any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to know more of mans imbecillity, and misery since
the fall, which is such; that he can neither will nor doe
any thing that is good, without Gods speciall preuenting
and assisting grace: (a point which ouerthrowes the
whole Fabricke of Arminianisme, which is founded vpon
mans Free-will.) Let him read the<note n="*" place="margin">Part. 1. pag. 7. to 13.</note>

principall and most proper cause of our Iustification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
is the goodnesse and loue of God, whereby he chose vs for

trust in God, and hope for the performance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
With this choyce is ioyned as companion, the
mortifying of the olde man, that is of our affection and
last. From the same spirit also commeth our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the loue of God, and of our neighbour, iustice, and
vprightnesse of life. Finally, to say all in summe,<note n="4" place="margin">4</note> 
               <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is in vs, or may be done of vs, honest, pure, true, and good,
that altogether springeth out of this most pleasant Rocke, from

oft therefore as we vse to say, that wee are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

that this Catechisme is fully agreable to the true sence

a Comment or Explanation on our 16. and 17. Articles:
so that whatsoeuer is affirmed in this Catechisme, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
affirmed by those Articles. And if so, then it is
more then euident, that our Articles doe point-blanke
oppugne the Arminian mutabilitie of Predestination: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

the totall and finall resisting of the worke of grace, and
Apostasie from the state of grace; together with the
truth of grace in reprobates, or castawayes: all which
are euidently refuted and condemned by this Catechisme

whom God hath ordained to life aeternall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> By the motions of spirituall life, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
<note n="7" place="margin">7</note> onely to the children of God: by the which

               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note n="7" place="margin">7</note> It is not possible that they should: for as
Gods purpose is not changeable, so hee repenteth not of
the gifts and graces of his adoption: neither doeth hee
cast off those whom he hath once receiued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Why then should we pray by the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi>

Spirit from vs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> In so praying, wee make protestation of the
weakenesse of flesh, which mooueth vs to doubt: yet
should not wee haue courage to aske, if we were not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that God will giue according to his purpose and
promise, that which we require.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Doe the Children of God feele the motions aforesaid
alwayes alike?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No truely: for God sometime to prooue his,
seemeth to leaue them in such sort, that the flesh ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matcheth
the Spirit, whereof ariseth trouble of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for the time: yet the spirit of adoption is<note n="7" place="margin">7</note> neuer
taken from them, that haue once receiued it: else might
they perish. But as in many diseases of the body, the
powers of the bodily life are letted: So in some assaults
the motions of spirituall life are not perceiued, because
they lie hidden in our manifold infirmities, as the fire
couered with ashes. Yet as after sickenesse commeth
health, and after cloudes the Sunne shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

calleth, haue not the like effect at all times: yet is it not
good to neglect the meanes whereby God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

melted without heate, nor clay hardened but by meanes

thereof; so God vseth meanes both to draw those vnto
himselfe, whom he hath appointed vnto Saluation, and
also to bewray the wickednesse of them whom hee iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemneth.</p>
            <p>

COPPYE OF A
RECANTATION OF
certaine Errors, raked out of the dunghill
of Poperie, and Pelagianisme, publiquely made by
Master Barret of Kayes Colledge in Cambridge the tenth
day of May, in this present yeere of our Lord, 1595. in
the Vniuersitie Church, called Saint Maries in Cambridge: which
Errors he (together with Maister Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Reaching in Latine not long since in
the Vniuersitie Church, (Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull,)
many things slipped from
me, both falsely, and rashly spoken,
whereby I vnderstand the mindes of
many haue beene grieued; to the end
therfore that I may satisfie the Church
and the Truth which I haue publiquely hurt, I doe make
this publique Confession, both repeating, and reuoking
my Errors.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, I said, that no man in this transitorie World, is
so strongly vnderpropped, at least by the certainetie of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15708:50"/>
Faith, that is, vnlesse (as I afterwards expounded it,) by
Reuelation, that hee ought to bee assured of his owne
Saluation. But now I protest before God, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in my Conscience, that they which are iustified by
Faith, haue peace towards God, that is, haue reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
with God, and doe stand in that Grace by Faith:
therefore that they ought to bee certaine, and assured of
their owne Saluation, euen by the certaintie of Faith
it selfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I affirmed that the Faith of <hi>Peter</hi> could not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
faile, but that other mens Faith may: for (as I then said)
our Lord prayed not for the Faith of euery particular
man. But now being of a better, and more sound Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
(according to that which Christ teacheth in
plaine words, <hi>Iohn 17. 20. I pray not for these alone,</hi> (that
is, the <hi>Apostles,) but for them also which shall beleeue in me,
through their word.</hi>) I acknowledge that Christ did pray
for the Faith of euery particular Beleeuer: and that by
the vertue of that Prayer of Christ, euery true Beleeuer
is so staied vp that his Faith cannot faile.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, touching perseuerance vnto the end, I said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that that certainetie concerning the time to come, is
proude, forasmuch, as it is in his owne nature contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
of what kind the perseuerance of euery man is: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I affirme it to bee proud onely, but to bee most
wicked. But now I freely protest, that the true, and
iustifying Faith (whereby the Faithfull are most neerely
vnited vnto Christ,) is so firme, as also for the time to
come so certaine, that it can neuer bee rooted vp out of
the mindes of the Faithfull, by any tentations of the
Flesh, the World, or the Diuell himselfe: So that hee
which once hath this Faith, shall euer haue it: for by the
benefit of that iustifying Faith, Christ dwelleth in vs, and
wee in Christ: therefore it cannot but be both increased,
(Christ growing in vs daily,) as also preseuere vnto the
end, because God doeth giue constancy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I affirmed that there was no distinction in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:15708:51"/>
Faith, but in the persons beleeuing. In which I confesse
that I did Erre: Now I freely acknowledge, that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Faith, (which as <hi>Bernard</hi> witnesseth, is therefore
fained, because it is temporary,) is distinguished, and
differeth from that sauing Faith, whereby sinners appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
Christ, are iustified before God for euer; not
in measure, and degrees, but in the very thing it selfe.
Moreouer I adde, that <hi>Iames</hi> doth make mention of a
dead Faith, and <hi>Paul</hi> of a Faith that worketh by loue.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, I added, that forgiuenesse of sinnes is an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Faith, but not particular, neither belonging to this
man, nor to that man: that is, (as I expounded it,) that
no true Faithfull man, either can, or ought, certainely to
beleeue that his sinnes are forgiuen. But now I am
of another minde, and doe freely confesse, that euery
true Faithfull man is bound by this Article of Faith, (to
wit, I beleeue the forgiuenesse of sinnes,) certainely to
beleeue that his owne particular sinnes are freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
him: neither doeth it follow hereupon, that that
Petition of the Lords prayer (to wit, <hi>forgiue vs our Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,</hi>)
is needlesse; for in that Petition, we aske not onely
the guist, but also the increase of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, these words escaped me in my Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi>
As for those that are not saued, I doe most strongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
and doe freely protest that I am so perswaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Caluin, Peter Martyr,</hi> and the rest, that sinne is
the true, proper, and first cause of Reprobation. But now
being better instructed; <hi>I say that the Reprobation of
the wicked, is from Euerlasting, and that that saying of
Augustine</hi> to <hi>Simplician</hi> is most true, <hi>viz.</hi> If sinne were
the cause of Reprobation, then no man should be elected,
because God doeth foreknow all men to bee de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iled with
it. And (that I may speake freely,) I am of the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mind;
and doe beleeue concerning the Doctrine of Election,
<note n="*" place="margin">The Heads therefore of the Vniuersity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who composed this Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were of this opinion, that the 17. Article doth make the will of God, not sinne, the true and primary cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, &amp; therefore they recited it at large in the Latine Copy.</note>
               <hi>and Reprobation, as the Church of England beleeueth, and
teacheth in the booke of the Articles of Faith in the Article
of Predestination.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:15708:51"/>
Last of all, I vttered these words rashly against <hi>Caluin</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
a man that hath very well deserued of the Church of
God; to wit, that he durst presume to lift vp himselfe
aboue the High, and Almighty God. By which words I
confesse that I haue done great iniurie to that most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and right godly man: and I doe most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you all, to pardon this my rashnesse: as also in that

this most grieuous offence, which I haue publikely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to this most famous Vniuersity, which is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of true Religion, and sacred receptacle of Piety; And
I doe promise, that (by Gods helpe,) I will neuer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
offend in the like sort: and I doe earnestly beseech
you (Right worshipfull,) and all others to whom I
haue giuen this offence, either in the former Articles, or
in any part of my said Sermon, that you would of your

            <p>That the authoritie, and consequence of this prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

briefely relate, both the occasion, and the carriage of it.
One Maister <hi>Barret</hi> of Kayes Colledge, Preaching a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio
ad Clerum</hi> in Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Church in Cambridge, on

incurred the penaltie of the 45. <hi>Statute of that Vniuersity,
De Concionibus:</hi> and by vertue and tenor of that Statute
they decreed and adiudged the said <hi>Barret</hi> to make a
publike Recantation, in such words and forme as should
bee prescribed vnto him by the Vice-chancellor, and
the said Heads, or any three, or two of them; or ese
vpon his refusall to recant in this manner, to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

binding him likewise in an assumpsit of forty
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15708:52"/>
pounds to appeare personally vpon two dayes warning,
before the said Vice-chancellor, or his Deputy, at what
time and place they should require. Afterwards this
<hi>Barret</hi> was re-summoned before the <hi>Vice-chancellor, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
Goade, Dr Tindall, Dr. Barwell, and Doctor Preston,
his assistants,</hi> who deliuered him this praecedent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation
in writing; admonishing and peremptorily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning
him on Saturday following, being the 10. of
May, immediatly after the <hi>Clerum</hi> ended, to goe vp in
person into the Pulpit of Saint <hi>Maries,</hi> where hee had
published these errors, and there openly in the face of
the Vniuersity, to read and make this Recantation, which
he did accordingly. Not long after this <hi>Palinodium,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Barret,</hi> (to shew that these positions are but a
bridge to Popery) departs the Vniuersitie, and gets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea; where he (as <hi>Bertius,</hi> and some other <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
since haue done) turnes a professed Papist: After
this he returned into England, where he liues a Laymans
life, being still an open, dangerous, violent, and most
pernicious and seducing Papist, as some men of credit in
these very termes haue informed me, who both know,
and will auerre him to be such a one.</p>
            <p>This is the true Relation and carriage of this Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I haue taken <hi>verbatim</hi> out of a Transcript of
the <hi>Vniuersitie Register of Cambridge,</hi> vnder the Registers
owne hand; wherein all the passages of it are entred
and recorded, for the benefit of posteritie. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation
it selfe, (of which <hi>Thysius,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">BB <hi>Carlton</hi> his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>Mountagues</hi> Appeale. cap. 2</note> others make
some mention) it was fairely Printed and Published in
Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, (some Copies of it being yet
extant) in the very selfesame words, and forme as here
you see it. And that none may suspect it to be forged, or
corrupted: I haue a transcript of it in Latine, taken out
of an Originall Coppy vnder <hi>Master Barets</hi> owne hand:
which agrees <hi>verbatim</hi> with this English one, onely in
this they differ: that our 17. Article is at large recited
in the Latine Coppy in the ende of the 6. Section, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:15708:53"/>
as it is onely named in the English.</p>
            <p>From this Recantation, and the carriage of it; it
is cleerely euident; That the Vniuersitie of <hi>Cambridge</hi>
in those dayes, did vndoubtedly beleeue and maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the now Arminian Heresies <hi>of the finall and totall
Apostasie of the Saints: Of vncertainety of Saluation; of
Election from faith, and Reprobation from sinne foreseene.
Of a personall, not a reall difference, betweene temporary
and true sauing Faith:</hi> (the Points which <hi>Barret</hi> recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
to be not onely <hi>false and erronious;</hi> but likewise <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
repugnant to the Religion and Doctrine, established and
setled in the Church of England, and to the 17. Article:</hi> For
so are the expresse words of the Order, and Articles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in the Vniuersitie Register: If they were thus
euidently repugnant to them then; I doubt not but they
are so now: at leastwise in all Cambridge mens repute,
who will not (at leastwise should not) so farre dishonor
their renowned Mother, as to degenerate from her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Orthodoxe and Dogmaticall Resolutions.</p>
            <p>These are the more ancient publike Monuments, and
Euidences of our Church, by which the subsequent
Conclusions now in Issue must bee iudged. The seuerall
figures inserted into them, and likewise placed in the
Margent, haue reference to the 7. Anti-Arminian Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
following: the figure of (1) noting out such passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as punctually confirme the first: the figure of (2)
such clauses as euidently backe and proue the second of
these Assertions, and so euery figure successiuely, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to its proper Position. If then all these Records
which doe either Really containe, or at leastwise, eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declare, the ancient, established, and receiued
Doctrine of the Church of England, giue punctuall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
for these Conclusions, oppugning the contrary
Arminian <hi>Theses in terminis,</hi> or substance, as they doe;
this question will be then resolued: and our succeeding
Anti-Arminian Conclusions acknowledged the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Doctrines of our Church, without any more debate.</p>

Ghospell to her.</hi> This then was the receiued Doctrine of
our Church in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes; as our 17. <hi>Article</hi>
which was then composed; together with our Homelies
forequoted will euince; there being no approued Writer
of our Church now extant, that did oppugne it in that
age: and should we begin to doubt it now? If any obiect
that Master <hi>Iohn Bradford</hi> in his <hi>Summe of the Doctrine of
Praedestination and Reprobation;</hi> affirmes, <hi>that our owne
wilfulnesse, sinne, and contemning of Christ, are the cause
of Reprobation,</hi> therefore this doctrine was not then so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
receiued: I answere, First, that <hi>Master Bradfords</hi>
explanation of himselfe in the subsequent li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es will take
off this obiection: For he informes vs, that he <hi>speakes only
of the second cause of Reprobation</hi> (that is of the execution,
not of the Decree of Reprobation) which is <hi>onely sinne,
not of the first cause of it,</hi> (the thing we haue now in quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion)
<hi>which we cannot comprehend,</hi> it being the vnsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
will of God, <hi>which we should not search into, further
then God doth giue vs leaue in his VVord.</hi> Secondly, that
Master <hi>Bradford</hi> speakes this onely to silence Reprobates
and damned men, aduising them to looke first vpon their
owne sinnes which bring damnation and Gods hatred on
them, not vpon Gods secret Decree of Reprobation,
which as it doth not impose a necessitie of sining vpon men,
so it neuer brings da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ation on them but for sinne: M. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
then speaking only of the actuall execution of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
not of the Decree it selfe: of the secondary cause of
it, not of the first, which is onely the vnsearcheable will
of God, makes wholy for our present Tenent, not against
it. The selfe-same answere may be giuen to that of Bishop
<hi>Hooper</hi> in his Epistle to the Christian Reader. praefixed
before his <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Commandements, where
he writes thus: <hi>The cause of reiection or damnation is sinne
in man, which will neither receiue the promise of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
&amp;c.</hi> Where <hi>reiection,</hi> is put, for the execution of
Reprobation, or actuall damnation, (as this disiunctiue
or explanatorie coniunction <hi>or the cause of reiection or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>)
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:15708:64"/>
and this marginall note: <hi>The cause of damnation in
man;</hi> annexed to it, due infalliblie demonstrate: of which
euery man doth readily acknowledge sinne to be the onely
cause: not for the Decree of Reprobation, which hath no
other primarie moouing or impulsiue cause, but Gods
meere will and pleasure: these writers then make wholy
for vs, not against vs, if rightly vnderstood.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15708:68"/>
the point of Free-will, with all the Authors in the three
former Positions, and my owne Perpetuitie of a Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
mans estate, page 9. to 38. All these, I say, doe fully
testifie, that there is no such Free-will, or vniuersall and
sufficient grace deriued vnto all men, by which they may
repent, belieue, and be saued if they will themselues.</p>
            <p>Now because this vniuersall Grace, or Free-will in
man, is the onely center vpon which the whole fabricke of
Arminianisme is erected; by the vndermining of which
alone, the whole superstruction, both of Pelagianisme,
Popery, Arminianisme, and Libertinisme, are vtterly
subuerted, I will briefely oppugne it with these seuerall
atheisticall, blasphemous, absurd, and dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
which will necessarily result and issue from it;
and those conditionall and secondary Decrees of Praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which are built vpon it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, it ouerturnes the euerlasting and irreuersible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of Election and Reprobation: for if euery man may
beleeue, repent, and be saued if he will himselfe, then it
ineuitably followes, that there is no aeternall nor immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Decree of Praedestination either way: whence our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians
to support this rotten Idoll of Free-will, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to maintaine a conditionall, mutable, generall, and
confused Decree of Praedestination onely; which in truth
is no Decree: not absolute, immutable, and particular:
by which they vtterly abolish the whole Decree, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Praedestination; and then marke the consequence:
If no Praedestination,<note n="a" place="margin">See Rom. 8. 29. 30. c. 11. 5. 6. 7. Eph. 1. 3. to 13. 2. Tim. 1. 9. c. 2. 19. 1. Thes. 5. 9. 2 Thes. 2. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>no vocation, no iustification, no
faith, no saluation; Praedestination being the originall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of all these, and the maine foundation both of grace and
glory,</hi> as the Scriptures, and all Writers teach vs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it makes the fickle, wauering, and
vnconstant will of man, the very basis and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
of all Gods immutable, and aeternall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
concerning man: where as God onely<note n="b" place="margin">Eph 1. 9. 11.</note> 
               <hi>workes and
orders all things,</hi> (as the Scriptures certifie vs) according
<hi>to the counsell of his owne will,</hi> not according to the bent and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15708:68"/>
inclination of our wills: by which it subordinates
God to man, and subiects his aeternall purposes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
Decrees, to sundry mutabilities, to his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and our great discomfort.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it makes man an independent creature, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
exempts him wholy from the disposing and ouer-ruling
prouidence of his great Creator: it makes the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trowler
of the world, a bare spectator, not an orderer or
disposer of humane actions: it causeth God with all his
counsels and designes, to daunce attendance vpon the will
of man, not man to depend vpon the soueraigne will and
pleasure of his God, (for<note n="c" place="margin">Rom 11. 36. Col. 1. 16. Reu. 4. 11. Pro. 16 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>whose onely will and pleasure he
was at first created,</hi>) as if God were made for man, not man
for God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it constitutes an absolute and independent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
being and will in man, praeexistent to the aeternall will of
God, not onely in nature, but in time: For if Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
and euerlasting Decrees, haue their resultancie from
the will of man, as the sampler hath from the coppy, the
picture from the body, the structure from the plat-forme,
or me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s after-determinations, from antecedent euents, as
our Arminians teach vs: then mans will must not onely
necessitate, and in some sort praedetermine the most free
and absolute purposes of God, (which by this meanes take
their rise and being from the creature, as if God were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient,
not all-compleate, and absolute in himselfe:)
but it must likewise haue a selfe-dependance or praeexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
to them, both in time and nature: which were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but to deifie the will of man, in giuing it an aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
being, both in and from it selfe, exempted from any
antecedent or fore-ordaining will of God.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it dethrones and pulls God out of heauen, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
depriuing him, not onely of his all-disposing prouidence
in ouer-swaying and controling the very wills and workes
of men: but likewise of his absolute soueraignty and power
ouer all his creatures<note n="g" place="margin">Iob. 9. 5. to 13. Psal. 115. 3. Psal. 135. 6. Dan. 2. 21. c. 4. 25. 35. c. 5. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his libertie to

then men might saue themselues when God would damne
them, yea, damne themselues when God would saue
them: an atheisticall and blasphemous consequent, which
defeates Gods power and supremacie in the ordering
and disposall of his creatures, both at once.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, it spoiles the Lord of the very glory, praise,

care to saue themselues, by a generall strength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

whatsoeuer, vpon this false praesumption; that hee may
praesently of himselfe repent, and so be saued after all his

to Gods especiall and peculiar loue; more discomfortable

of all repentance and saluation, from the sonnes of men.
For if our conuersion saluation, grace, and glorie, are

if none, let none beleeue it; But if it be thus generally infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
then tell me how or when: whether with the soule, or
after it? whether in the embrio, infancy, child-hood, youth,

whereby it wills all common ciuill things: and so a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
power, not a grace: If after it, I dare presume no
prying Arminian can tell me, how, or when. If in riper
yeeres, in youth, or in child-hood onely: then infants want
it who depart this life, and so it is not vniuersall: If in the
very wombe or infancy of all men, then God bestowes it
when and where it is but vselesse, and so doth things in
vaine: since infants (especially those that dye before dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion)
cannot tell how to act it, or to imbrace saluation
by it: If in neither of all these seasons, then not at all, and
so there is no such grace; all which being laid together,
will euidently discouer this Pelagian, Popish, and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
grace, to be in truth meere nature, and so vnable of it

            <p>Adde we to these replies, some other of our owne. First,
that Christ Iesus truely dyed for all men, in regard of<note n="t" place="margin">Phil. 2, 7, 8. He. 2, 14. 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>that
assumed common humanity in which he suffered,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it selfe indifferently vnto all: not in respect of the essi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
Redemption which he merited, by his suffering,
which is impropriated to the Elect alone: Secondly,
Christ dyed indefinitely for all men, in as much as<note n="u" place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 25 Ro. 11. 1, to 8 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>no
particular men whiles they liue on earth can truely say, that
they are actually excluded from the benefits of his death:</hi> not
because they are all particularly redeemed by his death.

Redemption, Iustification, Sanctification and Saluation, the

               <hi>by his death he hath purchased an absolute soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and dominion ouer all, to order, rule, and guide them at his

their workes:</hi> not because he hath procured an absolute en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchisement

These seuerall answers warranted by Scriptures, Fathers,
and the fore-quoted Authors, will reconcile all seeming
repugnancies of Scripture, and answere all obiections
against this fift Conclusion.</p>
            <p>Before I passe ouer this Conclusion, I must needs take
off one principall daring obiection,<note place="margin">Obiection,</note> with which our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians
doe encounter, it in this Syllogisticall dispute.</p>
            <p>That which euery man is peremptorily bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15708:77"/>
must needs be true; for God binds no man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
a lye, because he is truth itselfe.</p>
            <p>But euery man, as well the reprobate as the elect, is
peremptorily bound to beleeue, that Christ Iesus dyed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
for his sinnes; since euery man is obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in Christ, vnder paine of aeternall damnation. Iohn,
6. 29. 1. Iohn 3. 23. Marke 16. 16. Iohn 3. 16. 17. 18.</p>
            <p>Therefore that Christ dyed effectually for all, and
euery mans sins, must needs be true.</p>
            <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> first, that the Maior is not infallible, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be with this limitation: euery thing which men are
commanded to beleeue, is true; not absolutely in any
sense, but onely in that relatiue, qualified, and peculiar
sense in which it is to be beleeued: for one and the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
proposition may be both true, and false in different
respects: For instance. These two propositions<note n="y" place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 4.</note> (<hi>God
will haue all men to bee saued:</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Christ Iesus tasted death
for all men;</hi> are true, <hi>sensu diuise:</hi> in an abstracted; not
<hi>sensu composite,</hi> in a relatiue or compounded sense: true
in the proposition, false in the application, vnlesse wee
qualifie, or restraine their generality, with the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
modifications, or their inseparably annexed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of faith and repentance, without which God will
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> haue no man to be saued. Secondly, the Minor in its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> &amp; absolute sence, is meerely false: First, because there
are millions of men, (as Ideots, Lunatiques, Infants, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
by an inuincible, necessitated, and vnauoidable
ignorance) who are not peremptorily bound to beleeue,
that Christ Iesus dyed effectually for their sinnes,<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 2. 12. 14. 15. Iohn 9. 41. c. 15. 22. Acts 14. 16. 17. c. 17. 30. 31.</note> 
               <hi>neither
is infidelitie a damnable sinne in them,</hi> (Arminians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
confessing it, who desperatly affirme, that Pagans,
or Infidels may be saued) because there was an absolute
impossibility in them to beleeue, by reason of the incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the meanes in the one, and the ineuitable want of
meanes in the other. Secondly, because all those to whom
the Gospell is preached (who are scarce the tithe of all
the world) are not bound to beleeue, that Christ dyed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15708:77"/>
effectually for their sinnes in an absolute sence, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected:
but onely in a qualified, limited and restrained, to

               <hi>that Christ Iesus died
not thus for them, and that they shall be damned, if they are
not thus qualified:</hi> The onely absolute proposition then to
be beleeued and rested vpon by all men, is not this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
or irrestrained Conclusion: Christ Iesus died actually
or absolutely for all and euery man whatsoeuer, (the
ground of libertinisme, prochrastination, and all propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
among Christians,) but this; Christ Iesus dyed effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
for all true paenitent and beleeuing sinners, who
lay hold vpon his merits: (which cuts off all hopes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from prochrastinating and vnrepenting sinners: who
obstinaly proceed in sinfull curses,) and then this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> hee died effectually for all and euery mans
sinnes whatsoeuer, is but a meere inconsequent. Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
because the Scriptures enioyne no reprobate or wicked
man to beleeue at first, that Christ died effectually for his
sinnes: but onely,<note n="d" place="margin">Acts 2. 37. 8. c, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>to repent and beleeue in Christ, that so
his sinnes may be done away:</hi> The Scriptures indeed doe
binde all faithfull and relenting siners to beleeue, e <hi>that
their sinnes are actually forgiuen, and effectually purged by
the death of Christ:</hi> but for those who are yet out of Christ,
there is no such precept; they must first be really ingraffed
into Christ, &amp; then beleeue it: not first beleeue it: &amp; then be
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>graffed, else they should beleeue a lye, in beleeuing their
sinnes are actually purged, ere they are, because a man must
be first in Christ before his iniquities can be washed away
by his soule-clensing blood. Fourthly, admit that euery man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
were obliged to beleeue that Christ died effectually for
his sinnes: yet it followes not, that therefore Christ died
effectually for all men. First, because euery man may bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
bound to beleeue particularly for himselfe, (because hee
knoweth nothing to the contrary,) that Christ died for his
sinnes, and yet it followes not, that therefore hee must
beleeue that he died effectually for all mens sinnes: It is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15708:78"/>
no good consequent to say, that euery man must paticular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeue that he is elected: Therefore he must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
beleeu that euery man is elected: or that euery man must
beleeue that he shall be saued, therefore, that all and euery
man shall be saued. It followes not: that because euery
man is bound to beleeue that himselfe, or any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
man (whose case he cannot know nor yet determine)
are no reprobates; therefore there are no reprobates in the
world. This kind of argument from euery indiuiduall to the
speecies will not hold: This then is but a meere nonsequitur,
euery particular man must beleeue that Christ died effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
for himselfe: <hi>Ergo</hi> he dyed thus for all men: this
is the onely force of the praesent argument in which our
Arminians vaunt and triumph; therefore it is but vaine, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> &amp; nugatory. Secondly, because the Scriptures, (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
will of God) oblige men to beleeue such things,
as God neuer purposed nor intended to accomplish in his
secret will, in that way and course as they beleeue them:
<hi>Abraham</hi> was bound to beleeue (<hi>yea</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 22, 1, to 19. Heb. 11 17. 18. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and he did beleeue
it</hi>) that <hi>God did really intend the sacrificing of his dearest</hi>
Isaack, <hi>because he actually enioyned him to doe it, yet God
intended not the vnnaturall shedding of</hi> Isaacks <hi>blood, but</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 22, 16. 17.</note> 
               <hi>the admirable probate of</hi> Abrahams <hi>faith:</hi> The Niniuites
were bound to beleeue, and they did beleeue, that peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
Praediction of the Prophet <hi>Ionah:</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Ionah. 3. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>yet forty dayes and
Niniue shall be destroyed:</hi> yet God intended their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
onely, not their ruine. Our Arminians (if their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
be true, and their prayers faithfull,) are necessarily
obliged to beleeue, that God will haue mercy on all men
whatsoeuer, because they pray to God, to haue mercy
vpon all men, in the distributiue and largest sence; yet
God intendeth not<note n="k" place="margin">Exo. 33. 19. Ro. 9. 15. 17.</note> 
               <hi>to haue mercy, neither hath he mercy
vpon all without exception:</hi> So wee may bee bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that Christ Iesus died effectually for all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
if there be any one such text of Scripture which
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands vs to beleeue it: (as ther is not,) because the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth record it: yet God may not intend the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
application of his death to all men, no more then
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15708:78"/>
in those parallell cases: Neither will this consequence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow: that we then beleeue a lye; or that Gods
secret will, is contradictory to his reuealed: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <note n="l" place="margin">2. Cron. 20. 20. Iuke 24. 25. Gal. 6. 16. Iohn 10. 21. 2. Pet. 1. 19.</note> 
               <hi>the reuealed, not the vayled</hi> will of God, which we
cannot diue particularly into;) is the <hi>sole rule of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the only obiect of our faith,</hi> so that in beleeuing it,
we neither falsefy Gods open, nor crosse his secret will, nor
yet deceiue our selues in beleeuing of a lye. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
his reuealed will, is but subordinate or subseruient,
(not contrary, nor aduerse) to his secret will which it
doth still accomplish, and with which it doth all times
cooperate, as diuers from it, yet not repugnant to it. God
brings, men bring their secret ends and purposes to passe,
by seeming contradictory meanes which seeme to thwart
or vary from their purposes, yet there is a sweet concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
&amp; no repugnancie betweene their ends, their meanes,
their purposes, and their method to accomplish them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the one is wholy subordinate to the other, and
aymes at their accomplishment. The wheeles in a clocke,
the spheeres in heauen, the water and the mill, haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
motions, yet they concur and sweetly accord in the
same effect, without any contrariety: The strings of an
Instrument, voyces in a Quire, haue different sounds,
yet they make vp one pleasant and harmonious consort:
the stones in a building, the roomes in an house, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a haeterogenious body, are discrepant and various
in themselues; yet they all accord &amp; meete in one intiretie
So the secret and reuealed will of God, if wee sunder, or
disioine them, may seeme to iarre and contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
but if wee consider the one as subordinate to the
other, and so linke them both together, we shall find them
sweetly clasping and kissing each the other, without the
least dissent, the one of them effecting and fulfilling the
designes and purposes of the other without any clash or
iarre: which answers those Arminian cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ls to the full,
which say we set Gods wills at variance by our doctrines.
And thus much for our fist Conclusion.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To the first of these, I answer:<note place="margin">Answer.</note> First, that this text speaks
onely of the reprobate and <hi>stiffenecked Iewes:</hi> of <hi>vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
hearts and eares,</hi> who cannot but resist the externall
profers of Gods grace: not of the elect and chosen of God
among the Iewes,<note n="p" place="margin">Acts 2. 37. to 42.</note> 
               <hi>three thousand of which were conuerted
at one Sermon.</hi> Secondly, the spirit which these Iewes did
here resist, was the spirit of prophesie, not of regeneration:
it was the word of the holy Ghost vttered by those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
which they slew and stoned. ver. 52. which soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
onely in their eares: not the renuing and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
operation of Gods spirit which wrought effectually
in their hearts. Thirdly, this was onely an externall resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of <hi>the</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">v. 52. &amp; Mat 23. 34. 35. 1. Thes. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>holy Ghost in others:</hi> not an intrinsecall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of him, or of his operations in themselues: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its nothing to the point in quaestion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To the second, I answer: First, that Christ here speaks
only of a gathering of them by the externall ministry of his
Prophets, and messengers which they stoned: (as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part of the verse. <hi>O Hierusalem, Hierusalem, thou that
killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent vnto thee:
how often would I haue gathered, &amp;c.</hi> with verse 34. 35.
doe infallibly proue:) not by the internall regenerating ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his spirit, the onely thing in quaestion which they
could not resist. Secondly, I answer, with<note n="r" place="margin">Enchirideon. cap. 97.</note> 
               <hi>Saint Augustine</hi>
and<note n="s" place="margin">Lib. 1. Disti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacio. 46.</note> 
               <hi>Peter Lumbard:</hi> That the meaning of these words
is not: that those whom Christ would gather did resist or
disobay his call: but that <hi>Heirusalems</hi> Rulers, with the
Scribes and Phareses were vtterly vnwilling that Christ
should gather those whom he did call: The summe and drift
of these words is onely this: I by ministry would haue
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15708:83"/>
gathered <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and her Sonnes vnto me; but you
Scribes and Phareses (for to them alone, not to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
was this speach directed, as the whole series of the
chapter, from the 2. verse to the end, doth irrefragably
witnesse) would not permit me:<note n="t" place="margin">t Sec Iohn 7. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>for you withstood my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry:</hi>
yea, those that I did conuert and call, it was against
your wills:<note n="u" place="margin">Iohn 9. 22.</note> 
               <hi>who agreed, that of any man did confesse that
I was Christ, he should be thrust out of the Synagouge:</hi> This
is the whole scope and substance of the place which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
but this against vs. The Scribes and Phareses did
resist Christs ministry, in hindering him from preaching to
the people: Or Christ did conuert men against the Phareses
wils: therefore the Elect may finally &amp; totally resist the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
working power of the Spirit in the very Act of
their conuersion: a grosse Non-sequitur: which hurts
not this conclusion. All whom Christ effectually called,
when he was on earth:<note n="x" place="margin">Mat, 4. 18. to 23. c. 9. 9. Mar. 1. 16. to 21. c. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>as Andrew, Peter, Mathew, Luke,
and the rest of his Disciples, did readily leaue all to follow him
without the least resistance or delay:</hi> therefore all who are
thus inwardly called by his grace and spirit, doe so now.</p>

from the very infancy of her reformation to this praesent;
not one of them so much as as once oppugning the truth or
orthodoxie of all or any of them; and shall wee, may mee,
can we now be so ridiculously absurd, so audaciously irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
as once to question; whether they are the receiued
Doctrines of our Church or no? Doutlesse if the Church
of <hi>England</hi> hath any Truthes or Doctrines in her, these
must, these cannot but be they; since I dare boldly auerre,
because I doubt not but to proue it; that no points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
whatsoeuer, (no not the points of Iustification by
faith alone, of Transubstantiation, or of the Sacrament in
both kinds,) haue beene more punctually, frequently,
vnanimously, and copiously defended, then all, or most of
these, who haue all the learned of our Church their open
and professed Aduocates.</p>
            <p>If any man now be so strangly obdurated, so wilfully blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Popish &amp; Arminian Errors, that he will not yet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> let him giue
me leaue to vouch some other Praecedents and Records
which shall force him to confesse it. The intire Church of
<hi>England</hi> consists of three grand members: The Church of
<hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Church of Ireland.</note> the <hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
the mother or mistres of the other two: If then I can vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
euidence, that these three seuerall Churches did
constantly heretofore, and doe as yet vnanimously acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
defend, and iustify these our Anti-Arminian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
the victory, triall, and points in praesent issue must
be yeelded to me.</p>

in which I am perswaded the same Doctrine which I
haue this day handled is not obscurely deliuered: not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all our Articles were composed by the Disciples of <hi>Bucer</hi>
and <hi>Martyr,</hi> but euen out of the very words and meaning of
the Confession: and so he proceeds to proue his Doctrine to
be warranted by our 17. Article by 5. seuerall Arguments.</p>
            <p>The second Witnesse is Reuerend Bishop <hi>Carlton</hi>
in his <hi>Examination of Master</hi> Mountagues <hi>Appeale cap. 2.</hi>
where he writes thus.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was <hi>reformed</hi> by the helpe of
our learned and Reuerend <hi>Bishops,</hi> in the dayes of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, and in the beginning of the Raigne of
Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> They who then gaue that forme of
reformation to our Church, held consent in Doctrine with
<hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> being by authority
appointed Readers in the two Vniuersities: and with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then liuing, whom they Iudged to be of best learning
and soundnesse in the reformed Churches: and of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
especially with St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and were carefull to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:15708:93"/>
hold this Vnity amongst themselues, and with the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches. For that these worthy Bishops who were
in the first reformation, had this respect vnto <hi>P. Martyr,</hi>
and <hi>M. Bucer,</hi> it is apparent, both because the Doctrine
of our Church doth not differ from the Doctrine that these
taught, and because that worthy Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>
caused our Leiturgy to be Translated into Latine, and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the consent and iudgement of <hi>M. Bucer,</hi> who gaue
a full consent thereto, as it appeareth in his workes, <hi>Inter
opera Anglicana.</hi> And <hi>P. Martyr</hi> being likewise request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
writeth in his <hi>Epistles</hi> touching that matter, his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and consent of the gouerment and discipline of our
Church.</p>
            <p>This vniformity of Doctrine was held in our Church
without disturbance, as long as those worthy Bishops liued,
who were employed in the reformation.</p>
            <p>For albeit the <hi>Puritanes</hi> disquieted out Church about
their conceiued <hi>Discipline,</hi> yet they neuer mooued any
quarrell against the Doctrine of our Church, which is well
to be obserued. For if they had embraced any Doctrine
which the Church of <hi>England</hi> denied, they would assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haue quarrelled about that aswell, as they did about the
Discipline. But it was then the open confession both of
the <hi>Bishops</hi> and of the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> that both parts embraced
a mutuall consent in Doctrine, onely the difference was in
matter of inconformity: Then hitherto there was no <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane
Doctrine</hi> knowne.</p>
            <p>The first disturbers of this vniformity in Doctrine, were
<hi>Barret</hi> and <hi>Baroe</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and after them <hi>Thompson.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arret</hi> and <hi>Baroe</hi> began this breach in the time of that most
Reuerend Prelate, Arch-Bishop <hi>Whitgift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that these had attempted to disturbe
the Doctrine of our Church, yet was the vniformity of
Doctrine still maintained.</p>
            <p>For when our Church was disquieted by <hi>Barret</hi> and
<hi>Baro,</hi> the Bishops that then were in our Church, examined
the new Doctrine of these men, and vtterly disliked and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:15708:93"/>
reiected it: And in the point of Predestination confirmed
that which they vnderstood to bee the Doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> against <hi>Barret</hi> and <hi>Baro,</hi> who oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that Doctrine.</p>
            <p>This was fully declared by<note n="*" place="margin">If this were the Doctrine of both our Arch-Bishops and Bishops then, I doubt not but it is their Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine now, or else they are much dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from these their worthy Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.</note> both the Arch-Bishops,
<hi>Whitgift</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops and learned men of both Prouinces, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<hi>Barret</hi> and <hi>Baro,</hi> refuted their Doctrine, and iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the contrary, as appeareth by that Booke, which both
the Arch-Bishops then compiled.</p>
            <p>The same Doctrine which the Bishops then maintained,
was at diuers times after approued, as in the <hi>Conference at
Hampton Court,</hi> as will be hereafter confirmed. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
it was confirmed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Articles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the time of our late Soueraigne, <hi>Articulo</hi> 38.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Appeale pleadeth against the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
of <hi>Lambheth,</hi> and iustifieth the Doctrine of <hi>Barret,
Baro</hi> and <hi>Thomson,</hi> auerring the same to be the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he doth not by naming of those men, whose names
he knew would bring no honour to this cause: but by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
downe and iustifying their doctrines, and suggesting
that they who maintained the doctrines contained in the
<hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Lambheth,</hi> are <hi>Caluinists</hi> and <hi>Puritanes:</hi> So
that those Reuerend Arch-Bishops, <hi>Whitgift</hi> and <hi>Hutton,</hi>
with the Bishops of our Church, who then liued, are in his
iudgement to be reiected as <hi>Puritans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The question is, Whether of these two positions wee
must now receiue for the doctrines of our Church: that
which <hi>Barret, Baro,</hi> and <hi>Thompson</hi> would haue brought
in, which doctrines were then refuted and reiected by our
Church; Or that doctrine which the Bishops of our
Church maintained against these men, which doctrine hath
been since vpon diuers occasions approued? If ther were no
more to be said, I dare put it to the Issue before any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Iudges. Thus far this reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Bp. whose testimony alone

adhaered to</hi> St. Augustine <hi>in these points,</hi> (speaking before of
some Anti-Arminian conclusions, all which are fully related

haue likewise constantly adhaered to him: And if to him,

false testimony in the points in Issue: besides, his testimony
is wauering, dubious, and repugnant to it selfe, and it hath
beene counterpleaded by diuers of our Church, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
disclaimed by most, as false and spurious: Therefore
it doth but weaken, yea, betray their cause, and strengthen
oures. The last of these being transported beyond himselfe
with metaphisicall Contemplations, to his owne infamy,
and his renowned Mothers shame, (I meane the famous
<hi>Vniuersity of Oxford,</hi> who grieues for his defection, from
whose duggs he neuer suckt his poysonous Doctrines,) as
his euidence is intricate and obscure beyond the reach or

for their title to our Church. These are the only euidences
and Authors to my knowledge that our Arminian Tenents
can produce to interest them in our Church; and these, (all
circumstances, being well confidered,) make flat against
them: since our Chuch hath vtterly disauowed and distasted
them, reiecting, yea condemning these their writings, as
diametrally opposite to her established Doctrines. If any
Arminian can produce any other English Writers whom
our Church approues, to patronize these errors, I shall be
willing to be informed of them; for my owne part I neuer
met with any but with these. I confesse, that some would
