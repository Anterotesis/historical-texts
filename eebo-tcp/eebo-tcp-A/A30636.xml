         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>OF all the Attributes are
owned by the Deity, This
whereon I have engag'd my Pen,
is the most remarkable and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
Which I undertook the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and with the more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
because I knew that if I did
come short in my Discourses on
it (as who ever enterpriz'd it
must) I had my consolation in
my Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39294:5"/>
It is Divine Goodness to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of what a Person hath, and
not of what he hath not. I know
that God is great, as well as good,
that he is in Heaven, and we on
Earth; and that therefore as in
our addresses to him, so in our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of him, our words should
be few. But I also know, what <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
observ'd before me, that he
is <hi>Opt. Max.</hi> that he is first Good,
and then Great, and that he glories
in his Goodness, as his greatest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
[His making of his Sun
to rise on the Evil, and on the Good,
and his sending Rain on the Just,
and on the unjust, is called his
<hi>Perfection,</hi> and indeed is so, 'tis,
<hi>be you perfect, as your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once, it is the Interest and Cause
<pb facs="tcp:39294:5"/>
of God I plead in this Essay, and
so much, that all Religion is
concerned in it. For 'tis an
apprehension of the Goodnesse,
and Bounty, and Beneficence of
God, that established in Mens
hearts doth powerfully tie them
to Adore, Obey, and Serve him.
<hi>There is Mercy</hi> (sayes the
Royal Psalmist) <hi>with thee,
that thou mayest be feared.</hi>
It was for this Reason that he
prefaced the <hi>Law</hi> he gave the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> with a Repitition of
the benefits, which had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued
to them by him, <hi>I am the
Lord thy God, which have
brought thee out of the Land
of</hi> Egypt, <hi>out of the House of
Bondage, Thou shalt,</hi> &amp;c.
Namely to imprint upon them a
<pb facs="tcp:39294:6"/>
due sence of all his Obligations
and Engagements, that having first
possess'd them of a rational and
well establish'd Love, he might
afterwards the better influence
them by it, to a due respect to all
his commands. ['Tis, <hi>if you love
me keep my commands.</hi>] And
the Holy <hi>Evangel,</hi> wherein Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God is admirably repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
as most infinitely Loving,
Gratious, and Benigne, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, intention or design has it,
but by so ample proof and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Divine Love to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with man for his, that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he may love, and loving he
may serve and obey? This is the
Evangellical Obedience; that
of Faith, which workes by
Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39294:6"/>
Thus our Love to God it is the
life of all our Devotion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him, and his Benignity
and kindnesse unto us, it is the
ground of all our love. And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
knows it well enough, and
therefore he is so industrious (for
<hi>we are not ignorant of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi>)
to instil into the minds of
men, hard and frightful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the great God; as that he
rules by will; <hi>that</hi> he hath no
consideration in the world of his
Creatures comfort, but onely of
his own Glory, <hi>that</hi> he made the
greatest part of Men to damne
them, and triumphs in their Ruin;
and <hi>that</hi> he cruelly exacts impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities,
and obliges Men to come,
when yet he knowes they cannot.
And that <hi>Evil One</hi> is intimate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb facs="tcp:39294:7"/>
with all our minds, to know
that if he can but once perswade
them, that the Master, whom we
are to serve is most Tyrannicall
and hard, and that he <hi>reapeth,
where he hath not sown, and
gathereth, where he hath not
strewed</hi>; no question, but we
will away, and <hi>dig and hide our
Lords money,</hi> as that unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
servant did.</p>
            <p>So much it is the interest of
God and True Religion, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Benignity be vindicated; a
work as necessary now as ever,
when <hi>Lucretius</hi> is as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
as <hi>Moses,</hi> and when there
are almost as many, who blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
dispute Divine Goodnesse,
as there are that seriously believe
it. And it is with those I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39294:7"/>
In doing which I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to acquit my self, not onely
<hi>Philosophically</hi> by alledging
Reasons which Philosophy, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense, and the Natures of the
things I treat of, do suggest to me,
but also as a <hi>Christian,</hi> by blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with those other, such conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
also as the sacred Oracles
(whereon I most relie) do prompt
me with; not insisting on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
(which yet too many do) but
as they have the countenance and
favour of the latter.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>Sir,</hi> is what <hi>I</hi> offer you.
Be pleased to accept an <hi>Essay</hi>

            <head>AN
ADVERTISEMENT
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE Method I have taken
in the following Discourse,
is to second the evince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which I urge from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reason, or Nature, with the
suffrage of the sacred Oracles.
Which that the Reader may not
mis-interpret, and accuse of want
of judgement, seeing my preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are against the Atheist, who
believes not Scripture; he is to
know, that there are <hi>Reasons</hi> for
the Atheist, which though to
make them more perspicuous, and
convincing, I have backed with
the verdicts of the gravest <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,</hi>
and to shew them to be
also Scriptural, I have confirmed
from the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; yet I insist
<pb facs="tcp:39294:9"/>
not on them with the Atheist, as
they are Scriptural, but as they
are Reasons, Scriptural Reasons.
He may understand me, that I In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
not with him on the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but on the Reason of Scripture.</p>
            <p>And yet truely taking on me to
assert the Christian Religion, and
such Apprehensions of the Great
God, as that obligeth us to have,
I thought it point of Duty, not
onely to produce Reasons, and
Notions, that might satisfie, but
also to evince them Scriptural;
for as much as otherwise, though
they might be Philosophical, and
carry in them something of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
yet not being Scriptural,
they could not possibly be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and so answer my Ends.</p>
            <p>In Fine, to be ingenuous with
him, I was willing to annex the
Testimonies of the Scriptures, and
of Philosophers together, to all or
most of those considerations I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on from Nature, or Reason,
that I might insinuate into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist
<pb facs="tcp:39294:9"/>
a good belief of Scriptures;
as, <hi>that</hi> there is some conformity
in them with Nature, <hi>that</hi> they
are replenish't with recondite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and <hi>that</hi> that Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in them is a piece of
high Reason, and Philosophy.
And he cannot but believe all this,
when he shall see before his eyes,
so good a correspondency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
between them.</p>
            <p>As for the Philosophers, I have
quoted them at large, and in their
own Terms, that I might not be
suspected to abuse them, or my
Reader; but yet have so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
dispos'd the Texts, that
those, who list not to attend to
them, as perhaps a many will not,
that yet may have a mind to read
the Rest, they may skip and pass
them over, without any great
trouble or interruption.</p>
            <p>Onely one thing must be noted,
that in some of these Citations I
have made of the Philosophers, it
is the <hi>Medium,</hi> the Reason onely,
<pb facs="tcp:39294:10"/>
which I urge them for; the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi>
being mine perhaps and
not theirs; which yet I cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
be arraigned for, seeing 'tis
certain, that the Reason may be
one and the same, when yet the
matters wherein it is to hold are
innumerous. And though I have
<hi>Suppos'd</hi> a God to be, and all things
in the world to be made by Him,
'tis no more than what my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
justifies; and yet by way of
Obviation to the Atheists Cavils,
I have occasionally prov'd it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of this Discourse;
and therefore, if in Reading any
part of it, a such exception do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
I must oblige the Reader to
suspend his thoughts a little, till
it be remov'd.</p>
            <p>I intended not to give my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any further trouble here, but
on second thoughts, I crave his
pardon if I do, because it looks to
some, as if there were an irrepair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
defect in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb facs="tcp:39294:10"/>
in one Point, in as much as
I have quoted no Philosophers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it (and it is believ'd I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;)
not having given any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations</hi>
of the knowledge of a
Saviour [the greatest instance of
Divine Benignity] and of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of salvation by him, among
the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And indeed I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
declin'd the doing <hi>that,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a point that will oblige
me to a large Discourse another
where; but yet for present satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
if I should say there were
among the Heathen, some darker
intimations of that great Truth,
for which we Christians are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to the Evangel, though I
might be judged very Paradoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
therein, yet I conceive, I should
affirm nothing, but what I had
authority enough to verifie.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but that
the Ancient Heathens understood
that God was unattoneable, but
by humane blood; the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
did offer up their Children unto
<pb facs="tcp:39294:11"/>
               <hi>MOLOCH</hi> [<hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 10.] and
conformably the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plat. in Politic.</note>
who were a Colony of <hi>Canaanites,</hi>
did yearly offer some of theirs to
<hi>Saturn.</hi> Among the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. &amp; Stuckium de sacr. &amp; sacrif.</note>
the Altar of <hi>Diana Orthia</hi>
was besprinkled once a year, with
humane blood; two Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Annually elected by the Lot
for Sacrifice. Which usage,<note place="margin">Bodin de Rep. lib. 1. c. 5. Num. 34. 35.</note> as it
was highly barbarous and cruel, is
affirmed to be changed by the
great <hi>Lycurgus</hi> for a milder; he
ordaining, that the persons on
whom the Lot did fall,<note place="margin">Pausan. in Lacon.</note> instead of
being killed, should be whipped,
till the blood did flow. And with
that, they did besprinkle the Altar.</p>
            <p>This is much, but there is more.
For some of them did understand,
(if yet they understood what
their Performances implyed) not
onely that the great God was not
to be propitiated and attoned but
by humane blood; but also, that
that bloud must be the blood of
One that was <hi>to take upon him</hi> (as
<pb facs="tcp:39294:11"/>
it were) <hi>the Persons and the guilt</hi>
of all, or of an <hi>One</hi> that by his
sufferings was to purge and cleanse
the rest that offer'd him.</p>
            <p>And this is evident,<note place="margin">Nic. Leonic. Thom. de varia hist. liq. 3. cap. 33.</note> in that the
old <hi>Athenians</hi> every year in (their)
<hi>Thargelion,</hi> did sacrifice a Man and
a Woman, for the Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of their City, to Expiate and

they did sacrifice, they called<note n="*" place="margin">So the Author, but better <hi>Pharmaca.</hi>

               <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maci,</hi>
as who would say, that those
were persons, who, by being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
and offer'd up unto the
Gods, were proper <hi>Medicines</hi> to
purge and cleanse those others
(from their sins) that offer'd
them.</p>
            <p>And it will be yet more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,<note place="margin">De var. hist lib. 3. c. 106.</note>
if we consider what <hi>Leonicus

that in the <hi>most antient</hi>
times, if on any City there fell a

to the place of sacrifice; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there performed several Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
at last they burned him,
and threw his ashes into the Sea,
and so appeased the Gods. It is
not to be doubted, but that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>Figurative</hi> and <hi>Mystical</hi> did
lie in this; for otherwise they
knew, what by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is remarkable to All, that to

necessary one should die for the

that it was very fit, that one [in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

made a kind of <hi>Pharmacus</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharmus,</hi>
and so be offer'd as a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim
for the People, to settle its
Tranquility and Peace.</p>
            <p>And indeed <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> he is
the true <hi>Pharmacum</hi> and <hi>Catharma</hi>
for the whole World; it is he that
taking on him the iniquities of us

for Sin, <hi>by whose Stripes we are

to the Grecian Lustrations, as

That he did—<q>—<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
               </q>that he did by himself purge our

in his own person, he was our true

            </p>
            <p>I might also argue their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of a Saviour from
<pb facs="tcp:39294:13"/>
the many Appellations which I
find among them of their <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
as <hi>Jupiter Melichius, Jupiter Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,
Jupiter Servator,</hi> &amp;c. And
also take a hint to shew from
whence they had it, namely from
the Old and First Believers, from
whom they took this usage to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate
their <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as these
were wont to do their <hi>El,</hi> or <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
from occasional occurrents, as
<hi>El Roi, Jehovah=Nissi,</hi> &amp;c. I say,
they seem to have receiv'd these
intimations of the true Religion,
not so much from the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom
generally all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> hated;
of whom they make but little men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in their Writings, and with
whom they did not care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,

            <p>But to return, there is one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
more that I shall urge,
and that is <hi>Plato's,</hi> who seemeth
to have pointed his Disciples to

them they should adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Person,</hi> a Divine One came, who
would instruct them in the Truths
themselves, and him they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged

            <p>I confess, I never met with this
passage in the workes of <hi>Plato</hi> my
self (and yet he seemeth in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
to hint something of an

Author, who it is to be presumed,
had it in the Schools of <hi>Plato,</hi> in him
I have; and that is <hi>AEneas Gazaeus,</hi>
who introduceth <hi>Theophrastus</hi> (one
of the Persons in a Dialogue, which
he intitles so) assenting to <hi>Axithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>

            <p>There is one thing more I must
intreat the Reader not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with, and that is, that I
here annex some farther Testimonies
of Philosophers, which might indeed
have more conveniently been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their proper places, in the
Body of the Discourse it felf: but
that the Copy being out of my
hands, I was not capable of doing
that: and yet I was unwilling to

omit them, they seeming unto me
so full of evidence and clearness,
and so apt to bring a great addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of light, to what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
offer'd from others.</p>
            <p>I have said in my Discourse, that
God is therefore <hi>Liberal,</hi> Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and Beneficent, because he
is most <hi>Perfect,</hi> and is the Best Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

by <hi>Maximus Tyrius.</hi>

            <p>Again, for as much as I have said
that the Heathen understood some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the <hi>State of Happiness,</hi>
wherein Divine <hi>Bounty</hi> did at first
<pb facs="tcp:39294:15"/>
establish man, it is no other than
what <hi>Plato</hi> meaneth,<note place="margin">Plato in Politic.</note> when in his
Politicks he treateth of the <hi>Golden</hi>
Revolution under <hi>Saturn.</hi> For
he declareth <hi>that</hi> to be a time,
when God did rule, when Men
were naked, and when the Earth
afforded all things unto Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
labour; that in it Men had a
vast and comprehensive knowledg
of the nature of things, that they
did confer, and talk with the
Beasts, and that <hi>these</hi> were tame
and friendly unto one another,
and that all were subject to man.
Who seeth not in this Tradition
how agreable it is unto that of
<hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Hierocles,</hi> (besides what I
have cited out of him, about the
State of Pre-existence, which I
have evinced to be this of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence)
doth in his Definition
of Philosophy, egregiously insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
that Man in former time,
was in another Condition, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more Agreable and Happy
<pb facs="tcp:39294:15"/>
than his present, and that then He
was in Gods Image. For the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition</hi>
that he gives us of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
is to this purpose, that it is a
<hi>Restitution</hi> of a man unto his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

which he was possesled heretofore,
and withal a re-conforming of
him to the image of God. You

            <p>I had almost forgotten one pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage

that that account thereof in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>

so great advantage of it,

For my part I am astonisht at it: 'Tis
in his Discourse De <hi>Rep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therein, he introduces <hi>ERUS,</hi>
the Pamphilian, Son of one <hi>Arnie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>;
<pb facs="tcp:39294:16"/>
a Person slain in Battle, and
fabled to have risen again, the

laying him upon the (Funeral) Pile.
Him he introduces reporting to the
Inhabitants of the present World,
the Observations he had made in
the other; which he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to recount, at his return to

            <p>In fine the Method I have taken
in evincing the Benignity of God,
from the instances thereof, that are
in things, is the very same that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>

Morney,</hi> and some others do
of late, have not got a foot beyond
them. It was therefore I but hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
things on that head, because I
would oblige my Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
with these.</p>
            <p>I had many other things to add,
but I fear, I have already surfeited
the Reader, And I know it is not
fit the Gates should be too wide;
onely I will tell him, I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
more Reasons, why the Great
God defers the punishment of the
wicked, and bears with them so
long, because my subject did not
fairly lead me to it; I considering
that Patience, Long-suffering, and
forbearance of Almighty God, as
<pb facs="tcp:39294:17"/>
a great example and instance of his
Goodness, and no objection against
it. And so did the Apostle, who puts
them together. <hi>Or despisest thou the
riches of his Goodness, and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and Long suffering, not knowing
that the Goodness of God leadeth thee
to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But those who will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with this account thereof, may
be pleased to converse a while with
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> who having undertaken
in a Treatise made on purpose, to
solve this common appearance, hath
quit himself as excellently in it, as he
doth in all things else he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes.
He shews it is, <hi>that</hi> God
might be an Example of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he would have us imitate; <hi>that</hi>
the wicked might have time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
that though he doth defer
their punishment, he doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
'm? 'Tis that the Wicked may
be instruments to punish others,
and for many other Reasons, which
he mentions there.</p>
            <p>And now I'le cast my self upon
<pb facs="tcp:39294:18"/>
the Readers ingenuity and candor,
when I have once confessed freely
to him, that I have nothing else to
offer in excuse for this unusual tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass

               <p>Now, having shewed what Optimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Transcendent goodness is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it <hi>formally</hi> consists, as well as what
<hi>Foundation,</hi> and what ground it has;
it now remaineth, that I do evince it
competent to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I shall Essay
to do, (but very briefly) both from
the <hi>Metaphysics,</hi> and from <hi>Nature</hi> it
self.</p>
               <p>And there are many <hi>Topics</hi> in the
<hi>Metaphysics,</hi> which do evidently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
and evince him <hi>so</hi> Good; I shall
insist on one, That as <hi>there is a first
Being, so there is a first Good</hi>; there
is a First in every Kind, a First <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere
bonorum,</hi> as there is <hi>in genere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium</hi>;
for as much as every thing is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
First, or from it. And if there he a
Primitive and First Good, which all
inferiour ones derive from, and do
participate (as, if there be a First,
they must) It is the First Being, and
consequently it is <hi>God, which is it.</hi>
Good and Being are convertible; and
therefore the First Being is the First
Good. God is the First Being. All
Second Beings are derived from the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39294:21"/>
First Being: All Second and inferiour
Good <hi>participates</hi> the First Good.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Physics.</hi> The Divine Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timity
or Transcendent Goodness is
so <hi>remarkably impressed on the whole
Universe,</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> that excellent
Origenist, introducing God reveiwing
it in its Creation, doth also introduce
him thus commending it; <hi>God saw eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that he had made, and behold</hi>
[behold] <hi>it was very good,</hi> it was
good, very good, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and God
saw it. It was very good in Gods eye,
and therefore may be well so in Mans;
and very Good it is,</p>
               <p>For there is <hi>Nothing in the whole
world, but is good for something,</hi> if it
be not so for one thing, it is so for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and is either Good to profit,
or to please; a Verity so great, that
in the <hi>Metaphysics</hi> Bonity and Entity
are made convertible; [that cannot
be at all, that is not good.] Onely,
all inferiour is Dispersed good, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited;
so that what is eminently good
in one kind, is very rarely so in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that is seldome most useful, and
of most advantage for either Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
or Meat, which is most embellisht
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39294:21"/>
and adorn'd. The creeping Worms,
many of them, are more curiously set
off, and clad more richly, than the
noblest <hi>Animals. Solomon</hi> in all his
Glory, was not half as brave, and as
magnificent, as a <hi>Tulip</hi>; and yet a <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
that is the most beautiful and the
most fair, it is the least useful, and least
medicinal of Flowers. What is most
gaudy, is not most great, <hi>God hath
tempered the body together, giving more
abundant honour to that which lacked
it.</hi> The Goodness shining in the world,
is a <hi>Wise</hi> one, a well ordered Goodness.</p>
               <p>But to return, it were endless to
expatiate all the world over, and to
instance in the Excellencies scattered
in it, there is an admirable Majesty in
<hi>Man,</hi> and in the <hi>Heavens</hi> a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

all that view them. How infinitely

                  <hi>Beauty, Order,</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

So that, as the lower any Being

other Attibutes resulting from it, two
of which I shall consider, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Infinite <hi>Beneficence</hi> or Benignity of
God, and then his absolute <hi>Finality</hi>;
that he is good to all, as well as in
himself, and is the End of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Divine Beneficence,</hi> (wherein I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Kindness,</hi> the
<hi>Mercy, Grace, Benignity,</hi> and <hi>Bounty</hi> of
God) is <hi>that infinite Diffusiveness of
Nature, whereby he is most ready to
Communicate, and to impart the Good
is in him.</hi> A perfection so <hi>Essential</hi> to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39294:23"/>
him, that he could not be a God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not <hi>Good,</hi> without it; it being
this communicativeness, this propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Nature to impart, that in the
common Sense and Language of the
whole World, doth eminently entitle
and denominate one <hi>so.</hi> For He in
<hi>common Language</hi> is denominated a
Good, who is a Liberal, a Loving, a
Kind, a Merciful, an Appeasable, and
Bountiful Man; as also in the sacred
<hi>Scriptures, For a good Man one will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
dare to die</hi>; and for a Good, is for
a Bountiful, Benign, Merciful, Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man: One that hath obliged him
by courtefies, and is his Benefactor,
for such an one another may dare it.</p>
               <p>And such an One is God; his Name<note place="margin">Vide Arist. ubi supra.</note>

is composed of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which signifies Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience, and of the relative <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as who

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of God is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and it is
imported in that ravishing expression,
<hi>My Grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> For
were not this implyed in it, that what
sufficiency soever is in God, is in him
<hi>for the Creature,</hi> to assist and help it,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39294:24"/>
what consolation could it minister? or
what incouragement? 'Tis onely rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Sufficiency that is a consolation
or incouragement, an absolute one is
none. For God to say he has enough,
but not to give it, were to <hi>tantalize.</hi>
But God's Sufficiency is relative, he is
very liberal, and open handed, and he
cannot possibly be otherwise, because
he is so good.</p>
               <p>For all Good, <hi>it is communicative
and Diffusive, and by how much more
good a Being is</hi> (if that inelegance be
tolerable) <hi>by so much more Diffusive</hi> (as
Philosophers assure us) and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative
'tis: so that God in being
most good <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the absolutely
best, is also most Diffusive and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
It is a Scriptural connection,
that <hi>God is good and doth good</hi>; that is,
He is in proportion as propense to be
communicative, and imparting as he is
good; he is good and doth good,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. As is the Man so is his
strength, God is abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
He is the Original, Fountain,
and First Good; and so hath all Good
for others, as well as in himself.</p>
               <p>And the world shews it, for as on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39294:24"/>
Porphyrie's<hi> Tree the higher grades</hi> are
the commoner, and more extensive too
they be, and the highest are the most
so; <hi>so on the scale of Being,</hi> the lower
and inferiour, which are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
in matter, are the more deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
and contracted, but the higher
and Superiour, which are more immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and spiritual, are more diffusive
and free. All Confinement is from
Earth and Matter, but it is form and
Spirit, that is the <hi>Root</hi> of all inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and freeness. Minerals are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
determin'd; Vegetables, less;
Animals, spontaneous; Rationals ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary.
Thus also in Mechanic <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
the subtiler they are, the more
spreading. And <hi>Light</hi> of all Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Beings, the most refin'd and pure,
is also most imparting and diffusive.</p>
               <p>Now God, <hi>He is an absolute pure and
spiritual Act,</hi> inhabiting in Light as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessable
as glorious, and therefore,
seeing he Presideth on the Top of all
Being, he cannot but be infinitely Free,
and so much more, more imparting
and communicative than is any other,
as he is purer and more high than it.
For sayes our Saviour, <hi>If ye then being</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:39294:25"/>
Evil, <hi>know how to give good gifts to your
Children,</hi> how much more <hi>shall your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is</hi> in Heaven, <hi>give good things
to them which ask him.</hi> Evil is oppos'd
to <hi>Heavenly,</hi> if ye being Evil. &amp;c.
How much more shall your Father,
which is in Heaven, &amp;c. To be earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is to be evil, narrow, and illiberal.
But what is pure Heavenly and High,
is free and noble. God is the most

Evils for mans Good. How
things are best for the Beasts.
Evils as Entities, necessary for
the plenitude of the World; as
Afflictive for Gods Glory; and
as Paenal for Mans good. Things
ought to be as they are. An Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
from the Apparent ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of things [Good to
the Evil, Evil to the Good] pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,</p>
               </argument>
               <p>But in his <hi>Administration</hi> of the
Government of the Moral World,
(for so I call that of Mankind, in
distinction to the Natural,) his
Providence and Goodness, are as
visible as great; <hi>in that all things in
it are designed</hi> for the <hi>best,</hi> and <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
issue in it</hi>: Her ruleth in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39294:32"/>
his House, in all things, as a wise
and prudent Master, by assigning
<hi>to his Children and his Servants,
their respective duties (in it)
which are for the Good of all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and each of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
as well as for his own Glory;
and by</hi> obliging <hi>them unto them
with Rewards, and Punishments.</hi>
Thus he <hi>Disciplines</hi> and <hi>Governes</hi>
them. Government is for the
Good of Man, and all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is from God. He holds the
reins of all himself, and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
the Rules and Lawes of it.</p>
               <p>I ask the Atheist, <hi>if it would not be
a Golden and most happy Age, wherein</hi>
all men loved others as intirely and
sincerly as they do themselvs: <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
together with their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
and interests all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reminded those of others; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
they universally abstaining
from all injustice and wrong, each
assisted other to the utmost; and
<hi>wherein</hi> they lived and conversed
each with other devoid of Envy,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39294:33"/>
Malice, Covetousness, Pride, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
&amp;c. And if he answer me
<hi>it would</hi>; I tell him this is the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of the House, that Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(<hi>which is nothing else, but
what the Practical and common
Reason of man doth dictate to be done</hi>)
that God hath sanction'd in
the world, to which he hath oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all his Servants to conform;
thus he will have them do, and
thus be; and that they may, he
hath adapted <hi>means</hi> (the best ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable)
to ingage and move
them to it: He disciplines and acts
them with <hi>Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>:
He promiseth them Good, if
they obey, and threatens them
with Evil, if they do not. So the
Apostle,</p>
               <q>—Do by Nature the things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <q>—Having not the Law, are a Law

               <p>And if it be best for Man it is so

therefore [these not having any

not their own] That is best for
them, which is so for him. <hi>The

Now Man, he hath an interest in

and is afflictable by these, and so
is punishable by them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Good and Evil, that is
in them, the <hi>poyson</hi> and malignity

God is very Good and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral

so <hi>they have a good of Entity

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:39294:36"/>
and <hi>afflictive,</hi> so also they <hi>are
necessary in respect of God, that he
may have a rise of shewing</hi> his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
and Goodness, in its full
extent: For, if there were no evils
in the world, no infelicities, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
nor miseries, there could be
no <hi>compassions,</hi> nor no evincements
of his <hi>Tendernesses</hi> and Mercies in
relieving, or removing them. He
could not shew his readiness to <hi>Help,</hi>
if there were no <hi>need</hi> of help; and
therefore he hath sometimes <hi>hid</hi>
himself behind the Curtain, even
from his dearest Children, that on
his return on their cryes, they
may be more <hi>affected</hi> with his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and become more sensible of
it, else there had been no crying
to God, nor help from him, nor
thanks for it: See the 107 <hi>Psalm.</hi>
For where there are no Evils, it
might be said of God, as is said
of a virtuous Man, by <hi>Seneca,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>—Magnus es vir, sed unde scio,

But, if we consider them as <hi>pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Evils, so they have a mediate
goodness, and an usefulness for Man,</hi>
that much obliges him, for so (as
we have said) they are as many
<hi>Means</hi> to discipline and govern
him; who, if he were not as he is,
and were not govern'd and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
as he is, but had been fixed
by an Act of Power, without <hi>them,</hi>
half the <hi>Shew</hi> had then been lost. So
much of the Divine wisdome and
goodness as is, visible in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
(which is very much) had
then been never shewn, and so
God had been deprived of a good
part of his Glory. His is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
a manifold wisdome,
and manifold Goodness. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
wisdome must be shewn in
many wayes, and not be limited
to one.</p>
               <p>Well (<hi>saith the</hi> Atheist) this is
indeed a pretty colour, but 'tis no
more, for the Government, if any,
is not administred as you assert it;
the Good and Evil in the world, are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:39294:37"/>
not for the ends you mention, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
and order it; these are too
promiscuously dispens'd, and too
blindly, to be so for Ends; 'tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the contrary; the Good (if
any difference) are most unhappy
and unfortunate, and the wicked,
most successeful and prosperous. A
Phaenomenon, <hi>so</hi> Plain and obvious
that not only <hi>Telamon</hi> in <hi>Cicero,</hi>

               </q>
               <p>But also <hi>Solomon</hi> himself hath
noted it; no man (<hi>saith he</hi>) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
either love or hatred by all that
is before him, all things come alike
to all, there is one event to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and to the Wicked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So
undistinguishing and common are the
external accidents. And 'tis strange,
if there be indeed a Providence,
that the Godly only should have the
Promise of the present life, but no
more the performance of it, than the
Wicked.</p>

what a marvellous surprize is in it!
Take every passage of it solely by
it self, and separate it from the
rest, and how hard a one it is;
<hi>all is then against him</hi>: To be hated
by his brethren, that is bad; to
be sold by them for a Slave to the
<hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> and by these to <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi>
is worse; to be injuriously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused

became acquainted with the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler,
and interpreted his Dream; it
was his <hi>Mistress's Accusation,</hi> which
compos'd his <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to Prison; it was the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
and griping of the <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi>
that brought him to his Mistress;
and it was the Malice and <hi>Envy of
his Brethren,</hi> that brought him to

to Preferment,</hi> and who would
have thought it thus? <hi>All work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>

Such an Ordering and over-ruling

is said to <hi>send</hi> him. Humane Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice

made Man Upright, but he found
out many inventions.</hi> This is <hi>Plato</hi>'s
Descent of Souls.</p>
               <p>But if God be infinitely Good and
Pure, and Righteous, (replies the
Atheist) how is it, that he did not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39294:49"/>
settle <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocence and
Happiness? What salvo hath he for
his own Righteousness, who so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully
suffered man to slide from
His? Is he not an Accessory to the
Crime, who (when he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent)
permits it? He that doth
not hinder Murther, or other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
when 'tis in his Power so to
do, is to be interpreted in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to will it. God could have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<hi>Adam's.</hi> What say you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since he did not? How can you
call him good and charitable, that
would not prevent such misery? and
how Righteous and Holy, that did
permit such sin?</p>
               <p>But seeing nothing gives but
what it has it self, must not <hi>he</hi> be
Holy, Pure, and Righteous, that
<hi>Formed</hi> man so? and he Good,
that so abundantly accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
man, and freely <hi>furnish't</hi> him
with all conveniencies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts?
Now God not onely most
Benignly created Man in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and Happiness, <hi>but obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:39294:49"/>
conferr'd also to Establish him and

have eaten of it, if he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as well as of the other of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>]
Nor was it proper that he
should do more toward it. It was
not congruous and fit, he should
determine arbitrary and spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Agents, (and let the Atheist
Judge) as he had done the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:
nor agreeable that Man, an
Agent <hi>ad utrum-libet,</hi> one that
could deliberate and act on <hi>choice,
that could freely and electively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to both extreams, should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd,
as a Stone to one of them.</hi>
It was <hi>fit</hi> elective Creatures should
be left to their choice; and so was
Man. A Tree of Life, and a Tree
of knowledge [Life and Death]
were both before him, and he
might take his choice. Verily,
God is irrationally charged (and

Nothing wanted but mans will, to
make his happiness eternal. The
Tree of Life was before him, and
he might have eaten, and so have

               <p>For if the great God should have

and not <hi>morally</hi> onely (as
he did) and by a Law, from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the one Tree, or else should
violently have compel'd him (as
now the Atheist doth require) to
pluck and eat of the other; as he
had not congruously treated <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:39294:50"/>
in the Notion of a Free and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Agent, so neither had he <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
what he would do of himself.
Besides, there had not then been
any <hi>need of Law,</hi> for as much as it
had been impertinent, to interdict
eating to one, that could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
eat; and then if no Law, there
had been no obedience neither,
and consequently no Reward nor
Punishment; and if no Law, no
Obedience, no Reward nor Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
then no <hi>Government</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then in vain had <hi>Adam,</hi>
in the very constitution of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
been a governable Creature,
seeing (if this had been) he were
never to be actually governed.
Natural Agents are not (properly)
governed, but Morall Ones, and
Moral Agents must be governed
Morally. Hear <hi>Arrianus.</hi>

               <p>Nor is God obliged <hi>in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Good or Righteous Governor,
violently to restrain the Governed</hi>
from all unrighteousness, or to
promote their weal and Good vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently;
that is not for a Governor
(as such) to do; and therefore
that God did not, is not in dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of his Purity or Goodness.
A <hi>Governor</hi> restraineth Evil, and
advanceth Good, not by <hi>tying</hi> mens
hands, but by enacting good <hi>Laws</hi>;
by enforcing them with Menaces
and Threats, and with Rewards
and Compensations; by executing
penalties on those that break them,
and by renumerating those that do
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:39294:51"/>
not. And though a <hi>Subject</hi> be an
Accessory to the Crime, and Evil
which he doth not hinder, if he
can, and be interpreted to will it,
if he do not do his natural utmost
to prevent it, because he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by a Law to do so; yet the
Governour that maketh Law, [he
being under none, but that of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and Fitness, which is to rule
by Law, and as a Governour</hi>] is not
accusable of Crimes, which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids

that makes good Laws,
and rules by them, and not by force.</p>
               <p>But grant it (<hi>says the Atheist</hi>)
that it was Divine Bounty to create
<hi>Adam</hi> in a state of Happiness, and
no omission, not to establish him, and
fix him in it; but what equality in
this, not to say what injurie, that
when but One was in the Sin and

               <p>I answer, There is no iniquity
at all, <hi>in imputing unto all the sin
of One, when you consider that that
One was All</hi>; and those All are One.
<hi>Adam</hi> was the whole kind; and
All descendants from him, are but
One <hi>Adam.</hi> Many members make
but One whole. Mankind is a
Tree, whose Root is <hi>Adam,</hi> all
whose Children are but Branches,
which deriving from him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
out of him, were at first
<hi>in</hi> him, and so they all were; and
when he sinned, not one of them
but was; All were yet unborn,
which must be minded.</p>
               <p>And what maketh this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the greater moment, <hi>is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
that Eve herself came out of</hi>
Adam; so that <hi>Adam</hi> was intirely
All; All are come from <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> herself from <hi>Adam.</hi>
Had there been <hi>Non Adamites,</hi> or
<hi>Non</hi> intire Descendants from <hi>Adam,</hi>
such as <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39294:52"/>
of the Holy Spirit, it had not
seemed reasonable, that the Sin of
<hi>Adam,</hi> should be imputed to <hi>them.</hi>
But seeing Mankind is an <hi>Extended
Adam,</hi> and as it were, but one <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi>;
and Actions are of suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites;
though it were but He, the
Root that sinned (actually) the
Guilt is yet imputed to the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which were in him; it not
being thought unreasonable, that
he which stealeth, or else Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
but with his <hi>hand,</hi> should yet
be hanged for it by the <hi>Neck.</hi> All
are <hi>concluded</hi> with him, being All

<hi>Adams</hi> fall, is call'd the Fall of

Life.</p>
               <p>Thus, Humane condition, it is
capable of <hi>being better'd by the Fall,</hi>
it being in the kind of Man by
Grace, as 'tis in other kinds by
Nature, he riseth by his Fall; the
Corn is not quickened nor multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
except it die; Man was not
to be <hi>quickened</hi> by the Lord from
Heaven, nor advanced from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
into a better State of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and Immortal Life, but after he
was <hi>Spiritually dead.</hi> You <hi>who were
dead in trespasses and sins, hath he
quickened.</hi>

The Natural condition of the
Man was Good in Paradise, and as
good as that could be, but his
Spiritual is better, and it was <hi>agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto the Law and Method of
Nature, that what was good should
precede, and what was better follow
after</hi>; it being Nature's order, to
proceed from things lesse Perfect,
unto things more so. For in the
<hi>Genesis</hi> of things (if you consult
it) it was first <hi>Evening,</hi> then
<hi>Morning</hi>; first <hi>Darkness,</hi> then <hi>Light</hi>;
first the <hi>Naturals</hi> were made, then
the <hi>Vegetables</hi>; first the <hi>Animals,</hi>
then the <hi>Rationals</hi>; and 'tis to
this that our Apostle alludes; <hi>The
first man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living
Soul, the last</hi> Adam <hi>was made a
quickning Spirit. Howbeit that was
not first which is Spiritual: but
that which is natural, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that which is Spiritual. The first
man is of the earth Earthy.</hi> The
second <hi>Man is the Lord from Heaven.</hi>
Thus is Man's Condition better'd,
in that <hi>now,</hi> Divine Grace is
brought by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

               <p>Yes (<hi>sayes the Atheist</hi>) so it
lookes; for if he do extend his
Grace (as he is said) to men, it is
on Terms, so insupportable and hard,
that they cannot possibly perform
them; as if impossible conditions
did not nullifie his grants, and make
his Promises Denials; but that it
were in his Law, as Lawers tells us
it is in ours, wherein a Promise on
Impossible Conditions, does imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
invest in Right. What Grace
is this to look for tales of Bricks,
without affording Straw? He bids

we cannot) and then he tels us, we

else?</p>
               <p>A most malicious imputation

<hi>Esau,</hi> or hated him before

with that especial and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
love. And so <hi>comparatively</hi> he
is said to hate him; just as <hi>Jesus

               </p>
               <p>Now to apply it; <hi>What if God,</hi>
who has a general and common
love to all (which he hath evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in a thousand wayes, by his
creating, his conserving, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding

distinguishing an one for others, that
in respect thereof the former is as
none</hi>? Is he the less Good, or less
Benigne, because he is so much so?
or must it be interpreted a want
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:39294:57"/>
of Goodness or Benignity to
some, because he is abundant in
it to others? as if it were not
Righteous for the Great God to
have his <hi>Favourites,</hi> when yet it
is allowed and approved in men to
have them. God doth but <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
love</hi> some, to shew his <hi>Power</hi>;
and he <hi>specially doth favour</hi> others,
to shew his <hi>Rich Grace.</hi> Had he
loved all a like, it would not look
of Grace to any. Grace is Favour,
and Favour is particular, and
distinguishing. Nor had he shew'n
his power, if he had not <hi>passed some
by,</hi> when he obliged others with
Favours.</p>
               <p>So infinitely Good is God; that
the veryest Reprobate in all the
world, has no occasion of a just
complant against him; <hi>He is as good
as Soveraign,</hi> and to manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so, <hi>he has in all Transactions so
admirably temper'd Love and Power,
that if</hi> he is Soveraignly Gratious
in some of them, He is in others as
Benignly Soveraign: though he

Favours some and not others, and
that because he will, yet he has an
universal love and general kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for them all. Those that are
not <hi>Favourites</hi> are yet consider'd as
his <hi>Subjects,</hi> he willeth their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and as a Governour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
it; for though he use his
Power and Dominion, that he
might shew his <hi>indignation against
Sin,</hi> as well as his aversion, yet <hi>it
onely is on such he has first endured
with much long suffering,</hi> who by
aggravated guilt, have merited
destruction, and so <hi>have fitted and

is God Evil or Unrighteous? if
you state it thus; and so Scripture
states it, keep to these Termes, and
Reprobation is defensible.</p>
               <p>Nor <hi>is God a hard Master</hi>; he
requireth not impossibilities, or
Tales of Brick without Straw;
for, though he might consider man
in great <hi>Justice, not as he hath made

and so agreably expect from him

according to the Stock, which then
was given him; yet <hi>He hath conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to compound,</hi> and by an Act
of Grace, as infinite as is himself,
has offered bankrupt <hi>Adam New
Termes, and such as are agreable
unto him now in this Condition, and
feasible.</hi> I say now, for otherwise

Logicians tell us) were <hi>refusals</hi>;
or if, as many say, the Terms offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

consequently could not be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to oblige Man anew, since his

him and reproach him with it.)</p>
               <p>No, <hi>God requires nothing of a

as you can, yet, seeing it is such as

               <p>Then hear again, O Atheist, and
admire, and never open more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Divine Goodness, which is
much above the contradiction of
the Wicked, as the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

see it, that in the Covenant of Grace,
<hi>the Great God requireth nothing of
a Man, but what he offers him his

he conferreth on him in the way of
<hi>Duty and Dependance.</hi> So that
nothing is exacted as a Term, but
what a man is <hi>able and sufficient to
perform, not from any Power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

by way of caution, (for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:39294:61"/>
when it was in <hi>his,</hi> and it is his
Goodness to keep it for us. Now
every <hi>Man can</hi> do with God's help,
what every <hi>Saint doth</hi> do; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

This <hi>Concernment</hi> and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
of Almighty God with men
is admirably represented in the
Method of Jesus Christ used when
he <hi>cur'd the Impotent</hi> and Lame;
For Instance, when he cur'd the
<hi>wither'd hand</hi>; which he did, by
bidding him that had it, <hi>stretch</hi> it
out: and so that other impotent
and maimed man, at <hi>Bethesda,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>One would have thought he
had but <hi>mocked,</hi> to bid the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
arm be extended, or the
Impotent to take his bed and walk;
to bid them go that had no legs;
but they <hi>believed</hi> him to be serious,
and that he was able to enable
them, and therefore <hi>tryed</hi> and in
trying found ability <hi>come in.</hi> And
so it is with us, we are <hi>unable</hi> in
our selves for all the duties he
obliges to, we are bid <hi>to stretch
our wither'd arms out,</hi> to believe, to
love, to obey him spiritually, and

(as it were) to take up our beds

It is not <hi>means</hi> but Gods <hi>blessing.</hi>
And your <hi>Indeavours</hi> are to be in

Many have indeavour'd in their

you must try in Gods, and so you
can do every thing. You say you
<hi>cannot</hi> come, when God obliges
you; but pray try. Can't you

will not try, when God saith he'l
help; 'tis of perverseness, and not

come. Love <hi>offers</hi> help to all, but
Grace <hi>gives</hi> help to some. All
<hi>may</hi> have it if they will, but some

                  <p>A foolish Objection from the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,
and imperfection of the
Divine Life here proposed, and
the Vanity of it detected.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>But may the Atheist say, what
need so much adoe then, for man
to pray, and hear, and read, and
meditate, and try, if God do all?
And why is the Life of God in
men so long imperfect, when if he
were good, he would, and, if he
would, he could at once immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accomplish it? why doth he let
them creep, whom he could make to
flie, and so defer that utmost hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
and perfection, which he is
said to ordain them to, when, if he
would, he might as soon possesse them
of it, as design it.</p>

I answer, <hi>There are means as well
as ends,</hi> and wisdome lies in suting
them; the Atheist might as well
require, <hi>that</hi> every thing in Nature
should immediately, without an

arrive unto perfection, <hi>that</hi>
there should immediately be
Trees, without seeds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and those immediately should
bear fruit, without blossoming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
as what he doth. For, <hi>as it is
in other kindes, so it is in Mankind,</hi>
both as to his Naturals and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
he must orderly advance, and

God is uniform in his workes:

               <p>For if he be the best Being, as
has already been evinc'd, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
follows, <hi>that be is the last
End,</hi> in as much as Good and
End, for all their formal Notions
and Idea's be distinct, are yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible
with one another. The
Chiefest Good is All-sufficient, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:39294:73"/>
of an universal comprehension, and
capacity, containing in it all
Good; and he must needs be the
End of all, that containeth in
himself the Good of all.</p>
               <p>It might be also argued, and
perhaps with greater evidence
and perspicuity, as <hi>Boetius,</hi> and
the Scriptures do, from his first
and universal <hi>Agency</hi>; for he that
is the <hi>First efficient, must needs be
the last End</hi>; Being is a <hi>Circle,</hi>
wherein it is impossible, but that
the Alpha is Omega, and that the
Point beginning All, is the <hi>End</hi>
of it. <hi>The Lord hath made all
things</hi> for himself.</p>
               <p>And, if he be the End of all
things, seeing that an End <hi>is that,
for which a thing is,</hi> and so the
End of all, is that for which all
others are; it followes, that they
all <hi>are for God</hi> [so our Apostle,
to <hi>him are all things</hi>] or, as the
Holy Scriptures also happily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it (they all) are <hi>for the
Glory of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:39294:73"/>
But to prevent misapprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it ought to be consider'd,
that Divine <hi>Glory</hi> is either internal
or external Glory. His <hi>Internal,</hi>
it is his <hi>Essential Glory,</hi> that in
respect of which the Great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
calls him <hi>the Glory,</hi> and <hi>Peter
the excellent Glory</hi>; and is as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably
inherent to him, as is
that which doth compose the <hi>Sun,</hi>
to it. To which it is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
that 'tis as inaccessable
and dazling to the mind, as this,
to the Eye; and utterly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all Addition, as well as all
Diminution. This is the <hi>Finis
cui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not the <hi>End of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi>
or as the <hi>Metaphysics</hi> stile it,
the <hi>Finis cujus</hi>; it is not this, but
his <hi>external Glory,</hi> that all things
else are lastly for. And his <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Glory</hi> (as it were the <hi>shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Sun</hi> (is nothing <hi>but the
Manifestation of Divine Perfections

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed God is <hi>said</hi> to be <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,</hi>
or to have Glory given
him, either Passively and Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
or else Actively and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally.
The Heavens above, the
Sun, and Moon, and Stars,
and also the Earth below, the
Minerals and Plants, and mere
Animals, things that comprehend
not the Divine Perfections, but
as objects onely represent and
shew them, do by <hi>interpretation</hi>
give him Glory or Glorifie him
in the first sense; but <hi>Man</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in taking Rise from these to
do so, doth perform it in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
But properly, God is <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
in the former; but <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:39294:74"/>

                  <p>A Capitulation of the things to be

End, evinced. <hi rend="sup">1.</hi> From
his dependency in Being, and
<hi rend="sup">2.</hi> From his Faculties. That he

and by <hi>Reason,</hi> from the
Essential Notion of the world,

               </argument>
               <p>But to be more particular, (as
this Subject of Divine Finality,
which is of great importance, and
concernment, doth engage us) I
shall endeavour to evince distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
(1.) That <hi>Man</hi> is not his own
End. (2.) That <hi>another,</hi> One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
in Heaven, and the Origen
and Source of all, is it. And
then (3.) That the infinite <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sceudency</hi>
of God, or his highest
Exaltation, and Supremacy, is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:39294:75"/>
the <hi>ground</hi> of his Finality; which
effected, I shall shut up this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in two or three <hi>Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first, <hi>That Man is not his
own End,</hi> is evident; For as much
as He <hi>is from another</hi>: The Son is
from the Father, and he from his,
and so along unto the first, who
being of the same kind, is as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
as the second; so first,
and second, and every one, is from
another, and <hi>he is for another,</hi> and
not himself, that is dependent;
and is not from himself, but <hi>from</hi>
another.</p>
               <p>But if this first evincement, seem
too Metaphysical and Delicate,
there is a second, from the <hi>Humane
Faculties</hi> and Powers, which is
more Harmonious, and convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It is that Man himself is
<hi>constituted for address to Good
without him,</hi> that he is a <hi>willing</hi>
and <hi>affective</hi> Creature; that is, that
he hath Will and Affections, which
inclining him to Things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:39294:76"/>
                  <hi>transport</hi> him. Now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be imagined, that he should
be his own End, who is <hi>connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
carried out</hi> to Good beyond
himself; it being utterly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that that should be a Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native,
<hi>Central Being,</hi> which hath
<hi>Pondus in it,</hi> and doth gravitate
and weigh. That is off the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which inclines and gravitates.
Now the Will is <hi>Pondus animae,</hi>
and Love is <hi>Exstatical.</hi> Man is
not his own end, because he is
not his own Good. He is an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent,</hi>
and inclining Being; and
therefore his Good is all without
him, because his Love, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<hi>export</hi> him.</p>
               <p>I confess indeed He is <hi>the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
End of all inferiour Beings.</hi> For
though I know <hi>Velleius,</hi> [He in
<hi>Cicero</hi>] <hi>Carneades,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
do smartly argue on the
contrary; yet I also know, he is

being Adaequate and proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the <hi>Rational and Humane</hi>
Nature, do evidently shew, that
it was made for this. It is the
Order, Relations, and Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the World, that makes it;
and these are onely for the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
which alone discernes
them; as Colours are for the sight,
and Sounds are for the hearing,
and Odours are for the smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
&amp;c. There is nothing in
the World, but there is a <hi>Faculty</hi>
in Man to reach it; and <hi>Objects</hi>

<hi>Entertainments</hi> in every Being in

               </argument>
               <p>But <hi>Man</hi> though he be the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

things in the World, yet, not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Author or Original of any in

himself,</hi> Who having <hi>made</hi>
those other things, and also so
<hi>design'd</hi> them for <hi>Man,</hi> as that he
cannot but confess he could not

as much Superiour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<hi>him</hi> in Efficiency and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as in Beneficence and Bounty.
And this is the <hi>second thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to evince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For those other things are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:39294:79"/>
                  <hi>for the use and ends of
Man, they are so apt and fit to
them</hi>; and consequently being for
an End, it cannot be, but they
must have an <hi>Efficient.</hi> [Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is for somewhat, also is from
somewhat] and it cannot be from
Man (that) they should be, <hi>who
is so indigent</hi> to live upon them;
it being unimaginable, how a
thing should be from him, who
cannot be <hi>himself</hi> without it. Now
Man subsists on the <hi>Elements,</hi> and
on <hi>Elementary concretes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remaineth then, there <hi>is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Being they are from,</hi> which is
infinitely much above the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane;
of which it is as well the
Origen and Source, as of those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For seeing it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that Man himself should
be <hi>unmade,</hi> who <hi>cannot possibly
subsist, or be without the things
made</hi>: 'Tis most agreable that he
should have the making of <hi>him,</hi>
who hath the making of the <hi>things
on</hi> which he lives. I say, 'tis most
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:39294:79"/>
rational, that he should make
Man, if he be made (as he is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be) who, by providing for
him, conserves him. Thus other
things and Man himself, lead us up
to <hi>one above Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, admitting that Man hath
such an <hi>Authour</hi> of his Being, as is
infinitely much above him, (for
he made him) and hath bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
made all others, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
and serve him; how can
it be imagined, but that he is for
<hi>this</hi>? For 'tis not to be thought,
that <hi>God,</hi> who had so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
for another, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiously
neglect <hi>himself,</hi> but that
rather, seeing he hath made so
many things for Man's Ends, he
made Man, and all things else
for his own, and <hi>in constituting
Man a kind of God to</hi> them,<note place="margin">Iamblic. in Protrept.</note> and
so capacitating of him to receive
<hi>Duties,</hi> did but agreably instruct
him in <hi>those</hi> other, which he is to
pay. For what he looketh for,
from those beneath him, why
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:39294:80"/>
should he refuse to one so much
above him, who made him for
himself.</p>
               <p>And that he hath done so, the
Humane <hi>Faculties</hi> do further shew,
For as much as <hi>Man hath both a
mind</hi> and <hi>Understanding capable
of apprehending God, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with him, and a will also
as capable</hi> of weighing and inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him; and what other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
can a Man expect in
Nature, of his being formed to
maintain an intercourse with God,
to glorifie him in the World, and
to recognize him as the first Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and the last End, as All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and All-Good, and by
doing it to be conformed to him,
but that he is inabled and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
by him to do so? What
Evidence we have to convince us,
that the Eye was made to see co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
that very same we have to
prove that our understandings and
Wills were ordain'd to converse
with God: for we can Apprehend

Delight in him, and therefore

               <p>This is the very Argument by
