         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for our capacities by halfe, hang Poets and Poetry, wee
could never endure them, no verse is more sweet than a mans
neck-verse (if it be said in season) and as for Rhime, it is as
much distastefull to us as Reason, Yet I would needs know
by what Reason wee have the name of <hi>Round-heads</hi> put upon
us; me thinks our heads are no rounder than our fore-fathers:
Some say they call us so, because our tongues do trowle more
roundly than our Ancestours did, and that they did use ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<hi>Square dealing,</hi> and we only professe and practise Round
Talking or speaking. Others say, that we are so termed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee doe cut our haire shorter than our eares; and the
reason is, because long haire hinders the sound of the Word
from entring into the heart: and (truly) it is no shame for
a man to weare his owne eares. Yet in the 19. Chapter of
<hi>Leviticus,</hi> and the 27 verse, we are forbid to <hi>cut round the
corners of our heads, or to mar the tufts of our beards;</hi> but those
words were spoken to the Iewes by <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the world
knowes that we are Gentiles, we have nothing to doe with
Iewes or ceremonies, I can eat Pork and Pig (which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to the Iewes) and I love a good Sow or a Bore next
my wife and my selfe.</p>
               <p>Others there be that say we are called <hi>Round-heads,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that by our heads wee are more like Globes than those

that weare their haire long, and man being a little world, is
by the roundnesse of the head a figure or embleme of the
greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morgan Llewellin</hi> (that grave Greek Author) saith in the
ninth Chapter of his <hi>Litigious Aphorismes,</hi> That <hi>Bias</hi> the

(from the mold of his head) the first Round Bowles, in
memorie whereof they are called <hi>Bias</hi> Bowles to this day;
but the world is too full of rubs now, and most heads run like
Bowles, contrary to the <hi>Bias,</hi> that an honest man can hardly
win a good game all his life time.</p>
               <p>There are some that report, that wee are called <hi>Round-heads,</hi>
and <hi>Ovall-heads,</hi> by reason of the similitude of an egg,
I mused why that comparison was, but at last I perceived, that
the a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lusion was not to the Ovall for me of the Egg, but to the
addlenesse of the braines in the head, which I hold to be very
significant.</p>
               <p>There was a fellow lately did set forth a Pamphlet, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
<hi>A Tale in a Tub,</hi> or <hi>A Tub Lecture;</hi> The speaker of it
hee saith was one <hi>My heele mend sole,</hi> an inspired Brownist,
and a most upright Translator: The house (where it is said
to be spoken) was neere <hi>Bedlam;</hi> the time when, the 21 of
December last, and the writers name of it, is only under the
two thred-bare letters of <hi>I. T.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could almost perswade my selfe, that those letters of <hi>I. T.</hi>
should stand for <hi>Iohn Taylor</hi> the Aquaticall Poet, and yet mee
thinks he should have preferred a Boate before a tub to make
a pulpit of, for a Boate is more primitive to preach out of,
then a Tub or a Kinderkin. A fishers boate once served the
best Preacher that ever was, for a Canonicall Pulpit; but
let that businesse alone, and returne to the Tub. It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
but a Cobler may draw or vent a Firkin of smal wit
out of a Hogs-head, and (verily) me thinks it was a rare busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that the Hogs-head did not leake when the man ran o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
amaine; But it is the property and policy of a Learned
man to barrell up more then he can broach. There was such
Vertue once in Tub, that a grave and wise Philosopher made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64094:3"/>
choise of one for his study, which tub hee valued so highly,
that he would not change it for the Place of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great, (or <hi>Alexander</hi> of St. <hi>Magnus)</hi> and that may bee the
reason that our brother (the Cobler) made choyse of a Tub,
(he that is offended at it, I wish him in <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Tub, and
that is a pocky Tub, as a French Gentleman told me the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day) but to returne to our purpose, I have read of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
inhabiting somewhere beyond the unknowne Southerne
World (or <hi>Terra Australis Incognita</hi>) these people do once
a year offer their old shooes and boots to their Heathen Gods,
O what a mighty trade might a preaching Cobler drive there
being able alone of himselfe, to prepare and offer the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and so preach the oblation Sermon too, I know a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

death) and on his deathbed called his eldest sonne to him, and
after he had given his last blessing, he gave him this counsell.
My son (quoth he) I must leave thee, thou knowest that my

thy mother a Millers daughter of Tolledo, they and I

that thou do thy best endeavour to retaine the dignity of the
Majesty of so great a family. Truly, a man of such mighty spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

he been inspired as some of our Brethren are, he would have
proved that <hi>Simon</hi> called <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was at Rome once,
(welfare all good tokens he brake his neck there) but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Simon Peter,</hi> many wise men will never beleeve that,
he was there, though the Papists say to the contrary and with
Tooth and Nayle defend their furious asseverations. Also he

and zealous Brethren that have stifly stood for the cause,
(as the Sisters can testifie if they please) as namely the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Mr. <hi>How</hi> the Cobler, The most industrious Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>
the Ironmonger, the zealous Mr. <hi>Greene</hi> the Felt-maker, the
painefull Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> the Stablegroome, the pavior of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
the Sowgelder of <hi>Wallingford,</hi> the Barber and Baker
of Abingdon, and many hundreds more of true religious Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
Weavers, I had almost for got Taylors, but that one Mr.
<hi>Squire,</hi> a Gentleman of that function at Roderhith beinga
double yarded man, because he hath two, but neither of them
London measure, he is a mighty painestaker for us all in the
true w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of rayling downe Learning, wit, order and decency,
what though he faile now and then in stretching silver lace
on a petticoate, that he can frugally save out of 4. yards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
one yard; I say a Taylor may stretch lace and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and his bill too, but all is one for that, he is a true zelot
&amp; so forth, but though these have the honour to be named in
our catalogue of remembrance, yet one of our chiefe props and
pillers, is ingratefully forgotten, he being a man of such a
vast merit, that it is a shame hee should be buried alive (in
his fame I meane) the first letter of his name is a Brewers
Clarke, he is a man that hath more in him then all the world
is worthy to see or know, he hath some pith or weight in him
&amp; had he but couragiously attempted the downfall of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
Crosse in Cheapeside, if he had been but valiantly secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
hee would would have laid it levell with the pavement,
for he feares not the Hangman, and is able to keepe a <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
as big as halfe a yeare with any <hi>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I am afraid that our cake is but dough bak'd, (though
our zeale was warme enough to heate the Oven as hot as a
furnace) for we are crost, and the Crosse stands to baffle and
brave us, and further an unhappy pated fellow did lately
write these following Verses, in the behalfe of the Crosse, &amp;
disgrace of us.</p>

            <head>Verses upon the defacing of Cheape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
Crosse, with the Pictures of Christ
and Saint Peter.</head>
            <l>HOw? steale the leade from Cheapeside-crosse (O base)</l>
            <l>I'le take my oath on't 'tis a hoavy case:</l>
            <l>Some say the Devill did it, and I graunt</l>
            <l>The Devill is a mighty Puritant.</l>
            <l>He never could endure the Crosse because</l>
            <l>Man (on the Crosse) was ransomd from his claws;</l>
            <l>But whosoe're 'twas, Brownist, Punk or Pimp:</l>
            <l>If not the Devill, 'twas the Devils Impe,</l>
            <l>What e're he may pretend, he is a Grosse</l>
            <l>Damb'd Iew, that tortures Christ upon the Crosse?</l>
            <l>I wonder why the watchmen did not scare Vm,</l>
            <l>Sure 'twas some sleeping watch that lackt a larum</l>
            <l>And so St. <hi>Peter</hi> (whom our Saviour chose)</l>
            <l>One of his twelve Apostles, had his Nose,</l>
            <l>And both his Armes knockt of, were was the Cock</l>
            <l>That did not wake S. <hi>Peter</hi> at that knock?</l>
            <l>Christ made him an Apostle, now who can</l>
            <l>Without his Arms make him <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </l>
            <l>Some Crop-eare did it in revenge I feare,</l>
            <l>Because St. <hi>Peter</hi> cut off <hi>Malchus</hi> eare.</l>
            <l>What did the babe, what did our Lady do?</l>
            <l>Poore Innocents alas, they fuffered too.</l>
            <l>This shews the Devils brood, like th'Irish wild,</l>
            <l>Will spare no man or woman, maid or child:</l>
            <l>Now my opinion of the crosse is this,</l>
            <l>It is amisse to such as make't amisse.</l>
            <l>To such as reverence it, or adore it,</l>
            <l>Or say their prayers to it, or before it.</l>
            <l>Such do pervert it from its proper use,</l>
            <l>And turn an Ornament to an abuse.</l>
            <l>Turks, Infidels, Moores, Pagans, Heathen, Iewes,</l>
            <l>They know not Christ, therefore no Crosses use.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64094:5"/>And no true Christian justly can repine,</l>
            <l>To let a Crosse stand as a Christian signe.</l>
            <l>Knaves may deface it, fooles may worship it,</l>
            <l>All which may be for want of grace or wit,</l>
            <l>To those that wrongd the Crosse this is my curse,</l>
            <l>They never may have crosses in their purse.</l>
            <p>And thus Brethren you may perceive and see, how these
Iigmaking jeering Poets, doe with their pestiferous Rimes
(or Verses) support and prop up that Golden-Leaden nest of
Idols and Images, but for a conclusion, if I cannot have it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne,
demolished, cast downe, raced, confounded,
overturned, defaced, delapidated, distroyed, laid waste, rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
subverted, or call it what you will, (so it bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way)
and the lead melted into bullets to kill Irish Rebels; I
say if I cannot have it so, I will wish it so, and there is an
end before Finis.</p>
