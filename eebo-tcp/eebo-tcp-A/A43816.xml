            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for your <hi>Soul-improvement,</hi> by raising your thoughts
in your declining years to minde <hi>Eternitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the <hi>greatest part of it</hi> preached by mee at
<hi>Trinitie-Church in Cambridg,</hi> Febr. 13. 1647. and I can
truly say, it was both <hi>framed</hi> at first upon a <hi>sick bed,</hi>
(when such thoughts are very seasonable) and
<hi>preached</hi> when I was <hi>under sad symptoms of wel-nigh
six months Quartane Ague.</hi> So desirous was I to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the intended <hi>Combination</hi> for morning Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
there, which depended upon mee for the
<hi>begining</hi> of it, that with apparent <hi>hazzard</hi> to my
own <hi>health,</hi> (being not onely weakened by my
desease, but having, upon an occasion of a <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
preached three times</hi> within a few dayes before
in <hi>Trinitie-Colledg</hi> Chappel) I adventured upon the
work out of an honest intention, though I had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consent of <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Physicians.</hi> Admit I were
not able to carrie on or finish my discourse, as I
desired, should I not rather have been pitied then
<hi>bespattered,</hi> then grosly <hi>disparaged by son,</hi> and the
present prevailing of my disease most shamefully
<hi>mis-interpreted</hi> by others, as if this were a <hi>Judgment
of God</hi> upon mee, for defending the <hi>Universitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:62139:4"/>
the Town;</hi> wherein they shew as little <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie</hi>
as <hi>Wisedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for them, I earnestly desire they would seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
consider what our Savior saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 36.</note> 
               <hi>Every idle
word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof
in the day of Judgment.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> And if of every idle word,
then undoubtedly of every <hi>uncharitable, censorious,
lying, and blasphemous word.</hi> And likewise often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that of the Prophet <hi>Zacharie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I am very
sore displeased with the Heathen that are at ease: for I
was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the
affliction.</hi> When God whippe's his <hi>children,</hi> it is
most unbecoming <hi>brethren</hi> to add to their stripes.
Hee is no <hi>ingenuous servant</hi> that triumph's over his
fellow (unless hee bee guilty of som offence)
when hee is <hi>brought low before his Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for mee, I am not ashamed to bee made
<hi>comformable to my head</hi> Jesus Christ, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>Beelzebub, the prince of devils;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 24.</note> and to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
as one that was <hi>mad,</hi> which was the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the most wise and holy Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall I deny that this was an <hi>humbling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
that such an <hi>indisposition</hi> should <hi>surprize</hi> mee
then,<note place="margin">Act. 26. 24.</note> (though it might well bee so after a longer
and stronger intention of spirits in prayer then my
condition would bear) to let splenatick fumes
<pb facs="tcp:62139:5"/>
more prevailingly surprize mee in preaching at
that time, then in any other imployment since my
ague began; wherein I desire to <hi>sanctifie God's
Name,</hi> by <hi>abasing my self,</hi> and <hi>exalting Him</hi> without
whom wee can do nothing. I wish all may make
a right <hi>interpretation</hi> of his <hi>actions</hi> which are <hi>infinitely
wise,</hi> and consider that Ministers, being publick
persons, as they have <hi>consolations</hi> that they may <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
others,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 3, 4.</note> so have they many times afflictions for
the <hi>edification and salvation of others:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of both. And they must make account they
may possibly inherit the same Apostle's portion;
one while possibly to bee adored, and <hi>almost sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
unto,</hi> Act. 14, 11, 12, 13. and yet soon after to bee
stoned, vers. 19.</p>
            <p>I were very <hi>stupid,</hi> did I not observe the <hi>various
aspect</hi> of divers in <hi>Cambridg-Town</hi> towards mee in
som by-past years, wherein I have, and I hope
still shall <hi>unchangeably endeavor</hi> to approve my self a
<hi>true friend to their</hi> best good (in defiance to all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindeness)
and a <hi>faithful servant to their souls.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 24. 6.</note> Yet,
by the good <hi>hand of God upon mee,</hi> there have been
withal a <hi>generation of Seekers</hi> which have cleaved
unto, and with som <hi>fruitful acceptance,</hi> attended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my <hi>Ministerie.</hi> I would not value personal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
in comparison of that acceptance which
<pb facs="tcp:62139:5"/>
hath reference unto the glory of Christ in Gospel-success.</p>
            <p>I remember, not without <hi>thankfulness</hi> to my
good God, with what welcom entertainment ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
entertained my weak and plain preaching here
in former years,<note place="margin">An. Dem. 1628. 1629.</note> when I was your preacher at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew's.</hi>
I hope I shall never forget how much of
God's goodness I found amongst you both in his
assistance and your acceptance in the great plague;<note place="margin">1630.</note>
(<hi>hee can make by his presence a Wilderness prove a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>)
neither must I pass by with what readiness of
minde you attended upon my <hi>occasional ministerie</hi>
in 1643, when Providence cast mee for som time
amongst you, <hi>the sons of violence</hi> having forced mee
from the place I then had in <hi>North-Hampton</hi>-shire.<note place="margin">Tychmersh.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But whence is this <hi>Eclipse?</hi> whence this black
cloud? (God and som mens conscience know)
which I doubt not but it will soon vanish, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi>
said of <hi>Arrius.</hi>

<hi>soul,</hi> and not for my <hi>reputation,</hi> for a <hi>crown,</hi> and not
for a <hi>crust?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was indeed <hi>my portion</hi> to bee involved in those
<hi>unhappy differences</hi> between the <hi>Universitie</hi> and <hi>Town</hi>
of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> about their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> when I had the
<hi>honor</hi> to serve them as <hi>Vice-Chancellor.</hi> Is that a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground of such an <hi>unkinde alteration,</hi> that they
<pb facs="tcp:62139:6"/>
calumniate and traduce the Innocent thereupon?
Alas! <hi>poor Universitie,</hi> how hast thou <hi>offended the
Town of Cambridg</hi> which live's so much upon thee?
(as by woful complaints appear's when a great
plague scatter's the scholars) that as of old it was
in <hi>Tertullian's time, a crime to bee a Christian:</hi> so it's

of this distemper; and therefore I shall desire you to set before
you a <hi>better copie,</hi> that doth bespeak, yea, challenge, yea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

Here you have a description of the brittleness of our bodie;<note place="margin">1. The bodies mortalitie.</note> a
poor Venice-glass, goodly, beautiful, useful, but easily broken:
every word (almost) hath an emphatical intimation; it is but an
<hi>House:</hi> Houses, you know, will bee out of repair, houses will
fall in time; it is but an <hi>earthly house,</hi> and therefore may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into its first principle; it is our earthly house of this <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle;</hi>
the Tabernacle was a <hi>moveable house.</hi> When the children
of Israël were to travel through the wilderness, they had Tents,
they had Tabernacles, moveable houses, fasten'd with a few cords
and pins, easily removed. If our earthy house of this tabernacle
were dissolved, soul and body though knit together, though
the soul bee the <hi>darling,</hi> as the Psalmist speak's, Psal. 35. 17. yet
that knot must bee untied, when they have been married forty,
fifty, threescore years together; it needs no cutting asunder of
the knot, it will break of it self, the lamp will burn out: all this
shewe's the mortalitie of our bodie, but then that which hee doth
intend, is principally and more explicitely to shew you that wee
have indeed an eternal provision made for us in heaven.</p>

Lay two things that have an opposition together,<note place="margin">Contraria juxta se posita clariùs elucescunt.</note> one will
illustrate another, and make it appear more clearly, as Logicians
speak: so saith <hi>Paul, Wee know that wee have a building with God,
an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> When hee had
before spoken of an house that was made of man; Carpenters
build houses: but there is somthing reserved for the Saints, which
is God's own making, and that in a more immediate way; man
indeed is made <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but here it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hee being the more
special immediate maker of this piece of work-manship, God's
own preparing, none can do it but God himself, and hee doth
not use any instrument therein.</p>
            <p>Wee have <hi>a building of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> Great honor, that whilest poor
Saints live here upon earth, <hi>Angels</hi> shall bee their servants, and
all creatures to attend them; and <hi>God himself in heaven</hi> hath been
preparing a house for them, even from <hi>eternitie</hi> what house? a
house not made with hands. So in Hebr. 11. 10. <hi>A Citie whose
builder and founder is God;</hi> wee look for such an one.</p>

that was subject to dissolution; that was earthly, this is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly;
that was but a Tabernacle, a very temporary house, this
is <hi>eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here was <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>certaintie,</hi> this hee was sure of, which is a
great matter, a glorious priviledg. But there is one word which
link's all together, and that must not bee forgotten, and that is
the first in the Text, <hi>For;</hi> What did support <hi>Paul?</hi> What was
his cordial in those great extremities, that hee did not sink when
wave upon wave came flowing in upon him? saith hee, <hi>For wee
know:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 18.</note> hee had beheld those things that were eternal, <hi>Wee look
not upon those things that are temporal, but those that are eternal:</hi> and
here hee, look'd upon them with an eye of certaintie, <hi>For wee
know;</hi> and from these premisses deduce's <hi>this sweet Conclusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that you and I had such faith to do the same, if God should
cast us into as great a sea of troubles, as ever <hi>Paul</hi> was plunged
into, that wee might say, These are nothing! why so? For wee
know, that though the very sentence of death should not onely
bee pass'd, but executed upon us, by these troubles, by the furious
malice of unreasonable men,<note place="margin">Is verè felix qui miser esse nequit.</note> yet they cannot make us miserables
as hee is truly happy indeed that cannot bee made miserable: hee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62139:13"/>
is a rich Citizen indeed, that cannot bee undon by the Devil and
all his Agents; wee know God hath prepared a house for us,
where hee will entertain us with everlasting happiness. Out of
the words (had I time) I might handle these three Propositions.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> That God hath been pleased to make eternal provision for all his

               <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> That it is possible for his Saints to have a certaintie of this,
that God hath built such a house for them in heaven, where hee mean's to
entertain them eternally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> The certain evidence of this to their own hearts, would bee a
most sweet and soveraign cordial under the bitterest troubles that can befall
them.</p>
            <p>Let us begin with the first, and that I shall onely handle at this
time; but before I make any further entrance upon it, give mee
leave onely to premise this one thing:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The best of Saints dwell here in poor tabernacles:</hi> the best of Saints,
all <hi>Adam</hi>'s sons have no better a portion, then to dwell in poor
earthly Tabernacles. Som men are very great, so great, that they
are <hi>called Gods,</hi> Psal. 82. yet <hi>even they must die like men.</hi> It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>for all men once to die,</hi> Hebr. 9. 27. And in the same Dialect
doth the Psalmist speak in another place,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Verily man in his best e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
is altogether vanitie;</hi> not onely man when hee lie's sick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a great long Ague, or a Feaver, or the Stone, or the Gout;
not onely under infirmities of old age, which is a kinde of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but verily man <hi>in his best,</hi> take him <hi>in flore;</hi> take any young
man, when hee hath strength, and vigor, and marrow, and all
heat, all advantages nature can afford him, yet in his <hi>best hee is
altogether vanitie.</hi> Old men must die, and young men may die: I
beleeve you have many instances of both; it may bee it hath cost
som of you many <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>brinish tears:</hi> wee are all poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
at will; it is true, wee are <hi>Tenents for life,</hi> but yet that life
is but for <hi>a moment;</hi> and so indeed our <hi>lease</hi> is but from <hi>moment to
moment.</hi> O that wee were so wise as to consider it, and therefore
to carry our selvs like <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>strangers</hi> here, and <hi>abstain from
fleshly lusts,</hi> which war against our immortal souls, as the Apostl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62139:13"/>
to go plant there a garden, to go furnish your chamber, you are
but for a nights lodging; the very <hi>Stoïcks (Epictetus,</hi> and others)
could speak that language: O that wee could bee the more <hi>active,</hi>

Savior Christ was, I will do my Father's work while it is day,

that wee would so consider, that wee dwell in these brittle houses
of clay,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 16.</note> that wee would <hi>redeem</hi> time, <hi>redeem precious opportunities;
Eternitie dependeth upon every moment;</hi>

their time</hi> to the first temptation in the morning: many young
Gentlemen, Citizens, and others, for whom their fathers have
had many wearisom journeys and thoughts, night and day, to

thing they do in a morning, after they have spruced, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,<note place="margin">Note.</note>

Governors of this Citie, to look to those snares, those
pit-falls, that have undon many thousand young men; and
where many of your estates, after you have gotten them with a
great deal of care and industrie, are thrown away with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the elbow (as they say); they sell away their time, so far
are they from redeeming time: little do they minde eternitie, and
and consider, that at the best they also dwell in houses of clay,
and that in their <hi>best estate they are altogether vanitie;</hi> this I premise.</p>
            <p>There are three things will conduce (if God please to help
mee in the middest of many weaknesses) to open this point, <hi>That

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62139:14"/>
God and Nature</hi> (saith the Philosopher) <hi>never do any thing in

thing in vain. There are many <hi>desperate disputes</hi> (never did wee

hee had better have stayed here; hee did enjoy much of Christ
here; why would Christ himself have given such an answer to
the Thief, Luke 23. 42, 43. <hi>Lord, remember mee when thou comest into

it for you.</p>

this is certain,<note place="margin">Note.</note> (and it is a most sweet truth) <hi>As by the death of

            <p>1. There is a <hi>Possession:</hi>

            <p>2. It is a possession <hi>of life,</hi> nothing is properly <hi>eternal,</hi> but that
that is living; Eternitie being a duration according to <hi>immanent
acts,</hi> (as the School-men speak) and those immanent acts do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
life;<note place="margin">Job 2. 4.</note> now <hi>life for life,</hi> or <hi>life upon life, skin upon skin,</hi> so som

God is absolutely eternal, both <hi>without begining, and without end,</hi>
but this shall have no end, as much as creatures, as much as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

               <hi>all at once;</hi> you have whole heaven, the first <hi>moment you com to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
Time is <hi>Nunc fluens,</hi> but Eternitie is <hi>Nunc stans;</hi> a standing
moment, that hath a co-existencie to <hi>time past, time present, time to

like the stomack to the bodie, they help to maintain the whole;</hi> and I say
it most confidently, there is <hi>never a wicked man in this Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor in any other part of the Christian world, but bee may bless God for
the Presence of Saints amongst them; for it is the children that God take's
care for:</hi> when the hous is <hi>built,</hi> the scaffold shall com down, and
go to the fire; it may bee, when the corn is ripe, and carried in,
the <hi>hedg is designed to bee burned:</hi> God care's not for <hi>wicked
men, but in reference to the corn,</hi> no more then a Carpenter care's for
his <hi>Scaffold, but in reference to his hous.</hi> Make much of the people
of God, crie them not down, because they are of this opinion,
and that opinion, differing in som lesser matters, if they bee
Saints;<note place="margin">Job 22. 30.</note> 
               <hi>the innocent shall deliver the land:</hi> Sodom could not bee
undon,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 16.</note> as long as <hi>Lot</hi> was there; and I am confident there is not
a Saint in London, nor in England, though hee may bee perhaps
uneven in his practise, (the Lord reduce him) hee may have som
unsound opinions, (the Lord recover him) and I wish wee might
all set to do it, with a <hi>Spirit of Meekness,</hi> and Wisedom, and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God's truth; but yet I say, the meanest of God's Saints,
as hee hath <hi>preparations for in heaven,</hi> so is hee a <hi>pawn and pledg of
mercie here upon earth:</hi> therefore they that persecute them, drive
away God's blessing from themselvs. And let mee say this to the
Saints, (I would I could speak as in the name, and bee in the
power of God, in such language as may stick with you); Little
do you consider that the third Partie make's account to <hi>rais
themselvs</hi> in your ruines. For the Quarrel (we must speak out,
the Quarrel) is not <hi>INDEPENDENCIE, nor PRESBYTERIE;</hi>
Quarrel at bottom is the <hi>power of Godliness;</hi> and I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
as I am speaking in this honorable Assemblie at this time,
if the <hi>difference</hi> between them were <hi>compounded,</hi> (as I doubt not but
in God's good time it may bee) you'l have another <hi>Controversie
rise</hi> (unless you can reconcile the seed of the Woman, and the seed
of the Serpent) for that is but their <hi>stalking-horse,</hi> and their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi>
because they see there is a difference between those you call
Presbyterians and Independents,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which they endeavor to improve
to carry on their own designs: just like men that see two school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys
fighting, set them on, and cry, Well don, good boys, &amp;c!
Here they cry out against this Presbyterian, and that Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and com into another shop, and there they will cry out on
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62139:19"/>
the other side, to exasperate their spirits, that so at last <hi>when
you have gotten bloody noses, and can fight no longer,</hi> then they may
get the better of you both: this is their project.</p>
            <p>I beseech you, <hi>suffer not your selvs in any Convention, or publick
meeting whatsoever, to bee seduced by a fine cunning speech that will
talk of Presbytery and the Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> things very good, but
then there com's in a clause in the conclusion of his speech, that
drive's on his own design, and you shal in the mean time, if his
Rhetorick overcom you, do his and the Malignants work; and
God forbid, the Citie of <hi>London</hi> should do it. Give me leave to be
earnest, wherin the good of so <hi>many thousand</hi> souls, the Kingdom,
both Kingdoms, yea, the cause of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches abroad
is so much concerned; (I speak it, as if I were to die and answer
it immediately after Sermon) shake your <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>hearts,</hi> and
though there bee som difference in opinion, it is a thousand
times less evill then to suffer men that are <hi>Enemies to Christ, and
his Kingdom, Covenant, and Presbytery, and Scripture-reformation in
their hearts,</hi> to prevail; O let there bee such thoughts of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
where you shal dwel together, let that possess your souls
so that you may sweetly and seasonably close, and not betray
your selvs to a third partie: For your encouragment consider
what is Eternal in Heaven: Why brethren, there is an eternal

               <hi>Take heed of carnall company;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Beware of carnal compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> flie and shun them; there
are no Drunkards in Heaven; I mean such as live and dye drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
impenitently, no such persons in Heaven, that live impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently
in their sins; Away <hi>from mee all such, God hath heard the
voice of my weepings:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 6. 8.</note> What shall I do to convers with such men

<hi>Vse creatures onely as your servants, not as your friends,</hi> if God
have provided an Eternitie, do not all things heer, as if you
were at home; but do things heer, as it were in your way to the
Kingdom; as the Painter said, who being ask't why hee was so
exact in his Painting, why (said hee) these pieces are for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.
I pray for Eternitie, and I desire to act in my place, as a
Governor of a City, Alderman, Parliament-man, whatsoever
condition I live in, as a Minister, I do it for Eternity, and so
labor to keep your hearts above all comforts: It is a great
mistake,<note place="margin">uti fruendis, &amp; frui utendis.</note> 
               <hi>Austin</hi> hath it, that men do use things they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,

Friends, that wee should make onely our servants.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Have your conversation in Heaven. Phil. 3. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Have your conversation in Heaven,</hi> O speak heavenly

let every Sabbath day bee to you <hi>an Epitome of Heaven:</hi> when
ever you com to an <hi>Ordinance</hi> think, now I am in a corner of

to God, and admire and adore his mercies, and to powr out
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62139:20"/>
Hallelujahs to him, as if you were in Heaven. And then in the
fourth and last place: <hi>Bee much in communion with God;</hi> for what
is Heaven,<note place="margin">4. Bee much in communion with God.</note> but the ful pitch of <hi>Communion with God,</hi> bee glad of
address to God, com not to prayer, as to <hi>a task,</hi> but as to a <hi>sweet

in prayer, but also to <hi>enjoy thy God in prayer,</hi> and to have a
sweet communion and fellowship with thy Savior there, and
that there may bee som <hi>illapses of his spirit into thy spirit,</hi> and som
irradiations of the Sun of righteousness, some beams to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy soul, this is heaven. And therefore I beseech you in
the last place, (and so I shall dispatch, I'le not meddle with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two points,<note place="margin">Use IV.</note> but by way of Motive) If it bee so, Take a
<hi>friendly caution,</hi> beware as you love eternal happiness of an
immortal soul, do not let things lie at six and sevens, (as they
say) at meer <hi>uncertainties</hi> any longer, but give diligence as to
make your calling and election, so likewise to make your <hi>eternal
mansions</hi> reserved for you in Heaven, as sure to you, give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 10. Now I should have added the two next
points, one is to shew you,</p>
            <p>That <hi>it is possible to attain such a certainty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. e.</note> and the other is to
shew you,</p>
            <p>That <hi>it is a soveraign Cordiall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. 3.</note> 
               <hi>in the greatest troubles;</hi> but I'le
wrap them up, I see the time is gone; onely two Motives:</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Motive 1.</note> Though to attain such a certainty <hi>bee difficult, yet</hi> it <hi>is
possible;</hi> there is not onely <hi>a Faith of adherence,</hi> by which you rest
upon Christ for salvation,<note place="margin">Faith of Adherence.</note> but a <hi>Faith of evidence,</hi> by which you
know Christ to bee your Savior;<note place="margin">Evidence.</note> 
               <hi>that all Saints have,</hi> and this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they may have; the one is required to the <hi>Esse</hi> of a Christian,
to the beeing, but this to the <hi>wel-beeing</hi> of a Christian; therefore
som of Gods Saints want it, and the best of Gods Saints have
it not at all times, but somtimes to prepare them for a cross, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to chear them under a cross, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> when they
were in the prison,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 25.</note> somtimes to <hi>reward and crown them after a cross,</hi>
after great troubles: Let mee add this further:</p>
            <p>There is that Divines call certainty of the <hi>thing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Certitudo Objecti.</note> and of the
<hi>Person,</hi> the certaintie of <hi>the thing, it depend's upon Gods decree,</hi> upon
the mightie and invincible power of <hi>the spirit of God,</hi> upon the
efficacie of the death and intercession of Jesus Christ;<note place="margin">Subjecti.</note> of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62139:21"/>
thing it shall bee made good; the Saints shall com to Heaven;
but then certaintie of the Person, that is more or less, as God is
pleased to dispens himself; Somtimes the Saints pay a little
<hi>fine, have a little legal humiliation,</hi> then they pay a <hi>great deal of rent,</hi>
it may bee more trouble about their Sanctification afterwards:<note place="margin">Note.</note>
somtimes they pay a great Fine, when they are converted, lye
long under a <hi>spirit of bondage,</hi> then after six or seven or more
years, the spirit of adoption take's possession of them, (it may
bee) they never meet with <hi>a cloudy day</hi> many years afterwards,
heer is <hi>Certitudo subjecti,</hi> as God please's to dispens himself, and
this may bee the Portion of many Saints, not onely as an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
priviledg to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> (as the Papists would
make us beleeve) but as a priviledg common to the Saints; that
is, <hi>they are all capable of it,</hi> and they may attain it, if God pleas,
according to the ordinary rules of his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wee know saith
<hi>Paul, Rom. 8. 35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
&amp;c.</hi> Hee saith not onely of himself, but of others; but how
com you to this certaintie? there is a threefold seal thereof.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>are the promises of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Three seals to assure the Saints certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heaven. 1. The blood of Christ seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-promises. 2 Cor. 1. 20.</note> which are <hi>yea, and Amen in
Christ,</hi> and they are seal'd in his blood; though thy name bee not
written there, yet it is included, and Faith will spie and pick
it out; As when you have the Commandement, (the Papists use
this as a great Argument;) Is no man sure that hee is in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
because <hi>John or Zachary is not in the promise?</hi> so you may
as well say <hi>no man is obliged in the Commandement,</hi> because his name
is not there; now as you must apply the Commandements, so
the promises, and Faith will fetch out thy name that is wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up in the general: And secondly,<note place="margin">2. Seal of the Sacraments which are seals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As there is the blood of Jesus Christ, to seal the promises, in
whom they are all <hi>Yea and Amen, 2 Corinthians</hi> 1. So there
is the seal of the Sacraments, <hi>a publick standing visible seal,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
things are made more credible to us, though they are as true
in themselvs as things can bee; <hi>yet by a present visible representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
to help your sens, you shall have the material Elements,
as it is <hi>Austins</hi> comparison; <hi>When a man is upon the ground, that
bee may bee raised towards Heaven, hee must make use of his hands,
leaning upon the earth:</hi> So that wee may bee lifted up to Heaven,
Jesus Christ hath appointed these things sensible to help our
Faith; and then thirdly,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:62139:21"/>
There <hi>is the Privie Seal</hi> of the holy Spirit, which by a secree
work doth reallize and particularize the two former;<note place="margin">3. Third seal, the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> 
               <hi>Grieve not
the holy Spirit, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption: Ephes.</hi>
4. 30.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12.</note> So that it is possible, God enabling them <hi>fiducially to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
such promises</hi> to themselvs, and to <hi>see the work of grace clearly in
their hearts;</hi> and that the certainty of their salvation shall bee
sealed to them; 1 Joh. 5. 7. <hi>There are three that bear witness
in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost, and these three
are one;</hi> All the the three glorious Persons concur as to work
so to confirm our Salvation. The Testimonie, the Record is,
<hi>v. 11. That God hath given to us eternal life, and this life it in his
Son.</hi> v. 8. <hi>There are three that bear witness on earth, the spirit, and
the Water, and the Blood, and these three agree in one,</hi> which seem's
to bee the Spirits Testimonie in the work of <hi>Vocation,</hi> the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of Water in <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and of Blood in <hi>Justification,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the Sacraments,<note place="margin">2 Motive. Difficulty, Possibility, Excellency, three whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a most sweet and excellent thing, if you could attain this:
Brethren, it is the very next <hi>door to Heaven,</hi> to bee sure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
the very next thing to the being in Heaven, is <hi>to have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Heaven;</hi> you are in the Suburbs, you are in the Porch,
you have entered Paradise, that glorious Palace, when you
com once to this assurance; O sweet! it is a very Heaven here
upon earth; Peace of conscience that passe's understanding, and
joy in the holy Ghost, which is unspeakable and glorious, these
are the words the Scripture here use's of it, as <hi>of the first fruits of
Heaven:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 7. 1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> Now what is this? why it is indeed the <hi>beleeving and
the eying of those things that are eternal, and a certain knowledg,</hi> as
<hi>Paul</hi> speak's there in that place, 2 Corinthians 4. 17. <hi>For our
light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
and eternal weight of glory; Paul</hi> a man of great crosses, yet
you see in the midst of all had the greatest comforts, a light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
hee had told you a sad story before of his troubles,<note place="margin">v. 8, 9, 10.</note>
that would (it may bee) fink your hearts and mine, yet here
light afflictions, which were but for a moment, they were great
and long, yet hee call's them light and momentanie; what is the
reason? why, they work for us <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory;</hi> worketh out, as the spirit of God carrie's you
through, not by way of <hi>merit;</hi> a <hi>far more exceeding weight of glory,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62139:22"/>
as the Spirit of God prepare's them for Heaven, so Heaven is
prepared for them; and you shall finde, it is prepared in
this method, <hi>by affliction;</hi> as in the 1 <hi>Peter 5. 10. The God of
grace that hath called you to his eternal glory, make you perfect after
you have suffered a while;</hi> this Hyperbolical weight of glory, which
<hi>Paul</hi> tryed in his afflictions did uphold him.</p>
            <p>It is not moral Philosophers apprehensions, that could sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them; there was <hi>Aristides, and Socrates,</hi> and others, that
might bee called the <hi>Puritans among the Heathens,</hi> who went very
far and suffered much, <hi>Socrates</hi> to death; yet doubtless if they
had nothing but meer morality, it would not have comforted
them.</p>
            <p>As moral Philosophy wil not carry a man thorow when he com's
to suffer, so it is not Jesuitical fancies which som Papists have that
can yield solid comfort; It is a thing worth knowing, I would eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one knew it;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Burroughes Gracious spirit, c. 3.</note> it is indeed in <hi>Hospinian,</hi> &amp; you wil finde it in the
excellent Book of that man of God, that now is triumphing in
Heaven, hee wil tel you how the <hi>Jesuits use to raise a man to kil
a King,</hi> som of them the new <hi>Romanists</hi> com to venter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
very far, and wil expose themselvs to suffer much, to that
which they think Martyrdom, as the old <hi>Roman Heathens,</hi> and
others did, who threw themselvs somtimes into the greatest
troubles, even to death it self; (Popularitie and Vain-glory,
and self-respect, and such considerations may do much:) <hi>How
do they raise a man to kil a King? First, they bring him to such a place,
and there they shew him a consecrated Knife, and so many consecrated
beads hanging upon it, and then they deliver it into his hand, O heer is
the sword of Gideon, Jephtah, &amp;c. and pray to God to bless him, and
prosper him, then they carry him to an Altar, there they shew him the
picture of Jacobus Clemens that kill'd Henry the third to animate him,
and then they fain</hi> (as they can act a part most diabolically) <hi>and
seem to envy him, O to what a height of happiness art thou advanced,
that canst kil a King.</hi> (It is a dangerous Religion, whose principles
lead to that, to eat their Maker, and kill their King;) yet this
you see they do, and this wil heighten a poor man for a while,
and som of them are so desperate and proud, and vainglorious,
they wil do it, but this wil not last, this will not bee a sufficient
Cordial, the soveraign Cordial of all, <hi>is to behold Eternitie,</hi> to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62139:22"/>
see him that is invisible, as <hi>Moses</hi> did, and to see the things that
were Eternal, as <hi>Paul</hi> heer did.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 27.</note> One asked the great Duke of
<hi>Saxonie,</hi> How came you to bee upheld in so many troubles, you
have met withall? Saith hee, <hi>I felt the Divine consolations of the
Martyrs:</hi> If God should let wicked men prevail, and the disaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
partie of both Kingdoms (who now it is clear are joyned,
and <hi>Ireland</hi> I doubt in too) I am afraid they have all one design,
if God should suffer them so far, and leave the Saints of God so
far to themselvs, to give advantage to them, to suffer wicked
men to prevail, yet God wil carry on his cause. The Revelation
wil prove true, they cannot undo us, they can but send us to
<hi>Heaven:</hi> I could tel you a sad storie (which I had from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)
of a Gentleman, that had don very good service to his
Country in the Parliament, who was one of the Eleven, came to
take his leave of one of the greatest Subjects in the Kingdom, by
his place, said to him this, when hee came for a Pass to go over
Sea, Hee thank'd him for his kindness, saying, <hi>Had the plot prevail'd

let us labor to acquaint our selvs with the true, yet the divine
<hi>Consolations of the Martyrs,</hi> at least som taste of them, then let the
Devil, and all the Malignants in Hell, and on earth do their
