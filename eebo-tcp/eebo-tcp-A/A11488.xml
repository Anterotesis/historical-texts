            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen Laureola had endyd her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, I sawe well her reasons were short, but longe was her trouble &amp; displeasour. So I departed fro her, &amp; thought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many thynges, the which greuously tormentyd me, I remembred how farre I was out of Spayne, &amp; of my longe taryeng thence.

was accustomyd to do before, without changynge of her porte or chere: whose sure demeanour brought me in greate suspecte. I thought she dyd it to proue yf I wolde returne agayne to entre in to my fyrste reasons, I fearyd leste she hadde dissimuled to cause me to take co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage to haue spoken agayne for Lerea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, and then to haue punys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So I coulde not tell wherto to truste, thus I passed that daye and dyuerce other, and euer me thought by the apparence that I could se by her, that I hadde more cause to be bolde, then reason to feare. And in that byleue, I wayted a tyme conuenient, &amp; spake with her agayne, shewynge, my selfe fearefull, though I was not so in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dede. For in such besynes, and with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che persons, it is behouable to fynde some doubtfull turbation: for in suche cases, to moche boldenes is reputyd fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, for therby myghte be thought that the dignyte, nor auctorite of the persone
<pb facs="tcp:11095:18"/>
were not estemed. Therfore to saue me fro that errour, I spake to her with no great audacite, but in a fearefull maner So I shewed her all that I thought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenient, for the remedy of Lereano, but her aunswer was accordyng to the fyrst sauyng she was not so force, nor in such displeasour with me, as she was before. How be it, in her wordes, she gaue me knowledge, that I shulde be styll and holde my peace, but yet me thought her continance gaue me lycence to speake. And thus euer when I founde tyme &amp; place, I requyred her to haue pitie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lereano. And so diuers tymes I found her aunswers sharpe in wordes, &amp; meke in countenance. And when I had well aduysed al her demeanour, I hoped vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon some profytte, scynge in her dyuers thynges, wherby an amorous harte myght be knowen: for euer when I saw her alone, she was pensyfe and full of study. And when she was amonge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pauy, she wolde not be mery, she abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

company, and to be alone was her pleasour, often tymes she wolde fayne her selfe syke, to eschewe other pleasurs and if she were espyed, she wolde fayne some dolour or payne, and often tymes she wolde gyue sore sighes. And if Lere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ano hadde bene named in her presence, she wolde sodeynly starte, and leue her comynge, and blushe redde as a rose &amp; agayne pale: her voyce wolde change, and her mouth waxe drye, and though she coueryd her thoughtes as moch as was possyble, yet her piteous passyon, surmounted her discrete dissimulation, (I say) pitefulnes, for without doubte, accordyng as she shewed after, she recey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued these alterations, more of pytie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of loue.

            <p>Syr it is not without reason that noble princes in tyme past ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theyr counsaillors, to ordre by them what was to be done: wherby they found great profytte.

The fyrst is bycause that men may moche better order other mens maters, rather then theyr owne: for the harte of hym that the mater tochyth can not be with oute some ire, couetesnes, affection, or
<pb facs="tcp:11095:50"/>
desire, or some other lyke condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that he shall not determyne the cause, as he ought to do. The .ii. is when maters be pleatyd and arguyd: the traugth is the better knowen. The .iii. yf the counsaylours ordeyne iustly, and bryng the mater well to passe: the glory and honour is to them that folowyth suche counsayll. The .iiii. is yf by a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother mannes counsayll the besynes fayleth and takyth none effecte: yet he that demaundeth the counsayll is oute of blame &amp; charge: and they that gaue the counsayll muste bere the charge &amp; faulte. The .v. ys bycause good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sayl often tymes assuryth thynges that be dobutious. The .vi. is yf a man be faulen in euyl fortune: yet in all aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites good counsayll putteth the pertye in good hope. Certaynely syr it is but a blynde counsayll, a man to counsayll hym selfe, knowynge hym selfe in any furour or passion. Therfore syr blame vs not, though in the fercenes of your

And if they fynde them selfe troublyde with any passion, tyll they be cleryd therfro, they shulde gyue no sentence. And yf they debate, and delaye ther deades, then they do well: for in all suche weighty maters, hast is daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse, and tariynge is suretie. A wyse

<pb facs="tcp:11095:79"/>
The fyrst is bycause by theyr meanes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> symple &amp; rude persones dispose them selfe to attayne to vertue, and to pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and not alonely, they cause the symple to be discrete, but they cause them that be discrete to be more subtile: for if they be luryd with the passion of loue, they study then somoche for theyr libertie &amp; in sufferynge of theyr dolour they study &amp; imagyne to speke reasones so swete and so mete for theyr purpose, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> often tymes for compassyon therof they are delyuerd: &amp; such as be symple, and rude of nature, yf they be enteryd in to loue though they begynne rudely, yet they quycken so theyr vnderstandynge, that often tymes they come therby to wysdome. This they haue by women thought theyr naturall reasone fayle. The .ii. reason is that by reason of iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stice they cause men to haue the vertue of sufferance, for such as be in the trayn of loue and suffre payne out of mesure they take it in maner for a comeforte,
<pb facs="tcp:11095:79"/>
iustifyinge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they suffer it ryghtwy fly and yet they make vs not alonely ioy for this vertue, but also for other as na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall. For they that be stedfast louers, to be praysed of them that they serue, they seke all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wayes they can to pleace, for which cause they lyue iustly not exce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge in any thynge, in that is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nor mete to be done, bycause they wolde not be famyd to be of euyll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycions, or to vse any euyll customes. The .iii. cause is they make vs worthy in the vertue of atemperance, bycause they shulde not abhorre vs, nor that we shuld not be behatyd of them, they cause vs to vse atemperance in eatynge and drynkyng and slepyng, and in all other thynges that perteynith to the vertue of atemperance aswell in spekynge as in all other warkes, so that we woll not excede in no poynte frome hones<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:11095:80"/>
doth encrease, they cause vs to be strong to suffre, they cause hardynes to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price, they cause the harte to hope, when they putte theyr louers to any ieopedy, they cause them to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For theyr sakes they begynne, &amp; make an ende of many greate e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terprices, puttyng theyr stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth in the state as they deserue: wherfore we may well indge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be bounde to them The .v. is they endue vs with no lesse vertuos theogecals, then they do with vertuos cardynals. And to speke of the fyrst, the which is faith, yf any man be in dought of his beleue, if his mynde be ones set in loue, then he shall truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in god, and laude his puyssance to create suche a creature as his louer is, with so excellent beawtye, and they wyll be so deuoute, that the apostels in holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shall haue of them none aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage The .vi. reasone is bycause they engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

The .vii. reason is, they cause vs to deserue charyte, the propretie ther of is loue: this restith in our wyll, this we put in our thoughtes, this we drawe in to our memory, this we ferme in our hartes. And though it be so that we vse this loue towardes our loueres, yet it redoundithe to the souerayne vtilyte, and welthe in tyme to come, so that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> quyke contricion it shall brynge vs to god: for loue at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pynche of deth causith vs to do almesse deades, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith

The .viii. reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bycause they make vs contemplatiue, for the prisoners of loue, do gyue them selfe to contemplacion, in remembrynge the beaute grace and excellence of them that they loue, and so moche they thynke vpon theyr passions, that often tymes they remember god, &amp; set so theyr hartes vpon hym, that they thynke them selfe well worthy to receyue theyr paynes &amp; torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. Thus it may be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> clerly that women helpe &amp; ayde men, to wynne the glory perdurable.
