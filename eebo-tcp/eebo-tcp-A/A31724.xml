            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF AN
English-Man.</head>
            <l>BY the first Principles, of Mother Earth</l>
            <l>An <hi>English man</hi> is noble, by his birth</l>
            <l>Hath a fine body, and an Aspect Rare</l>
            <l>Shines like the <hi>Stars</hi> in Northern <hi>Hemesphere,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He being of the purest matter made</l>
            <l>As by the wise Phylosopher is said</l>
            <l>Crowns him, in the Figure of his Manhood high,</l>
            <l>As the <hi>sun</hi> is the <hi>Candle</hi> of the Sky</l>
            <l>

            <l>And plant him in their Golden Chair of <hi>State;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So highly born, that from his Blood we hope</l>
            <l>That he may rule, in Princedomes <hi>Horoscope:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He feareth God, and Honours high his King</l>
            <l>Acting, and doing well in every thing;</l>
            <l>His <hi>Ethicks</hi> are so high, and learning Rare,</l>
            <l>Though he treads on the <hi>Earth,</hi> yet flies in <hi>Air,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And as <hi>Divinity</hi> doth <hi>Law</hi> excell,</l>
            <l>So in him, doth true <hi>Perfection</hi> dwell;</l>
            <l>Religious Reason is his sole delight,</l>
            <l>And loves to see both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> go right:</l>
            <l>To all he's <hi>Allamode, Iantee,</hi> and <hi>Neat,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Brisk, Complaisant, Endearing,</hi> and <hi>Compleat;</hi>

            <l>Having both Wisdom and good wit at will,</l>
            <l>And can do all things, unless that of ill:</l>
            <l>And for his Innocence and Conscience high,</l>
            <l>He'1 duell with the <hi>Devils</hi> in the Sky?</l>
            <l>Following the <hi>Dictates</hi> of his reall Nature,</l>
            <l>Shewing that the reasonable Creature</l>
            <l>Is not for to be forc'd, but gently led</l>
            <l>By Governours, and by his dearest Head;</l>
            <l>He takes his Princes part against the <hi>Devil,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And will not have him come to any evil;</l>
            <l>And yet Resolves that he will be no slave,</l>
            <l>Unless unto the Mighty, Good, and Brave;</l>
            <l>He payes all just <hi>Devoires,</hi> where truly due,</l>
            <l>And where it is Fictitious and not true,</l>
            <l>Grows careless of the Justice of his breast,</l>
            <l>And so leaves all to take his pleasant rest:</l>
            <l>Shewing 'gainst Reason and Religion,</l>
            <l>Nothing in humane interests is done;</l>
            <l>Since 'tis a thing that mounts him to the Grove</l>
            <l>Of Joy, and Peace, and Universal Love.</l>
            <l>Where when the <hi>Feast</hi> is o're, and <hi>Banquet</hi> done,</l>
            <l>Like th' <hi>Eagle</hi> he shall fly beyond the <hi>Sun:</hi>

Where he shall see such <hi>Prospects</hi> of delight,</l>

            <l>With all <hi>Celestial</hi> and eternal Charms.</l>

            <l>To behold him in his curious Train?</l>
            <l>His <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Voice,</hi> proclaim the Angelick nature,</l>
            <l>Making him the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Creature:</l>
            <l>And all his vertues do denote him high</l>
            <l>To be the next a kin to the Divinity?</l>
            <l>Their Speech is mean like to the Birds of th' Field,</l>
            <l>Therefore a pleasant Conversation yield:</l>
            <l>Shewing the variety of the World,</l>
            <l>As differing Lights from the same Sun are hurl'd;</l>
            <l>But in him the Indies of his love's laid out,</l>
            <l>Which makes him turn the Giddy world about?</l>

            <l>Heaven shewing it self most unto its own,</l>

               <hi>In short</hi> he's the Flower of the Creation,</l>

            </l>
            <l>The Favourite both of Heaven and of Earth,</l>
