         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Accomplish'd
COURTIER,</head>
            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>The various end and aime of Courtiers. The way by
which they may ingratiate themselves with the
Prince, whatsoever disposition he be of. To this,
end it is needfull, that a man be notified to the
Prince. Some are known by the splendour of their
Family, others by their own Industry.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T behoveth every man, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
rightly, and in order, to
institute his actions; first, to
consider the end, or aime of
such his enterprises.</p>
            <p>2. They who are drawn to
Court, prefix not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the like end; for some are led thither by
hope of gain, others by ambition, and hope of
honour.</p>
            <p>3. Some are drawn thither by a desire of
commanding others; some also (as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith)
by a desire of destroying, hurting, and procuring
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93484:6"/>
businesse to others. Few propose and intend
the advantage and safety of the Prince.</p>
            <p>4. The way of obtaining this (whatever their
ends be) is common to all Courtiers (to wit) the
favour of the Prince. In the prosecution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
every one sets his wits on worke, and is
very industrious.</p>
            <p>5. To get the Princes favour, its needfull that
you be both known to him, and also approve your
Manners and Actions, and by some laudable way
please him.</p>
            <p>6. There are some, the Splendor of whose Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and Authority by reason of their office (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more ample or mean; whether purchased by
Money or discended by Inheritance) hath forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
their admittance to the Prince. These are
exempted from labouring addresses; and are,
as it were, in the mid-way to further promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>7. They to whom these things are wanting in
the beginning are put to more labour. But when
once they come to be known to the Prince so that
he judge them fit for his service, are often moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above others, because they being raised from
a lower place (at least from a meaner fortune)
become more subject, and more addicted to the
will of the Prince; whom they more submissively
reverence and esteem, as the sole Author of their
Dignity and Promotion.</p>
            <p>8. The meanes and way of Nobles (so born)
is very different and hath much disparity. The
Dignity of their Office or Family puts a kind of
necessity on them to maintain their own honour,
and sometimes to preferr their own opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93484:6"/>
the Prince's; who is also oft-times more
difficult to promote them, out of a kind of Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or feare, lest their Authority should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
against the Author thereof, which to represse
would be hazardous to himself and his dominion.
On the contrary, the suppression of one raised
from basenesse is more p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oclive; so that if the
Prince turn his back on him, or suffer him to be
at the will of great Ones (who for the most part
have an evill eye on such) he soon failes. I speak
of Princes discreet aud prudent, and who know
how to limit and circumscribe the power of those
whom they love and advance, not conferring on
One the whole stresse of Command, but even
holding under the very Peers; yet this course
hath not been expedient to some Princes.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>Two wayes to aucupate the Favour of the Prince.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THere are two wayes especially and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and frequent whereby Courtiers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to themselves Authority and Favour with
the Prince.</p>
            <p>1. One is the course of such who go about
to procure to themselves and hunt after publique
Charges, Offices, and Dignities; and, in the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls
of such Dignities and Imployments more
neer, content themselves with such as are lower &amp;
at greater distance from Supremacy.</p>
            <p>2. The other, is of such as follow the Court
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93484:7"/>
continually seeking to be imployed in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's
most secret businesses and extraordinary soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations
for others.</p>
            <p>3. The last of these is the most compendious,
and beares the impresse and footsteps of such as
have been in the most flagrant and flourishing
favour and acceptance with their Prince. Such
was <hi>Mecoenas</hi> with <hi>Augustus,</hi> and <hi>Salustius</hi> with
him also and <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>essor. Of whom
<hi>Tacitus</hi> in his Annal 3. sayes thus: Although <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustius</hi>
emulating <hi>Mecoenas</hi> by a prompt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
entrance to honour, yet without the dignity
of a Senator, out-stript many in power, who had
triumphed and were of Consular dignity; being
divers from the institutes of the Auncients by his
trimnes and sprucenesse, and by wealth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
more prone to luxury; had never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
such vigor of mind as was fit for great
negotiations, and so much the sharper by how
much he did ostentate and brag of sleep and sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</p>
            <p>The like to whom was <hi>Mella,</hi> of whom the
same <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the twelfth of his Annals, saith:
<hi>Mella</hi> being descendred from the same Linage
with <hi>Gallio</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> abstained from the desire of
honour through a prepesterous ambition, that
being a Roman Knight he might equalize the
power of a Consul, and also believed that it was
a shorter way to get riches by procurations and
soliciting for others, then by negotiating for the
Prince.</p>

         <div n="3" type="chapter">

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>Divers wayes to be notified to the Prince,</p>
            </argument>
            <p>TO be made known and be approved to the
Prince the wayes are divers also, according
to the diversity both of the Suitors at Court,
and of the Times. There are some which render
themselves known by some action (notably ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
usefull or glorious) or else by their (more
then vulgar) vertue and honesty. To some, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans recommendation hath opened the way
to the Prince, and this way is more usuall then the
rest.</p>
            <p>2. Princes act in place so eminent above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and they are hedged about with such a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
troop of Noble and deserving Courtiers
that a Novice or new commer can scarce presse
through such a thicket of obstacles unlesse there
be some which may lead him by the hand and
even force his entrance through them, or else
that he himself can (by some unusual action) draw
the eyes of all men and consequently of the Prince
towards him.</p>
            <p>3. Memorable is the fact of a certain Architect
whom some call <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mocrates,</hi> others <hi>Stacicrates</hi> who
desiring to be known to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, when
all the great Ones refused to bring him to the
King, consults and resolves with himself to offer
himself to the Kings view, naked, and not annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93484:8"/>
with oyl, his head invironed with a Crown of
Popler; a Lyons skin cast over his right should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and holding in his right hand a wharle-Bat or
clubb. And forthwith in this Attire he approaches
the presence of <hi>Alexander</hi> sitting on the Tribunal:
the novelty hereof drew the eyes of all, and of
<hi>Alexander</hi> also, so that he commanded him to be
brought unto him. And although the King he
approved not the Project, yet he ordered he should
be inrolled, and took him as one of his Family at
Court.</p>
            <p>4. We have brought this Example not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
any man that by such a Nugament or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
he may insinuate into the Princes favour, but
to shew that such (who are at a distance) unlesse
they be assisted by some flourishing in Authority,
are not fit to break through such a troop of men
who compasse the Prince about, unlesse by some
notable exploit or unusual accident they seem to
merit; and, as the Poet saith, To be pointed at
with the finger; and that it be said of him, (That's

            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>The manners, conditions, inclinations, and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of Princes, and their Familiars, are to be
known by such as are Court-suitors.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. AN unadvanced Courtier, and he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
both to be known to, and beloved
of his Prince, ought to consider both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he manners
and conditions of the Prince, and those his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
in whom he most confideth; of great
Ones also, and of all those, who either are able
to assist him, or, on the contrary, (being snatcht
from the Prince, either by the emulation, fear,
envy, hatred, or endeavour, of himself or those
about him) are able to prejudice him. First, it
is necessary, that he have a clear insight into the
in linations and customs of the Prince, which do
commonly follow the temperature of his body;
for although this may be concealed by cautelous
and wary Princes, yet it can hardly be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that
at last it will break forth, and shew it self; since
all their actions are so exposed to the eyes of all
men, that it cannot be, but some will take
notice which way they tend. They are also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so sharply stimulated and enraged, by the
weightinesse of negotiations, that forgetting to
dissemble, they betray their ingenies and naturall
dispositions: Even <hi>Tiberius,</hi> although the most
crafty Artificer of dissimulation, could not so
well bear up the scene of his contracted brow,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93484:9"/>
but that time, by little and little, brought all his
Arts to light.</p>
            <p>2. But since the propensions and inclinations
of all men, but chiefly of Princes, are divers,
and almost infinite, yet may they be brought to
two heads; one whereof containeth such, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
their Greatnesse; the other, their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
            <p>3. Greatnesse consisteth either in fame or
wealth, or in the obsequiousnesse of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or, lastly, in the strength, puissance, and
faithfulnesse of Armies. In these, as the Prince
fareth well, and need requireth, a man ought
to accommodate his endeavours; which whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doth wittily, (provided he be neither suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
nor hated upon any other account) shall
doubtlesse be mostly accepted with his Prince.</p>
            <p>4. The same is to be conceived and judged,
concerning the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itious pleasures and affections
of Princes: If he be of a diffident and timorous
Genius, you may conceive, that a bold Accuser &amp;
Delator, and one who careth not much for the
envy of great ones, and is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rompt and ready to
execute his Prince's commands, shall find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with him; such a one <hi>Tacitus</hi> describeth
<hi>Sejanus</hi> to be, He had a body, (saith he in the
fourth of his <hi>Annalls)</hi> able for labour, a bold
mind, shie and wary of himself, to others a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer
of crimes, closely flattering and proud,
openly composed and modest, inwardly gripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and covetous.</p>
            <p>5. If the Prince delight in drinking, he will
delight in those thereunto addicted; for which
cause, <hi>Tiberius</hi> loved <hi>Pomponius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Piso;</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93484:9"/>
whereof <hi>Suetonius</hi> writing of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in his
<hi>chap.</hi> 24. saith thus, Afterwards the Prince, (to
the corrupting of publick manners) spent two
whole nights and daies, in continuall eating and
drinking, with <hi>Pomponius. Flaccus,</hi> and <hi>Piso;</hi> on
the one of which, he conferred the Province of
<hi>Syria;</hi> on the other, the Presidentship of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and in books professed them, <hi>omnium
horarum amicos,</hi> his jolly friends and company at
all hours.</p>
            <p>6. The same <hi>Tiberius,</hi> (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports)
preferred a most ignorant and simple fellow, that
sought onely for a Questorship, and Tax-gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
before his Nobles, for drinking at a Banquet,
himself taking off his whole glasses.</p>
            <p>7. Society in lust endeared <hi>Tigellinus</hi> to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
as <hi>Tacitus, Annal</hi> 14. hath it: <hi>Tigellinus,</hi> saith
he, became more strong in the Princes mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
associated with him in his most intimate and
close pleasures. So <hi>Petronius</hi> the Arbitrator, and
Judge of Elegancy, (they are the same Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
words, <hi>Annal. 16.)</hi> being taken in among
those few familiars to <hi>Nero,</hi> he thought nothing
pleasant and delicate, in his affluence and plenty,
but what <hi>Petronius</hi> had given his approbation of.
After the same example, <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
preferred to all the dignities of the Empire,
men most like themselves in licentiousnesse.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Mutianus</hi> was not so well beloved of <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi>
for his faithfull duty and actions, as for that
he was most fit (before others) to satisfie his
avaritious desires.</p>
            <p>9. Such covetousnesse endeared a certain
youth to <hi>Isaacius Angelus,</hi> (who held the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93484:10"/>
after the death of <hi>Theodorus)</hi> whom he
made President of his Exchequer, (although he
could hardly write) upon hopes to participate of
the large Bribes, which he there might have
opportunity to take, from such as had occasion
to make use of him in that employment.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Manuel Comnenus,</hi> an Emperour also, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for a sharp Exactor, and crafty Artificer, in
gathering of Tribute and Customes, and one that
might largely supply his prodigality with mony,
chose <hi>John Pucius,</hi> a fellow rude, and morose,
and testy, hard to be accosted and spoken to, of
intolerable asperity and sharpnesse; and, in a
word, <hi>Procuratorem vultu qui praeferat ipso,</hi> who
carried a Procurer or Solicitor in his very face.
And not content herewith, or as if that were not
enough, put him in such high Authority, that
he not onely trampled upon all others in dignity,
but would abrogate and disannul the Decrees and
Edicts of the Prince, and Ordinances of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
upon pretext of his houshold affairs, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and poleing the most necessary advantages,
(such as was the custody of the Gallies) the chief
strength and benefit of the Empire.</p>

            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>Whether or no, and how the affections of Princes are to
be seconded and obeyed. How, and wherefore honest
men, may undertake Courtship, and publick Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. NOw that they who desire to find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with a Prince, ought to serve him in
his affections, is a thing not onely very well
known, but also experienced, by the daily use
of Courtiers.</p>
            <p>2. An honest man will admire this, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that by this rule, he is intercluded and shut
out, from any entrance into Court, whereby
he is bidden to follow the inclinations of the
Prince, since they are oft-times devious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant,
from the path of reason and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.</p>
            <p>3. I confesse, for him that would live a life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
innocent, and remote from the custom
of those, who are addicted to evill Arts, and
their own Genius, I esteem it better, that he
abstain from Court, because sometimes men are
there corrupted, though formerly most innocent
and faultlesse.</p>
            <p>4. Of such corruptions, let us see an example
or two. <hi>Festinus,</hi> the familiar of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> in
the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
<hi>Asia</hi> with much renown, and fame of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and modesty, being a sharp reprehender of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93484:11"/>
the violences and cruell facts of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> and
of the calumnies, by which he (for his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage)
had circumvented many.</p>
            <p>5. But observing, that by such doings, his
Companion was made President of the Pretorian
Bands, (which Dignity was second to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorship
onely) he changed his course of life, and
imitating <hi>Maximinus,</hi> did many things cruelly
and unjustly.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>John Pucius,</hi> (mentioned a little before) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
in the affairs and treasure of <hi>Manuel</hi>
the Emperour, with great integrity, whereby it
came to passe, that the haughtinesse and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
actings of the Emperour, became more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
to mens minds: At length, applying his
mind (as <hi>Nicetas</hi> testifieth) to the getting of
wealth, fell short of none of the like Office, in
covetousnesse; and became also a president to his
friends to do the like, many of whom being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by his example, followed his steps:
Others, although better, and such as could not
be corrupted themselves, yet suffered others to
be tainted, for fear of imminent banishment, to
such as should dare to oppose themselves.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Aristides,</hi> just in name and deed, President
to the Athenians, of their publick Exchequer, at
first, of his own ingenuity, and also to discharge
the office of an honest man, was carefull to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those, who were employed under him, from
purloyning and robbing the Treasury. At length
they accuse him of pilfering, and exclaim on him,
as one of the most rapacious and ravenous
thieves, that ever had been; and hardly could he
escape condemnation. At length being quit, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93484:11"/>
his Office being prorogued and suspended, he
was advised to imitate others, who were his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors;
and to wink at the thefts and leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demains
of his Colleagues. So by and by he got
the name and report of a good man, by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and judgment of all.</p>
            <p>8. Such courses are still taken in the Courts
of most Princes, either from the malice of
such, as are in chief authority, (and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
honest men with disdain) or else by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
and stupidity, of the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>9. Therefore to retain honesty in Court, is
very difficult. Yet, if any one, by the exigency
and necessity of his own fortune, or by the
splendour and greatnesse of his birth and lineage,
or dignity of Office, or by an impulsive desire
to serve his Country and friends, or being
called thither by the Prince, shall undergo this
kind of life, he may persist therein, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
although a good man; at least, may live
there a while; and as opportunity serves, and
occasion offers it self, not onely be serviceable to
himself, but others also.</p>
            <p>10. I speak of the Courts of most harsh and
cruell Princes; for to live in the Court of a wise
Prince, and one who loves honest men, is far less
difficult.</p>
            <p>11. Honest men heretofore, undertook pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
functions and employments, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of desire to advance the publick, but
sometimes also, that they might anticipate and
prevent the entrance of evill men into such em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.
For the same causes may they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93484:12"/>
also, and ought to seek accesse to Tyrants, and
Princes given to volupty; that so, if not with
open face, yet obliquely, and as much as in them
lies, they may either impede and hinder pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
counsells, by delaying things evilly consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
objecting some difficulties to them; or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in some more mild and plausible.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Burrhus</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> (considering those
times) were accounted not onely good men,
but good Courtiers, who being governours of
<hi>Nero</hi> in his youthfull time, observed the ingenie
and disposition of the Prince to be leight and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and proclive to lust; lest he should break
forth, to the debauching of any of the most il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
women, granted him to love and court
a free woman, whereby in time he restrained his
fury, having taken for a cloak of such doings, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca
Annaeus Serenus,</hi> who pretending love to
her, openly bestowed those largesses, (the words
are <hi>Tacitus</hi> his own, in the 13th. book of his
Annalls) which the Prince secretly conferred on
her. Thus a good man, not knowing how to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
luxury, licentiousnesse, and perverse coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells,
may at least divert them, and bend them to
such a course, as from whence lesse hazard may
ensue, both to the publick, and the Princes same
and renown.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>The rarity and condition of honest men in the Courts
of Tyrants and dissolute Princes. The seminary of
evill men, and the Art of approving themselves to
the Prince.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>PErhaps some will say, It seldome chanceth that
a Tyrant or dissolute Prince takes to him an
honest man. Nor can I deny that it is very rare,
but this also I affirme, that there are few Princes
houses in which some good man (at least) may not
be found drawn thither if not by a call from the
Prince, yet by a desire of accommodating the good,
and infringing the power of evill ones, and may
keep his Station there by the aide and benevolence
of the better sort, or the friendship of some great
or noble One: observing first and keeping that
wholesome temperament of <hi>Lepidus</hi> whom <hi>Tacitus</hi>
in the fourth of his <hi>Annals</hi> propounds as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of a good and wise Courtier, who neither
by abrupt contuma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y hath irritated and provoked
the Prince, nor by a deformed obsequiousnesse
consented to all his lust.</p>
            <p>2. The same <hi>Tacitus</hi> commendeth <hi>Labeo</hi> and
<hi>Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>o;</hi> of whom speaking. That age, saith he, bare two
Ornaments of peace at once: but <hi>Labeo</hi> being more
famous for his incorrupt freedome and liberty; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pito</hi>
for his readiness to serve those in Authority,
were much approved, <hi>Annals</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>3. It cannot be denied, but that a Courtiers life
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93484:13"/>
to an honest man is more beset with difficulties
then to another man. But this labour wilbe made
good by the greatnesse of the glory and pleasure of
mind which he shall have. Moreover, if he act
wisely, and accommodate himself to such things
as hee sees cannot be changed, I dare be bold to
say that he shalbe at length endeared even to the
worst of Princes, more deere certainly then others
in after times who seldome with due faithfulnesse
transact the business of their Prince, at least not so
exactly, but that every man may lawfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
himselfe better service from a good man.</p>
            <p>4. To this purpose was the Counsell of <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius</hi>
and <hi>Mecoenas</hi> whereby the one to <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
the other to <hi>Augustus,</hi> commended the love
and friendship of good men because their owne
regard of estimation, and religious Conscience,
is more prevalent with them to deterr them from
dishonest things, then fear of punishment can do
others; or their owne imbecillity, or want of
strength, can restraine.</p>
            <p>5. But, as is said, the growth and sproutings up
of evill men is more plentifull in Courts, who
chiefly do approve themselves to the Prince by
two causes; first by Adulation and doing any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit
the Prince commandeth, and so much the
more servile is he by how much the hope of profit
allureth: moreover there is this, wherein Princes
much please themselves, that they may have some
in comparison of whom they (although evill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
may seeme to be good. Others also sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their life more secure amongst such as are
like themselves.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant being required to expell
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93484:13"/>
from Court a certaine fellow, who by his obsceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
had incurred the odium of all men, answered
that he must retaine him in the Court, lest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
should seem to be the worst there.</p>
            <p>7. They who know themselves obnoxious to
some vices have this way with them, that they
cloake themselves with a shew of honesty, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
themselves with those who are worse. And
it is the old Artifice of such as Rule, to choose an
unlike and unequall successor, that so their own
doings may appear better &amp; more illustrious. Nor
was <hi>Augustus</hi> other wise minded while he called
<hi>Tiberius</hi> to his assistance seeing his Arrogancy and
Cruelty, nor <hi>Tiberius</hi> when he delivered the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to <hi>Caligula:</hi> of which, <hi>Tacitus</hi> is the Author.</p>
            <p>8. But first it is very necessary that an honest
man be sober and sparing in speech: for Princes
do seldome give freedome to such, nor was it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull
to <hi>Plato</hi> the liberty which he usurped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Dionysius Syracusa:</hi> for therefore was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to a certaine Marriner, and sold into the
Isle of <hi>Creta,</hi> from whence being redeemed by
certaine Philosophers, he was admonished either
to abstaine from the Courts of Princes, or to speak
pleasing things unto them.</p>
            <p>9. With like counsell <hi>Aristotle</hi> instructed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listhenes</hi>
his kinsman, whom he was fitting and
preparing to accompany <hi>Alexander</hi> that he should
speake but seldome and pleasant things to him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whose word his life depended.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>How, when, and with whom, a man may use Flattery.
The condition of true, and free Adulation. The
necessity of Assentation and flattering.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. IT cannot otherwise be but Flattery must be
used with such dispositioned Princes as have
been spoken of, that so a man may oblige them. But
this is not to be done after any manner of way; for,
a too sordid and servile Adulation and flattery
displeased even <hi>Tiberius;</hi> who was heard when he
went out of the Court to speake in Greek to this
effect (O men fitted for servitude). They are the
words of <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the 3 of his <hi>Annals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Flattery usurped and too often used becomes
as hurtfull as when omitted and neglected. For it
many times happens that he whom we manifestly
flatter, suspects us of deceit and craftiness towards
himselfe. It is the judgment of <hi>Aesohines</hi> and
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> that flattery ought to have something of
truth, and of the species and shaddow of liberty and
freedome; that so we may perswade not onely the
Prince, but others, that we speake cordially, and
thereby conserve our Credit and Esteeme with
them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Croesus</hi> in the time of his reigne had through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learned the Ingenies, and inclinations of kings,
and what would please, or displease them: for
when on a time <hi>Cambyses</hi> king of the Persians had
enquired of those that stood about him, what
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93484:14"/>
they judged of him in Comparison of his father
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> and all had consented that he was greater
then <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because he had added <hi>Egyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> with the
Command of the Sea to his paternall kingdome:
but when <hi>Croesus</hi> his turne came to speake, he
adjudged him inferiour farre to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> because as
then he had begotten none like to himselfe. This
answer seemed to savour somewhat of freedome,
and was therefore the more satisfactory to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses</hi>
his vanity then the rest.</p>
            <p>4. Notable was the flattery of <hi>Valerius Messala</hi>
reported by <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the first of his <hi>Annals,
Messala Vale ius,</hi> saith he, added this that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Oath was yeerly to be renewed in <hi>Tiberius</hi>
his name. And being asked of <hi>Tiberius</hi> whether
or no he had uttered this Sentence of his own head
answered that he spoke ir spontaneously and that
in those things which concerned the publique, he
could use no other Counsell then his owne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hazzard of offence, and so there remained
nought but the species or shew of flattery.</p>
            <p>5. Like to this is that which the same <hi>Tacitus</hi>
reports of <hi>Ateius Capito</hi> in the third of his <hi>Annals.</hi>
That <hi>Lucius Ennius</hi> a Roman Knight being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Treason in that he had coyned into money
a Promiscuous Effigies of the Prince, <hi>Caesar</hi>
quashes and countermands the accusation, <hi>Ateius
Capito</hi> openly slights the business out of a kind of
freedome (for neither ought the power of judging
and determining be taken away from States-men
and Counsellors neither ought such an evill Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to passe unpunished) was not much troubled
thereat, lest he should thereby permit an injury
to be done to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:93484:15"/>
6. It were easie to bring other examples of this
kind; but those that have been produced, may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to instruct such, on whom a necessity of
Adulation and Flattery is imposed. And lest such
mens flattery should be conjoyned with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
or private discommodity, it's sufficient
that it be sometimes satisfie the vanity of the
Prince.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>How, and after what sort, the Counsels of Princes are
to be handled and ordered by a Courtier.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>LEt a Courtier likewise beware that he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
not with the Counsels of his Prince
although called thereto, and so cannot honestly,
avoid it. For such Princes do for the most part
aske Counsell with the same mind that <hi>Xerres</hi>
did, when he went about the Warre of <hi>Greece.</hi>
He convocated the Princes of <hi>Asia</hi> as if he would
deliberate with them about the businesse of the
Warre. I have call'd you (saith he) my Nobles
to Counsell, lest I should seem to act after my
own list without your advice; But yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that your obedience to us in these things is
rather required from you, than a carefull and
doubtfull deliberation. <hi>Cambyses,</hi> the Predecessor
of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> desiring to marry his Sister, inquired
of his Counsellors whether any Law of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
did forbid such a Marriage. They observing
that the King inquired, not so much about this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93484:15"/>
out of a desire to have the question absolved and
his doubt cleered, but that he might have a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
discovery of their minds, answered that no
Law indeed allowed what the King required, but
that there was a kind of law which avouched that
Kings might do what them liked. So that a man
may judge, whether credit or obedience be to be
given to him when he asketh our advice, even
from the inclination and disposition of the
Prince, and the nature of the businesse.</p>
            <p>2. You have already had Examples of Kings
I will give you another of a man who although
he bore not the name and title of a King, yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the office of one formerly in Spain. Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando
being dead, the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Maximilian</hi> exhort <hi>Charles</hi> De <hi>Austria,</hi>
(then Agent in <hi>Flanders)</hi> to take upon him the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of King of <hi>Spain,</hi> although his Mother <hi>Joan</hi>
the Daughter of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> was alive, and by
reason of sicknesse unfit for government. The
Nobles are convened in <hi>Parliament,</hi> before whom
Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> eloquently setteth forth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to excuse the Novelty of the businesse. The
Nobles being more observant of an ancient Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
and of the Queen, then was meet obstinately
vote against the King who soon after was to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
<hi>Ximenes</hi> leaping from his seat, and being
moved, shews that the businesse in agitation, was
not to be doubted on, nor needed their counsels
or advice, and that Kings in their entrance to
a Kingdom are not to expect the Consent of
Subjects. That they which were convened were
not called thither by necessity, but that they
might have occasion by the promptitude, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93484:16"/>
of their suffrages, to ingratiate themselves
with the Prince; and that they might seem to
act out of duty, what was to be done out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
Not expecting therefore their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he affirmed that <hi>Charls</hi> would proclaime
himself King at <hi>Madrid,</hi> whose example other
Citties afterwards followed.</p>
            <p>3. Such reason of their Actions do Princes
use, not only in like, but in most Cases. Scarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing is advised for other end then this only,
that their designes may receive approbation by
the many suffrages, and votes they have for them;
or else to take an inspection of the mind and bent
of such as they advise with. Such was the fetch
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> witnesseth.</p>
            <p>4. A Courtier therefore must carefully search
out the mind of the Prince, lest he accidentally
perswade to any thing that may prove offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.</p>
            <p>5. The Princes will, being dubious, let him
feigne somewhat to shake off the businesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and (having brought arguments on both
sides) let him leave the free election and
choice to the Prince; if he conceive not
throughly the businesse, hearing the reasons
on the contrary, if he be wise, let him alter his
opinion.</p>
            <p>6. Nor shall that shame and blushing (for
truly it is a shamefull although familiar evill
with great ones, that they blush to be inferior
to such whose advice they follow) disorder the
Prince, when you remit the liberty of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own prudence. And you shall also
avoid the Perill which is imminent to Counsellors
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93484:16"/>
when the things they advise the Prince to, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to their expectation.</p>
            <p>7. If following his first designes the Prince shall
not obtain successe, he will at least acknowledge
the Courtiers prudence, who foresaw a future
evill while it was yet evitable and to be eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>8. If you be urged to give your opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a thing altogether unlawfull, you ought
to find out some pretext of delay, or to intreat
that a third man be called, for the more diligent
examining thereof; whereby the thing being more
maturely waighed, it may appeare whether
any thing in it concerne the Princes dignity or
safety.</p>
            <p>9. By the former way <hi>Burrhus</hi> inhibited <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rses</hi>
first attempt to kill his mother, himself pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to execute her if she were found guilty of
the offence, and that that should make her defence
no not her parents. In the interim while the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
are preparing to be published, <hi>Neroes</hi>
rage is abated, fears are asswages, and the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and thought of the fact, although not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
abandoned and cast out of his mind, yet
was deferred till another time.</p>
            <p>But this way doth not often nor in all busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
take place, but chiefly in ambiguous and
doubtfull matters; yet before one under take such
a businesse, a man ought to look into the ingeny
and disposition of the Prince and whether he can
bear such protractions and delayings or not; for
there are some so impatient of loyterings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes,
that whoever useth them, shall certainly
incurre their displeasure.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HE that hath to do with such kind of Princes,
ought to be skilful and expeditious in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
subitanious and haste-requiring Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>2. Sith that (as it oftentimes happens) we
may be put to it, not to advise, but to find out a
way to execute designes, if these seem to oppose
both Reason and honesty, wayes are to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as remote and at as much distance as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
&amp; such as may be wound about with the shew
of Facility, or Equity, or Security: moreover it
must be offered to consideration, that suddain
undertakings are discriminous, and full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
            <p>3. Unlesse the Prince be hasty and impatient,
I doubt not but he will follow that which he
shall judge to be most facile and safe. But if
(through impatience) he will not hear such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
as tend to protraction, or stay; neverthelesse,
such a kind of anxiety of prudence, or affection
towards the Prince may excuse him that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades;
who had rather things were done
slowly with security then prematurely and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
with destruction to their Master.</p>
            <p>4. But if in such precipitate Course as the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93484:17"/>
Prince shall choose, some difficulties shall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
much more then will he perceive the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and discretion of him, that perswaded the
contrary course. If he shall give ear to those, who
propound slower waies; such interstice or pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
time, will administer many things, which
may restrain the will and cupidity of the Prince;
and himself may observe, that what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
could not have been done, or, at least,
not without absurdity.</p>
            <p>5. But oftentimes, that which the Prince
propounds to himself, is brought to that passe,
that even in its first rise, it may be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very difficult; but in its progresse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lainly
unatchievable, and not to be accomplished. You
may not at all animate the Prince, to undertake
such things; rather with venerable silence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that he observe his own mind, lest while you
disswade, and difficulties arise, he seek an easier
way to fulfill his desire, which otherwise (spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his force amongst those obstacles) would
of its own accord vanish, and be asswaged.</p>
            <p>6. Sometimes it so falls out, that the Prince
demands the execution of some wicked things,
from a good man; in which case, I suppose, no
man can be so well fortified with restraining
reason, but that he may be sometimes tainted
with such defilements, especially if opportunity,
and the reason of the thing, take away all place
for excuse, or substituting another to the office
and administration. This course therefore was
made us: of by <hi>Burrhus,</hi> when <hi>Nero</hi> consulted
the killing of his mother, where no other effect
followed his dissembled silence, and the strait
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93484:18"/>
wherein he was, then; that a woman (though
otherwise alwaies weak and impotent) should,
after an injury, be more sharpened and imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
            <p>7. For <hi>Burrhus</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> being sent for,
stuck for some time both doubtfull and fearfull:
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> in the 14th. of his Annals, saith, They
were both a long time silent, lest being provoked,
and put to it, they should disswade him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Seneca</hi> (till this time more prompt and
ready) looks upon <hi>Burrhus,</hi> as if the question
should be put, whether or no the murther
should be committed, and put in execution by
the Souldiery. <hi>Burrhus</hi> answers, That the <hi>Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
were obliged to the House of the <hi>Caesars,</hi>
and (being mindfull of <hi>Germanicus)</hi> durst not
act any bloody thing against his progeny. Let
<hi>Anicetus</hi> fulfill his engagement. Thus <hi>Burrhus</hi>
freed both himself and his Souldiers, from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
a very great villany.</p>
            <p>8. I confesse, thou canst not merit at the hands
of such a one, whom thou employest and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglest
in such commissions. But as the case
stands, I think it more conducible, and of greater
avail, that such as are like <hi>Anicetus,</hi> should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
execute such things, then thou.</p>
            <p>9. Most safe it is, to foresee in ones mind and
thought, the desires of a Prince; and before they
break out, or take too deep root, to grub them
up, or prune them.</p>
            <p>10. There are very many, who have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
the great force and strength, of kind and
flattering entreaties, and (as <hi>Parysatio</hi> called
them) those silken words, which some use about
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93484:18"/>
such businesses as these. But such as desire to
use this kind of remedy, need be in great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with the Prince, and to have audience from
him, as one speaking (which is very rare) not
more from affection, then from reason. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
in some one or other, this course may
succeed, but not in all things nor cases.</p>
            <p>11. Their way seems best to me, who by their
genius, being facetious, and apt for witty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
and upon that account, in favour with the
Prince, may represent to him the danger and
turpitude, of such counsells, as the Prince is
feared to encline to, by some opposite and pithy
Narrative of Comedy, and such as may seem
to aime at something else.</p>
            <p>12. To this, as we have shewed, a great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
and readinesse of wit, and pleasantnesse
of speech, is very requisite: And also he must
take heed, lest the Prince smell out and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that himself is the argument of such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall
discourses, or comicall representations
and shews: As <hi>Tiberius,</hi> of his fratricide, and
killing of his brother, in a Tragedy, composed
by <hi>Scau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pbraided. To this it is also necessary, that this
narration be fitly and trimly interwoven with
other things, lesse squaring and agreeing with
the Prince; and that which principally furthers
the businesse, is, that it ought not to be incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and repeated seriously; and yet, lest it
should slip by his ear, it may be iterated by a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93484:19"/>
casuall repetition. The pleasant conceitednesse
of the Narrative, makes a deeper impression of
those things which are spoken, and because they
appear spoken, as not studied-for, but <hi>ex tempore,</hi>
and according to a present occasion and subject,
they will not offend the disdainfull ears of the
Prince.</p>
            <p>13. Other waies there are of this Moderation,
whereby you neither foment and bring aid to
the Prince's lusts, nor in vain wrestle with them,
are fetcht from Occasion, and the very nick and
junctures of times; and from Accidents, such
as even the approach and suddain comming in of
one of the Prince's Pages or Lacquies, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to you.</p>
            <p>14. If the case wholly require, that you must
oppugne some one of the Prince's affections, then
ought you to assail and set upon another affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
equally valid and prevalent in him, and so
cause a kind of reluctancy and wrastling in the
Prince's mind. And first demonstrate, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
shew, that whatever we speak, proceeds
from that veneration and duty, which we owe
unto him. By this means, <hi>Mutianus</hi> held <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
to his businesse, and kept him from acting
that to <hi>Cerialio,</hi> which (prompted by what hope,
I know not) he endeavoured to have effected.</p>

               <p>Princes have a four-fold Temperature, from their
originall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n in Nature: How a man may converse
with each of them. The Art of Courtiers, in asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
others to them.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat these things may more prosperously be
prosecuted and effected, it greatly condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to know the Princes temperature, which
they for the most part have in common with
others, this onely excepted, That whereas in
other matters they are more powerfull, so are
they more impotent and weak, in moderating
their affections and inclinations; and these, for
the most part, are more violent in them, then in
others.</p>
            <p>2. He in whom yellow Melancholy, (which
in Greek is called Choller) is prevalent, will be
prompt and ready for action, proud, subject to
anger, a lover of humble and obsequious duties
and services, heavily offended with such as are
refractory, impatient in executing, precipitate
and hasty in Counsells, a contemner of other
mens judgments, if they discord with his own;
cruell to such as injure him, but placable to
such as are hurt, if they remember not again the
injuries; hating such as are mindfull of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
a speedy and preventing revenger of such,
whom he fears or doubts.</p>
            <p>3. He who shall be a manuall servant to such
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93484:20"/>
a one, had need to have his eyes and Eares open,
that he may readily understand and execute at the
beck of his Command not objecting, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting,
least by his contradictions he move the
opinion and Imagination of the Prince to Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,
and seeme to him to think him selfe more
wise then hee. Let him not be shie to submit to
the meanest office, even to that which may seem
below his owne fortune, let him bear injuries
and not long remember them, and after an affront
or rubb, be the more officious. Let him not shew
or tell to any what admonitions and advisements
he gives him, least he seem to upbraid him; hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and covering over one office with another as
one sayes, lest the raine beat thorough. When the
Prince is angry, let him not come neere him, for
then all things will offend him, and even such as
are most deere to him, neither by word nor deed,
can then curry favour with him: Familiarity with
such a <hi>Genius</hi> is easily turned into Contempt,
(which therefore is to be avoyded) although the
Prince himselfe incline towards it. Let all things
therefore be composed rather to Reverence and
Modesty: for such are Lyons, sometimes kind, but
in the end cruell and fierce to such, who are most
known to them, even to their keepers.</p>
            <p>4. Such as are of a sanguine complexion are
mostly of a merry <hi>Genius,</hi> lovers of pleasures and
witty conceits, avoyding the sad intricacyes, and
contests in business, desirous of peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
committing the administration of affairs
to others, and bearing nothing more temperately
then complaints, Courteous and full of humanity,
pleasant and amiable abstaining from injuries espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93484:20"/>
great ones, not more mindfull of things
received then of things done, very desireous to
please and accommodate others, and for the most
part frank and bountifull.</p>
            <p>5. They who are employed under such, may not
in any wise neglect the duty of veneration, and
must handle serious matters very sparingly. They
who transact the weighty and difficult business of
the Common-weale, ought not to approach his
presence before they be called in, or be assured
that he be not at his vacant disports and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
otherwise they interrupt his chiefe delights,
and cause him to blush by their sudden approach,
and being taken at unawares feare a secret and
tacite check or taunt from them. While <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>Macedon</hi> was sporting, and in his <hi>pasta Tiempo</hi> one
comes and tells him that <hi>Antipater</hi> was at the
dore, whereupon he being disturbed, and not
knowing how to obscure himselfe hid the dice in
the bed, blushing to be seene by <hi>Antipater,</hi> when
he was at his pastimes. Wherefore, as they who
have the principall care of the Empire by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
command, are supereminent to others in seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
businesses; even so are they themselves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stript
by others in their free and familiar accesse to
the Prince, who avoydes and shunnes the more
serious and grave, as discording with his owne
<hi>Genius</hi> and naturall disposition.</p>
            <p>6. They who have <hi>Jove</hi> for their propitious
starr, and are capable both of serious matters, and
of gameing and pastimes, are for the most part
very acceptable to such Princes; so that they be
cautious, that while they are absent from the
Prince, their too much facility and courtlinesse
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93484:21"/>
diminish not their Authority with others. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this observation (as the vulgar Proverb hath
it) <hi>Familiaritas contemptum pariet</hi> Familiarity will
breed contempt, Contempt will give Audacity
and boldnesse to make complaints, as if you did
them a kind of wrong and injury, which the Prince
going about to take away as being an Enemy to
mournfull and sad things, will endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
him whom he shall find most manifestly
culpable.</p>
            <p>7. The Prince who is of Melancholy complexion
and disposition is slow in Counsells, pensive
museing, diffident, suspicious, witty, and for the
most part malizing, disposed to silence, uttering
ambiguityes, and rather serving and traceing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens senses and opinions, then discovering
his owne; a dissembler, an enemy to merry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
and familiarity, loving solitude, difficult of
accesse, a friend to few and but a cold one, easily
hateing, by reason of diffidence and distrust (which
never leaves him) avaricious, and absurdly timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
equally hating offences and offenders; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably
desirous of Revenge, and whom (though
reconciled) you had need to feare.</p>
            <p>8. With these kinds of dispositions a man must
deale circumspectly and warily, &amp; first he ought to
be moderate in his speech, and as it were to advise
upon every word, lest he speak any thing imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
or offensive, and speak not unless compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In veneration and reverence let him be more
then ordinary, abstaining from contradictions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murring
in counsells unless urged to speak, lest
his black Melancholly being incensed turne into
Choller, and that into hatred; chiefly, where you
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93484:21"/>
think the repulse will be facile and easie. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing
be not unreasonable, for to be sent away
empty from a Prince is oftimes dangerous, and a
Melancholick and sad person is alwayes excessive
and superfluous, and will deny that he thought
he had offended him whom he so dismissed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
him an enemy; this feare will hardly be
bought out by any Artifice whatsoever. Such
will remember injuries a long time, and do mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
other men by their owne Genius and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</p>
            <p>9. In briefe, This constitution is the sharpest of
all, difficult, and most uneven and disordred by
reason of the variety of things which the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
representeth and offereth to it. By which
their life is made the more laborious who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to such mens service.</p>
            <p>10. The Phlegmatick participateth of the
weight and slownesse of the Melancholick; but, as
it is unlike in nature and inclination, so is it in
malignity and diffidence. He hath his heart as it
were environed with Cold, and from hence it is
that he distrusts rather himselfe, then others, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to undertake great matters because he des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires
of the successe, or is ignorant of the way
and meanes how to carry them on. He is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in consults, fearefull in executing, of a stupid
Genius, not sharp and harsh in hating, nor vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and eager in loving.</p>
            <p>11. For such, an active Minister, and one
prompt, and ready in mind and hand, is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the Prince when he shall find one fit
to execute and accomplish what he accoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
desperate, perceiving the imbecillity of his owne
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93484:22"/>
Genius: and he will love and admire such a one,
and imbrace him as a necessary Creature, and such
favour which is bound with an opinion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
is for the most part durable, which such a
man observing may so act, that he may effect
those things which the Prince looks upon as hard
and impossible, and bring them to a prosperous
issue, and this shall he do (if possibly) himself; at
least, let him not have an associate more prompt
then himself, and also beware he be not long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from Court, lest the chief of businesses be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the Prince. For if any be found fitter
for such imployment; you shall be lesse valued,
or at least, lesse needfull; and so being once or
twice passed over, and not imployed in such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
be at last neglected and not accounted
of.</p>
            <p>12. It is the old art of Courtiers not to choose
associates, but such as they themselves doe very
much excell in vertue and prudence, that the
darknesse of others may be a foil to their splendor,
and the Prince may not easily find one whom he
may oppose and set against them, or prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. Adde that these lesser ones, as oft as
there is need, will easily be open to and ready to
serve those to whom they either did, or may
owe their fortune, although by base and corrupt
wayes and arts. This cannot justly be expected
from an equall, or from him who strives in his
own strength.</p>
            <p>13. These are the kinds of humane Inclinations
to which Princes are no lesse obnoxious then
Peasants; being propense and readily bent, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to to this, sometimes to that course, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to be accounted. Age, Businesse, and Custome
do vary and change the temper of the body, why
not then the Inclinations and Actions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</p>
            <p>2. In time of Warre, Princes will imbrace mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
and fighting men, whose favour (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
by degrees when things are pacified) will
easily wear out and wax old. If the Prince incline
to pleasures or any other affection, he will also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to love such as are ministers and furtherers
to him therein.</p>
            <p>3. See what <hi>Tacitus</hi> testifies of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> The
times wherein he was had divers changes of
customes and manners; he was notable in his
life and reputation when a private man, or in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
under <hi>Augustus;</hi> close and crafty, in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
vertue, whilest <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were alive; mixt of good and bad, while his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93484:23"/>
was healthfull; of intestable and incredible
cruelty, but covertly lustfull whilst he loved or
feared <hi>Sejanus.</hi> At last he broke forth into lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and dishonorable actions, after that he
(having set aside shame and fear) followed his
own Inclination. Acute and tart was the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which <hi>Passienus</hi> passed upon <hi>Caligula:</hi> That
there was never a better Servant, nor ever a worse
Master.</p>
            <p>4. 'Tis incredible to be spoken with what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
manners, <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> acted: And
<hi>Plutarch</hi> makes a doubt whether Fortune chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Inclinations, or only unvailed and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
those mischievous dispositions which had

            <p>5. To speak rightly, The disposition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny
of such is not altered, but that which lay
hid through feare (that being removed) breaks
forth: as <hi>Leontius</hi> said of <hi>Zeno</hi> he was like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
which being frozen with cold cannot hurt,
but being thawed and refreshed by the heat of

            <p>
               <hi>Tripho,</hi> as <hi>Josephus</hi> witnesseth, while a private

            <p>8. For the most and chief defects of Princes
take their rise and originall from Arrogancy, the
most individuall and unseparable hand-man and
attendant of great Ones. This ushers in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of other mens Counsells, with such
who are perswaded, That by how much they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
others in power, by so much they exceed
them in prudence: and some are so transported
that they disdain and think it below them, to be
under the bonds of either law or reason, and that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93484:24"/>
they cannot be Princes unlesse they may do what
they list according to that saying.</p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>Sanctity Piety and faith, are good to private

they please.</p>
            <p>9. I should lesse wonder if vulgar Ingenies were
only corrupted with such opinions, but I see
that the best of mortalls have their minds blinded
with these delusions and cheats of power and
Puissance.</p>
            <p>10. No man heretofore surpassed the seaven
wise men of <hi>Greece</hi> in the precepts of moderation:
and none that ever came to the Empire were
more cruell Tyrants then those who came from
among them.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Appianus</hi> being about to speak of <hi>Aristo</hi>
the Philosopher rehearseth some; who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
that name formerly, had exercised Tyranny
at <hi>Athens:</hi> he addeth moreover that some of the
<hi>Pythagoriaens</hi> (whom he names) who had gotten
imployment in <hi>Italy</hi> had very unjustly abused
their command, which makes us doubt whether
those Philosophers who so proudly contemned
honour and dignities, did it <hi>bonâ fide</hi>
and in good earnest; or rather took it up as
a pretext, and a cloake for their beggerlinesse and
sloath.</p>
            <p>12. Certes, if we may credit <hi>Aristophanes,</hi>

such mens services, have degenerated. Such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors
curry favour with the Prince, while they
ostentate and boast before him his greatnesse,
power, and utility; who doth so much the more
willingly embrace them; by how much the lesse
he knowes and understands the parts of his own
office and charge, not perceiving, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
him, that so they may betray him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him to odium and contempt.</p>
            <p>4. And truly, the most secure way of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Prince, is the being obsequious and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him in his avarice, cruelty, and lust; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

and ready to fall to him, see how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
arts he useth: He had made his observation,
how that the City began to disdain <hi>Tiberius,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that <hi>Agrippina</hi> with her children, were at his
motion imprisoned. And seeing him inclinable
to a cessation from businesse, neglects not to
perswade him thereunto; hoping, that during
his absence, the stresse of the Empire, and rule
of businesse, would be left to him; which so fell
out. And in truth, <hi>Tiberius</hi> for some little time,
was Lord of a little Island, and <hi>Sejanus</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

                  </gap>iars of Princes, and how
to obtain their friendship.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving considered what a waiting Courtier
is to do, in respect of the Prince, let us come
now to what he is to do, in respect of, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those, who are his domestick servants,
whose Office is continually, to be employed
about the Prince's person, and therefore very
usefull for such, as seek addresses to him, either
by procuring them an extraordinary accesse, or
by mentioning them to him, or informing them
of occasions and opportunities, to dispatch their
businesse. Princes for the most part, carry one
kind of countenance in private, and another in
publick; and do more freely disclose their minds
to those their domesticks, whom they believe to
be faithfull and trusty, supposing that their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and low condition, is not capable of any
endeavour, either traiterous or mischievous.</p>
            <p>2. Who knowes not, that <hi>Claudius</hi> was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the commands of such, who had been
bondmen? One whereof <hi>(Pallas</hi> by name) he had
so enriched, that himself on a time, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to one of his wants, had this reply, That
if he made sure to be adopted by <hi>Pallas,</hi> he
should forthwith be rich. The same was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
that <hi>Claudius</hi> married <hi>Agrippina,</hi> after that,
by the help of <hi>Narcissus</hi> (formerly also a bondman)
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93484:26"/>
he had slain his wife <hi>Messalina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Who knowes not also, that while the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> stood, the power thereof,
was sometimes upheld by Eunuchs; and but for
them, <hi>Arbetius</hi> the chief Commissioner of the
Empire, had lost his life, when <hi>Verissimus</hi> accused
him.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lus</hi> and <hi>Germanus,</hi> two kitchen-slaves,
by the authority whereby they held <hi>Botoniates,</hi>
one of the Emperours, altogether subject and
obnoxious, rendred him strange and absurd to
<hi>Isaacius,</hi> and <hi>Alexius Comnenus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Put case, the Prince doth not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his counsells to them, yet are they more
easily sifted out and accused by such. Nor can it
be, that a Prince can alwaies keep on his vizard
in private: Affections kept close and suppressed,
break forth amongst the multitude, and become
conspicuous to men, when privacy before hath
given them liberty.</p>
            <p>6. It is a thing altogether necessary in Court,
for a Prince to esteem men of all kinds, even
the vilest, usefull to him; and to believe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
that prudence and ingenuity encrease to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with authority and fortune; which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus,</hi>
writing to <hi>Epictetus,</hi> shewes, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and his two slaves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
although one was Groom of the Stool to the
Emperour, the other a wiper of shoes; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> who had lately sold them
as unusefull creatures, not onely insinuated into
their favours, but also commended their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and discretion.</p>
            <p>7. Fortune scarce ever advanced any man to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93484:27"/>
that height in Court, but that she procured
him as many foes, as friends; and never brought
any man so low, but that she could afterwards
either hurt him further, or again in some kind
or other do him good. Whereupon not in vain,
is the observation of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in the 6th. of his
Annalls, That while <hi>Tiberius</hi> was Emperour, it
was accounted a magnifick and stately thing, but
onely to be acquainted with, and known to, the
Porters of <hi>Sejanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. It will be then the part of a wise and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
man, to procure the friendship of the
Prince's Familiars, whatsoever they be, by any
such officious serviceablenesse, as reason and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
will permit.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>There are four kinds of great ones at Court. How
the first sort ought to be honoured, observed, and
entreated. How cautiously a man ought to confide
in Princes, who are not very constant.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FRom the Prince's familiars, let us come to
such as are great at Court, who are of divers
kinds: Some are eminent, by the splendour and
excellency of their birth and parentage, yet are
not in intimate favour with the Prince; others
very gratious with him, and yet not mounted
to honours; others prevalent with him, both by
honour and favour; others both flourish in his
favour, and are employed in negotiations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:93484:27"/>
2. The benevolence and good will of the first
sort of these, will little conduce to thy grouth
in preferment, who neverthelesse are to be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and reverenced, both for their own merits,
and also because, that though they may not hurt
you themselves, yet may they by their retainers
and friends.</p>
            <p>3. For men of illustrious and noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
are highly esteemed, and prevail much with
such, and with others, by being obliged by an
old kindnesse or good turn with others, by the
reverence and esteem of their greatnesse and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
(which easily changes the Princes mind)
do therefore favour them, and Retainers to their
service.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Archilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> had omitted
to salute and court <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he was Agent
at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to his great prejudice and mischief;
for <hi>Tiberius</hi> (having got the Empire) out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of revenge, pretending something more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
commands him to be called to <hi>Rome,</hi>
where the wretched man dyed an untimely death:
Yet the Historian testifieth, that he omitted not
that duty through pride, but being admonished
by some intimate friends of <hi>Augustus,</hi> because
that while <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us Caesar</hi> flourished, being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Orientall affairs, friendships and
correspondencies with <hi>Tiberius</hi> seemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe.</p>
            <p>5. We are here to consider, that great ones
of this sort of fortune, as they are oft-times im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
and weak in meriting, yet have strength
enough to hurt you: These therefore, although
they seem burdenous, and suspected to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93484:28"/>
Prince, are to be reverenced neverthelesse; and
we must make some pretext to restrain their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
lest they become our enemies.</p>
            <p>6. If it happen, that the Prince will put thee
into the hands of such, (which is usuall with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers)
as you may not refuse this kind of contest
or combat, so ought it to be managed with great
Art, and choice of Occasion and opportunity,
that all men may see that thou actest not only by
reason, but also givest satisfaction to the Prince.
Such an enterprise is full of hazzard, but (if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
as having the Prince for its author)
is the way to augmentation and encrease of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>7. One here acts all things, in his own name,
although he have many helpers, especially such
as are under the degree of Nobility; for fear, lest
if they should not do so, they might offend the
Prince.</p>
            <p>8. Another adheres more closely to the
Prince, by the encrease of his fame and renown,
if he be prudent, choosing specious occasions,
of doing laudable service to his Prince, and to the
emolument and advantage of the Publick.</p>
            <p>9. But a man must be very cautious, lest he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing, that thou canst not bring to pass;
for, besides that the vulgar judge all things by
the event, and believes, that Right and Justice
stands in the same station with Fortune, you
will wonderfully weaken your fame and favour,
wherewith the Prince embraced you, by sinister
successe: For he, to abolish the ignominy, and
because he fears, lest he should be debased in the
eyes of his Subjects, and animate his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93484:28"/>
whom he in vain opposed, will be constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to disguise and hide this authority, and the
esteem he had of you.</p>
            <p>10. Yet take heed that you believ not, that while
I speak of contesting with Nobles &amp; great ones, I
would have you act any thing, or deal with them
by force, since that cannot be done without tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
and noise; nor that you set upon him with
contumelies, and calumniations, for that's the
part of men of mean fortunes, and base corrupt
judgments, and their end is seldom honourable or
auspicious. See how it fared with <hi>Piso,</hi> whom <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
had sent into <hi>Syria,</hi> to restrain the hopes of
<hi>Germanicus,</hi> who carried himself so insolently,
that the Prince, having advanced <hi>Germanicus,</hi>
was necessitated to leave <hi>Piso</hi> to publick odium
and hatred.</p>
            <p>11. When we perswade you to counterplot
the designes and endeavours of great ones, and
Nobles, we understand such who are unjust, and
undertake something, either against the state of
the Common-wealth, Religion, Justice, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Armies, or publick Treasure; whom
you must so meet with, and prevent, that it may
appear to all good men, whom it concerns, that
you are not acted therein by any private provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but by an honest care of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
onely.</p>
            <p>12. If you would have an example for your
imitation, I shall name Cardinall <hi>Ximenes,</hi> who
was chosen by <hi>Isabella</hi> Queen of <hi>Castile,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Nobility, who then were not so subject
to Kingly command, as at this day. From being a
<hi>Francisean</hi> Monk, he was made the Queen's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93484:29"/>
and afterwards, by the counsell of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Mendoza,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Toledo;</hi> and lastly
Inquisior of the faith; and acted with great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
amongst the Spaniards, and (being the chief
Commissioner in the raigne of <hi>Isabella,</hi> after that
in the Raigne of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and at last when the
Empire descended to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth) contested
so with the Nobles, that he held both Prince and
people ever devoted and addicted to him.</p>
            <p>13. It was reported that he died by Poyson, and
himselfe was suspected; but the thing could never
be proved, and therefore his death may be more
rightly imputed to aged nature (for he was very
old when he deceased). And nothing hindereth
but that he may be believed to have maintained,
and kept his owne fortune (which mostly he
ought to himselfe and his owne endeavours) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and flourishing even to the last moment.</p>
            <p>14. The same fortune attended not upon
<hi>Cicho Simoneta,</hi> who when <hi>Franciscus Sfortia</hi> and
after him <hi>Galeacius</hi> his sonne, possessed the City
of <hi>Millane</hi> in Lumbardy under the widow-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Galeacius</hi> (who was young and under age)
was set to oppose the brothers and heires, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his trust and prudence; and being beloved
for his mannagement of affaires.</p>
            <p>15. He, that he might preserve the Empire and
Command for his pupill, thrust out the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of <hi>Galeacius,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> de. <hi>Santo Severino</hi>
from the citty of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>llane.</hi> But imagine what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
he underwent, and also how lewdly he was
soon after destituted and forsaken: for the widow-Mother
returning into favour with her adversary
made <hi>Simoneta</hi> the price and reward of her amity
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93484:29"/>
and friendship with them; by whom being a long
time detained in prison, he perished miserably
tortured and quartered by them. Learne hence,
how cautelously one ought to trust pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces whom
you did not sufficiently know to be constant.
Such will prostitute their Ministers for a leight
matter, to the lust and will of their very enemies.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>A Second Third and Fourth kind of Nobles or Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
and the reason why each of them ought to be
esteemed and allured.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. THere are some Nobles (as we said before)
gracious indeed with the Prince, yet live
without the dignity of office and charge. These
if they contribute not to confirme and settle us,
yet may procure us so much favour with the
Prince, whereby it may be done.</p>
            <p>2. They are also usefull by commemorating our
merits, or, if need be, to excuse our failings; and
by protecting us against the Calumnies, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
accusations, and detractions of others; who
(if they be benevolent) may much advantage us;
if irritated and offended, may much hurt and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
us. Wherefore the favour of such is to be
purchased by any means, at least such as are not
unbefitting, or below our condition. You may
imagine that these are not so daily tied up to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Princes domestick customes and uses;
but that sometimes they look abroad to others.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93484:30"/>
And although they have not imployment or office
and charge, neverthelesse those whom they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
(if not otherwise unworthy, or ungratefull
to the Prince, or unfit to undergo imployments)
are seldome despised, sometimes preferred before
others, who (though not unequall in deserving)
are yet destitute of such friends and assistants.</p>
            <p>3. The third sort we have spoken of, are such
who being adorned with great Authority in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
are yet but meanly favoured by the Prince.
These are found especially with such Princes who
live peaceably, and mind their pleasures being
carelesse of publique affaires, and therefore
(committing the government to one or other who
are faithfull), become averse to hard and difficult
businesse, out of a feare of their importance and
weight.</p>
            <p>4. In such a juncture of affaires, you ought to
be more studious in seeking the favour of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of State, then of the chief Ruler; for he will
permit them whom he intrusteth with the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of government, to choose and delegate
others to offices: for it would seeme weaknesse in
him to choose any for officers, whom himselfe
knowes not to be fit for imployment.</p>
            <p>5. There are other Princes, who being more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
and stedfast to their government and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
themselves constitute Officers of State, yet
admit them not to their familiar Converse and
Acquaintance, nor to their presence, unlesse some
weighty business be in agitation, nor intrust them
with the dipensing, and bestowing of Offices, out
of mistrust and jealousie lest their power by the
multitude of Clients and Attendants, should am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93484:30"/>
and rise to such a heighth, as that from
thence, (if they should offend) they cannot be
taken downe and dejected. The old custome of
such Princes hath been to hold such Ministers
under some kind of awe, and to give them ground
to believe, that the pile and Bulwarke, which
they by their labour in so long time have been
building, may with one winck of his eyes be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished.</p>
            <p>6. 'Tis very hard to perceive how you should
carry your selfe towards such great Ones, whose
power is so circumscribed and limitted: their good
will may not much benefit you; perhaps (if the
Prince perceive it), it may prejudice you: And
being without it, you will more hardly come to
the mannaging of your business; and you will
sometimes be even inforced and necessitated, not
without hazzard, to concurre with them.</p>
            <p>7. Here will need very much circumspect
courtesie and mildness; you must treat them with
all the offices and duties of veneration, and civill
deportment: and upon occasion testifie (though
warily) your secret promptitude and readinesse
of mind. Meane while, neglect not to seek out
another Trumpeter or spokesman who may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and underprop thee, and so thou mayest be
more closely joyned with, and notified to, the
Prince.</p>
            <p>8. Such Nobles remaine to be spoken of, who
are prevalent both in respect of favour, with the
Prince, and also in regard of office: these (in brief)
are to be honored almost equally with the Prince.</p>
            <p>9. The inclinations and will of such, are to be
inspected and looked into, and ought to be known
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93484:31"/>
and executed, next after the Princes.</p>
            <p>10. After this manner therefore, the power
and authority of the great ones being (as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees)
subducted, you will not be ignorant what
may be hoped for, and expected from them, for
you must carefully beware, that you aske no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from any of them, which you or they see,
cannot be effected: for there is nothing that more
molesteth humane ingenuity, then not to be of
ability to satisfie the request of one, whom a man
loveth and affecteth.</p>
            <p>11. Therefore benevolence, being preoccupated
by uncivill supplication, or remedilesse diffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulty,
is offended. And know, that he from whom
you have suffered a Repulse, will shun to see you,
for feare, lest by the impudency of such a like
request, you put him to the blush, as if through
defect of Authority and power, he could not do
what you desire.</p>
            <p>12. But (this by the way may be added) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to the knowledge of great ones is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
open, it must be wrought by degrees. They
who can do very much with them, whether
Strangers, or Domesticks, and their dependants and
adherents, are to be allured, considering what
abilities each of them hath, wherewith to advance
and help others.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>Who those Courtiers are, which are under the degree
of Nobility, and what is to be done with them first:
what is to be done with enemies which hate us for
our friends sakes, because offended by them.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. THere are others in Court, who (being set
below the ranck of Nobles) are either our
superiors equalls or inferiours. And these are of
two sorts; some more apt and ready to benefit us,
others to prejudice us. The Authority and power
of both is diligently to be waighed and considered,
as that, which may either promote, or impede,
and hinder what we affect and sue for. Their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
and affinities also are to be pondered, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of times requiring that we act with them,
by their owne servants and followers rather then
by our selves, using their Counters to reckon our
Game by; at least, by them, deprecate and turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
envy from us.</p>
            <p>2. But first we must take heed, that we do not
then onely seek their friendship, when we just
need it; we ought to have it already prepared, and
knit fast by the pledges of ancient benevolence
and good will.</p>
            <p>3. There are three sorts of those who may hurt
and hinder us; for they are either such as are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or envious persons, or else Competitors and
Emulators.</p>
            <p>4. They who are enemies, hate us either for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93484:32"/>
our own sakes, or for some of our friends sakes
who have offended them; but this last odium and
hatred is for the most part lesse sharp then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and may be allayed, and mitigated, by some
good office, whereby we may witness that we
love our friends; but cannot forthwith hate all
their Enemies.</p>
            <p>5. But for the most part the friendships of
Courtiers are factious, and cruell; and they will
wish and advise you to abjure all familiarities
which themselves envy.</p>
            <p>6. For this cause, some openly preferring the
friendship of one party, have neverthelesse not
failed to imbrace the other party secretly: not
that so they might to betray their friend, but in
in case he should faile, provide a refuge for
him.</p>
            <p>7. Such prudence is not only happily and
successfully used in Court-contests, but also in
Empires. <hi>Syenneses</hi> being Vice-roy of <hi>Tarcis</hi> when
the warre began between <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>
fearing to oppugne and fight against <hi>Cyrus,</hi> imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his party, but sent his Son to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to
be a refuge to his father, in case <hi>Cyrus</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Bardas Durus,</hi> having escaped from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> seeing that <hi>Bardas
Phocas</hi> was created Emperour against <hi>Basilius</hi>
sought the amity of <hi>Phocas</hi> being as yet his enemy
but sent his Son (feigning that he fled away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his will) to follow <hi>Basilius,</hi> and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
for his father in case <hi>Phocas</hi> were conquered:
which also came to pass.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Solon</hi> when the Common-wealth discorded.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93484:32"/>
ordained that none should be permitted <hi>Adiaphory</hi>
or neutrality; nor do I think that 'twas his mind
that friends imbracing contrary parties should
not send and return a message to a private friend;
but rather that he hoped, that friends following
and pursuing divers ends, would then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
more greedily and happily for publique
peace.</p>
            <p>10. After the same manner in Courts, although
you be of a contrary faction, yet may you keep
friendship with one that is of another faction,
both to the end you may have a receptacle in a
changed fortune, and also that you may be the
fitter to reconcile minds inclining to milder
things. There is no safer nor honester means
and way to ingratiate your self with either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
party, amongst those discords,
and contentions that arise amongst great
Ones.</p>

            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>How we must deale with such who hate us for our
our owne cause, and are offended with us: where
also is intreated of Threats and Injuries.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THey who hate us for our selves, do it either
because they are offended with us; or else,
(as is very familiar with great Ones towards
their Inferiors and as the Italian Proverb hath it,
<hi>Qui offendit, non condonet,</hi> He that gives the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
let him not forgive) because they have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93484:33"/>
offended us. Minds swelling with great fortune
have this fault chiefly. Whom they hurt, they
hate.</p>
            <p>2. The best remedy for such Injuries, as these
do to us, is, If they be not understood and
known; but if its weightinesse shall give it a marke
of an offence to us understood, let us soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
a mitigation of grief for it, and that
the remembrance thereof is defaced and blotted
out of our minds. Else, if they perceive us to
bear it impatiently, we strike into them a fear of
our revengefulnesse, and so, a desire of preventing
us.</p>
            <p>3. But chiefly let us forbear threats, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if we be not presently prepared to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</p>
            <p>4. For threatnings rouze up the vigilancy of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
and do provoke them to hatred and to
double the Injury, and often brings us to shame,
if we breath out revenge, and have not power an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to our will.</p>
            <p>5. I know this moderation is not approved by
all men, chiefly, by such as are revengefull, who
are of opinion that no Injury is to be passed by
without sensibility, not onely in regard of the
sweetnesse which is in revenge, but also, because
that if you bear with an old Injury, you invite a
new; and therefore think fit to prosecute with
immortall hatred, those who offend them. But
such, while they desire to render themselves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable,
and dreadfull, produce this effect to
themselves, That no body will have Commerce
with them. Sithence therefore, all are mortalls are
prone to lapse and digresse and so either affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93484:33"/>
or through incogitancy and want of heed
are carried away, let every one for fear of giving
offence, shun those who are so tenacious and
ready to hate, even as wild and savage beasts, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them to their own solitude. Lastly, if he shall
also offend, he will yet expect all amicableness
from the other party, and while he feares revenge,
will desire to inforce and strike the first blow.
Wherefore to avoid so many evills, I think it
best to insist rather and pursue the contrary way,
and do prefer lenity and mildnesse, which is not
difficult, no not in the greatest Injuries; respect
being first had to the difference, both of the cause
by which; and to the condition and quality of
the persons, by whom the Injuries is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>6. For in lighter injuries, and such as have
their rise rather from Perturbation and trouble
of mind, then Malice, we ought to be so unoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as that we seem not to be at all sensible. If the
injury be heinous, let us shew our selves carefull
and tender of our reputation and esteem; yet not
be so implacable to the offending party, as not to
leave him hope of reconciliation, and place for
pardon in case of satisfaction. To which end,
I judge it not unfit to complaine of the wrong
to the friends of him who hath injuried us,
and to commit the cause to their Arbitrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>7. I am of opinion that those wrongs which are
insultingly done, through malepertness and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulancy,
and out of a humour to reproach, are
forthwith to be vindicated, yet not so much with
a desire of revenge, as to chastise the offender,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93484:34"/>
that so he may learn to demeane, and carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
more modestly, not towards us only, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others also.</p>
            <p>8. Yet such are not to be revenged on with
implacable hatred; rather ought we to testifie
our grief for the necessity of vindication which
is laid upon us. And (after Amends and Restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made) that we are ready according as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the trespass will admit to redintegrate
and renew our friendship and amity with
them.</p>

Artifices and devices for reconciliation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingratiating.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUt because, such abuses are commonly put
upon us by such as overpower us; The first
remedy to avoid these, is, not to deal with them
but with much reverence, and respect, taking heed
lest they disdain your familiarity with them, or
(if they be more rough and austere) altogether
decline to converse with them. Notable is that
that of Martial.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Si vitare velis acerba quaedam,</l>
               <l>Et tristis animi cavere morsus;</l>
               <l>Nulli te facias nimis sodalem,</l>
               <l>Gaudebis minùs, &amp; minùs dolebis.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:93484:34"/>
Englished thus.</p>
            <q>
               <l>If shun thou wilt most bitter things,</l>
               <l>From sad remorse secure thy mind.</l>
               <l>To none become too much a friend;</l>
               <l>Lesse joy, lesse grief thou then shalt find.</l>
            </q>
            <p>2. The second is not to prefer the sensibility of
an injury before ones own safety: for, it is neither
safe, nor is it a wise mans part, to strive too much
with one more powerfull then himself. Let the
disparity of abilities be a just pretext to excuse
thy disguised Dissimulation.</p>
            <p>3. I know that some perswade themselves that
an adverssary smitten with fear, will come and
crouch and begge pardon and reconciliation; nor
can it be denied but that some low and poore
spirited ones, will sometimes so farre debase
themselves, and stoop so low: but such a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement
and peace-making is but feigned, and
will never prove sincere. Nor do such omit,
(when occasion is given to renew injury) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
and dispense with their own minds; and by
how much the more timorous and fearfull they
find a man, by so much the more cruelly and
outragiously will they aspire and breath forth
vengeance. Therefore since an occult and close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
enemy, is more difficult to be avoided, then
an open and declared one, it is better (after some
sort) to have such open enemies, then friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
when enforced thereto by fear. I speak
of those, who being not greater then our selves,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93484:35"/>
of Amity be broke, they can doe us little
harme.</p>
            <p>4. For if we have to do with one greater then
our selves whose Emnity may eclipse our Lustre,
It were better to hold his affection redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated,
and renewed, though fictitious and feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
so, then to have him appear an open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>5. If we have been the first offenders, let
us be first in appeasing the party offended, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to themselves, or by mediation of
friends.</p>
            <p>6. Now that we may discern who are of most
ample ability to suppresse and hinder us, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
not only to consider their power, but their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
by which (besides their hatred) they are
carried to do us hurt.</p>
            <p>7. For some are acted by a desire of hatred, (the
Piedee and Laquey of revenge) others by fear, lest
having gotten and obtained what we prosecuted,
we should thereby bee better armed to prejudice
and offend them.</p>
            <p>8. That first and worst affection is violent, but
that of fear is more violent, for Court oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but that enemy, who, besides this, is stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
also by that other, is the most inevitable.</p>
            <p>9. The former may be mitigated, by humble
and satisfactory services; but the timorous will
scarce ever be perswaded, to change his fear into
a confidence, and assurance of your benevolence
towards him; yet this must be assayed by all
means, which occasion and opportunity will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give him to understand, then any instruction
or discipline.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:93484:35"/>
10. <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> that he might make them his
friends again, whom he had offended, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
them to the most honourable places and
offices; in the administration whereof, when
they had incurred envy, (as is commonly seen)
the accused are constrained to fly to the Prince,
who delivering them from hazard and infamy,
obliges them by this good turn, to become his
sincere friends.</p>
            <p>11. It is a very familiar artifice, and subtle
trick used in Courts, to supplant and remove
a man secretly, that so thou being advanced by
this kindnesse and good office of his, maist be
the more strictly engaged and obliged to him.</p>
            <p>12. Not lesse frequent in Court is that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and to be avoided craft and wilinesse, of
<hi>Eutrapelus Horatianus,</hi> who was wont to lend
mony to men, to supply their luxury, and would
puff up the minds of those, whom he intended to
accommodate, with a good round sum.</p>
            <p>13. In like manner, they who applaud and
allow us in our pleasures, affections, and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and advise us to undertake such things, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
our strength and abilities, (which also they
extoll beyond desert) or such things as are against
reason, do most-what go about to hurry us to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and destruction.</p>
            <p>14. But let us return to the means of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
friendship with Enemies, amongst which, this
is in no wise the last, or least, <hi>viz.</hi> to assist the
wishes and endeavours of an Enemy, both by
counsell and endeavour, when you see that
you cannot impede and hinder their success
that so he may seem to be engaged to love by your
good turnes.</p>
            <p>

15. By this means <hi>Ascanius Sforcia</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
observing, that he in vain interceded and
went about, to hinder the machinations and
plots of <hi>Julian</hi> the Cardinall, who laboured to
advance <hi>John,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
sixth, to the Cardinall-dignity, did afterwards so
affectedly act on <hi>Johns</hi> side, that he obtained it for
him; and after that, became a greater favourit to
him, than <hi>Julian</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>16. If the stubbornesse of the enemy frustrate
all endeavours of reconciliation, we must at last
observe, whether our adversary hath not some
other, whom he envies, and fears more then our
selves; if so, and he seem to prosecute the same
designe, which we do, you may so deal with the
adversary by a friend, that though his hate be
equally prevalent towards both, yet may he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
favour or lesse hurt and obstruct our party.</p>
            <p>A device, not unlike to this, was that used by
<hi>Gerlachus,</hi> the Bishop and Elector of <hi>Mentz;</hi>
when he intended to create <hi>Adolfus Nassovius</hi> his
kinsman, Emperour. He knew, that there was
variance between the Princes, who were very
likely to get, or else designed for, the Empire
then vacant: He deals with the Electors, (whom
he was about to make use of for his purpose) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
and apart: He admonisheth <hi>Vinceslans,</hi>
then King of the Bohemians, that most of the
suffrages and votes of the Electors, went against
<hi>Albertus</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria, Vinceslaus</hi> his enemy;
neverthelesse he himself was ready to hinder and
stop it, if he perceived, that <hi>Vincestaus</hi> consented.
Having perswaded <hi>Vinceslaus,</hi> he sets upon the
Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and reports to him, that the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93484:36"/>
               <hi>Duke</hi> of Brunswick (his adversary) was the next in
hope to atchieve the business. But to the <hi>Palatine</hi>
he boasteth lest he should be hindered, that <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceslaus</hi>
(who then was offended with the <hi>Palatinate)</hi>
unlesse he were hindered, was neerer to it then the
rest. Thus (every one promising to subvert his
enemy) he circumvents them all, and at last no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
his kinsman, who (if he had mentioned
him before), would doubtless have been rejected
by consent of all parties.</p>

               <p>Concerning Envy, and by what meanes it may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1, OUr speech must now be framed, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Envy, which is so great an evill that
it needs much happiness and fortitude, to conquer
and overcome it, as that which will not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
but with the participation and enjoyment of
that thing, which it denieth to another; but
every one being tenacious of, and holding fast his
owne good, is willing to labour and take paines
for himselfe, and not for others.</p>
            <p>2. This is superable, and may be overcome;
though very hardly, nor to this is the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of that good thing, we hunt after, simply
needfull. It sufficeth sometimes to shew the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
that the good thing which they desire, if it
remaine in our power, may be done to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:93484:37"/>
3. To this end, it behooveth us to get into
their friendship and familiarity; and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to them, That although they be manifestly
envious, yet we do well affect them; affirming
that we will all things as they will them, nor go
we about any thing whatever but that thereby we
may be the fitter to serve our friends, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
amongst them. In brief; we must so act, that
they may conceive hopes of increasing their owne
fortunes, by the augments and amplifyings of
our wealth and substance.</p>
            <p>4. All haughtiness of mind, too great exceedings
in costliness, unreasonable feasts &amp; banquettings;
and lastly, all boasting and bragging, are chiefly
to be shunned by such, who will be cautious of
being Envyed.</p>
            <p>5. Especially by such as are raised from a mean
place and office, unlesse the will of the Prince or
the dignity of Office require the contrary: for then
some Magnificence and sumptuous provision will
not be unbeseeming, so that he manifest that he
is not at such cost for his owne pleasure, but in
obedience to the Princes Command.</p>
            <p>6. By such prudence and moderation, began
Cardinall <hi>Ximenes</hi> in a principall City: he was
borne in an obscure and unknowne place, and
t'was uncertaine whether noble, or not; although
his fortune afterwards found those, who would
affirme him noble. When he was but meane, he
became a Monk; afterwards for his Endowment of
mind, made confessor to <hi>Isabella</hi> Queen of <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
upon the recommendation of Cardinall <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza,</hi>
and lastly Arch-Bishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which
Arch-Bishoprick (when <hi>Mendoza</hi> was dead)
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93484:37"/>
               <hi>Isabella</hi> having obtained from the Pope) he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe unfit for envy, would not accept.</p>
            <p>7. In refusing whereof he was so pertinacious,
and head-strong, that though <hi>Isabella</hi> had submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and subjected all the Court-Nobles he would
scarce suffer himselfe to be intreated to accept of,
and undertake the charge and office. And after he
had consented and accepted, there was need
againe of other intreaties, by which he might be
induced to more ample charges and offices, and
such splendor as befitted his dignity. And so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
was he of his former way of life, that he
was no otherwise wrought upon, to any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then by the Authority even of the Pope
himselfe. This modesty wrought well for him,
and he appeased the Envy which otherwise was
certainly to be expected to one, who possessed
dignity, environed with so many noble Spaniards,
and wealth second onely to that of kings.</p>
            <p>8. Lastly this way of acting, as it is a not able
and excellent Amulet and preservative-Poman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
against Envy, under the beginnings of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
so it little advantageth those, who have
once already carried themselves proudly; for such
Moderation will seeme but feigned. An example
whereof the history of Constantinople will afford.
A certaine Metropolitane, by name <hi>Constantine,</hi>
being expelled the Court of <hi>Isaciaus Angelus,</hi> and
afterwards of <hi>Alexius,</hi> the Emperours, returned
with <hi>Euphrosyne</hi> the Empresse, boasted of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
of business, and a Court life, took upon him
the function of a Deacon; by which to credit his
dissimulation, and that he might the more instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be courted and intreated thereto. But, in briefe,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93484:38"/>
he so craftily played his Cards, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
himselfe sent for him to Court, contrary to
the ordinances of the Church, he being excluded
from the Sacrament of Priest-hood, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to great offices; and (not content with his
owne dignity) he brought two brothers to be at
the Emperours elbow, to supply his absence, if
at any time by businesse of great moment he
should be called aside. But because his former
fortune had too much disclosed his insolency;
therefore now, although seemingly modest,
could he not long be credited, but afterwards
being removed from Court, and never restored,
he dyed.</p>

               <p>Emulation is the sister of Envy. The Remedies against
it.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. THe same remedies which do change Envy
into the better, do also prevaile against
Emulation which indeed hath lesse malignity in
it then Envy hath, but more ambition; and is not
lesse treacherous against the growth and thrivings
of others.</p>
            <p>2. But we may avert and turne aside those who
are inflamed with ambition, by a specious shew
of veneration, and allure and delight them with
vain honours; lest they become Competitours with
us, scruing up their hopes to higher things and
assisting them as far as is lawfull. On the contrary,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93484:38"/>
undervaluing the things we affect and aime at,
as below their Merits, yet sufficient for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
as not having equall Hopes with them
of greater.</p>
            <p>3. If there be any feare that they should get
before us, they may be stopt by injecting a doubt,
which may be done, if (arguments being proposed
on both sides,) the greater species and shew be
added to those things, which are most apt to stop,
and retard their ambitious courses.</p>
            <p>4. But of all courses, that were best, if we could
conceal our designes till the Emulous, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
parties have elapsed their time, wherein they
could have stopped and hindred us.</p>
            <p>5: The suite of such as solicite too openly, is
often odious to those, who acting more modestly
take time to turne themselves in, and to consider
they also have a conflict with greater difficulties,
and are exposed to more Envy if they overcome;
but if otherwise, to more reproach.</p>
            <p>6. Farr safer is it (as is said in number 4.) to
suppresse and conceale advisements, and like water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
rowing in a boat to turne the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ack upon the
place they strive to land at.</p>
            <p>7. They who have canvassed for the greatest
Empires, have steered this Course, nothing being
more usuall with them, than that (in <hi>Euripides</hi>
his Tragedy) example of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> to boast
that his desires tended rather to peace, then hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.
And many have been sensible, that this hath
been the most wholesome remedy, and Antidote,
in turning aside the plots of adversaries, and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Infamy, which abides these frustrated, and
earnest Suitors. And at last they have attained
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93484:39"/>
that glory, that their honour seemeth rather to
be conferred on them by their own merits, then
by flattering suffrages and votes of others.</p>
            <p>8. Lastly, in atchieving honours; this chiefly
must we take heed to, that we strive not with any
one who is greater then our selves, and more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
then they, under whom we shelter our
selves. <hi>Manilius Lepidus</hi> a man in the judgment of
<hi>Tacitus</hi> most wise, will then be worthy our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
who being brought into the Senate by
<hi>Tiberius</hi> with <hi>Junius Blesus,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Sejanus,</hi>
that one of them might be chosen Proconsul of
<hi>Africa,</hi> excuseth himself with his owne unheal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
the age of his Children, &amp; that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was marriageable, fearing doubtless that <hi>Seja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
would become his Enemy, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
had been taken before hand from <hi>Blesus.</hi>
Annal 3.</p>
            <p>9. Neither may we strive too obstinately with
one, whom the Prince more propitiously favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
goeth about to advance, although the law
favoureth us against him. For the Law doubtless
is overcome by favour, as the Historian tells us,
was fotmerly done, when <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Drusus</hi>
created <hi>Haterus Agrippa,</hi> the kinsman of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,

            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>How ruine is to be avoided, when it is imminent; how it
may be handled. Examples of such as have fallen
by their power.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. Hitherto we have dispatched the chief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
which a politique man is to observe.
If any remain, every ones prudence and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
may supply them. And although they serve
not only to acquire and get, but also, to keep and
maintain Courtly power; yet will it not be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
to have in readinesse the examples of such
who have fallen by their power and greatnesse;
that we may be wise by others perils, and if we
cannot shun ruine, at least we may learn to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
our selves for it. For this last is not lesse
necessary then the other. Sithence he who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth
a flight, oftimes assayeth in vain; he
who prepares for a fall (inevitable to most whom
fortune mounteth on high) renders it the more
gentle and supportable.</p>
            <p>2. Such chances often happen, either by our
own default, or by the Arts, and devices of envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Enemies or Competitors, or by the pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Princes inclination, or finally, by his
death.</p>
            <p>3. Since all mens lives are prone to lapse and
repleat with errors, chiefly theirs, who live lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and by reason of their Authority (by which
they who are neer to them, are constrained to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93484:40"/>
all their Actions, whether good or bad) are
set without, and beyond the chance of the Dice,
and danger of reprehension.</p>
            <p>4. But above all others, that's the basest treason
when men rise up against their Prince, the Author
of their dignity and honour, a note and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an ungratefull mind and unfaithfulnesse, a
filthy crime, and the most just matter and
subject of a Prince's Odium and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>5. Let such men as are advanced to great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
fly the very shadow and appearance of this
wickednesse: and for the end, let them not move
the Prince to the least suspition, and let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
those honours which may seem opportune,
and seasonable, by evill endeavours.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Paterculus</hi> adjudged <hi>Sejanus</hi> the most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of Courtiers; and indeed he ought to have
been so, who could flourish in favour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that same crafty, and distrustfull <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. In acting (saith he) he was like one asleep
revengefull of nothing done to himself, and so
obtaining all things, scruing himselfe into the
esteem of others; calme and undisturbed in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and life, but restless in mind. And yet on
this crafty and subtill peece had Ambition so got
hold, that he aspired to the Empire. For that end
first he desired intermarriage with <hi>Livia</hi> the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of <hi>Drusus,</hi> whereby being allyed to the house
of the <hi>Casars,</hi> he might the more faciliate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
And although his request was suspected by
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> as he might guesse by his tergiversation
and refusall; he never yet changed his minde: but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93484:40"/>
because this succeeded not, he attempted another
way.</p>
            <p>8. He well knew that the City disdained <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
and therefore, while he was wavering, he eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him forward, and perswades him to betake
himself to <hi>Caprcas</hi> his magnificent Tower neer
<hi>Naples.</hi> Of this matter, <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the fourth of
his Annals, saith thus. Least by driving away the
troops which dayly came to his house, he should
infringe his power, or by receiving them, give way
to criminations, be bent this way, to force <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
to live in pleasant and delightfull places,
far remote from <hi>Rome.</hi> He provided many things,
he held addresses and accesses in his own hands;
he intercepted Letters often which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to and fro by the Souldiers; when as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
growing into years, and lying quiet, and at ease
in a secret place, would, he thought, ere long, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the charge of the Empire to him with more
facility. Nor did his hope altogether her deceive him,
for in short space, under the shew of helping
<hi>Tiberius</hi> in his old age, he got<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> almost all the
strength of the Empire into his owne
hands.</p>
            <p>9. Nevertheless, that this way which <hi>Sejanus</hi>
tooke had more of hazard in it then expedition,
the Sequel will declare: which more exactly to
commemorate will be a worke well worthy our
labour, to the end that both our Courtiers may
be better cautionated, in ruling and governing
their own fortunes; and Princes in promoting
of others.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Sejanus</hi> was either more indeered unto, or
more endured by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he found his help
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93484:41"/>
usefull in repressing <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and her sons <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
and <hi>Drusus.</hi> In which villany, <hi>Sejanus</hi> shewed
himself very prompt and ready, knowing that
thereby he should not only hoise up sayle, and
have a speedy voyage to the Prince's favour, but
also establish his hopes for future power and
greatness, there being none remaining of <hi>Caesar's</hi>
house but those two youths; whose tender
Age, if they had accepted the chief Regiment and
Government, had left to him the Authority and
mannagement of affairs, till opportunity would
serve him, to usurpe and possess the Supream style
and Title.</p>
            <p>11. But observe how precipitate and heady Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
makes men! He sees not by that how much
the neerer he was to the height, by so much the
more was he suspected by the diffidency of the
Prince; and that the course he takes would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diminish him, then further his progresse. He
hunts counter; for when nothing, save the name
of Emperour (which yet many were ready to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him) and the power of a Triune, (which
title being the top and Pinacle of Honour and
dignity, the Emperours did challenge as due
soly to themselves) was wanting to him; not
content therewith, he strives to exaggerate and
heape up his power, to a greater bulke and breadth;
And by this (as he renders himself venerable to
all, so) he brought himself under suspect with
<hi>Tiberius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. He therefore, when he perceived that not
only the Praetorian bands, but many of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Principall Families, (partly by benefits
and hope, and partly by fear) were addicted and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93484:41"/>
devoted to <hi>Sejanus;</hi> and that his own secrets
were carried, and disclosed by his own domesticks
to <hi>Sejanus,</hi> and the like not done to him of the
matters of <hi>Sejanus;</hi> by and by, plotted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
his ruine and destruction, as of an Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and one contending to outvie him. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he would set upon any action, thought fit to
try how some stood affected towards him, that
so he might distinguish from the rest, who
would approve his designe and advise him in
it.</p>
            <p>13. And lest <hi>Sejanus</hi> should smell out <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
intention, he makes him a Consul, and in his
presence, and also by Letters to the Statesmen
and people, styles him his friend in Labours; at
length feigneth himself sick, that so he might
sound the affection of <hi>Sejanns,</hi> and others towards
him.</p>
            <p>14. Sometimes he writes to the Senate more
cheerfully of his health, and that he would come
shortly into the City. Sometimes commends and
applaudes <hi>Sejanus;</hi> another while depresseth him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
receiving some upon his recommendation;
spurning at others, that so he might keep him
ambiguous, and doubtfull betwixt hope and
fear.</p>
            <p>15. Who, (whether yet imboldned by favour,
or out of fear) determines to act nothing forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
lest he should hazard all his hopes, hoping
that his petty trespasses against the Prince (if any
were) would in time be raced and blotted out
of memory. Some, mean while hitherto follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rather <hi>Sejanus</hi> his fortune then himself, seeing
the mutability of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> begin to act more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93484:42"/>
the affection of others towards him by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, withers and growes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ale.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>Tiberius,</hi> having a good while since taken a
clear prospect of the proud and lofty mind of
<hi>Sejanus;</hi> and also mistrusting, lest his designe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stirred up by contempt, should be frustrated,
by running the hazard of fortune and chance,
commanded, it should be noised abroad, that
he intended to deliver over the Tribunician
power and authority to <hi>Sejanus.</hi> A little while
after, by Letters to the Senate, which were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by <hi>Macro,</hi> (who was Provost of the Pretorian
Bands) he commands him to be committed to
prison. <hi>Macro</hi> having entred the City, before
day, acquainted first <hi>Memmius Regulus,</hi> then a
Consul, (for the other Consul was more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Sejanus)</hi> with the Prince's mandat, which
afterwards he shewes to <hi>Grecinus Laco,</hi> then
Captain of the Watch. From thence going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Senate-house, he accidentally acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
<hi>Sejanus,</hi> who being troubled in his thoughts,
enquires whether he had any Letters for him
from <hi>Tiberius:</hi> He whispereth him in the ear, that
by and by he must be saluted a Tribune; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tickled with secret joy, enters the Court.
<hi>Macro</hi> dismisses the Pretorian Attendants, shews
by Letters, that it is the Emperours pleasure it
should be so, and that thereby they are promised
a donative. <hi>Macro</hi> having ordained <hi>Laco</hi>'s Band
to the Pretorian Attendants, who were now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed,
entring the Senate-house, offers the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and anon, (not expecting the reading of
them) charges <hi>Laco</hi> diligently to watch, lest <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus</hi>
breaking out of the Court, should raise a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93484:42"/>
tumult, himself going to the Pretorian Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
and prohibites them from attempting any
thing.</p>
            <p>17. The Letters which were then read being
somewhat large, afforded <hi>Macro</hi> time enough, to
provide necessaries, and were wonderfully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced
and contrived. In the beginning, not a
word of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> but of other matters; by and by
hee's nipt, but very lightly; after this, (some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things being interwoven) followes a high
accusation; and yet but perfunctorily and sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touched. At length, (after many digressions
about the publick affairs) two of <hi>Sejanus</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
are nominated, whom the Senate are
commanded to animadvert and consider, with
this addition, that he himself should be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
no mention was made of any course to
be taken for his death, that so, hopes might be
left to the accused, to purge him of the crimes,
which were therefore objected but as leight
matters.</p>
            <p>18. The Letters being read, many of those who
had brought him into the Senate-house, (when
they perceived the businesse to be far otherwise,
then that <hi>Sejanus</hi> should receive the power of a
Tribune) began to rise up, and encompassed <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus,</hi>
lest he should slink away, which was
thought he would have done, if the beginning of
the Letters had thundred more sharply against
him. But contemning those petty and sleight
nips and twinges, he stirrs not from his place;
and being called upon twice or thrice by <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>
the Consul, he scarcely submitted; so inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and haughty was he grown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93484:43"/>
19. When he was risen up, <hi>Laco</hi> first followes
him; afterwards <hi>Regulus,</hi> accompanied with
other of the Senators, brought him out of the
Court into the Prison, where afterwards he was
condemned by the Senate, <hi>ad scalas Gemonias,</hi>
which was a place appointed, from whence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
men were thrown down.</p>
            <p>20. Behold here the end and destruction of a
Courtier, who had scarce his peer within the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of man, for craftinesse and power; whose
structure and building, although as to the whole,
and continuance of it, seems to be due to <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
yet may rather be ascribed to the destiny of
such power, as commonly, by reason of its own
heap and bignesse, falls so much the lower, by
how much the higher and loftier it thrusts up it
self; according to that saying, <hi>Tolluntur in altum
&amp; lapsu gravioreruant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. This may be learnt from the example of <hi>Peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
whom (striving to get up to this height by
<hi>Seianus</hi> his Arts and devices) <hi>Commod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
farre inferiour to <hi>Tiberius</hi> in ingenuity
and witt, subverted and overthrew.</p>
            <p>22. Perhaps these relations may not move ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men, because they seeme to themselves to bee
wiser then others, and to know some things
which was unknown to those whose chances are
here related; And truly, there have been some in
these latter Ages, to whom this businesse hath
succeeded not altogether so unhappily, such as
<hi>Boyla</hi> was, (of whom we may reade in the History
of <hi>Constantinople)</hi> who being found to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
against <hi>Constantine, Monomachus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
suffered not such exquisite, and heavy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93484:43"/>
as others in like cases had done, because
he fell into the hands of a mild and placable
Prince.</p>
            <p>23. But we are willing here briefly to recite that
story, from which may be understood, That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
even the most secret, and such as to humane
eyes are not passable, oftimes by divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and even by unhoped for meanes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
and discovered, and cannot avoid their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
although handled with never so much
craftinesse and subtilty.</p>
            <p>24. No mortall could have beleeved, that this
<hi>Boyla</hi> had had, either aptitude and fitnes, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
cause for such a villany. The greatnesse
of the benefits wherewith hee had adorned and
beautified him, had wrought an opinion in the
Prince of his fidelity, for otherwise he seemed
simple to any great matters; for he was not only
borne in a low and meane place, but also was of
such a buffling, sumbling, and cumbred
speech, that he could scarce be understood, and
when he perceived that it delighted the Emperor,
he afterwards industriously affected it.</p>
            <p>25. By this assentation and soothing, he so far
insinuated into the Prince's familiarity, that he
had admittance even to the privy, and bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Constantine.</hi> At length, being enriched by
the Prince, and elected into the number of the
Senators, he began to shute out his hopes to a
higher flight, and went so far, that he thought, by
the ruine and destruction of the Prince, he might
find a way to the Scepter it self. He first opens
himself to those, whom he knew were offended
with the Prince, and promiseth largely to those,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93484:44"/>
who approve and associate their aids, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the refusers for their good-will to their
Prince, and made shew, as if he were but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorator,
and private spy, to try their faithfulness
and loyalty.</p>
            <p>26. While these things were in agitation, he
shunned the conscience of all men, save those
whom he feared not; and had done the bloody act,
had he not been discovered by one of his own
comerades and counsellors, and by his art depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
having the very weapon in his hand,
which he had sharpned to kill the Prince withall.
The Emperour bore the injury so mildly, that he
accounted it enough, that some of the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were put to death; but the Ring-leader and
Captain he onely banished.</p>
            <p>27. It would be too tedious, to bring in here
all those, who in Courts have been shipwrackt;
such, I say, as by such offences have merited pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
and which have hepned, not onely to
the manifest authors of such wickednesse, but
even to such, as have been suspected of the
thoughts thereof. But we'l content our selves,
with producing these, and onely add this, That all
Pride, whether it offend the Prince by ambition,
or boasting, upbraiding, malediction, or revile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
by splendour, or too great a retinue, is the
high road to destruction and ruine.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>Bragging and boasting before the Prince, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and twitting with offices, liberty, arrogancy,
too much familiarity, pride, vanity, avarice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousnesse,
conspiracy, sowing of dissention and
strife, are every one of them denoted by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BOasting and upbraiding of Offices, in the
Court of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, lost <hi>Philotas</hi>
and <hi>Clytus; Craterus</hi> also, was almost blown up
with the same winds. Certes, he had longer stood
affected with the Prince, had he contained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
within the bounds of noble and generous
modesty.</p>
            <p>2. Thus <hi>Caius Sylius</hi> with <hi>Tiberius: Antonius</hi>
the first, with <hi>Vespasian; Syllas</hi> with King <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi>
publishing aforehand their offices and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
deprived themselves of all the fruit
and benefit of them; concerning the first of whom,
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> in the 4th. of his Annalls; and <hi>Josephus</hi>
in his 4th. History, touching the last, are to be
inspected and looked into.</p>
            <p>3. Princes believe, that their fortune is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
by such kind of boastings; which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
they will have seem to be due to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
not to the merits or vertue of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>4. A lust and desire of reprehending the
actions of Princes, and a freedom of inveighing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93484:45"/>
against others before the Prince, is to be avoided,
as the neighbour to arrogancy. <hi>Eumenes,</hi> petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
and saucily, complaining before <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of <hi>Hephestion,</hi> that he assigned to Stage-play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and such kind of fellowes, the Souldiers
quarters, incurred the displeasure of the King.</p>
            <p>5. To be too familiarly busie about the Prince,
or to boast ones self, the sole Arbitrator and
Commissioner of principall charges, savoureth,
if not of pride, yet certainly vanity; and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse
sometimes crouds it self in with it.
Many examples of such are extant every where,
in Histories. How immodestly did <hi>Zotirus</hi> demean
and carry himself, under <hi>Heliogbalus?</hi> how did
<hi>Turinus</hi> under <hi>Alexander,</hi> the son of <hi>Mammea?</hi>
One whereof was by the Emperour's command
suffocated with smoak, using a more uncouth
and harsh fortune then the former, it seeming
just, <hi>ut, qui fumum vendiderat, fumo puniretur,</hi>
That he who had vended and sold smoak, should
perish by smoak. The other was wont to boast,
that the Prince was ruled by his advice, and also
made advantage, by selling favours, when the
courtesie was no way advantagious to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser.</p>
            <p>6. Worthy in the first place to be remembered,
is the arrogancy of <hi>Plancianus,</hi> which also was
accompanied with vanity, and at length broke
out into treachery: He was of that arrogancy,
that he durst oppose himself against <hi>Bassianus,</hi> the
Emperours son, the author of his dignity and
fortune: Moreover also, so vain, that passing
through the City, he would not onely preclude
others from addresses to him, but almost from
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93484:45"/>
having a view of him; and had some to go before
him, to turn those whom they met, out of his
way. At length proved traitor to his Prince; and
being found guilty of manifest conspiracy, lost
his head for his pains.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Philip</hi> the fair reigning in <hi>France, Enguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus
Marigny,</hi> presuming to confront <hi>Carolus
Valesius,</hi> how miserably he perished, together
with others, is observed out of the French Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories.</p>
            <p>8. Before all things also in Courts, we ought
to beware, that we lend not our help to the sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of discord amongst Princes; for they being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to each other, do mostly sacrifice such
persons to their friendship. Which thing is made
good, both by many examples, in the Histories
of all Nations, and also by that memorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Otho Crondorferus,</hi> which the History of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> supplies us withal. He was in flourishing
favour with <hi>Radulphus</hi> the Palatine, and was the
author of the enmities between him and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
At length, the mother ingratiates her self
with her son; but <hi>Crondorferus</hi> was rewarded,
with the losse and deprivation, both of his tongue
and eyes.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>How a man may conserve the Prince's benevolence,
and the good will of such as are in favour with
him.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. WE ought not therefore to crosse or resist
Princes themselves onely, but even not
such as are in favour with them, and are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
then ourselves.</p>
            <p>2. This Counsell <hi>Germanicus</hi> when he dyed
gave to <hi>Agrippina;</hi> whereof <hi>Tacitus</hi> speakes in the
2. of his Annals, thus: Then turning to his wife
(sayeth he) he intreateth her by the memory of
himselfe, and the Children they had between
them, that she should put off cruelty and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and submit her mind to rigorous fortune;
least returning back to the City, she should stirre
up, and provoke, such as were more powerfull then
herselfe, through emulation. This precept being
sleighted by <hi>Agrippina,</hi> ruined both her, and her
children. We spake a little before, of that which
was the diminution and shortning of <hi>Eumenes</hi> his
favour with <hi>Alexander,</hi> that behaving himselfe
too irreverently and unseemly in the Prince's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
when he came to complain of <hi>Hephaestion,</hi>
he even wove himselfe, (through the Complaint)
into the web of Envy.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore, when we see any one flourish by
the grace and favour of the Prince; we ought
carefully to waigh our Authority, if we have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93484:46"/>
any, in the ballance with theirs, and try whose is
most ponderous. And in the Examen and tryall
thereof, not to attend so much to the externall
species and shadow; but to the importance and
wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght of interiour and inward causes.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Hephaestion</hi> seemed once to be
both in great and equall favour with <hi>Alexander,</hi>
till <hi>Alexander</hi> himself made the difference; when
he calls the one, <hi>Amicum Regis,</hi> the friend of the
King; the other <hi>Amicum Alexandri</hi> the friend of
<hi>Alexander;</hi> for upon this speech, <hi>Craterus</hi> could
make this observation and judgment, That Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being commonly more addicted to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
then their owne dignity and honour, do
hold, and account them most deere unto them,
who do love and embrace <hi>Alexanders,</hi> that is
themselves; then those who do court, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the fortune of Kings. And although there
arose a dissention afterwards between him and
<hi>Hephaestion,</hi> whereby the whole Court was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into parties; <hi>Alexander</hi> shewed himselfe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
and tied to neither party, but chid both;
and threatned to punish them, if hereafter they
put him to the like trouble. In this kind of deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which <hi>Alexander</hi> here useth, he manifested,
not so much his equall and indifferent affection
towards them both; as a singular and most especial
kind of prudence in Princes, very much to be
imitated. This discord and difference, he sees,
may produce many troubles; neither was he igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that <hi>Craterus</hi> his wonderfull Authority,
with the Macedonians; and his owne favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Hephaestion</hi> was envyed, and bred displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against himselfe: he therefore blames <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaestion</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:93484:47"/>
for his envy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>blique; and chides
<hi>Craterus</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivately, lest the Macedonians should
be offended.</p>
            <p>5. Amongst those, who in the examination of
Princely benevolence and favour, have either
been more neglective, or being devoid of reason
have been more unexperienced and unskilfull, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius
Primus</hi> deserves to be listed, who (presume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to contend with <hi>Mutianus)</hi> learnt at length,
That it was more destructive to him that he had
disdained <hi>Mutianus,</hi> then if he had despised <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Now, that Princes do more sharply revenge
an injury done to their Ministers, then to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
is a thing attested by Examples almost in
all Courts, the cause whereof <hi>Dio</hi> sifted out; after
he had declared the same to have happened in the
case of <hi>Sejanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Even as they, (saith he) whom virtue and
their known merits, have dignified and exalred,
do not very much stand upon, and esteem or heed
the vanities of their honours, and the outward
marks and expressions of worship and reverence:
So on the contrary, they, who by Ambition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to raise themselves from the ground and
dust, and to cover their domestick and covetous
briberies, do take it very hainously, and interpret
it presently a contempt, if you neglect the least
matter or punctillio of homage, or good turne
towards them. So much the more difficult is it
therefore, to conserve and hold fast the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of such, then of the Prince himselfe. For
he counts it his glory to pardon an injury, but
they, (that they may not seeme to remit, what
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93484:47"/>
they cannot vindicate) not onely straine their
power in persecuting their enemies, but ostentate
and boast of such their doings.</p>

               <p>Pride denoted and observed by Examples in men, of

and designes.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. ANd not onely hath an insolent, and
haughty carriage and deportment, been
destructive and mischievous to Nobles and great
ones: but even to men of the most inferiour and
base degree. John king of <hi>Arragon</hi> so fondly and
fervently loved <hi>Alvarus</hi> de <hi>Luna</hi> (the son of a
former king of <hi>Arragon,</hi> but borne out of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke)
that he would commit to him the chief
affaires, and even the kingly dignity; his Nobles
in vaine resisting. But when he being lifted up
with pride in this prosperous fortune, had p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
and thrust down head-long a Noble
man, who in the kings name had admonished him
of his duty, himselfe by the kings Command, lost
his head for his paines.</p>
            <p>2. This hath been in Court, the frequent cause
of such Ship-wrack; when any hath rendred either
himselfe, or the Prince odious to the people, or
to the chief of the nation. For either the Prince
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93484:48"/>
himselfe to free him from envy, will cast such
a one off; or else others will rour him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him.</p>
            <p>3. While <hi>Commodus</hi> was Emperour, <hi>Cleander</hi>
had armed the Pretorian Companies against the
people of Rome. This bred Rome so many
troubles and tumults, that (had not the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
himselfe sacrificed <hi>Cleander</hi> to the peoples
fury), he could not have been secure.</p>
            <p>4. The same <hi>Commodus</hi> had incurred the odium
and hatred of all men, for the love of one <hi>Anterus;</hi>
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om whom that they might deliver their Master,
some of those Ministers, who well affected <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi>
met <hi>Ante<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> upon a time as he returned
from Court; and slew him.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Eutropius</hi> being (amongst a few others) a long
time beloved of <hi>Arcadius</hi> the Emperour, when he
was but believed to be the Author of the sedition
moved by <hi>Tribigildus;</hi> was delivered up by the
Prince to his Enemies, as a price of peace and
quietnesse.</p>
            <p>6. Amongst those evills, which subvert and
overthrow Courtiers; that unfaithfulness is not to
be passed by, which bewrayeth the secrets of the
Prince, and imparts them to his enemy. That of
<hi>Sylla,</hi> as it was horrible, so was it notorious by
the destruction of many others, and hammered and
forged with many Monstrous and prodigious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(to wit) with lightnesse and unconstancy,
imprudence and lacke of heed, vanity and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
I may add, with a desire of getting money,
unjust honour, Revenge, Curiosity, and other
restlesse troubles.</p>
            <p>7. As to the secret of Princes, I esteeme it best
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93484:48"/>
that they make choice of such, as are not cleft,
and full of chincks and crannyes, so as to vent and
let out those secrets they impart to them; seeing
they fly onely to them to be admitted into their
Consciences and private thoughts. For if thou
alone be knowing; and yet fame and report,
which is ingenious and cunning at conjecture
and guessing, shall by chance spread abroad some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like that committed to thy secrecy; thou
wilt not avoid suspition, but he will judge his
Secret to issue out from thee; And although the
Prince (it may be) hath by chance opened the
same thing to another, yet possibly he may forget
it; or more confide in the others silence and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,
and the blame be neverthelesse laid on thee.</p>
            <p>8. Not without cause was <hi>Philippides</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
poet (amongst the chief) deere unto king
<hi>Lysimachus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ho being asked what he would wish
to be made partaker of, by the Prince; answered,
That he would refuse nothing that came from
him, so long as he might be free from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his secrets. Let us follow, as much as
may be, his example, and count it safer, to be
unknowing of his Secret, as a thing hard to be
kept, then to be acquainted therewith.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Hiero</hi> Prince of <hi>Syracusa</hi> said, that they who
revealed the secrets of Princes were injurious; in
that they exposed others, aswell as themselves, to
the odium and loathing of the Prince.</p>

               <p>The causes, kinds, and examples of Conspiracies with
the enemies of a Prince.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. BEsides this, most doubtfull of all, is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of those, who being driven thereto,
either by avarice, or ambition, or by desire to prop
up their own security, conspire with a Prince's
Enemies, either extraneous and forraigne, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestique.</p>
            <p>2. Cardinal <hi>Balaeus,</hi> the Son of a Botcher, being
made Treasurer by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. was also from
that preferred to a Bishoprick, from thence by
the intercession of the King, and the accord of
the <hi>Pope</hi> (who indeavoured to confer a Benefite
on him whom he had hitherto experienced to be
his adversary) attained to Cardinal Dignity. But
afterwards being found to have conspired with
the Kings foes, was imprisoned by the space of
12 years, from whence at length the prayers
and intercession of <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the 4th only, freed
him.</p>
            <p>3. For the like crime, Cardinall <hi>Pratenfis</hi> in the
Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the first, underwent the like
punishment, who perhaps had never been released
from Prison, but that afterwards drinking his
own Urine, he deceived the Physitians by dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the Strangury. For the King fearing the
<hi>Popes</hi> anger, if the Cardinall by that Malady
should have been consumed, set him at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

4. <hi>Peter de Vineis</hi> being a privy Counsellor to
the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the second; and being
suspect of conspiracy with <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> the
third being the Emperours Enemy, lost his eyes by
it.</p>
            <p>5. Not only the Counsels of <hi>Stilico</hi> (the Father
in Law of <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperour) to enjoy the
Orientall Empire, but his occult and secret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with <hi>Alaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
to have procured and caused his death;
which thing that Ignominious peace and League
which he entred into with <hi>Alaricus,</hi> although
the Senate withstood and did oppugne it, doth
confirme. <hi>Lampadius,</hi> who also himself cryed
out against it, calls it not a Peace, but a Pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Servitude, by which the Emperour was
constrained to become tributary to the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>

for which Courtiers fall away from their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

            </argument>
            <p>1. FIrst also, our Polititian whom we instruct,
must beware, that he be not the Author of
ambiguous Counsels; the unhappy issue of these,
will be imputed to the Adviser, but the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

who will be glad that he hath one, on whom

            <p>2. While <hi>Scilico</hi> was living, and after his dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h,
there was but one Argument and subject matter
of wailing and complaining amongst the people,
to wit, the peace which he had made with the
<hi>Goths. Olympius</hi> who had procured the Ruine of
<hi>Stilico,</hi> striving to be famous by contrary wayes,
broke off the League of peace, <hi>Alaricus</hi> in vain
objecting Right and Equity; War being begun,
for sometime contrary to Augury and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vination;
he being accounted in the judgment of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
the Author of all their Evills was at length
accused by the Eunuches, who were very grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
with the Emperour, and leaving the Court
fled into <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When the businesse was of undertaking a
Warre or breaking the League, the Ministers and
furtherers in this businesse are made parties; they
only bring arguments on both sides, and leave the
choice of either to the arbirrement of the Prince:
not with standing, if they were constrained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their opinions they would conclude it safer
to incline to peace, unless very Necessity or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
and apparent Utility, perswaded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Jovius,</hi> the Successor of <hi>Olympius,</hi> of whom
we have spoken, wisely prosecutes the businesse:
for he being more prone to War, that so he might
be more necessary to the Prince, did neverthelesse
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93484:50"/>
as the Politick custome of some is, prefer the love
of Peace. Meeting at <hi>Rhemes</hi> to parly with <hi>Alari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
he sends those conditions which <hi>Alaricus</hi>
had proposed to <hi>Honorius,</hi> perswading him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
by other Letters, to offer the command of
the Armies to <hi>Alaricus,</hi> by which he might be
made more equall and indifferent for other things.
The Emperour denying that it was besides his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
to commit the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>resse thereof to a forrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and one who was yet an Enemy, answered
that he had rather consent to became tributary.</p>
            <p>5. These Letters when <hi>Jovius</hi> had read before
<hi>Alaricus,</hi> he being wroth, that himself, and his,
were contemned by <hi>Honorius,</hi> broke off this
uncertain web and worke of the Paction and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement:
<hi>Jovius</hi> returnes to <hi>Honorius,</hi> who
himself being offended with the insolency of his
Enemy, sweares not to have peace with <hi>Alari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
and with the same Oath binds all his party.
Thus <hi>Jovius</hi> by the same subtilty and craftinesse,
both removes the envy of the Truce-breakings
from himself, and obliges <hi>Alaricus</hi> by the restifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his good will; whereby he would have
had him been made the Tribune of <hi>Caesars</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
but infolded <hi>Honorius</hi> in War: which thing
wonderfully established the Authority and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Jovius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. There is such great variety in Histories, of
those Errors and faults, for which Courtiers fall
into disfavour with Princes, that no man by any
diligence can so collect them all, but that when
he hath quoted many, he will yet seem to have
omitted more. Wherefore the most principall
only being tasted, we will leave the rest to every
ones industry and prudence.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXVII.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>By what wiles a Courtier may be suppressed, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent
persons: First, That either he may go from
Court himself, under some pretence; or else be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
removed. Of such, who by the same Art,
are called up out of the Provinces.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE have seen how by his own default, a
Courtier may fall into the displeasure of
a Prince. We will now shew the means, by which
his foes, such as are envious, or emulous, may
depresse and abase him: For, they may endeavour
to remove him from Court, upon some pretext
not dishonourable; or may render him suspected
or hated to the Prince; or lastly, in a publick and
open manner, constrain the Prince to remove
him.</p>
            <p>2. The way of Amolition, or removing, which
we said was the first way, hath divers means, and
various ends; for some, out of a shew of honour,
or occasion to live with some friends, and neer
allies, are induced, not unwillingly, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselves from Court. This way <hi>Stippiota</hi>
craftily used, (when <hi>Manuel Comnenus</hi> was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour)
to remove <hi>Hagiotheodorita,</hi> who stood in
his light; for there being a difference between
<hi>Michael</hi> the Pedagogue, and <hi>Josephus Balsamon,
Stippiota</hi> perswaded the Emperour, that if <hi>Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theodorita,
Balsamons</hi> kinsman, were made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> the difference would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93484:51"/>
               <hi>Hagiotheodorita</hi> being glad of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to help his kinsman, accepteth the
courtesie; little minding, that <hi>Stippiota</hi> alone,
would in the interim (his Competitor being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved)
have the ordering and managing of the
chief affairs of the Empire, which also came to
passe.</p>
            <p>3. Some men, being wearied with the contentions
&amp; brablings of adversaries in Court, betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto any Province whatsoever, upon pretext
of necessary departing thence. Thus did <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
who (as <hi>Velleius</hi> testifieth) went into <hi>Asia,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
some principall businesse; but, as report
went, for some private grudge between him and
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> withdrew himself from the present
time.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Tiberius</hi> (while <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> was yet alive,
who envyed him) departed to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> pretending
to turn Student there, and (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> saith) by
his mothers means, obtained, that to cover his
reproach, he might make shew, as if he had gone
Ambassadour thither.</p>
            <p>5. If he whom you desire to remove, have no
pretence to get leave to withdraw, and will not
take it as a courtesie, that he may depart wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
and without compulsion, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Prince to prefer him, to some charge
and office, upon this account, that none is more
worthy or fit for such an employment.</p>
            <p>6. After the same manner do emulous and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
persons, desire to have such abstracted and
drawn from a Province, or subdued Country,
whose authority they endeavour to weaken,
whom they labour to bring into Court, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93484:52"/>
and usefull to the Prince, and to thrust
him into the croud of Courtiers, by whose lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse,
he may be the more obscured and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>7. This was the artifice and trick, which <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
used with <hi>Polybius,</hi> when he went about to
deprive <hi>Taurio</hi> of the government of <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. So <hi>Darius</hi> (by the advice of <hi>Megabyzus)</hi>
called back <hi>Hyesteus</hi> from the government of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
a Region of <hi>Greece;</hi> not because there was
need of his presence, but that he might infringe
and lessen his power and greatnesse.</p>
            <p>9. If these Courtiers were content to enlarge
their own place and bounds, by the removing of
another, and would stop there, the comparing of
others far worse, would render this Art tolerable;
but for the most part, they stick not here.</p>
            <p>10. When <hi>Constantius</hi> was Emperour, <hi>Sylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
being Commander of the Infantry, (as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus
Marcellus</hi> reports) by the procurement
of <hi>Arbetius,</hi> is sent into <hi>France,</hi> to correct and
amend those mischiefs, wherewith the Barbarous
people had infested the French; as one emulous,
and that could not endure to see any one quiet,
and out of trouble; declines so great and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
a work, and turns it upon another. <hi>Sylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
undertaking the journey, and having ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
with the French, became thereby power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Afterwards <hi>Arbetius</hi> compileing envy against
him, with the Emperour, was at length himself
brought to ruine.</p>
            <p>11. The same fortune almost had <hi>Ursicinus,</hi>
Commander of the Cavalry, under the same
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93484:52"/>
Emperour: One <hi>Eusebius</hi> an Eunuch, with many
other Courtiers, had conspired his death; by the
machinations and devices of these conspirators,
he is sent into the borders of <hi>Persia,</hi> that so he
might be at distance from Court, where having
continued by the space of ten years, he receives
for his successor <hi>Sabinianus,</hi> a man, who neither
for wit nor experience, was comparable to him,
for such a charge. By and by, (a rumour being
raised, that the Persians made ready for war) he
is commanded to stay there, having delivered up
his power to the other; <hi>Eusebius</hi> purposely so
disposing the matter, that so <hi>Sabinianus</hi> should
challenge to himself, the prosperous event of the
war against the Persians, and that the adverse and
ill fortune thereof might be imputed to <hi>Ursicinus,</hi>
which the event afterwards confirmed: For <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicinus</hi>
being dejected for anothers fault, spent
the remainder of his life in private. You may see
if you please, <hi>chap. 30. numb.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>12. The times of the same <hi>Constantius</hi> will
supply us with another example; for <hi>Ruffinus,</hi>
the uncle of <hi>Gallus,</hi> by the fathers side, being
President of the Pretorian bands, was sent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
the sedition of the Souldiery, with no
other intention, then that he might perish
amongst the hatefull hands of those mad and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
people. For the same end, <hi>Clytus</hi> complains,
that he was sent by <hi>Alexander</hi> against the Sogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="28" type="chapter">

            <head>CHAP. XXVIII.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>The second way, is; Calumnies and Commendations
are made use of, to make others suspected and
hatefull to the Prince. Touching Detraction, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THus much concerning Amolition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving,
as the primary means and way,
which is used by enemies, and envious and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
persons, to bring others into disfavour with
their Prince and Soveraigne. The second is, that
whereby they render men suspected and odious
to the Prince, by the help of detractions and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
or else by commendations.</p>
            <p>2. In Calumnies we must attend unto two
things; First, Whether they be fit and sufficient
to change the Prince's will. Secondly, Whether
they have a likenesse to truth. Of the first, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to be made, both by the present state of
affairs, and also, by the genius and inclination
of the Prince, and the very nature and condition
of negotiations.</p>
            <p>3. No calumnies do abound with more ruines
of great men, then such as do accuse and impeach
them, of machinations and plots, against the
Prince, and his rule and government, or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and disdaining to obey him, or such as are
of detracting speech, and mocking or scorning the
Prince's words or actions.</p>
            <p>4. Calumnies, and false accusations, are then
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93484:53"/>
rendred probable and likely, if the accusation,
which makes the party accused guilty, be branded
with a note of arrogancy, either in the words or
actions of themselves, or else of their servants,
friends, parents, or those who are tied and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to them, by necessity or alliance. If they be
supposed to have counterfeited Letters, the
judgment and sentence will be such, as that
which the Prince hath already conceived in his
mind, even the faithfulnesse of the calumniator,
and the guiltinesse of the party accused.</p>
            <p>5. Those things which by calumny are wrested
into a crime, are such, as the party traduced is
said to have spoken, or done; either spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and of his own accord, or else being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the deceits and circumventings of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or envious persons. Such wits, by allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and enticeing words, can fetch and pump
up things that are not; and in every matter, find
occasion and opportunity, wherewith to help
themselves.</p>
            <p>6. There are some, who having counselled and
perswaded a man to do something; when they
have found him yield, they make this the very
weapon of their accusation, and feigne, that he
hath attempted some horrible designe against the
Prince.</p>
            <p>7. A certain Magician a Monk, one <hi>Santaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi>
by name, was (before others) beloved by
<hi>Basilius,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but envyed
beyond measure by <hi>Leo</hi> his son: And therefore,
having endeavoured by all obsequious readinesse
of feigned devotion, to allure his good-will, at
length wrought the young man to credulity:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93484:54"/>
For afterwards, (having gotten some credit with
him) he advises <hi>Leo,</hi> to wear a dagger for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
privately, under his Mandilion or Jacket,
if at any time he went out to hunting with his
father. Following his instruction, the Magician
goes to his father, and feignes to him, that his
son had privately conceived parricide, and shewes
the Dagger, as a detection and token thereof,
which he, watching his opportunity, had carried
about him. To be brief, the matter was so han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled,
that the son was imprisoned; and although
protected with the most intensive and vehement
prayers and entreaties of the Nobility, he scarcely
escaped punishment.</p>
            <p>8. In the time of <hi>Valentin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an</hi> the Emperour,
<hi>Aetius</hi> accuseth <hi>Boniface</hi> his companion, (who
was very deer to the Emperour, and made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Africa)</hi> of treachery against <hi>Placidia,</hi>
the Prince's mother, and that he intended to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>Africa</hi> to himself; advising also, that he
might be speedily recalled thence. At the same
time, he admonisheth <hi>Boniface</hi> by Letters, that
he was accused at Court, and upon that account
recalled; but bade him yet take heed of comming
back, lest he should be an enemy to his own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Boniface</hi> giving credit to these things, so far
disobeyed the Emperesses recalling him, that she
agreed with <hi>Gontarus,</hi> King of the <hi>Valid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Genseri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>us</hi> his son, then manageing the affairs
in <hi>Spain,</hi> to reduce him, if he opposed by force;
who by this occasion, possessed themselves of

<hi>Placidia</hi> permitted, that after the custom of

               <hi>Aetius</hi> being conquered, he was commanded to
avoid the Court.</p>
            <p>9. Not unlike to this was the subtilty and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of <hi>Samonas,</hi> who being deerly beloved to

wills his friends to admonish him by Letters, that
he should beware of <hi>Hymerius;</hi> who came with
an intention to accuse him (exoculation, and

in that age, wherewith principall men, and those
whose power they thought fit to abate and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
were afflicted and chastised) <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Castell. This hindered not <hi>Samonas</hi> to exaggerate
and heape up businesse against him to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and by his perswasions, an army is sent,
which drives <hi>Andronicus</hi> together with the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi>
from the confines of the Empire.</p>
            <p>10. We have a little before (Chap. 27. <hi>Numb
10)</hi> made mention of <hi>Arbetius.</hi> It seemes worth
observation how he superaddeth Treachery upon
treachery. When he sees that <hi>Constantius</hi> was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with <hi>Silvanus,</hi> and doubted least he coming to
Rome, should obliterate and wipe off the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
objected against him, he takes care that
the Emperours Letters (by which he calls <hi>Silvanus</hi>
unto him) might be committed to the charge of
one <hi>Apodemius.</hi> He coming into France, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93484:55"/>
suppressing the Letters, tells him that he was in
very imminent danger. Here upon <hi>Silvanus</hi> moving
sedition as a remedy and cure of his owne safety,
imprudently and unawares verified the Calumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>11. But truly we have too long been silent
concerning <hi>Sejanus;</hi> who, as he was wonderfully
crafty in all things, so was he not unaccustomed
to this Art whereof we now treate. That he might
render <hi>Agrippina</hi> the more suspected to <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
he suborneth his friends, that they might puff up
and increase her hopes beyond what was lawfull.
Her neighbours also are provoked and inticed, to
stimulate and prick forward the haughty and
smelling spirits of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> by depraved and
stubborne words and speeches. Himselfe being the
Engineere and contriver of the plot, <hi>Claudia Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chra</hi>
Neice to <hi>Agrippina</hi> is accused and slandered;
to the end that <hi>Agrippina</hi> complaining hereof,
and being a woman, hot and fell, ill able to beare
a discontentment, might the more vehemently
and sharply touch and gaule the suspicious mind
of the Emperour.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Sejanus,</hi> not herewith satisfied, strikes higher
and harder at the discontented and improvident
Lady: and having suborned some, who in shew of
friendship should admonish her, that there was
an intent to poyson her; and that therefore, she
should shun to eate of the Banquet which <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
her father in law had invited her to; She (unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
credulous and rash of beliefe), when <hi>Tiberius</hi>
offered her an Apple, withdrew her hand, and
thereby very much offended him.</p>
            <p>13. He also, (when there was appointed unto
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93484:55"/>
               <hi>Agrippina</hi> and her sons a Scout-souldier to lye
perdue, and to watch and observe their actions),
instructed and suborned some to admonish her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that she should fly to the Armyes of <hi>Germany;</hi> or
else lay hold on the effigies and pourtraiture of
<hi>Augustus,</hi> in the most frequented place of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and also should invoke the aide and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Senate and people of Rome.</p>
            <p>14. Moreover, by what kind of wickednesse he
also circumvented his Client <hi>Titius Sabinus,</hi> that
he might render him altogether suspected of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to <hi>Tiberius;</hi> is to be read in the very His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
Which being no lesse abominable, then
worthy your remembrance; t'will not be irksome
to thee Reader, that we have here run it over, in
the very words of the worthy Historian, which
are extant in the fourth Book of his Annals.</p>

            <p>3. This discourse brings us occasionally to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93484:56"/>
other way and means, by which we told you,
that Calumnies and false accusations come to
have the resemblance of truth: and this consists in
the supposition, and pretence of forged and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Letters; And yet, this mode, and way
could not so preserve and maintain it self, but
that at length it vanished and came to nought,
although it hath ever had the greatest force, to
cause suspition to take the deeper impression in
the mind of a Prince, and to alienate and estrange
his will; which thing being considered, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
accused fearing worse matters, have either
spontaneously quitted their imployments; or else
after the Calumny has been accepted and taken
for granted, having attempted and set upon those
very villaines, have added to and encreased such
detraction: which is verified a little before by the
Example of <hi>Silvanus, Chap. 28. Num.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>4. The perfidiousnesse and treachery of false
witnesses, is a main and Principall ground, and
prop for Calumnies and slanders, and such as they
chiefly have need of, who accuse any one of high
Treason, in betraying their Prince and Soveraign,
whose domesticks are in this case most preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>5. In the reign of <hi>Arcadius, Eutropius</hi> conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
against <hi>Timasius</hi> an old Sword-man and
of approved Authority, corrupted <hi>Bargus</hi> his
Client, (or rather his most intimate familiar) with
flattery and gifts, to accuse <hi>Timasius</hi> of affecting
the Empire. <hi>Bargus</hi> puts his faith and credit
out to use to the accuser <hi>Eutropius</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
because there having been such a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between him and <hi>Timasius,</hi> he could not be

thought or believed to accuse of any such crime
one so well deserving at his hands, unlesse
he were most certaine of the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>6. They adde moreover to the probation of
the crime, feigned and forged Letters. By this

            </argument>
            <p>VVE have said before, that the affection of
the Prince towards the Calumniator,
makes very much to confirme and strengthen the
Calumny. This was throughly noted in <hi>Seja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:93484:57"/>
who endeavouring to bring <hi>Agrippina</hi> the
widow of <hi>Germanicus</hi> under suspition with <hi>Livia
Augusta,</hi> chose <hi>Julius Posthumus</hi> for his turne: for
he, by the Adultery and forgery of <hi>Mutilia Prisca,</hi>
was one of <hi>Livias</hi> intimate ones, and very fit for
<hi>Sejanus</hi> his Counsels, but <hi>Prisca</hi> was very great in
the opinion of <hi>Augusta.</hi> They are the words of
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> in his fourth book.</p>
            <p>2. But the snares and guiles of Calumnies have
a more compendious, and short procedure and
determination, if the party slandered have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been any whit suspected by the Prince.
For then the Calumniator, may not onely thereby
suppresse the other, but advance himselfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</p>
            <p>3. The familiars and friends of <hi>Aulus Vitellius,</hi>
would not set upon <hi>Junius Blesus,</hi> before such
time as they perceived <hi>Vitellius</hi> his benevolence
and friendship towards him, begin to waxe stale;
and do the sooner obtain their desire, because
<hi>Vitellius</hi> his brother <hi>Lucius</hi> accommodates them
with his aid in the accusation. <hi>Hist.</hi> Book the

as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith in the 13th of his <hi>Annals,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and Age having been taught in the
Princes family, even from the time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
thought, that the best way, and remedy for him
to conserve and keep the favour of the Prince,
was, to accuse <hi>Cornelius Sylla,</hi> whom <hi>Nero</hi> had a
good while before suspected. The like Art <hi>Tigel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>
useth against the same <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Plautus.</hi>
Whereof <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the 14th of his Annals saith

his evill arts in which only he excelled,

adventurous and saucy, and a Counterfeiter
of sloath and negligence, while he may find a

               <p>The Art of Calumniators and the chiefe meanes of
detracting; To accuse one of a speech which in it
self is true but fould, and not spoken by the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;

                  </gap>ew of relating the words of others,
to reprove the evill actions of the Prince without
punishment or danger.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THey who accuse another to have spoken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
of the Prince, by how much they draw
and heap up more evill words from those which
are true, by so much the easie wil their accusations
find credit and belief.</p>
            <p>2. This evidently appeares in the example of
<hi>Granius Marcellus</hi> whom (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith in the
1 book of his <hi>Annals) Coepio Crispinus</hi> accused to
have uttered some sinister and unhappy words
touching <hi>Tiberius,</hi> a crime inevitable, fith that
the accuser chooseth something of the Prince's
vicious actions, and objecteth them to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused's
charge to have spoken of. For because
they were true, therefore were they believed to
have been spoken by him.</p>
            <p>3. Many Calumniators having followed this
Example have upbraided and twitted the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
with their faults, by a shew of relating other
mens speches, without reproof. This alone,
in a manner moved them, to be very sparing in
giving ear to false accusers.</p>
            <p>4. And truly <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as he was a hater of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93484:59"/>
so was he a lover of calumnies
and accusations; and lest he should hear
the one, when he was present in the Senate,
and that the other might not be omitted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to <hi>Caprea,</hi> believing (as the Historian
saith) it was fit for him to shun the assembly of
his Councills, and their votes,, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
while he was present with them, were grave
and weighty. <hi>Annal. Book</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>5. This way of upbraiding Princes, with their
vicious actions, did they use, who translating by
checks and taunts the Matricide of <hi>Nero,</hi> accuse
others of the same crime, before <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was
the author thereof, with a desire rather of rebuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and discommending the wickednesse, then of
destroying the party accused.</p>
            <p>6. These are the most usuall wayes and modes
which calumniators use; for who can enumerate
them all? Calumny is a Monster, which hath a
thousand figures and shapes, a thousand crafts and
cunning deceits.</p>

               <p>Of the wiles and subtleties of Court-commendations,

The inward intention and disposition of such,
as commend or dispraise us, is to be looked into.
The third way and means, by which one Courtier
oppresseth and grieveth another, viz. Power and
Force.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FRom Calumnies, let us come to Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
there is use made likewise of these
in Courts, (as we have said) to suppresse and pul
down others; the most here do palliate and cloak
their odium, envy, and emulation, that so they
may the more easily deceive and frustrate.</p>
            <p>2. Thus did <hi>Fabius Valens</hi> scandalize <hi>Mantius
Valens,</hi> by secret criminations, without his
knowledge or mistrust; and that he might be the
lesse aware of his deceits, would openly commend
him. <hi>Tacitus Hist.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>3. So did <hi>Eusebius</hi> the Eunuch, impugne and
overcome <hi>Ursicinus,</hi> by the inticeing allurements
of immense and huge bounty and largesse, and
did often openly call him, a stout and valiant
man; being very crafty and cunning, to intangle
and insnare the simple man, in his poysonous
and deathfull intrapments; and in that season
too powerful, as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> reports.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Alfonsus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> when a certain
person had before him commended another,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93484:60"/>
(besides his accustomed wont and manner) tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
about to his friend, <hi>Iste exitium haud dubie
ei, quem laudat, meditatur,</hi> That man doubtlesse
means ruine to him, whom he thus commendeth.
Nor was the King mistaken in this opinion;
for about six months after, he that so highly had
commended, impleads and sues the other at Law,
and had overthrown him, had not the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Mucianus,</hi> when he could not oppresse <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>
the first, openly loadeth him with much
commendations in the Senate, and secret promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
shewing and boasting, that the nigher <hi>Spain</hi>
was vacant, by the departure of <hi>Cluvius Rufus;</hi> and
bestowes upon his friends Tribuneships and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And after he had puft up his mind with hope
and desire, remitteth and weakeneth his force
and strength, by dismissing the seventh Legion in
their winter-quarters, whose love to <hi>Antonius</hi>
was most ardent. <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the 4 th. Book of his

            <p>6. Neither do Courtiers onely, but even Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
when they desire to di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inish and pull down
some, take this way and road. <hi>Tiberius</hi> (having
<hi>Libo</hi> under secret suspect and envy) advanceth
him to the Pretorship, and feafteth him often,
not being estranged in countenance, not moved
in language, and so conceals his anger, as <hi>Tacitus</hi>
saith, in the second Book of his Annalls. By the
same Art, he also overthrew <hi>Sejanus. Domition</hi>
was never more to be feared, then when in his
countenance he made shew of courtesie. <hi>Nicetas</hi>
was wont to call the commendations of <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the beginnings of an injury; his liberality,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93484:60"/>
a token of confiscation of goods; his lenity, the
forerunner of death.</p>
            <p>7. Some, in commending others, have this
reach, that thereby they may kindle the Prince's
hate against them. By this means, was <hi>Julius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola</hi>
suppressed by <hi>Domitian;</hi> whereupon, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
writing of <hi>Agricola,</hi> saith thus; The cause
of his danger, was not any crime or complaint
of hurting any body, but the Prince's being
displeased at his vertues, and the glory of the man,
and withall (that worst sort of friends) such as
commend and applaud.</p>

                  </gap>ian</hi> the Emperour had a saying, <hi>Nullos

There are none more capital and deadly enemies,
then masked and vizarded Courtiers, such as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius,</hi>
and, after him, <hi>Mamertinus</hi> describes; who,
in a Panegyrick, and flattering speech, speaks
thus: <hi>Callido artificio accusatoriam dicacitatem lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum

            <p>9. But we may then discover those commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations

<hi>Plutarch</hi> objects to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> when he
saies, that the Athenians were commended by
him, as valiantly retunding and repressing the
Persians Armies; not with a desire to extoll the
Athenians, but to disgrace and defame the others,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:93484:61"/>
10. It is usuall with Kings, as <hi>Seneca</hi> testifieth,
to commend their ministers and servants, who
are deceased, that so they may shame such as are
living. Thus did <hi>Augustus</hi> advance and set forth,
the faithfull duty and services of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> and
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> when having openly manifested the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualities
of their daughters, he would reprehend
his familiars and friends, as carelesse and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of their Prince's businesse and fame.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Augustus</hi> beats <hi>Tiberius</hi> black and blew,
by commending and excusing him; whereof <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
writing in the first Book of his Annals, saith
thus, <hi>Augustus</hi> a few years before, had required
of the State and Councill, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> should
have the power of a Tribune, although in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Oration, he had yet cast out something,
touching his habit and attire, and his institutions
and purposes; all which, as seeming to excuse,
he upbraids and casts in his teeth.</p>
            <p>12. These things therefore should admonish
us, that we endeavour to look into the inward
intents, and dispositions of such, as either praise
or reproach us.</p>
            <p>13. We told you, that the last way and means,
by which Courtiers are oppressed by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
is, Force and Strength, which then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
takes place, when either People or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery,
being offended at our dignity or manners,
stir up sedition.</p>
            <p>14. 'Tis not unknown, what tumults were
amongst the Parisians, how they were heated
therewith, when <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> was taken

those unknown, who, when his son was Vice-Roy,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93484:61"/>
held the principall offices and dignities in
the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>15. Not many years since, the seditions of the
Janizaries, swept away Ministers of chief autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
from the Turkish Emperours. The times of
<hi>Arcadius</hi> the Emperour, will afford us some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
hereof, from the most antient Histories.
<hi>Ruffinus</hi> was very neer and deer (amongst the

For <hi>Ruffinus</hi> being gone forth with the

by giving a signall, compassed him about, and
tore him in pieces. <hi>Eutropius</hi> being substituted

guarded on all hands, happen upon a Prince,
whose Genius is vain, distrustfull, envious, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
cruell, or timidous, which proves to
their inevitable ruine. These diseases, as planted in
Nature, do mostly what delude the circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the most prudent. <hi>Seneca,</hi> owing much to his
liberty with <hi>Nero,</hi> but little to his service, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
prudent, and not uncrafty in Courtly
Arts; yet being overcome, as it were, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the Prince's genius and disposition, yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at last. He first incurs his envy by his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and wealth; and afterwards falling under
calumny and false accusations, was bereft of the
Prince's favour, and his own life together.</p>
            <p>2. The diffidence and envy of Princes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
some, hath be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had rather suffer a diminution and abatement
of their own emoluments, and profits, then be
highly active, with their Prince's envy and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</p>

Antony,</hi> (by whose Authority he waged warr;)
was content to have repelled the <hi>Parthians</hi> in
three severall battells even to <hi>Media,</hi> yet would
not prosecute the victory.</p>
            <p>4. The same thing did <hi>Bellisarius,</hi> when <hi>Justinian</hi>
was Emperour, as <hi>Agathias</hi> sayes; when in like
manner he feared, least the greatnesse of the
victory, and applause of the people, should stirre
up the hatred of the Nobles and afterwards of the
Prince.</p>
            <p>5. Such as these, neither provide rightly for the
utility and advantage of the Prince; nor their
owne honours. But the fault neverthelesse is not
in them so much, as in him that rules; and for
this cause <hi>Mercoenas</hi> perswades <hi>Augustus,</hi> that he
should neither impute sinister Events to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor successefull to Himselfe. For (saies he)
many of those who handle publique affaires, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be envyed by the Prince, have more neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
acted in their Imployment; chusing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to run the hazard of Glory, then safety.</p>
            <p>6. Their course notwithstanding, seems best in
my approbation; who, to avoid Envy, whatsoever
notable Enterprize they publish and set forth, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the glory thereof to the Prince, though
absent at the time of the action.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Agrippa</hi> the son in law of <hi>Augustus,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth
those who take in hand great matters, to
attribute the thing accomplished to the Prince;
and himselfe did often so. Thus <hi>Joab</hi> when he
had besiged <hi>Rabbath</hi> and could have subdued it,
would not before <hi>David</hi> himselfe was come; <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi>
when the warr was to be composed, with
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93484:63"/>
               <hi>Artacena;</hi> waited for the presence of <hi>Alexander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Julius Agricola,</hi> as <hi>Tacaus</hi> reports, never trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
for any Actions to his owne fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne,
but referred the fortune to the Author,
and Generall, looking on himselfe, but as a Minister
and instrument.</p>
            <p>8. This same Envy and Emulation, (for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
though divers are heere the like in effect;)
let it be that they are diseases, yet have they been
common and familiar to the most generous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
such as were <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Alexander;</hi> and do
more strongly blast some, then others.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Theodosius</hi> the second of that name, had dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
and appointed the care of those Seas, which
flowed up to Constantinople, to <hi>Syrus</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
and walled in; which worke when he had
effected in sixty dayes, this Celerity and speedy
dispatch was so gratefull to the people; that they
cryed out on all sides, that the City was built by
<hi>Constantine,</hi> but renewed by <hi>Cyrus.</hi> This being
heard of the Emperour, stirr'd up such Envy in
him, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> to expiate it, was necessitated to
put on the hood.</p>
            <p>10. He that hath to do with such dispositions,
may think that he walkes upon the hot imbers;
and therefore ought with all diligence so to act,
as that he may diligently search out their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
that so he may guard himselfe against
them, or if that may not be done; he may at least
be conscious to himselfe, of having not omitted
his duty and office.</p>

true friend in Court, is <hi>Rara avis</hi> seldome found.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. HE may worthily be reckoned amongst the
happy ones, and as it were the Chickens
of fortune; whose Authority with the Prince from
whom he had his beginning, remaines in the same
height and loftinesse with his Successor. This is
rare in Courts, because he who presumeth to be
next; by retaining his office, is for the most part
suspected to those that rule; and being so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in this place, they are very often necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to crosse and thwart such persons which yeelds
most frequent seed to deadly feuds and hatred.</p>
            <p>2. And besides this, the successor of a Prince
hath mostly his owne Ministers and Servants, well
known to him by their long and faithfull service
and imployments, to whom that they may make
way to dignities and honours, he will pull down
the Clients and retainers of the deceased, either
freely or by perswasion to give place to others,
that are petitioners.</p>
            <p>3. There are yet some, whom either the matter
of their imployments for which they are apter then

Clothes cast upon him, as sayeth <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his

by him, although he hated him for his pride, and
for his contentious and turbulent spirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him to be necessary to him. Afterwards
<hi>Valentinian</hi> calls the same <hi>Arbetio</hi> to Court of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

<hi>Procopius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. We have shewne hitherto, what a Courtier
is to shun and avoid, who would enjoy the grace
and favour of his Prince. The head and chief of all
Counsells, which can in this place be given a
Courtier, is, Modesty towards the Prince; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
himselfe not in himselfe, nor comparing
himselfe with himselfe; not framing himself I say,
by the Modul of fortune, but of his own duty,
acting nothing boastingly and in a bravadoe, noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
irreverently, avoyding Envy (as much as is
possible). A thing so formidable to many worthies
and ancient Grandees; that many (pretending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitnesse,
or other inability to mannage them);
others (betaking themselves to their books,)
have with drawne and estranged themselves from
the publique Negotiations, as one, whereof His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians
make mention, of <hi>Domitian;</hi> as the other,
of <hi>Galba.</hi>

6. First we will carefully transmit, and passe
over those Commendations of Malevolent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the Calumnies; of which we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
spoken.</p>
            <p>7. They who slander us, or say, that there is
wanting in us some of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hings which are
requisite to the well serving of a Prince; and
affirme that we have spoken something amisse,
and with intention to offend; or else have by Act,
hurt and injured some body.</p>
            <p>8. The fault which is objected against us, is
either to be excused, or amended; or else expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and purged by the operation of other vertues.
As also all our words and deeds are so to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated,
that they become not obnoxious to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
interpretations and constructions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the mind of another, is first to be scrued and
searched into; before we disclose our owne. But
if through carelesnesse, somewhat may fall from
us, that may be offensive, we must shew, and
evidence to them; (either by some good office to
be performed for them, or by casting in some
smooth and handsome interpretation, by other
words and speeches), that we had no mind to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them in our discourse.</p>
            <p>9. If we have cognizance that we are calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninated,
it will be advisedly and wisely done of
us; to be as little absent, and at distance from the
party, to whom we are accused, as possible may
be. For besides this, that affection towards such
as are absent freezeth in time; the reproach and
slander, unlesse maturely aud timously repelled,
and foiled by the aide of verity and truth, will
more easily find place; which (the course being
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93484:65"/>
turned, and a doubt speedily injected), will flagg
and wither: but by delay, and none contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

may hate the party accused, before he inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Crime.</p>
            <p>10. He therefore that will be rightly advised
herein, shall procure himselfe one, or more
friends; who in his absence may defend him from
the assaults of Slander: but be sure they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of honour; and such, as to whose defen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Prince may no lesse give eare, then to the

there is great sterility and barrenne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se at
Court: where it is mostly usuall amongst all,
either to oppresse their fellowes; or suffer them
to be oppressed. Yet it happens sometimes that
there may be one, who by benefits received from
us; or by desire to oblige us to them; or lastly
out of hate to the Accuser; may be moved and
perswaded to such a good turne.</p>

               <p>How much Ostentation is to be avoided by a Courtier

            </argument>
            <p>A Courtier should not only shun Ostentation
and boasting of his Prince's favour, that so he
may avoid the Envy of Compeers and equalls (of
which we have spoken <hi>Chap. 19.)</hi> but that of the
Prince also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>2. When on a time the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nobility in the
Raign of <hi>Philip</hi> the second, went about to root
out and overthrow Cardinall <hi>Spinosa,</hi> see how
they go about to undermine him: they all lay down
their Mases and Offices at his foot, they all feigne
and profess that he is the Hinge upon which
their fortunes depend. The Prince's domestick
Ministers and servants offer themselves ready at
his beck. When the King gets intelligence hereof
he is removed from Court; and within two years
decayes, what ever the loftie structure of power
were, that he had built to himself.</p>
            <p>3. Let a Courtier therefore learn to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with a small retinue and train, to keep his
station, and subsist with that dignity wherewith
the Prince hath adorned him, and rather below his
degree; but let him never transgresse his bounds.
Its unseasonable to diminish and curtaile ones
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93484:66"/>
train onely in a declining Fortune. 'Twas no
boot to <hi>Seneca</hi> after he had left <hi>Neroe's</hi> favour
to betake himself to a private Cottage, and to
have composed and built up to himself a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
of studies, and under pretence of unhealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to deny entrance to visitors; nor did it any
thing ease the mind of <hi>Agricola,</hi> by night, and
with slender attendance, to walke about the
City.</p>
            <p>4. It behoveth very much that a man do ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
compose and module himself to tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and moderation.</p>
            <p>5. Yet although we would not have you be
surround with the noise and rout of many suitors
&amp; attenders; nevertheless would we not have you
neglect to make many your Clients and retainers:
not such as should serve for your pomp and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity;
but such, as, if any dysaster should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
thee, may either restore and renew, or at least
refresh and comfort thee.</p>
            <p>6. For though sinister and unhappy Fortune
hath found but few such friends, yet hath it most
found some, who if they cannot eye friendship
yet may they for their own benefit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
have respect to somthing tending to the
conserving and preservation of thy For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>Comforts in adverse fortune. The benefits of Princes
are to be dispensed warily: His favour is not to be
too much divided amongst others. By what means
one may intercede for others. Favour is not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to be boasted of. The free arbitrement of Princes
in acting. What commands of his are to be obeyed &amp;
dispatched. The reason of a Princes dresse and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuousnesse.
How we are to deale with one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
to us of being offended and hurt by the Prince.
Of the Court houshold service. What is the most
especiall part and Office of Courtly wisdome.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUt yet, as it is a great Comfort and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in adverse fortune, to have communicated
with others in our prosperity, and to have used
the favour of the Prince to lift up and advance
others: so is a Courtier also to be admonished
that he dispense and bestow those benefits wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For it is most certain, that whatever the
Prince hath conferred on another at our request
is in a great measure to be imputed to us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his grace and favour, unlesse it be very great
towards us, is not to be too much divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
others; and very seldome are others who
are not after some sort knowne to the prince, to
be recomended unto him. That of <hi>Horace</hi> is to be
observed.</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:93484:67"/>
            <q>
               <l>Qualem commendes, etiam atque etiam adspice:
ne mox</l>
               <l>Incutiant aliena tibi peccata pudorem.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Englished thus,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Such as in friendly wise thou wouldst commend,</l>
               <l>Be sure thou try them as thou wouldst thy friend.</l>
               <l>Lest by their faults thy self should get disgrace;</l>
               <l>By their reproof a blush light on thy face.</l>
            </q>
            <p>2. If we desire to beg a Boon of the Prince let
our request be just, and accommodated and fitted
to time; conjoyned likewise with the dignity
and Emolument and advantage of the Prince,
and such as the like hath been obtained by many
others. If the Prince signifieth his consent, let
us manifestly evidence that we accept it as a very
great benefit and bounty; if he refuse, we must
be very carefull, that we give him not cause
to think that we are discontented.</p>
            <p>3. Here also must we observe that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Chap. 35. Num.</hi> 1. we admonished, that we do
not ambitiously ostentate and boast of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
favour, as if we had him obnoxious to our
Commands, which some having done have ill
succeeded as we shewed. What ever Princes
act, they desire to seem to act it, by their own
free Arbitrement and will, without the addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and props, or Authority of others, especially
of their subjects.</p>
            <p>4. If the Prince give us in Command any thing
hard and perilous, lets endeavour to have it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93484:67"/>
in writing, and if possible to be most
accurately and exquisitely gathered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
if any difficulties occur in executing them,
let us ripen them, and before we betake us to the
Province and place appoynted to execute them
in, let us not omit or neglect to unfold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
them, if the matters be not sit to be written
and be to be committed to us in secret, we are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to iterate and repeat them over in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
that we may more throughly understand
the mind of the Commander, and he may see, that
his Authority in the things which we act, is not
denyed.</p>
            <p>5. That which remains, is, We ought to shew
our promptitude and readinesse to do, even the
meanest offices the Prince Commands us to. A
small matter ofttimes opens a way to a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
and Princes will have their Commands to
be estimated, not by the weight and ponderosity
of the things commanded, but by the magnitude
and greatnesse of their own fortune: and therefore
are not lesse offended at our abandoning and
disdaining of their lesse and easie Commands, than
of the hardships and hazards they expose us to, by
their imployment.</p>
            <p>6. When we are neer the Prince, we ought assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duously
to watch that we be not overrun with
suddain and unexpected commands, or taken
tardy in doing something besides our businesse
and imployment. To this purpose, let us (as
much as may be) observe and preoccupate in our
mind, the things which are incumbent on us, and
prepare our thoughts to every thing which falls
into agitation, and that we speak not many things
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93484:68"/>
to the Prince, nor any thing that we do not well
know and understand. When the Prince speaks, let
us be intent, and not minding other matters, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let us appear sad, and full of thoughts, lest
we seem, either not to hear, or by a carelesse hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
to transmit and passe over slightly his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>7. If any one that is grieved by the Prince shall
come to us and complain of his fortune; let us
shew, that we pitty his case, and perswade him to
silence and patience: let us also raise him up to
hope well, extenuating the Injury done to him,
and excusing the Prince. But we must act very
circumspectly with such; for there are some who
feigne themselves injured, that so they may pump
and draw up something from us, which may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
a sinister and evill will in us, towards the
Prince, and may thereby find occasion to oppress
us. Others are <hi>(re vera)</hi> and in truth grieved
and hurt, yet oftentimes being imprudent and
silly, and carried away by affection and selfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
do not conceale those things which are
communicated to them in secret trust.</p>
            <p>8. If it be our fortune to have the charge of a
family, we ought to keep our servants also from
speaking more freely against the Prince, or such as
are by affection and love chiefly endeered to him;
for the fault of a houshold servant is of times
tranferred upon the Master.</p>
            <p>9. This is amongst the choisest parts and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Courtly wisdom, <hi>viz.</hi> to be able sagaciously
and prudently to resent the Princes affection,
when either changed, or but luke-warm towards
us. If any such thing should happen, it is gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93484:68"/>
and sweetly to be dissolved and untyed as the

               <p>A judgment touching the Constancy and mutations
and changes of Princely love and Benevolence.
Felicity inexplicable and intricate; The Court starr.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat a Courtier may rightly judge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and permanency of the Prince's good
will, towards him, it is not enough that he be
knowing of the Princes Genius and disposition,
and the Authority and power both of his friends
and foes; he ought first throughly to weigh and
consider the cause, which enkindled this love of
the Prince towards him. For if that which was
the cause should cease in us, or be found more
valid and strong in another; doubtlesse the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
affection towards us, will altogether cool;
or at least be lessened.</p>
            <p>2. It's sometimes difficult to divine, what the
cause is for which thou art beloved; and as <hi>Auso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
sayes, This is a felicity, the reason whereof we
cannot render. But ordinarily, this love of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ariseth, either from a similitude and likeness
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93484:69"/>
of disposition; or from the grace and comelinesse
of our deportment and behaviour, or from some
duty and offices performed; or some other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and aptitude to obey their will.</p>
            <p>3. That love, which that externall and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
grace and likenesse of manners produceth;
although it seeme most firme and stable, doth
soonest of all wax old and decay; both because as
we have said, the Genius and inclinations of men
is changed according to age, and the variety and
change of intervening and accidentall affaires;
and also for that it is a rare thing for two such like
dispositions to be found, which may not in some
thing differ and disagree. Oftimes also, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thing which they have, is more prevalent to
discord and division, then the things wherein they
resemble each other, are to Concord and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>4. Notwithstanding, I know not what starre or
constellation, by an unusuall manner and way,
doth so attemperate and season some men to the
Prince; that he can not easily in any thing depart
from, nor leave such a ones fashions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.
And these are they, (I deny not) who
reape a plentifull crop of good things before all
others; especially if they know how, wittily and
trimly to serve the time; and before a Tempest to
furl up their sailes.</p>

            <argument>
               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>The love of Princes towards women. The paramours of
Princes. Presents bestowed on Princes, are easily
envyed. The condition of well deserving men in
Court. The affections of some Princes towards such
men. The reason why Rewards and Largesses are
given and appointed for the undertaking of business<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the love of Princes towards such as minister to their
volupties and delights.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WIth this kind of love, Princes are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
affected to Women; and that by so
much the more, as they are prone to venerious
volupties and pleasures.</p>
            <p>2. From the same neverthelesse do these fail
away and decline; if not by their owne fault, yet
at least by the satiety of the party loving, or by
the sight of a better Love or Mistresse: whereby it
cometh to passe, that they become more crafty
and guilefull; who endeavour to divert the
Prince from all familiarity and converse with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
especially with such, who seem fit and able
to bend the Prince's mind another way. Some by
feigned and counterfit disdaine, have kept them
loving and kind to them. Others being more
audacious, have ungirt and unbuckled those
whom they perceive to be more obliged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to them by Luxury and carnall pleasures
and delights.</p>
            <p>3. This art used <hi>Poppaea</hi> to <hi>Nero;</hi> of which yee
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93484:70"/>
may see, in the words of the prince of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
in the 14. th of his Annals.</p>
            <p>4. The female friends of Princes have oftimes
more easily obliged some to them, after this mode
and way then by flatteries or pleasures. But, there
is no constancy (as we have said) in this kind of
Love.</p>
            <p>5. It were more convenient and agreeable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that the love which thou hast, (as it were)
hatched to thee and bred by services; should be
more stable and firme, as that which is sprung
from a more honest Cause; and fitter to allure
and intice others, to the like offices and duties.</p>
            <p>6. Yet very often, doth experience teach us
the contrary; many times the chief benefits in
Court are envyed, and those whose turne and
office they cannot requite; they oft revenge
with hatred.</p>
            <p>7. Such are not willing to be indebted to any
man, much lesse to a subject. They shun, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
not, that deserving men should see them; as
those who should upbraid their ingratitude,
which is the cause that their condition, in Court,
is most miserable; for, when by some office and
service they have merited from the Prince, they
are forthwith constrained by shamefacednesse,
not to require their reward; and seeme by feare,
not to have given, but sold their advantage and
benefit. Princes, in the interim being careless of
benefits and good turnes, and very sloathfull as to
compensations and recompences, procrastinate
and put off from day to day; untill the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the benefits wither and fade away from
the minds of those, who are conscious and privy
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93484:70"/>
to them, who before feared some secret taunts and
reproaches.</p>
            <p>8. Some understanding thus much, have thought
it good to strike (as they say) while the Iron's
hot; (that is to say) when they have known them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
destinated and appoynted to some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
businesse; before they would undertake it,
have had an eye to the reward, knowing that the
hope of receiving an Office, is more strong and
vali'd with Princes, then the Hopes of a reward;
that it is better to be obliged to Rulers, then to
oblige them; because whom they oblige, they
think should be benevolous and bear them good-will;
he who hath obliged them, (because he may
be thought not to love the Prince, who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him his recompence and reward) shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with odium and hatred, insteed of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.
This was the judgement and opinion
of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11th, as <hi>Comineus</hi> reports.</p>
            <p>9. Love towards those who Minister aid and
assistance to the Prince's volupty, and are obedient
thereto, seems fit to be more stable, and is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
so long as the Prince is constant to his own
inclinations: But (they being changed) such as
administer to them, are also changed; sometimes
also the Prince, becomming conscientious of what
is honest, abominates and casts away the Ministers
together with the vice.</p>
            <p>10. Moreover as the inclinations of the Prince
are some more durable and lasting then others;
so also the favour which we have spoken of to
such as administer to them, will be alterable and
unconstant.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>I Shall not here meddle with all the volupties
to which a Prince's natures are prone, because
they are not all such, as upon which the heighth
of Court-fortune can be superstructed and built.
There is a three fold kind of them, too common
and familiar with Princes which I will rehearse
<hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. Veneriall Love, as it is mostly vehementer
then the rest, so is it the more unconstanter; which
although it may last in him, yet will he not long
love and like one and the same party; and though
he may not change the subject, yet (to use the
Scholastick terme) he will change and vary the
object. Neverthelesse, very many have used
this as the basis and foundation wherein they
have reared and buil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> up their fortunes, not stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prostitute and debauch their own wives
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93484:71"/>
that they might attain the Prince's favour. As
we read in <hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Ortho</hi> did, yet this succeeded not so, as to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
him: for <hi>Nero</hi> removed him from Court, lest
he should have a Rival neer him.</p>
            <p>3. Others, that they might oblige the Prince,
have associated themselves with him, and been
contented to be witnesses and ministers of his
misdeeds and lust. An example whereof was <hi>Tigel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus.</hi>
Annal. 14th. These consider not, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
scrupple not to sacrifice such men at length
to publique envy, to free themselves there from.
Such servants of Lust may expect the same which
<hi>Remirus d'Orco</hi> (that Minister of Cruelties to
<hi>Caesar Borgia)</hi> experienced, whom <hi>Borgia</hi> at length
commanded to be put to death, as the persor
guilty of all those things, which himself had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
acted and done.</p>
            <p>4. And by this example of <hi>Remirus</hi> we may learn
their fate and destiny, who lend their aid to the
cruelty of a Prince. Seldome is the Princes
affection towards such, long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lived; both because
he afterwards reads his own vices in them,
and also, because he is afraid himself of them,
whom he perceives and find so apt for villany.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Nero</hi> although of a cruell disposition, and an
old and crafty Polititian, after his mother was
slaine hated <hi>Anicetus,</hi> whom he perceived to have
upbraided him with his Matricide.</p>
            <p>6. But least of all, is that affection of covetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
mutable. The diversity of object changes
not that, as it doth Love; it is not lessened and
impaired with age, but increased; and although it
be equally and alike hatefull to the people as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93484:72"/>
Cruelty is, yet is longer indured; because exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have commonly a pretext of publique ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and honest parsimony, and likewise a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and shew of common utility. Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they who are Ministers herein, may seem lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be sheltred by the Prince's amity, whiles
that they (which is rare in such kind of men) be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
froward, nor testy and difficult, nor too gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of wealth and gain.</p>
            <p>7. Morosity, which for the most part is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious
and reproachfull, procures odium and
envy both to the party, and to the Governour and
Ruler of a people. The Author whereof the Prince
at length will reject and cast off, that so he may
remove the envy from himself. Riches are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to envy, not only of the multitude, but
sometimes of the Prince himselfe; who, if truly
covetous, will seldome be contented to have
wrung out and squeezed the full sponge, which
(as we read) <hi>Vespatian</hi> was wont to do, but will
imitate the Peasants and Rustick people, who
at last devoure and eat up those swine, which they
have formerly cramm'd and fatted.</p>
            <p>8. Certes, the Kingdome of France hath seen
many such, who being rough and sharp beyond
measure, or too hasty to enrich themselves, when
they have acted too insolently, after a great and
lofty fortune, have been brought to perdition
and ruine.</p>
            <p>9. In the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the faire, one <hi>Peter

at <hi>Paris. Lewis</hi> the son of <hi>Philip</hi> having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

memory, meane while the examples produced
do sufficiently instruct, that the facility of such
kind of Ministers brings too much detriment
and hurt to the Princes utility; but their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency,

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>Aptitude and fitnesse for businesse in a Courtier, is the
ultimate cause of Princely grace and favour.
What consideration is to be had therein, to wisdome
and glory. The weakenesse of Courtly power. Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne
Counsell, for such as act highly. A Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
of a sedate and quiet life, and of the Author's
wish.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe last of the causes, for which Courtiers are
beloved of the Prince, now remaines; which
in the 37.th Chap. <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. we told you, was
aptnesse and expeditiousnesse in doing the Prince's
businesse; which when we have observed to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the Prince, we must also mark, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no it be therefore pleasant and taken in
good part, because necessary; or because the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's
desire provoked him, to such an aptitude. If
acceptable because necessary, the love will endure
so long as the necessity lasteth; neverthelesse it
will be rather a forced, then a voluntary and free
love.</p>
            <p>2. If the Prince aspire the glory of this kind of
aptitude, we may not doubt, but that they who
in this shall exceed him; will in time be grievous
to him. Sith that, there is an imbred desire, not
in Princes onely, but in all men, to excell all
others in the art they professe; Certes, no man
scarcely can with an equall and moderate mind
beare it, if he be surpassed by his houshold servant.</p>

3. <hi>Asinius Pollio</hi> being exhorted by some to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
and require something that <hi>Augustus</hi> had
written against him, with some verses; answered
<hi>Nolle se ejus, qui possit proscribere, scribendo incurrere
invidiam:</hi> That he would not incurre the Envy
of him by writing, in whose power it lay to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
and banish him.</p>
            <p>4. There being a controversie sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Favorinus</hi> a Philosopher, and <hi>Adrian</hi> the
Emperour, concerning some word, when the
Emperour had posed him, and his friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
it, he answered thus: <hi>Non erubesco, vinci
scientia ab illo, qui triginta Legionibus imperat:</hi> I am
not ashamed to be conquered in knowledge
by him, who hath thirty Legions at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>5. It is a known precept of wisdome <hi>Coram
Rege noli videri Sapiens:</hi> Seem not to be wise in
the presence of the King. It cannot otherwise be,
for to purchase the Prince's favour here, we ought
to desert and lose our own glory: and not only
when we have to do with words, but in every
thing we ought to submit and yield him the
Palme of victory. And to that end, it will not be
impertinent and besides the purpose, that a man
sometimes admit against himselfe somewhat
(though a little hurtfull) even by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and procurement.</p>
            <p>6. From the things hitherto discoursed on, it
appeares, of what slender stability and durableness
all kind of Court-powers are. These therefore
are the most soveraign advicements and counsels
which can be given to such as act highly and
eminently, <hi>ad descensum in arenam praparare sese:</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:93484:74"/>
to make them ready for Combat, though it be
judged more generous and couragious, to fight
him who enters the List, than to flye. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
if we must fight with more perill then
Guerdon and recompence, a man may not be
ashamed maturely to retreat, and to imitate the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> who fight as they flye.</p>
            <p>7. It is also more glorious and commendable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
descend slowly, and by gradatious and steps, then
precipitately and rashly to commit himself into
others hands, and retreat through a certain and
sure posterne, then to be thrown out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
So having found a pretence, it is lesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable,
freely and spontaneously to bid
adieu to honour, then to tarry till you be repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and removed. To this may be added the
saying of an antient Roman, <hi>Quid fatigatae felicitate
molestis es? Quid expectas donec Castris eijciaris?</hi>
why art thou troubulous to tired felicity? why
tarriest thou, till thou be removed out of the
Camp?</p>
            <p>8. 'Tis happinesse (saith <hi>Seneca)</hi> to dye in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
On the contrary, I deem him a happy
Courtier, who in the middle of felicity betakes
himself to a retirement. Peradventure he that
doth so, shall not find the like judgment from all
men in this particular, and shall seem unworthy
of his fortune, the messenger whereof he so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
turns back: but who so is prudent will not
stick at these sayings, but will rather provide for
his safety; and will call to mind, that at all Games
and pastimes which depend on fortune, 'tis better
to break off a Gainer, then a Looser; and that it is
not a wise mans part to change certainties for
hazards and doubtfull chances.</p>

9. And mostly men ascend gradually to such a
heighth of dignities; but who will not admire
to see one descend from on high, when he sees
no Staires or Ladders under him? And if so be
that by the fulgor, and brightnesse of too great
a fortune, a man be inveigled and dazelled, and one
pace or step faile him (as may easily happen to
such as live in a lofty and high condition) they
may not be said then to descend, but to fall head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
