            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Treatise is the first fruits of my
<pb facs="tcp:94568:5"/>
studies, therefore of common right sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to God; and the rather because the main subject thereof is His Day: His, by institution; His, by denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and (it being the first fruits of dayes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hexam.</hi>
               </note> as Saint Basill elegantly calleth it) of right his. Now seeing all offerings were according to Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script; First, to be brought to the high Priest, who was to examine them whether they were such as God would accept, and then to present them before the Lord. To whom sooner then to your self, Sir, should I bring this my petty oblation? It is said that Cain and Abel brought their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that is, (as most learned men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) to Adam their Father, that he might present them; why then may not I mine to you? If he was their Priest, why may not you be mine? Fathers of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies (you know) were anciently all such:
<pb facs="tcp:94568:6"/>
And though Consecration and Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath somewhat dimmed their wonted splendour, yet I hold for certain that their Priestly office neither is, nor shall be utterly extinguished. To you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sir, I hope not impertinently, I bring this my poore oblation; I know too well how strong frailty is in me, to say it is without blemish, or not lame; yet if your judgement shall conceive it a work acceptable to God, and beneficiall to his Church, I most humbly crave you would be pleased to present it to him for me. And this is the first cause of this addresse to you; The other, this:</p>

                  <hi>Phocylides.</hi>
               </note>Sir, you are my Parent, second in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God; so the wisdome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients styleth you: and certainly if any Parent may challenge honour from a Son, you may from me. To which honour you have a double title: One, wherein all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:94568:6"/>
intercommon by Generation; the other, almost peculiar to your self by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, I had almost said, Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; perhaps not altogether unfitly, for good nurture is a kind of morall Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and usually a preparative to the Spirituall. I call the Education you have bestowed upon me almost peculiar to your self, because that whereas most Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are either sordid in their allowance, or negligent in instructing, or become lewd patterns to their children; you have in breeding me failed neither in purse, nor in precept, nor in example. I write not this to flatter you, but to manifest that I set a due and just value upon this your Fatherly care, and that though there were no Divine Law to constrain me to it, yet this alone were sufficient reason for me to honour you.</p>
            <p>And if every the meanest part of my
<pb facs="tcp:94568:7"/>
education obligeth me to this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, sure your training me up to letters much more, especially in this age, when to know even Fundamentalls and necessary Truths, is accounted at least pedanticall, if not as (Saint Paul said of preaching) foolishnesse. I do not hereby arrogate to my self the name of a Scholer; for my delight in learning hath been more then my proficiencie, which God knoweth is very slender, so slender as these my simple labours dare not approach you from any assurance of their own worth, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the products of those stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which derive their originall from your extraordinary both charge and care, they think themselves of right to belong to you, and so their motion towards you is not more voluntary then naturall.</p>
            <p>Be pleased, Sir, to entertain them as testimonials of my filiall gratitude, which
<pb facs="tcp:94568:7"/>
is the chief end of this their second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to you; for they exceed their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, if they speak so much what they are themselves (though that is mere weaknesse) as what I am, that is,</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, why at all, in regard there have of late issued out Tracts homogeneall, wherein the Truth hath been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently enough demonstrated, Errour convinced? To both these I hold it requisite to give my answer, and (if I can) satisfaction: To the first then I say, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded upon these reasons especially.</p>
            <p>First, though my studies have been most conversant in Eristick Theologie, yet I delight therein more as a stander by and spectatour of others digladiations, then out of an itch to enter the lists my self, which of all things (through a desire to suppresse from publick notice my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate infirmities) my Genius most declineth. Secondly, being conscious of mine own failings, I was loth to betray so good a cause by so mean a champion as my self, and so
<q>—ipsíque oneríque timebam.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, being of a Lay condition, I held it discreet and good manners to leave the work to be performed by others who had both greater abilities, and a calling more suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it.</p>
            <p>To the second my answer is, That this Tract was not onely commenced; but (as I then <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note>I see no necessitie that the Institution, Genesis 2. must suppose it to be in Paradise, and before the fall, for it is not improbable (I determine nothing) that Adam sinned and was expelled out of Paradise the very day he was formed, as the Fathers almost universally have thought, from whose full consent in this point proceeded that Greek saying, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Neither was Paradise (in my opinion) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of any such ingredients as would in no wise incorporate with a Sabbath: it was indeed a place exempted from the works both of toil and sinne, and therefore no otium to refresh the body, no Sabbath to sanctifie the soul, in respect either of the one or the other, necessary. And though the whole tract of time spent in that innocent condition might worthily seem a continued Sabbath, yet some parts and portion even of that time should (I conceive) have been allotted to a more solemn worship then others. For God imposed upon man a calling of husbandry: should he so incessantly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94568:13"/>
have intended his tillage, as never to intermit, never to give over? should he have spared no time to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise himself in the contemplation of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, the truest object of perfect beatitude? or could he <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> at one instant, intend both his vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Gods worship?

            </p>
            <p>Besides, it is most evident out of Genesis 1.27. that Adam and Eve were both created on the sixth day; <hi>Male and female created he them,</hi> not by Prolepsis (as they fancy) but really &amp; truly upon that very day</p>

            <p>That God gave but one positive law to Adam in Paradise, is neither in it self likely, nor in respect of repugnant Scripture credible: for is it not said that God put Adam into the garden to dresse it? was not this a command? Augustine <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>De Gen. ad lit. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> holdeth clear it was so: if a command, then a law; for <hi>Lex dicitur à li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gando,</hi> A law is called a law because it bindeth<note n="c" place="margin">

If then it was a law, it must be either merely naturall, or positive; if merely naturall, then immutable, still in force, and we must all, tag and rag, turn gardiners or plowmen: if it was positive, then their Prolepsis
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94568:15"/>
halteth on that foot. Consider the Law it self, and you shall see the positive accrue to the naturall by way of superfoetation; Man must be alwayes busie, alwayes in action, there is the naturall; his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is limited to tilling of the garden, there is the positive law. But if Adams apostasie and fall was the same day he was formed, as many have thought, and is still disputable, this argument might well have been spared, because the command concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sanctifying the Sabbath might have been given in his corrupt and vitiated estate.</p>

And if you restrain it strictly to mount Sinai, as the letter seemeth to import, you must of necessity offer violence to Exodus 16, where at the fall of Manna it is clear the Sabbath was made known before the Law pronounced on mount Sinai: And so the Prolepsis faileth in this her last refuge as in the former.</p>

before and since the Law there were the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, sure there was also the same thing observed, yea and the same commanded; for from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the Law, from the Cause to the Effect, from the End to the Means, is a solid argument, and never faileth but when that end may be acquired by a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter means; and impossible it is to demonstrate how the tyred bodies both of man and beast could have been more charitably provided for, Gods solemn worship in a more sweet decorum performed, and the memory of the Creation better preserved from the immerging deluge of time, and profanenesse, by any day other then the weekly Sabbath, the day which God indigitated for the same purposes by his own example; an example equivalent to a Law: For though there had been no vocall, no verball institution of the Sabbath, yet Adam and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Patriarchs (who had a view and clear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Gods works, their orderly existencies, and exact consummation; but especially who were manuducted and guided by an inerring spirit) could not but collect from Gods example <note n="a" place="margin">Omnis actio Dei nobis pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etatis &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis est re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, <hi>Basil.

               </note> the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall equity for man to imploy six dayes in the works of his calling, and to interferiate the seventh, consecrating that to religious duties. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that main Argument from the want of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Institution, is but like a ruffled arrow, that maketh a great noise in the aire, but falleth short of the mark: For the controversie is not <hi>de Modo,</hi> neither of the command, whether Internall or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, nor of the observation, whether voluntary or imposed by precept; but <hi>de Re,</hi> whether it was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94568:19"/>
or observed or commanded yea or nay: that it was observed, the equity thereof common and agreeable to both times evinceth; and observed it could not be otherwise then in obedience to command, either prolated or tacitely inspired by the holy Ghost: for impute we must not to those sanctified men supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and will-worship. If then the Sabbath was both observed and commanded before the Law, why might not the command arise out of Gods blessing and sanctifying the seventh day, mentioned Gen. 2.3? why should we not rather embrace the proper and grammaticall sense of the words, then resort to a peerlesse and senselesse Prolepsis that hath neither fellow to associate, nor reason to strengthen it?</p>

One place there is, I grant, which at the first blush seemeth to perswade the contrary: but upon more mature consideration it exhibiteth nothing lesse. The text is, Exod. 16.32.

For might not (I pray) this command, this Institution, be dictated to Moses at the same time whereof he wrote? might not the precept be given now, though the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the precept was adjourned? nay, is it not most likely it was so? for where in the hole bible meet you with any injunction concerning it but here: touching the building of the Tabernacle, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering every thing else appertaining to it, God did exactly lesson Moses on the mount, but of the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the pot of Manna, and placing it before the Testimony, no hint at all was given there, nor any where else but here onely. And though we should grant that this command was given after the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle finished, yet cannot the mentioning of it here be properly said to be by Prolepsis. This narration taken hole and together is (I confesse) mentioned by Prolepsis; not so the parts of it: Hole and Part have not things so common betwixt them, that <hi>what belongeth to the hole,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quicquid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius est, idem &amp; partis.</note> 
               <hi>belongeth also to the part.</hi> A total Prolepsis of an entire story before another there may be, and yet no partial of one part of that story before another: the parts may be marshalled in their due order, though the hole be antedated. All that series of Divine story, from Genesis to Job, may be said to be related by Prolepsis; for it is the currant opinion that Job was comtemporary with Jacob and Joseph: but improper it were to say that the fall of Manna, the giving of the Law, the building of Solomons Temple, and such particulars, are, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94568:21"/>
of the history of Job, set down by way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsis. Prolepsis onely aimeth at what is next her; she beholdeth not things remote: So it is in this text; the verses from the 27 to the end of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter constitute a narration distinct, and in a canton by it self. For Moses having, in the former 26 verses, reported so much of the history of Manna, as was peculiar to that time whereof he wrote, thought it not amisse to superadde what else concerned it (though he delayed a while the ensuing occurrents, which should have been precedents to it) because it being not much he had to say, and that so homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal with what went before, he was resolved to take now an <hi>ultimum vale</hi> of it: therefore he telleth you of an after ordinance of God, concerning the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling an urn with Manna, the disposing of it before the Testimony, the execution of that command by Aaron, and lastly the duration of the use thereof by the Israelites fourty-yeare; which last is supposed to be the supplement of Joshua or Eleazar. If now you consider this digression, abstracted from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing story, you will find the hole preposterously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and yet the parts not at all inordinate; and if you look wistly upon Calvines <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>In Exod.</hi>
               </note> words, you shall find him not repugnant to what I have here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it is absurd:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Last Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity.</hi>
               </note> for there can no solid reason be given why Moses should by a Prolepsis of about 2670 years insert this Institution.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brerew. p.</hi> 66.</note> It could not be to instruct the Israelites, that Gods resting from his works on the seventh day was the reason why he had selected and appointed by his commandment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94568:22"/>
given to them that day rather then any other to be sanctified for his Sabbath. Indeed if the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment had onely mentioned the seventh day to be the Sabbath, without more ado, and had supprest the reason, Moses had had fit occasion to give them here this observation: But seeing that Reason was fully and with indeleble characters ingraven in the Decalogue, it had been mere supervacaneous and impertinent tautologie to recite it here; especially considering it is the most received opinion, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses compiled the history of Genesis after the Law was promulgated on mount Sinai, and so this reason was no news to them.</p>
            <p>If any, notwithstanding these grosse and palpable absurdities, seemeth desperately enamoured of this forlorn and despicable Prolepsis, enjoy her he shall without me his rival, I envy him not.</p>
            <p>Come we now to survey that little which the Divine remembrancer hath afforded us of the actual observation of the Sabbath before the Law; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of two onely examples are extant, the one for the observation notable, the other for the violation.</p>
            <p>For the observation, we reade, Exod. 16.22. when the Israelites had on the sixth day gathered twice as much Manna as on any other day before, the Rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses, and he said to them, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord:</hi> We do not find here that the Israelites were amused at the word Sabbath, that they expostulated with themselves (as before concerning Manna) what it should be; no, they knew well enough
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94568:22"/>
what it was, with the Rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord they had been long acquainted, it was no novelty to them; the new attendance, and long train of strict observances that now waited on it were the things so puzzled, so possest them with wonder of a <hi>How is it changed from what it was?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo?</hi>
               </note> Their old wont was to dresse their necessary viands upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and being now interrupted, now disturbed in their accustomed practice, by an uncouth innovation of <hi>Bake that which you will bake to day, and seethe that which you will seethe, and that which remaineth over lay up to be kept untill the morning,</hi> well might they be in a study, well demand a reason of this change. And whereas it is by some stiffly affirmed, that the Jews did bake their Manna on the Sabbath day, an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ascribed to Theophilus Brabourn,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heilen, p.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 108.</note> the first (as my Authour telleth me) that looked so near into Moses his meaning; he must know, that in Opticks, amongst other requisites to perfect discerning, <hi>justa distantia,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bacon. Persp. Dist.</hi> 8.</note> a fit distance, is one; and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Brabourn might perhaps by looking too near see to little: where the fault was, whether in this, or in some defect of the organe (his understanding) or through what other cause, I not dispute; sure I am that an hallucination, an errour of the sight there was, and that a grosse one. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase they give of this Text, <hi>Bake that which you will bake to day,</hi> &amp;c. is this, As much as you conceive will be sufficient for this present day, that bake or boyl as you use to do, and for the rest lay it up to be baked or boyled to morrow: and to this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they the rather betake them, because the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites laid it up as Moses bad, and it did not stink;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94568:23"/>
now (say they) it had been no wonder at all, that it did neither breed worm, nor stink, had it been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the day before: Things of that nature, so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, are farre enough from putrifying in so short a space.</p>
            <p>Not to dwell long in discussing this point: They have mistaken both Gods miracle and Moses his meaning. Gods miracle; for the baking or boyling excludeth not the miracle of its not putrifying: things so dressed are indeed the lesse disposed to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; therefore the putrefaction which Manna con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by procrastination on other dayes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the same order taken for preservation of it by baking and boyling, was the greater miracle: and because it tainted against nature, and miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reserved upon other dayes, Gods ceasing to work the same miracle upon the Sabbath might it self seem a miracle. The mind of Moses they have not reacht, whose words resolve themselves into this construction, What you mean to bake, bake to day, what to seethe, seethe to day, and what remaineth (not unbaked or unboyled but) of that which you have baked, or boyled, more then sufficient for this dayes food, lay up for you to eat to morrow: and therefore Hierome hath rendred it, <hi>Quodcun<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

But to put it out of all doubt, that this errour may never read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, God himself, vers. 5. commanded Moses that the people should Prepare that which they bring in, and it should be twice as much as they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered daily: what was this Preparing but dressing,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94568:23"/>
but cooking of it? so the English will bear; and by a word of the same energy and signification it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in, I am sure, most Translations; so the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint, so Hierome, so the Spanish, so the French: a thing so manifest, as the very Friday was thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the <hi>Preparation to the Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the violation of the Sabbath, we have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded vers. 27. that <hi>there went out some of the people on the seventh day to gather, and they found none:</hi> this I conceive most likely to have reference to the chap. 18. v. 12.</p>
            <p>Now, because it is held by some that the <hi>primum esse</hi> and first dawning of the Sabbath began at this fall of Manna, though I hope I have already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved the contrary, I would further know, why it should begin then, and but then: was it to chalk out to the Israelites the precise seventh day from the Creation, whereof they were at that time ignorant? It could not be; for of the seventh day whereon God rested they were not, they could not be ignorant: in some profane and irreligious houses it might perhaps have been lost, but in others more piously affected it was certainly preserved. For it is most undeniable, and irrefragably true what S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh <note n="a" place="margin">

And this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94568:24"/>
by the light which Moses might have, either by Cabala or letters: For that the most notable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents of every severall age were transmitted downwards by tradition and heare-say, is without all controversie <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Basil Schol. in Psal.</hi> 77.2.</note>; and for letters, it is so clear they had the benefit of them, as some have not set down content to believe that the prophesie of Enoch, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by S. Jude, was written; and that what Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus relateth of the Pillars errected by the posterity of Seth, is true; but they conceive also that Adam and all the succeeding Patriarchs compiled the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of their own times. But how Moses attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his knowledge, I leave to the disquisition of them who affect curiosities: yet this give me leave to note as received amongst the best Divines, That the holy Ghost was not so much an intelligencer, as a directer and guide to Moses in the framing the history of Genesis. For the omniscient Wisdome, foreseeing that it would not be alwayes safe to make Tradition the perpetuall depositary of so rare &amp; choice a jewel as the story of his Primitive Church, which might either through carelesnesse loose part of what was betrusted to her, or under colour of sole possessing the Truth, vend counterfeit and sophisticate stuff, thought it necessary for the good of his Church, that a set and certain story of the first times should be compiled: to which purpose he selected Moses as his Amanuensis and Register, aiding him extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily with his holy Spirit, by whose assistance he was enabled to distinguish truth from fables, which had by surreption intruded; exactly to describe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minute circumstances of time, place, persons,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94568:24"/>
names, &amp;c. which memory was not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and to digest it into that perfect order wherein we now see it. So that one way or other, either by tradition or letters, or both, the precise seventh day could not at that time have been lost or forgot, and consequently that no cause for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to begin at the fall of Manna. And was there any other? what? To be a preamble and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the subsequent Sabbath? this would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. A preparation to the after strictnesse of the Sabbath it was, that I confesse; not to the Sabbath it self, this I deny: an introduction it might be to the solemnity of the Sabbath, which began after, not so to the Sabbath it self, which was long before. For though it was but in its minority, but <hi>magni nominis umbra,</hi> a very shadow of the after celebrity, yet a Sabbath it was, and the seventh day Sabbath too; and this not my singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar assertion, but the consent of the most profound Doctours, as well ancient as modern. So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

The questions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed which relate to it are neither very numerous, nor absolutely necessary to be discussed; yet as they are by accident subservient to my ensuing tract, an elucidation I must and will afford them, according to that order wherein method disposeth them, which I take to be this.</p>
            <p>Some result from the precept, some again from the practice: from the precept, <hi>Quis, Quibus, Quid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quis,</hi> Who gave the precept? Who promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated it? And this question is not peculiar to the fourth precept distinctly taken, but onely as it is a member of the decalogue, whereof the question
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94568:28"/>
is especially made: for controverted it is, whether the ten Commandments were on mount Sinai promulgated by Gods immediate voyce, or the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of his Angels, or one or more. And not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily: for Moses seemeth to attribute it to God himself; but Stephen, Acts 7. vers. 38.53. and Paul, Gal. 3.19. and Heb. 2.2. to the Angels: in regard of which specious opposition, eminent and famous men have been diversly inclined: some to Moses are propense, for these reasons.</p>
            <p>First it is said, <hi>Dixit Jehova Elohim, God spake these words,</hi> not an Angel create: and though the word <hi>Elohim</hi> is once (and but once) applied to the Angels in the plurall, but never in the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as Psalm 8. yet here it can have no such signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: for the verb is <hi>Dixit,</hi> and the pronoun <hi>Ego,</hi> both singular.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the person speaking saith, <hi>I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt</hi>; but an Angel create did not deliver them out of Egypt.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Saint Paul himself saith, that it was <hi>the voyce of Christ which shook the earth,</hi> Heb. 12, 26. Therefore where it is said, Acts 7.38. that Moses was with the Angel in the wildernesse, the word <hi>Angel</hi> must not be understood of an Angel create, but of Christ, who is often called both an Angel and God in similary places, as Gen. 31. vers. 11, 13. and 48.15. Exod. 3.2. in all which places the word <hi>Angel</hi> can mean no other person then Christ. Thus farre <note n="a" place="margin">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94568:28"/>
singular number, yet in the other place it is <hi>Angels</hi> in the plurall, excluding utterly the application of it to Christ, or any single person. Where Zanchy brake off, the explication is continued and supplied by the thrice-excellent <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Parallel. l.</hi> 1.</note> Junius, who resolveth it thus, <hi>At the delivering of the Law on Mount Sinai, God was attended with many Millions of Angels,</hi> (so both the state and service of their Lord, and the great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in hand required) <hi>and from amidst this glorious host he spake unto the people, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Del, l.</hi> 1.</note> Angels; all the Angels being witnesses to the Covenant, God proclaimed the Law: so he interpreteth it; a glosse rather new then absurd.</p>
            <p>Others incline to Stephen and Paul, and conceive that God did not utter the Law himself, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of his Angels: to which they are the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disposed, because in some places of Scripture the Angels use such a form of speech, as though God himself spake, and yet it is manifest that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were the immediate utterers of those words as, Numb. 23.32.</p>
            <p>If it be now demanded which interpretation I fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; I answer, neither: The Scripture salved by both I see, but the mind of the holy Ghost is (I take it) atteined by neither. That which hath misled the whole stream of Expositours, is a conceit that Stephen and Paul spake of the pronouncing of the Law in Mount Sinai, whereas indeed their words onely aim at the delivering of the Tables of stone, called the <hi>Law</hi> also by a <hi>Metonymia subjecti,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining by the name of the conteined; these being put into the hands of Moses by the Ministery of his

Angels, as is evident, Gal. 3.19. For where is it said that the Angels pronounced the Law? that God did, we reade often. As Scripture saith not they did; so reason, that they did not: For how could the vocall prolation by many Angels but generate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of sound? or if God by extraordinary gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their voice might make them speak not onely one and the same thing but in one and the same articulate sound; yet seeing <hi>frustrà fit per plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> it might full as well have been uttered by one, why should he imploy so many? No, out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion (if duly considered) it is that God did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94568:29"/>
For first there is thunder, the voice of God, Psalme 29.8. and the concomitant of it, John 12.20. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the words are very direct, very expresse, where Moses telleth the Israelites, <hi>The Lord spake unto you,</hi> Deut. 4.12 <hi>out of the midst of the fire; ye heard the voyce of the words, but saw no similitude, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye heard a voyce.</hi> Now take it for a <gap reason="foreign">

Lastly, there are degrees of distance injoyned, the people not to approch nearer then the foot of the Mount; Aaron and Nadab, Abihu and the seventie Elders, up to the Mount; but Moses onely into the Cloud: from hence also note another certain argument of Gods immediate presence; which is alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant with such procession-bounds, as Exod. 3.5. Josh. 5.14.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </note>First, laws onely bind them, to whom they are onely given: But the Decalogue was given onely to the Jews, as is manifest by the preface: <hi>Ergò,</hi> it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bindeth them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note>The Decalogue was indeed given to the Jews; but was it as Jews, or a Nation distinct by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? No; rather as Covenantees, and the then select people of God, so that whosoever were after implanted in the Covenant, and inrolled Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to them, as <hi>pòst nati,</hi> did and doth the Decalogue belong. Nor was the Preface prefixt to invest the Israelites with a sole propriety therein: for God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now to give them (as they were then his holy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94568:30"/>
and chosen Church, which is alwayes formally though not materially the same) his morall and immutable laws, had here just reason to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self first to them, as Jews, and to rowze their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by inculcating into their memory the recent and signall blessing lately conferred upon them, thereby to excite their more strict observance of what he was now to give them in charge. So that this introduction might, I confesse, be proper to the Jews onely, and yet the Decalogue it self have a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger province and extent, and be spoken <note n="s" place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, if the Law as given on Sinai obliged the Gentiles, then were they at that time, before, and now are since Christ, bound to observe the Sabbath: But they neither were, nor now are astricted to that observation: <hi>Ergò,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

the day is abrogated and annulled? and can you demonstratively prove it so? The Jewish Sabbath was questionlesse indeed abolished, but was the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the fourth commandment so? If you say, Yea, for they were both one; I reply, it is with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er facility said then proved. And now we arive at the last circumstance considerable in the precept, <hi>Quid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this it is controverted, what day the precept enjoyneth, whether the Jewish Sabbath, the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or any other particular and expresse day? Most hold the Jewish seventh from the creation to be the day directly prescribed there; but I think it no hard task to beat them, or from that hold or in it. For first I would gladly know where in expresse terms the Saturday-Sabbath or seventh from the creation is commanded in this precept; examine and dissect it throughly: <hi>Remember thou sanctifie the Sabbath day</hi>; The Sabbath day it is you see, not the seventh from the creation.

               <hi>These Dogmatists,</hi> saith one, <hi>are not affraid to make the holy Ghost a liar, who teacheth in most clear and expresse terms, That God Almightie blessed the very seventh day on which himself rested.</hi> An heavie charge, did we not plead, not guiltie. That God blessed the very seventh day whereon he rested, we not deny; but whether he did expresly command the observation of that day by this or any other member of the fourth precept, that is the thing whereof we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand clear demonstration. Nor yet should we call this into dispute, had we not just cause to appeal from the old Translation, which hath herein imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a strange singularitie; for where it readeth, <hi>God blessed the seventh day,</hi> the Geneva, Spanish, that of Hierome, all that I have perused (the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint onely excepted) render it, <hi>God blessed the Sabbath day,</hi> as our most correct and new translation
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94568:32"/>
hath it: indeed the very fountain it self, the Hebrew giveth it so; which being true, can what we have said deserve so loud an outcry as hath been made? let any neutrally affected judge.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the defect of direct and expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is not the onely, the principall motive it is, I grant, which allureth us to think the Jewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in especiall manner not injoyned here: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument there is accessory to it. For if God had here expresly commanded the observation of the seventh from the Creation, or Jewish Sabbath, the fourth precept would have been in relation to that particular ceremoniall, and by consequent changeable: but I think it was and is in all parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely morall, and perpetuall; and my opinion is founded upon two not very defeasable reasons.</p>
            <p>First, it is marshalled in the Decalogue amongst the morall and immutable laws, which were nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly distinguished from the ceremoniall by many circumstances; <hi>The Morall uttered by God himself,</hi> (proved page 39.) <hi>in the presence of the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, written by Gods own finger, given without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint to time, how long; or place, where: Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Ceremoniall given to Moses onely, and by him declared to the people, called Ceremonies, Judgements, Ordinances, and limited onely to the land of</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">

               <hi>Jury:</hi> Now it could not be agreeable to the wisdome of the God of Order to shuffle and misplace a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall amongst his Morall laws.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if you cast your eye upon the Sabbath of the fourth precept, you shall behold it quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plumed and stript of all legall observances: for those
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94568:33"/>
things which are all urged as ceremoniall, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Jews, touching the Sabbath, are all, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, Postscripts and By-laws, not one emergent from the fourth precept. <hi>It was a signe betwixt God and his people,</hi> Exod. 31.17. Ezech. 20.20. It was injoyned with extreme rigour, <hi>No meat to be drest,</hi> Exod. 17.5. <hi>no fire to be kindled,</hi> Exod. 35.3. These were all peculiar to the Jews: if the commandment of the Sabbath was so too, how cometh it to passe they are thus discriminated, thus severed? Very suspicious it is then that they were not uniform pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, not all of a piece.</p>

               </note>I answer, True: But there is a great diversitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Decalogue given on Mount Sinai, and that described in Deuteronomie; That appertaining to Gods Church indefinitely taken, this to the Jews onely: And this is evident from the due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Deuteronomy: for though there be many things in it which may of common right belong to the hole Church, yet certain it is that book was especially penned for the Jews, it being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an explanation of that Law (whether Morall, Ceremoniall, or Judiciall) which Moses received on the Mount, and application of it to the particular state and condition of that people: So that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection doth not onely not evert but establish my assertion, it being a manifest argument that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Decalogue ingraven in the Tables was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94568:33"/>
of larger extent then that mentioned in Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: for else why should the reason of one be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall, <hi>viz.</hi> as a monument of the creation; of the other, particular, as a memoriall of the redemption out of Egypt: and consequently it may perswade that the Sabbath of the one was Morall, of the other Ceremoniall.<note place="margin">U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> it is very probable what Beza hath applied by way of salve to this of Mark (though it relisheth not well (and perhaps the worse because Beza's) with the learned Heinsius) that there is a dislocation of the words by some unwary Scribe,<note place="margin">

            <p>The <hi>Quando</hi> I have briefly dispatched; and the dispatch of that giveth me accesse to the <hi>Quomodo,</hi> the manner of observing the Sabbath, that is, what holy duties were performed that day. And from this arise two questions: First whether the Law was read publickly every Sabbath, or onely in the yeare of release at the feast of Tabernacles; and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94568:35"/>
this question is limited too, to the period from the Law given to the captivitie. The other <hi>quaere</hi> is, what Law, whether the hole Pentateuch, or Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie onely, was read in that yeare of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease.</p>
            <p>As concerning the First; they which hold the negative ground their opinion on these reasons:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>B. White, p</hi> 144.</note>First, that there should be any publick or solemn reading of the Law upon Sabbath dayes, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely required and commanded in the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It appeareth not by any relation of sacred History, that before the Babylonish captivitie there was any weekly reading or expounding the Law upon the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it is a thing to be admired, that if the reading of the Law had been in continuall use among the Jews every Sabbath day, there should be found in the dayes of King Josiah one copy onely or book of the Law, and that Hilkiah should present this book to the King, as a great raritie, 2. King. 22.8, 9.</p>
            <p>But the unsoundnesse of the foundation argueth the assertion erroneous: for,</p>
            <p>First, will nothing but expresse Text satisfie you? suppose we find it not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not verbatim com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thus, Reade the Law publickly every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; is not, I pray you, necessary and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deduction out of Text Scripture with you? if yea, then we need not travel farre for a command, no farther then the fourth precept, and not farre into that, but to <hi>Remember thou keep holy or sanctifie the Sabbath day.</hi> I told you before that things are then
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94568:35"/>
said to be sanctified, when they are applied to holy worship; now holy worship is the exhibiting to God his due and just honour: and that is performed two wayes, either by reverent attention to what he offereth us in his word, or an humble presentment of what we preferre to him in our prayers. For Hearing of the word &amp; Adoration are the two hands of religion; the one we extend to receive what God communicateth to us, the other to represent what in mercy he accepteth from us: so as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the proper instruments of mutuall commerce betwixt him and us; and though I allow them a parity of honour, yet hath the one a precedency of order before the other, and this belongeth to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word: <hi>For the first of religious offices where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we publickly honour God on earth</hi> (saith that worthy <note n="m" place="margin">

If then the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Sabbath be the application of it to Gods worship, the consequence must and will be, That all sacred actions tending to this worship as parts thereof (but the hearing of the Law read most especially, it being of the essence of that worship) were commanded in and under the word <hi>sanctifie.</hi>

                  <hi>B.

            <p>I answer, The literall sense of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment imposed upon the Jews the sanctification of the Sabbath, <hi>viz.</hi> by all such religious actions as are proper to holy worship; the specialties whereof it not determineth, least it should be thought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any. It also imposed rest and cessation from secular businesse; but that it commanded it as any at all, much lesse the onely externall form of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Sabbath, pardon me, I cannot believe. For what honour could accrue to God through an idle and lazie rest? what worship could man perform waking more then a sleep? How could the day be lesse sanctified by beasts then men? Rest was injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as necessary indeed <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> as a fit means; but not <hi>necessitate causae,</hi> as a necessary cause constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sacred worship.

               </note>. And therefore the beam of truth hath extorted from them this confession, That some other religious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were intended by God as the end of the precept, but no other were formally commanded<note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>B. White, p.</hi> 146.</note>. What I pray, did God intend those religious actions as the end of the precept? how come you to know Gods intention? hath he any where revealed it? if yea, then tell me, is not that overture, that declaration of his intendment equipollent to a command? Besides, when and where did God open this his mind? in this precept, and at the giving of the Law? If now, and here, then these religious actions and rest were coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate together, both imposed at one and the same time, the thing you deny: If after, then God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and man observed rest to no end and purpose all that while, untill the manifestation of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the end of that rest came forth. But God and nature do nothing in vain<note n="e" place="margin">

            <p>Their second Argument is upon the old haunt still, The want of expresse narration; which were it true, yet is it no <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94568:37"/>
they affirm, as I have proved before, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the contrary may be probably collected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out detorting Scripture against reason: For first, when the Shunamite desired to go to the Prophet Elisha to acquaint him with the death of her sonne, and to see if he could afford her any comfort, her husband expostulated with her, saying, <hi>Why wilt thou go to day? it is neither New-moon, nor Sabbath day:</hi> which had been an impertinent question, if they had not accustomed to resort to the Prophets on those dayes, to heare the word expounded. That this was their practice scarce any Expositour upon the place but assureth us.</p>
            <p>Though here is onely mention of the New-moon and Sabbath, yet as we need not doubt but that they practiced the same upon other festivalls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, so I conceive it to be implyed in both or either words, which are often in Scripture taken in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall notion, not denoting any certain or particular but an indefinite feast. The word Sabbath especially, this so frequently as no meanly lettered man is such a novice to whom it is a novelty: The New-moon more sparingly, yet when mated with Sabbath sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome retaineth it any other signification. Examples whereof are first this text of the Kings, then that of Isaiah 66.23. <hi>From one New-moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord.</hi> Again, that of Ezech. 46.3. <hi>The people of the land shall worship at the doore of this gate before the Lord in the Sabbaths and in the New-moons.</hi> Lastly, that of Amos, 8.5. <hi>When will the New-moon be gone that we may sell our corn? and the Sabbath that we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94568:37"/>
may set forth wheat?</hi> In all these portions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Sabbaths &amp; New-moons, by the figure <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>when one thing is expressed by two words,</hi> are onely put for solemn feasts generally not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted. Nor is the word New-moon taken thus onely when linked with the Sabbath, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while also when single and alone, as 1. Kings 12.33. For where in our translation (as in I am sure most, if not all others) it is said that <hi>Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth moneth,</hi> the Hebrew word for that feast is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifieth the New-moon;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seld. Marm. Arundel. pag.</hi> 134.</note> but to speak properly the New-moon it could not be, for the Moon was then in her full, it being the 15 day: and the feast is thought by learned men to be devised by Jeroboam in imitation (indeed to suppresse it in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion) of the feast of Tabernacles which was to be on the 15 of the seventh moneth.<note place="margin">

            <p>But not to expatiate too farre in collaterall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions; the reading of the Law may (not absurdly) be expiscated out of Acts 15.21. where James giving definitive sentence in the Councel of Hierusalem, saith, <hi>Moses of old time hath in every citie them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day.</hi> But against this place they except, <hi>viz.</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> hold it probable that Synagogues had their beginning from the plantation of the land of Canaan, when the priestly and propheticall offices ceased in the first-born, and masters of families, but were supplyed, the first, by the Leviticall priests; the second, by the seventy Elders, as some suppose <note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Genebrard. Chron. p.</hi> 102.</note>, but more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Prophets, whose ordinary calling was to reade and expound the Law. The numerous provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which sacred preachers maketh it incredible that they were destitute of places (no matter how, or Colledges, or Synagogues, or otherwise deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated) destinate to that and such like holy-duties.</p>
            <p>Their last argument is not compounded of much better stuff. For first the finding of the book of the Law by Hilkiah, and presenting of it to Josiah, is no infallible signe, <hi>Quod alioqui nulli ejus essent alii codi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> That there were besides no other books there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not to Genebrard <note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>Chron. in ann.</hi> 3526.</note> I am sure: and it may well be controverted. For if in times of harder pressures, when the Temple and the authentick books in it were burnt, when utter havock was made of all, and the people of God led captives into Babylon; even in the extremitie of that desolation, if some copies were no doubt preserved in private mens hands, as Daniels, Ezechiels, <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de verb. Dei, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Jun. anim. adv. in eum.</hi>
               </note> Jeremies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (For how otherwise could Esdras restore the Sacred volume to its first integrity, then by comparing divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplaries
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94568:38"/>
then extant together, and so reforming what errours had been committed by negligent penmen) if I say, some copies escaped the fire at that time, probable it is that all perished not before Josiahs reign. But be it granted that all were lost, not one to be found before Hilkiah chanced to light upon that, yet are you short still; your argument is not <hi>ad idem:</hi> for the question is of a duty, part of Gods publick and solemn worship, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is of a time under persecution, when the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of the Church was the Crosse, when there was no solemn worship of the true God publickly tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and you may as well upon this instance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that there was no Sabbath observed, as deny the observation of it by this dutie of Reading and Hearing the Law. No man (for ought I know) contendeth that the solemn reading of the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes every Sabbath, and that in times of distresse, was practiced: and that it was at other times, even Cajetan <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cajet. in locum.</hi>
               </note> himself (who holdeth that that book which Hilkiah found was of all other the onely rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) acknowledgeth:<note place="margin">Tanto tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore neglecta erant divina tempore Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassis, ut li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Legis tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam res no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viter inventa scribatur.</note> 
               <hi>Holy exercises</hi> (as reading and expounding the Law) <hi>during Manasses his wicked reign were so long neglected</hi>; (and neglect I hope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth a dutie formerly practiced) <hi>that the book of the Law is related as a thing new discovered.</hi> So he. True it is, he mentioneth not the Sabbath day, as whereon these <hi>neglecta divina</hi> ought to have been performed; but seeing the words seem to referre to duties which ought to have been publickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, their publick performance ought to have regard to both times and places destinate thereto.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94568:39"/>
This point I prosecute no further: enough I hope (if not too much) hath been said to perswade that the Law was read on the weekly Sabbath, as well as on the annuall of Tabernacles in the septennuall of Release.</p>
            <p>I passe then to the last question. In this as brief I shall be, as in the former I was tedious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At the end of every seven years, in the solemnitie of the year of Release, in the feast of Tabernacles, thou shalt reade the Law before Israel in their hearing,</hi> saith the text: Upon which words Tostatus thus, <note n="c" place="margin">Accipitur specialiter LEX pro Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio, <hi>Tostat. in Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>q.</hi> 91.</note>

               </note>I answer, This Fundamentall Law is tacitly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this precept, but so it was also in the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other ceremoniall festivals, the Passeover, Pentecost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which we may as well resort as to the fourth precept for it. And if this morall or naturall Law be the onely reliques of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: I would fain learn what was in the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath extraordinary more then in other Feasts, which might intitle it to a roome amongst the morall Laws of the Decalogue, when as the other Feasts were excluded. Besides, if this morall law of <hi>Festos dies coles</hi> maketh a distinct precept by it self, I see no reason but there should be another for going to Church, another for allowing God a convenient portion of our substance (for these are also morall equities) and so there will be an even dozen. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how cometh this morall equitie to be a peculiar of the Gospel onely? God had from the Creation to the Law, from the Law to Christ, a day appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated (and that by himself) to his worship: what? hath he lesse reason to require it under the Gospel? hath he left the Christian Church to that liberty that every man may serve him as the toy taketh him, and so God stand to our courtesie to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped when we list?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>B. White p.</hi> 121.</note> You will say Nay; we are not left at that libertie: <hi>The observation of the Holy dayes appointed by the Church, is reduced to the fourth Commandment, as a speciall to a generall:</hi> viz. <hi>Gods
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94568:40"/>
people must observe holy times, because the equitie of the fourth Commandment obligeth thereunto: But Easter and Christmasse day, and Sunday,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are holy dayes lawfully appointed by the Governours of the Church, and subordinate to the equitie of the fourth Commandment; therefore Christian people are bound to observe these Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes, in obedience to the equitie of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, The Church hath a power indeed to ordain festivals; but is the observation of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions concerning them, a fulfilling; the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, a breach of the fourth Commandment? How can this be? First, what needs an Obligation be derived from the last precept of the first Table, when the first of the latter is alsufficient? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, is it not a mere <hi>non sequitur?</hi> The fourth Commandment bindeth us to yield God a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time for his worship: <hi>Ergò</hi> It obligeth us to observe the festivals of the Church? Where learned you this Logick? Suppose I pray, the Church should injoyn but one day in a moneth, doth he I pray who observeth her order that one day, and not once more in the interim serve God perform his dutie which God in this Commandment requireth? or doth he who plieth God with frequent addresses, who strictly observeth canonicall houres, yet onely perhaps faileth that one day which the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth; doth he, I say, violate the morall law of this precept, which saith not, Set apart such times for pious exercises as thy Governours prescribe, but, such as thou thy self thinkest meet. In short, to make this more evident, Every Law positive is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94568:41"/>
built upon some morall, as upon a foundation; now it is manifest that the foundation may stand, and yet the superstructure fall, as may be demonstrated in an example familiar to us: The equitie of State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that particular persons be not inriched any way which reflecteth to the damage of a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; upon this sociable equitie, there is a positive, a Statute law <note n="b" place="margin">5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> inacted, that None shall buy or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract for any victualls or wares before they come to the Market, Fair, or Port. But in some parts of this Realm, especially in Norfolk, such plentie of corn there is growing in most Towns, as maketh every of them a kind of Market, so as few men need go out of their own Villages to be supplied with materialls either for bread or beer; yea the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie is such, as many Towns vend a thousand quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of grain, over and besides what supplieth their families and lands; by reason of which great plenty little or none is sold in many Markets: and the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all practice hath been, and is, for Merchants to buy, not in open Market, but at the Barn doore great quantity thereof, and export it into other parts of the kingdome where scarcitie is. This act of theirs some Merchants have by smart experience lately found to be illegall, but yet no violation of the foresaid equity: for who complaineth that they are damnified thereby? Not the Norfolcians, they are eased; not the Shires deficient, they are relieved: either part desireth it: one, <hi>ut impleatur,</hi> that it may be stored; the other, <hi>ut depleatur,</hi> that it may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened.</p>
            <p>Nor doth the fourth Commandment onely inferre
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94568:41"/>
out of these words, <hi>Remember thou sanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> that God must have a Sabbath in a speciall manner; but it declareth also his will concerning the quotient and limitation thereof, <hi>Six dayes shalt thou labour and do all that thou hast to do, but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth is the Sabbath,</hi> so that one in a week he must have.</p>
            <p>If you say, the limitation of one in a week was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> and so abrogated.</p>
            <p>I answer, prove you it ceremoniall,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Solut.</hi>
               </note> and I will yield it abrogated: but there hath not yet been any argument or reason shewn us whereby we might be perswaded to conceive it ceremoniall, nor hath it so much as one Character of a ceremony in it.</p>
            <p>For first, it was not typicall; it did not prenote any thing to ensue or be accomplisht under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. If that fancy of the Jewish Cabala be true, that the world shall continue but six thousand years, and then the day of judgement shall follow, it might prefigure that, and yet no ceremony proved; for that time is not yet elapsed, and the type must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till the thing typified be fulfilled: so that this rather evinceth the duration then abrogation of this limitation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it had no particular relation to the land of Canaan, the proper place of ceremonies; nor yet to the Jews, upon whom it was not imposed as Jews, as a mark of difference to distinguish them from the Gentiles. If you object, Exod. 31.13. &amp; 17. Ezech. 20.12, &amp; 20. where the Sabbath is called <hi>a signe betwixt God and them</hi>; I say, the Sabbath was at that time a mark of difference and separation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94568:42"/>
betwixt the Jews and Gentiles, that is confest; but was it so as a seventh day? No; that which caused the distinction was the sanctification of them on that day, not any thing in the number of seven. Gods seposing of a certain time for their, and onely their (for, <hi>God worthily neglected those of whom he was not worshipped</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eos à quibus non coleb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was not imposed as an heavy burthen upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Jews. If the sequestring one day in a week had been burthensome to them, it would be also a grievance now to us Christians, who observe the same: But we are under the law of grace and liberty, exempted from such pressures, and if it were in any respect onerous, we would and might renounce it; so that it being not to us heavy, it is consequently probable, that it was to them tolerable.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.12.</note> And indeed in the explanation of the law, or rather application of it to the state of the Jews, it is rather recited as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of comfort, and refreshing, as of mercy and and favour, then of rigour, or severity, then of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and of servitude.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Lastly, it was not commanded in recognition of any speciall favour conferred upon the Jews: It was a memoriall of Gods creating the world in six dayes, and his resting on the seventh; but this being a benefit wherein all mankind inter common, the Jews can claim no property therein several to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And so in respect of this Character, as of the three preceding, no tidings of a ceremony yet, and so no cause of abolition: for you will
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94568:42"/>
not have more abrogated then was ceremoniall, will you?</p>
            <p>If you say, it was and must be ceremoniall:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall it was not, and therefore positive; and because positive, ceremoniall.</p>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note> denying that positive either necessarily implyeth ceremoniall, or excludeth morall. Nay more: disputable it is whether positive may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here or no. Sure I am a great Prelate <note n="d" place="margin">In divinis non datur jus Positivum, <hi>Winton.

                  <hi>Aqu.</hi> 1.2 <hi>ae. qu.</hi> 99. <hi>art.</hi> 3.</note> Schoolmen and Civilians use to speak: but in regard the propriety of the word signifieth the imposing of what before was in its nature arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, whether the imposition be Divine or Humane, it constituteth (in my opinion) a Law positive deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated accordingly. Be it then Positive: is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ceremoniall, or not morall? Let the definition of either word end the strife. Morall is derived from <hi>mores</hi> or <hi>mos,</hi> and may be defined as Lirinensis <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Contr. Haer. cap.</hi> 3.</note> doth Catholick, <hi>Quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> That which hath been observed every where, alwayes, and of all men. And though in its remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test latitude of signification it is synonymall with what Civilians call <hi>Jus Gentium,</hi> or the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet may it not unfitly be restrained to lesser societies, as to Gods Church; and so what hath been alwayes observed in his Church, may not unfitly be called <hi>morall</hi>; and then the observation of a weekly day will become so too; yet with this restriction and difference, that one is morall by Naturall infusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the other by externall Imposition <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Halens.</hi> 3. <hi>qu.</hi> 32. <hi>memb.</hi> 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>But suppose it granted that Positive were a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94568:43"/>
of Morall, yet can you never prove that it must inevitably inferre ceremoniall: for ceremonies are in their very nature changeable, to last but a while; their etymologie giveth them that definition, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (therefore they who write cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie do ill deduce it from Ceres) whereas Positive laws may be, and are some of them, immutable. The prohibition of incestuous matches within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degrees, decimation and tithing, were Positive; and yet I hope you will yield unchangeable: The last, I am sure, you demand by virtue of the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. Nor doth the tenth content you, you are (you think) defrauded of your right, unlesse we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it as due <hi>jure Divino,</hi> the truth whereof is here not to be discussed; and though I as yet rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the affirmative, yet this for undeniable veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I dare and do averre, that to evince a <hi>jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> there is farre, infinitely farre clearer evidence and demonstration in the Scripture for the Lords day then for Tithes. But I digresse. All Laws Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine derive their firmnesse or mutability two wayes: either from that which giveth them their first consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, Reason; (<hi>Qualis Ratio Praecepti tale Praeceptum,</hi> as the Reason is permanent or moveable, so is the Law; for the form of all laws is the reason, as that which diversifieth all things is the form) or from the subject, or matter about which they are conversant; for if that be constant, the law must also be the same. <hi>For those Laws Divine, which belong, whether naturally or supernaturally, to men as men, or to men as they live in Politick society, or to men as they are of that politick society which is the Church, without any further
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94568:43"/>
respect had to any such variable accident as the state of men, and of societies of men, and of the Church it self is subject to in this world; all Laws that so belong unto men, they belong for ever, although they be positive laws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse being positive, God himself that made them altereth them,</hi> saith Hooker.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Now no man will deny the reason of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a weekly day in memory of the creation to be immutable; therefore the Law it self for that cause also, though at first positive, must be so. And that it was imposed on Gods Church, without respect had to any particular Place, People, Time, or the like variable occasion, is so clear as none can solidly refute: and for this cause also it must continue so long as that society the Church, for which it was first given, shall abide.

There was no interregnum, no vacancy at all, no cessation of a Sabbath; No, not the first week: No sooner was the old Sabbath abolished then the new established and installed. The Jewish Sabbath, that slept (we all know) its last in the grave with our Saviour: Its ghost (according to Countrey dialect) or the shadow of that shadow walked indeed a while after, but it self, the old Sabbath, expired then, and immediately entered the Lords day.

            <p>Though this be the last first day mentioned in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ, which our Saviour hallowed in his assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with the Apostles, yet probable it is that he practiced the same even till his Apoge and Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But conjecturall arguments we will not urge, when demonstrative are so hardly obtained.</p>
            <p>Well; our Saviour is ascended: Let us now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what honour the Spirit of Comfort (which in his late valediction he promised to send his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles) hath conferred on this Day. Our Saviour is ascended, and the holy Ghost descendeth; but on what day? the first of the week? Not expresly, yet consequently and by deduction, yes: for it was when Pentecost was arrived, and this fell that yeare on the Sunday.<note place="margin">

For those things onely are casuall, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, <hi>praeter intentionem operantis,</hi> contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the agent: But here God was the agent, whose omniscience nothing could escape, who is privie to all events as the disposer of them. True it is, that <hi>necessarium</hi> and <hi>contingens</hi> necessary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent are terms which Theology can endure well enough, when they are spoken with regard to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate and second causes (For those Effects which are the emanations of such Causes as can in nature produce no other, are said to be necessary; and those which proceed from such as are in their own nature not determined to certain and definite effects, are called contingent) but when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the supreme and paramount Cause of all, they are then, and must be called, Necessary. Nor could the falling of Pentecost on the Sunday be a contingent thing in respect of the second Causes, which were all (no doubt thereof is made) necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For Scaliger hath informed you right, that the Pentecost's <hi>terminus à quo</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:94568:48"/>There were certainly other reasons which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the holy Ghost to make choice of this day and time; yet seeing all Antiquitie hath accounted his descent upon the Apostles amongst those titles of honour which have been dispensed upon this day, I see no reason why it should be now denied it. And though no glory at all (the thing by some over ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly desired) should accrue to it thereby, yet this is most legible, that on this day the Apostles were solemnly though closely assembled in prayer and holy duties. But so, you will say, they were on other dayes; which I grant, with this distinction of <hi>aequè</hi> and <hi>aequaliter:</hi> for some dayes amongst them were doubtlesse dignified with a more solemn ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servancy then others, in respect whereof they were especially reputed, if not denominated, Holy-dayes. For how else can our Church <note n="e" place="margin">

Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter Brer. pag.</hi> 37.</note> be understood, where she saith that <hi>The Christian people, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Ascension, began to chuse them a standing day of the week to come together in</hi>: so that both the preferring one day before another, and the time of that choice, viz. <hi>immediately after the Ascension,</hi> she indigitateth to us.</p>
            <p>The next mention of Apostolicall observation of this day occurreth, Acts 20. vers. 7. <hi>The first day of the week, the Disciples being come together to break bread, Paul preached unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against this Text two exceptions lie: First that by <hi>Breaking of bread</hi> is onely meant their ordinary repast,<note place="margin">

            <p>I answer, some have indeed interpreted this Text of bodily repast; yet the major part take it for the mysticall breaking of bread in the Communion: And for our Church,<note place="margin">

In which interpretation there is enough to reconcile both parts, something for il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94568:49"/>
being super-added. For the holy Ghost doth here (so I take it) regard the practice of the Christians in their Love-feasts <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Chrysost. in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Hom.</hi> 27.</note> (and happily from hence they took their commencement) which consisting of divers viands provided by a common purse and collation, their fashion was to take so much thereof as they thought sufficient for the Communicants, and so to celebrate the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per together; which done they presently fell to their spare and slender chear, entertaining and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing themselves with spirituall and divine collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies. So that the fraction of bread here might have reference to their mysticall repast in the blessed Eucharist, which was the first course or part of their Agape; and the latter part of the verse might look at the other part thereof, viz. corporall refection.</p>
            <p>Their next cavill is, that this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the first, but some one day of the week, wherein as they are become Separatists from our Church in her most absolute Translation, so them and her I leave to end the quarrel.</p>
            <p>We meet with it also, 1. Cor. 16.1. and there an ordinance of the Apostles, that their oblations should be upon that day. Now I would gladly learn why this day rather then any other should be appointed for an Almes-day, had it not been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Holy in those times.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we meet with it Apoc. 1.10. but not now as formerly styled the First day of the week, but appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in a Christian name, and called the Lords-day; which certainly the holy Ghost would not have done, had it not passed for currant amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94568:50"/>
by that name: and how could it obtain that name, had it not been destined then to religious actions as a weekly holy-day?</p>
            <p>Laying all these premised evidences of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick practice together, do they not clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the translation of the Sabbath into the Lords day? For why should the Christian Church, even in those times when every day was sanctified with devout exercises and seemed an holy Sabbath, select any one distinct and peculiar day to be kept holy? and why one in a week, rather then in a moneth or yeare? and why not in the weekly circuit, the old Sabbath rather then the Lords day, had not God some way made known his will to them, that he would still have a Sabbath exempted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condition of other dayes, &amp; that Sabbath to be weekly, and that weekly, not the old Jewish, but the new Christian, to be the first of the week, as dignified by the Resurrection of our Saviour,<note place="margin">

               </gap>6. And though this Comforter is called <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> and so impossible it is that he should inspire any thing lesse then truth; yet when Christ telleth his Apostles that this Comforter should guide them into all truth, he presently saith withall, <hi>That he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he shall heare that he shall speak: He shall receive of mine, and shew it to you:</hi> which denoteth to us that the doctrine of the Gospel is in a more especiall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be ascribed to Christ, then to the holy Ghost, who was but our Saviours delegate and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee; therefore S.

            <p>It being then indisputably clear, that the Apostles were inspired by the holy Ghost, and that that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine enthusiasme was but the revelation of Christs will, there is nothing else now desiderable, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove, that in this very act of instituting the Lords day or Sabbath of the new Covenant, they were <gap reason="foreign">

Church? was the doctrine they taught inspired from above, and were their constitutions Ecclesiasticall an humane device? Certainly no; the voyce of truth it self soundeth the contrary.

Concerning the first he saith, <hi>The Apostles are to be considered, either as Apostles by extraordinary mission sent to plant the Gospel, or as Pastours to govern the Church already planted. As Apostles they were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inspired with all truths, upon all occasions. As Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, their inspirations were onely such irradiations, influences and concurrences of the Spirit, as are afforded at this day to Pastours of the Church, unlesse by some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall miscariages they procure unto themselves spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all derelictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer,<note n="a" place="margin">Utrumque abs te fine ulla dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scere debui, sed non sum avarus, unum horum doce, <hi>Aug. contr. Epist. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich. lib. un.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>It is your dutie to prove indubitately both these to me, but I am not covetous, make good but one and I am satisfied.</hi> And first, tell me, good Sir, (if to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you out of this dream I be not over-rude) where find you the Pastorall and Apostolicall Office, in the same persons, distinct? where reade you of a double Commission, one to plant the Church, the other to govern the Church already planted? were not both these parts of the Apostolicall function? were they not Apostles, i. e. sent to do the one as well as the other? Instance in any one act of their Pastorall office, which was not in the latitude of their Apostolicall patent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, admit them for severall functions: where I pray learn you that they had a distinct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, according to those severall functions? If those irradiations you talk of, which were shed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94568:55"/>
them as Pastours, were no other then what God now dispenseth to ordinary Ministers, then (I say) the beams or species intentionall of such irradiations must needs have a tincture of the Medium (naturall corruption) through which they passed; and every thing, which as Pastours they did, not onely may but must have a rellish of sinne or errour, which ever did, and ever shall, more or lesse, distain the best action of the justest man (infected with originall corruption, and not extraordinarily and infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired) living upon earth. If then the Apostles as Pastours were but ordinarily inspired, and that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inspiration did not exempt their Pastorall works from sinne and errour, it were a worthy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to put the New Testament into Purgatory, to weed out all those passages which relate to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall office of the Apostles, and to bind them up with the old Apocrypha; I see also no necessitie why Children should be baptized, why women, nay why any of the Laitie should be admitted to the Eucharist, which are Apostolicall devices, whereof expresse command from our Saviour to them we find none: and to speak to the point in question, I see no necessitie of celebrating the Lords day, but of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Jewish Sabbath I see a necessitie; for I see Gods command to observe it, and I see no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand to abolish it. If the Apostles abrogated it without expresse warrant from God, they did it as Pastours; and their Pastorall constitutions by your rule ought not oblige the Church for ever.</p>
            <p>But let us take view of the proofs which confirm this your distinction.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Idem.</hi> 174.</note> 
               <hi>First you say the Apostles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94568:55"/>
as Pastours, were subject to mistake,</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>as appeareth by Saint Peter; who living at Antioch as a Pastour, was justly reproved by Saint Paul, for not walking as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved a Pastour. And Paul and Barnabas dissented from one another, and that in such heat, as it maketh it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent they were not both, if either, directed by the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, That Peter and the other two Apostles were too blame, I not deny; but were they <hi>in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra,</hi> or doing any Pastorall work? assuredly No. He offended about the choice of meat, these about the choice of a companion; which are not things relating to the Pastorall office. And for ought I see, you may as well argue, Such a Minister is a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizer; Such and such a Pastour were cholerick one with another; <hi>Ergò</hi> they preach false doctrine, and so transferre the faults of the Person, to the office or calling.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you instance in places of Scripture, where you bring in the Apostle speaking some things of himself, not as dictates of Gods Spirit.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>I speak this by permission, not of commandment,</hi> vers. 6. <hi>To the rest speak I, not the Lord,</hi> vers. 12. And, <hi>I have no commandment of the Lord,</hi> vers. 25. And, <hi>I give my judgement,</hi> vers. 40.</p>
            <p>I answer, Your first is nothing <hi>ad oppositum</hi>: for the Apostle there distinguisheth not his permissive counsel from Christs command. In the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Text, where S. Paul is said <hi>to speak, and not the Lord,</hi> it is onely meant, that Christ did not expresly determine the doubt, whilest he conversed on earth, it being not then on foot: and this is the solution of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94568:56"/>
the 25. verse also. Where it is said, verse 40. <hi>I give my judgement,</hi> we must not think it to proceed from his own head, but dictated by the Spirit; and so by way of precaution he telleth us, <hi>I think I have the Spirit of God.</hi> Nor do these words, <hi>I think,</hi> imply, as though the Apostle were not confident of it, but by way of Irony seem to gird those who boasted of extraordinary illumination: and this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant interpretation of all learned Expositours.</p>
            <p>Let us now see how you distinguish Apostolicall Traditions: <hi>These</hi> (you say) <hi>are either such as they received immediately from Christ, or such as were sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to them by the Spirit; the first</hi> (you say) <hi>they delivered as Apostles, and they are therefore Divine; the other as Pastours, and may be dispensed with.</hi> I did expect you would have derived this distinction from the Primitive Fathers, or some reformed Writers, men of some credit with us; but I see you are put to hard shifts, and are glad to appeal to them whom we renounce as incompetent judges,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Canus, loc. l.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> the Papists. But you say, <hi>according to this sense you find the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers speak of Traditions.</hi> Your talk of Fathers at first affrighted me, till I saw your instance onely attain a bare singular number. But what find you in Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, your Fathers, or universall particular? when Stephen accused his Anabaptisme for novelty, and repugnant to the ancient Tradition,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cypr. Epist. ad Pomp.</hi> 74.</note> 
               <hi>True,</hi> saith Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, <hi>but whence is this Tradition? from Christ in the Gospel, or from the Apostles in their Epistles? For what is written must be observed. There</hi> (you say) <hi>we have the first kind.</hi>

                  <hi>Cyp. Ep.</hi> 68.</note> 
               <hi>But elsewhere Saint Cyprian saith, that the choice of Bishops and Ministers in the presence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94568:56"/>
and with the approbation of the people, was of Divine and Apostolicall Tradition. Now who seeth not that here Saint Cyprian speaketh of those other Traditions, delivered and practiced by the Apostles as the Churches Pastours, which are no longer in force then the Church</hi> (you forget your self, you mean the Pope, for so your Canus singeth) <hi>shall like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, what you see I know not; this I dare affirm, that whosoever shall behold directly and with equall angles this passage of Cyprian, will clearly discern these two things: First,<note place="margin">Diligenter de Traditione Divina &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolica ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servandum est &amp; tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> that he cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Divine and Apostolicall Traditions together. Secondly, that he annexeth to Apostolicall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an <hi>observandum &amp; tenendum est,</hi> it must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, which implieth their perpetuall Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and by both these, Cyprian will be discovered to differ from your assertion, <hi>secundùm terminos op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positos,</hi> as wide as may be. And whereas you would enforce your interpretation upon us, as agreeable to the mind of this Father, from an assurance that such a choice of Bishops and Ministers is neither deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gospel, the Acts, or the Epistles; the thing is not so evident as you perswade: yea the contrary is the more probable, for Acts 14. vers. 23. where it is said, <hi>they had ordained them Elders in every Church,</hi> the word is, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Though I have by main force of this invincible argument of Apostolicall Institution and Tradition reinvested the Lords Day into a possession of <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> assured and confirmed enough against all machinations of her greatest oppugners, yet wanteth she not other (should need so require) auxiliary to her.</p>
            <p>For that Evangelicall day, which was prophecied of, and prefigured in and under the old Law, could not certainly be an humane device: But the Lords Day was shadowed under Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cision on the eighth day, prophecied in many Psalmes (both proved by sufficient Testimony of the Fathers) <hi>Ergò</hi> the Lords Day is no humane ordinance.</p>
            <p>Lastly, as the Eucharist is called <hi>the Lords Supper,</hi> because he instituted it; for the same reason is the Sunday denominated <hi>the Lords Day.</hi> For these two, the Day, and the Supper, have the epithete of <gap reason="foreign">

And whereas we are now taught a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Tradition and Command, we will for quiet sake (though it biddeth defiance to all antiquity) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it in the same sense you impose upon it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it for a mere leaving of the observation of this day to the Church, without any expresse command to observe it; yet, I say, you shall find Command so

implicitly complicated with Apostolicall Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as all your waters of separation, all your chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall extracts of School-distinctions, shall never be able to sever them.

So that if Tradition were it self no command, yet hath it here command annext to it. And though I grant that our Expositours understand this place especially of the written word, yet extend they it to Traditions unwritten also, such as are clearly held to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall, and have, if not mention, yet foundation in Scripture: amongst which the observation of the Lords Day is worthily accounted. <note n="a" place="margin">Habet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probationem Scripturarum itaque inter Non-scriptas Traditiones haud possit collocari, <hi>De Iudice ac Norma fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei.</hi>

Besides, the question was propounded as well to the Lay as Clergy-Christians, of whom it had been absurd to expostulate, <hi>Num Dominicum egissent</hi>? whether they had said Masse? which is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done by the Priest. Nor can it respect the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist otherwise then by implication, as it was then an usuall work of that day; because it is said that they might not <hi>intermittere,</hi> which especially relateth to time (as interpose to place) and inferreth the not doing of a dutie in its proper <hi>quando</hi>: which cannot be well interpreted of the celebration of the Eucharist, it being not restrained by any positive Law of God to a certain time. And indeed it was more proper to examine them whether they held their Christian assembly, whether they met on the Lords Day, considering it consequently inferred the performance of all sacred duties, then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether they had celebrated the Eucharist, which according to the custome of those times was often performed at home, being reserved for the same purpose.</p>

               </note>First, Christs Apostles did not conceal Christs command: for what if perhaps it be not extant in their writings? They were indeed our Saviours executours, performers of his will; but was his hole will exemplified in Scripture? certainly no: Some part thereof was declared <hi>in ima Cera,</hi> (as Civilians say) and by Tradition. For Tradition, which is clearly known to be Apostolicall, is as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect evidence of Christs will as the Canonicall Scripture it self. For the Scripture before it was Scripture was but a part of Tradition, and became Scripture that it might be of more ready use and better preserved from perishing, but mainly because it was the fundamentall Canon of our Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Apostles in their Synodicall Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle had onely respect to the Judaicall, not to Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall observances. Moreover, the solemnity of the Lords Day was made known to them by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practice (equivalent with precept) at least, if not by precept it self: for according to our Church, <note n="a" place="margin">

to be Christians. Lastly, the precept was in the negative, not in the affirmative. If you say, True, and hence we may inferre that the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were tied to no affirmatives, but such as were expresly commanded by Evangelicall precept. I answer, then it must follow that women did not communicate, children were not baptised, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters not ordained, incorrigible persons not excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, these being not expresly commanded by any Evangelicall Law.</p>

The truth is, Gods commandment may impose, but never oblige unto, things sometimes impossible: where there is an utter impossibility of observation (as in this or the like case) that impossibility is a necessity with which the Law dispenseth. And this is the reason (to speak to the point in question) why the Sabbath being given to Adam, and in him to all mankind, Gen. 2. was not described as the other six dayes by evening and morning; as also why the Sabbath of the fourth Commandment, of like latitude with the former, is not set out by expresse bounds of <hi>from Eve to Eve,</hi>

Augustine saith that the Christians in his time did not observe so much the festivals themselves as what was signified by them; and therefore he saith that the Apostle did blame the Galatians in this, because they did observe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times <hi>servilely,</hi>

               <hi>not knowing the mystery to which they tended</hi>: he speaketh nothing of their institution, not one word. Hierome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I grant, was inclining to your opinion, but his single judgement is not equivalent to the many reasons and authorities urged on the contrary. The book of Homilies affirmeth no such thing as you say: these words, <hi>of themselves without any Divine precept,</hi> are yours not the Churches; not expresly, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively, so not hers as she is positive in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary. For there being two things wherein the Divine right of the Lords Day is founded, upon legall Institution in the fourth Commandment, and Evangelicall by either Christ or his Apostles, for the first she saith that <hi>God expresly in that precept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the observation of the Sabbath which is our Sunday; and not onely commandeth it, but also by his own example doth stirre and provoke us to diligent keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same.</hi> For the second, having a while after declared it to be Gods Will and Commandment to have a solemn time and standing day in the week consecrated to him, she presently addeth, <hi>This exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Commandment of God the godly Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94568:65"/>
began to follow immediately after the ascension of our Lord Christ, and began to chuse them a standing day in the week to come together in.</hi> Now where she speaketh of <hi>Godly Christian people,</hi> she doubtlesse meaneth the Apostles (for who else durst at that time take upon them to begin such a custome) and so as touching the Institution of the day as a weekly day, she redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it to the fourth precept, and as the first of the week, she foundeth it upon Apostolick practice.</p>
            <p>What some other reformed Churches think in this point of the Lords Day, may plausibly enough against us be urged on your parts, I confesse, and it is your Drusian, your keenest objection; and yet we can oppose many things to turn the edge of it.

Nor ought we to wonder at their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take herein: For first the precept of the Lords Day is not so legible in sacred Scripture as the rest which concern matters of faith, thereby to instruct us to put a difference betwixt fundamentalls and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; it is written in a finer character, in a smaller Print, and therefore might well escape the eyes of those Churches at the first break of day of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when the light shone somewhat dimme. Secondly, the question was never on foot in their times, and so the evidences demonstrating Divine Right were never laid open to them; and having inquiries concerning sacrifice of the Altar, Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. more proper for those times, to imploy them, they were not like to inform themselves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon accident.</p>

            <p>And first, it is to be examined (the Lords day being an Apostolicall Tradition) whether it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, whether the Church hath power to alter the day, and substitute another in liew thereof.</p>
            <p>I answer, Nay, the Church hath not such a power, the sphere of her activitie extendeth not so farre, she cannot null and rescind the act of God. If the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day be established (and established so I have proved it) <hi>Jure divino,</hi> it is without all dispute unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for Immutable is one ingredient into the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> as the Canonists compound it, who make it, <hi>which is comprehended in the Law and Gospel, and remaineth perpetuall</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Quod in Lege &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinetur, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile semper permanet, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

True it is, I grant, that many positive divine Laws are changeable by the same authority which first imposed them, but that a divine Law can be abrogated, yea or displaced, by humane authority, that no sober man will yield to: And I hope (though many have of late set her on her tip-toes, and advanced her to a tickle point) the Churches power and authority reacheth not Divine. Besides, there is an especiall and peculiar reason of the inalterability of the Lords Day more then is usuall in other constitutions though Divine; for God hath a propriety therein. Six dayes in the week he hath bestowed upon us, but the seventh he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94568:66"/>
reserved for himself, wherein he hath as good, nay better freehold estate, then any man in his possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and then the rule of the Law is, <note n="b" place="margin">Quod no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum est, sine assensu nostro, ad alium trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferri non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, <hi>Reg.

               <hi>What is ours without our assent cannot be transferred to another.</hi> So that the Church hath no power to make that a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which God himself hath consecrated to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worship. Nor mattereth it whether this designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were performed by Christ immediately, or by the mediation of his Spirit assisting and infallibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Apostles, and so it becometh an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall Tradition; for even this (though the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree of Divine appointment) doth conferre exemption enough upon this day, to secure it from any jurisdiction the Church can claim over it.</p>
            <p>I will not dissemble it, some learned men have I confesse ascribed to the Church an authoritie over this day, so as she may if it please her transferre it to another: But you must know withall, that not one of these do repute it as an Apostolicall Tradition, which is the hinge upon which the hole question moveth; nor if they did, are we to give absolute credit to their dictates.

Dormant I said, not dead. Life, vigour, and force they have still, and should the same occasion arise again, God would expect from the Church the same observation: For they being Apostolicall, and so evidences of the Divine will upon severall occasions, we must not think that one and the same cause can operate in the Immutable Essence a diverse will, seeing in Philosophy, <hi>The same agent,</hi>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94568:68"/>
that severe and rigid vacation, which the Jewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath required?</p>
            <p>I answer, Yes, <note n="f" place="margin">Qui in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit jure ejus uti debet, <hi>Reg. Juris Lex</hi> 138<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>He which succedeth into anothers jurisdiction, is invested in his predecessours right.</hi> The same strictnesse of observation belongeth to the Lords Day, that anciently did to the Sabbath; I say by the fourth Commandment: for that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath not lost under the Gospel the least scruple or atome of obligation, which it injoyed during the Law, but bindeth still without abbreviation of time, or alleviation of restraint during that time. As for the duration of time, though I cannot discern such distinct abbuttalls thereof in this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as some seem to perswade, yet am I of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the word <hi>Day</hi> comprehendeth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a hole naturall Day. And as touching restraint from negotiation and toil on that Day, the words are very direct, <hi>Thou shalt do no manner of work.</hi> What, not quench an house of fire? not water a beast? not provide necessary food? yes, works of necessitie, works of mercy, thou mayest do: the precept onely interdicteth servile work, ordinary work of our vocation (All Doctours whatsoever so understand it:) which being granted, the fourth precept for ought I see little exceedeth in rigour touching the Sabbath, the Canon and Statute Law of this land, concerning the meanest holy Day. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer I do herein from my sacred mother the Church of England, it cannot be denied; she hath expressed her self otherwise,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hom of the Time and Place of Prayer, Hom.</hi> 1.</note> viz. <hi>That this Commandment of God doth not bind Christian people, so straitly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the utter ceremonies of the Sabbath Day, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94568:68"/>
the forbearing of work and labour in times of great necessitie.</hi> But seeing in the substance, viz. That we are not bound to observe the Lords Day with that extreme severitie which once belonged to the Jewish Sabbath, we consent, I hope a difference in the manner of expression is at most but a peccadil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, but a veniall fault; our dissent is onely this: That strictnesse which she reduceth to the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, I rather lodge and settle in those acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory and occasionall laws, which are quite of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parish, and have nothing to do here.</p>
            <p>If it be here objected, That this precept bindeth not to the observation of the Lords Day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no matter what it injoyneth.</p>
            <p>I answer, it doth oblige to the observation of this day; for no other day can properly be called Gods Sabbath then this, because no other day is weekly solemnized in the Church, and thereto destined by Divine appointment, which are the certain chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the Sabbath of that Commandment.</p>
            <p>Besides, all Expositours interpret this precept of this day especially, and some of none other; and above all, our Church it self is so full as nothing can be desired more apposite to our purpose, then what she hath delivered.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hom. of the Place and Time of Prayer.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Like as it appeareth by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> saith she, <hi>that no man in the six dayes ought to be slothfull and idle, but diligently labour in that estate wherein God hath set him; even so God hath given expresse charge to all men, that upon the Sabbath Day</hi> (which is now our Sunday) <hi>they should cease from all weekly and work-day labour, and give themselves wholly to divine exercises of Gods true Religion and Service.</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:94568:69"/>
And a few lines after she saith, <hi>That to keep the Christian Sabbath</hi> (which is the Sunday) <hi>is Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commandment.</hi> These are lowd and clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of what our Church then thought; wherein two things are remarkable: First, that she reduceth the observation of the Lords Day to the fourth Commandment: and secondly, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any scruple she very broadly calleth it our <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See before, p. 109. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct. of H.</hi> 8.</note> yea and <hi>The Sabbath.</hi> A word whereat much offence hath lately been taken, and all that use it are checkt by our great Schoolman; who (good man) in a tender care of us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ironside, p.</hi> 120.</note> adviseth <hi>that we follow the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the holy Ghost, as also of the Primitive Church, that we vary not from other reformed Churches, that we gratifie not the Jews in their obstinacy against Christ, that we offend not our weak brethren, and lastly that we use that name which doth most edifie, viz. the</hi> LORDS DAY. As concerning the style <hi>Lords Day,</hi> we quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell not at it, we are no enemies of it, we use it for ought I know more frequently then Sabbath; yet were it truly sensed, and according to right sense duly observed, it would contract not onely the title but nature of a Sabbath; for what is our Lords Day but the Evangelicall Sabbath? as the Legall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was the Jewish Lords Day. Be the Lords Day thus stated, call it then by that name ever if you please, it not at all offendeth us; but when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh from the Sabbath an ordinary holy day, or rather playday; from the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> the <hi>Churches Day,</hi> we have then just cause to rouse the world by shrill expressions, and lowd manifestations, that it is both the Sabbath of the fourth Commandment, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94568:69"/>
also the Lords Day, that is, of his Institution. But to persue this not without wonder, behold the strange condition of these men who inveigh so bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly against the word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing warrant both from our book of Homilies, the Canons Ecclesiasticall, and Edicts of our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, behold their perversitie: The words <hi>Altar, Priest, Sacrifice, Holy of Holies,</hi> will down with them so easily, as now they begin to rellish nothing else. It is rare, very rare, a great novelty to heare the course and homely terms of <hi>Table, Minister, Lords Supper,</hi> or <hi>Chancel</hi> in their mouths. Now I say, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> hath not in it any semblance of danger to Gods Church, comparable to that of <hi>Altar, Priest,</hi> &amp;c. For first the Lords Day is a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> &amp; <hi>The Sabbath</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, properly and directly; whereas these words <hi>Altar, Priest,</hi> &amp;c. are used <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively and symbolically. Besides the word <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> giveth no offence, for if any incline to Judaisme it is in the strictnesse, not now in the day. But the other words stumble many, especially in these times wherein we have cause, and just cause, to fear they are meant and intended of things other then meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall: And are not our fears just? when Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation beginneth not to be instilled in some subtile and Paracelsian spirit of School distinction, but according to the Galenists to be exhibited in the grosse masse of corporeall presence in a corporeall sense; so as the most unprepared and unbelieving receiver eateth his part thereof as well as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But admit this to be the tenet of some few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagants; yet are not our fears just? when that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94568:70"/>
uncouth and apish bowing toward, if not to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is not onely warranted and defended, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to our observation by the chief of our Church: which whosoever shall dive into it, and search antiquitie, will find it one of the Parents (E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation or Ostension being the other) which begot adoration of the Host, which begot Impanation or Transsubstantiation. Let not any think here that by <hi>Antiquitie</hi> I understand the very Primitive Church, with whom we challenge so near alliance in matters of Doctrine; for certain it is, that the first Church was utterly ignorant of this novel device: you shall indeed many times, very often find in the Fathers <note n="a" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But of bowing (for what some urge of Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen's Gorgonia was geniculation, not genuflection, as will appear to any that duly peruseth the place) towards the Altar as you call it, or ducking as often as they approched unto, or departed from it, you shall not find mention any where till you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at Chrysostome's Liturgy, which requireth <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>towards the holy Table</hi>; and this we all know is a piece of yesterday, the Authour whereof was in being not full six hundred years past, which we are also as certain was the very time about which the Incarnation of Bread or Transsubstantiation began first to be whispered. I should not have dwelt so
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94568:70"/>
long upon this, but that I find it pressed as a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dutie, yea a dutie of necessity adequate to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Lords Day, a Tenet which deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth rather to be hist at then answered.</p>
            <p>But to return from whence I have digressed: Let whatsoever is positive in the fourth Commandment stand for a cipher, is the Lords Day to be observed one jot the more remisse? doth not Apostolicall Institution imply an equall Obligation both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the continuance of time and restraint from labour? what did they ordain? what institute? was it not, That the first day of the week should be consecrated to God and spirituall negotiations? you cannot yield us lesse. If then it was the first day, of what is it meant? of a naturall day from sun to sun, or of an artificiall from the sun-rise to his set? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, of the first, for these reasons. If all the other dayes of the week contained both night and day, why should not the Lords Day have as large a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time as the rest? do not all the dayes in the week hold by Gavelkind? and if it contained onely daylight, then there was a night to spare, whereof I would gladly know what should become: Should the Saturday have it all? If so, then this would by sesquialter proportion exceed all the rest: should it passe by way of dividend amongst the other six, then there would be two houres in every day more then the suns revolution maketh. Moreover, when God requireth any thing dedicated to him, his constant caveat and proviso is that it be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>not defective</hi> and without blemish, not lame,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.21.</note> or imperfect. Now that which wanteth one minute
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94568:71"/>
of its full time cannot properly be called <hi>a day:</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly I say, and <hi>de jure,</hi> of right, it cannot, where the day is seposed by divine designation.<note place="margin">

               </note> And this is the more evident by observing what God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under the law, it being no lesse then a full and complete naturall day from eve to eve; which was, not (as a learned Doctour conceiveth, and I think aright) to set out the beginning and end, the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of a naturall day, but to declare his own claim of a naturall day to be dedicated to him which should begin at evening. If then the day must be understood of a naturall day of 24 houres, it will then necessarily follow that vacation from labour during that time must be concomitant with it: For vacation from worldly affairs, which may impeach the worship of God, is so inseparable from times consecrated to that worship, as it is by Brerewood rightly accounted part of the moralitie and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the fourth Commandment,<note place="margin">

            <p>But it will be here opposed, that neither the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselves, nor the Primitive Church, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served this day with any such strictnesse untill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine's decree; and therefore it is like they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned it not.</p>
            <p>I answer, as touching the practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, there is, I confesse, nothing either the one way or other clearly evident, nor much of that of the Primitive Church during the time limited: Onely Justin Martyr <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Apol.</hi> 2.</note> (if I be not mistaken) hath something reflecting that way; for in his description of the custome of publick assembling in those times upon the Lords day, after he hath insisted awhile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the duties performed in the Church, he setteth down what the Christians did <hi>postea,</hi> after their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as their visiting &amp; relieving the poore, their consorting together, and their repeating to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what they had learned that day in the Church. Of the remainder of time, the solemn assembly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, I understand this <hi>postea</hi> probably enough, yet will not warrant it with over much pertinacitie; if any other construction can vouch better reason in its defence, let that obtain. But though we should find no evidence of the Primitive practice of cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from labour on this day, yet will it not follow that they did not forbare it if possibly they could: for we meet with exhortation to it by Origen, <note n="f" place="margin">Die Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Christiani nihil ex om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus mundi actibus opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet operari; si ergò desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus seculari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus operibus, &amp; nihil mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum geras, sed spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus operibus vaces, haec est observatio Sabbati Christiani, <hi>Hom.</hi> 23. <hi>in Num.</hi>

secular affairs, and dost nothing but employ thy self in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall negotiations, this is the right observation of the Christian Sabbath.</hi> Is it now likely that the doctrine of so eminent a Teacher as Origen should perswade none to conformitie with what he here delivered? But suppose the worst, and that you were able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us an example or two of labour on this day, must it therefore follow that there was no decree of restraint made by the Apostles, and that we are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to plow and cart on this day, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any divine Law to the contrary? Nothing lesse: for as his late Majestie <note n="g" place="margin">

Heavy were their pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, many thousands were the slaves of miscreant masters, who in likelihood would not forbear their servants work an hole day in a week, but exact it from them under the penaltie of many stripes; so that should any of that servile condition have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his masters work on that day, nothing could he expect but severe if not inhumane usage: and should the Christian Church have engaged herself in the vindication and justification of such contempt, it had been the high-way to have made both her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and self (even to eradication) odious, as the incendiaries of disobedience and maintainers of Anarchie. And therefore very discreetly the fathers of the Laodicean Councel, wary of giving offence,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94568:73"/>
yet willing to shew how they stood affected, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the twentie ninth canon of that Councel, <hi>that Christians should rest from labour on the Lords day, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But here it will be excepted, If the Law of God commanded their rest and cessation upon the Lords Day, the law of man enjoyning the contrary was not to be weighed: for in such cases, <note n="h" place="margin">Nullus sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jicitur legi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferioris con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1.2<hi>

            <p>I answer, Better it is indeed to obey God then man, when they command things repugnant; but it must be with this proviso, that the Law of God be fundamentall and paramount, from which there is no appeal to an higher: For if it be a positive or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law, a law of lesser caract, then Aquinas his rule must be retorted with the losse but of one letter, <hi>No man is obliged by an inferiour law against a superiour.</hi>

Because the point is tickle, and may perhaps give offence to weaker apprehensions, I will illustrate it with two examples taken out of Holy writ, where God dispenced with ceremoniall laws for a while, that the morall might be preserved inviolate. The ceremoniall law of God enjoyned the Israelites to offer such and such sacrifices, at such and such times, in such and such places; directly crosse to which,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94568:73"/>
Pharaoh their King imposed upon them such a task, as would not afford them any leisure to perform those sacred duties: Now the fundamentall law of God enjoyned them (as it doth all men) to obey their superiours in all things either simply good, or not simply evil; and betwixt this fundamentall and the other ceremoniall laws stood the contest. But what was the issue? Did God with the Israelites in this case (as Popes in their fury, by a <hi>Nos Sanctorum,</hi>

The Israelites were more and mightier then their adversaries; did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigate and spurre them on to rebell, or by assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make away their King?

            <p>The second dispensation was in the wildernesse, and that from observation of a sacramentall law: for we reade Joshua 5.5. that circumcision was omitted all that time, and the Israelites abode there 40 years. The most probable cause of this omission was, because they were every minute to watch the motion of the convoy-cloud, and to march with it; but circumcision would either retard their expedition, or hazard the lives of the infants: therefore God in mercie had rather respect to the safety of those innocents, then to his ordinance of circumcision.</p>
            <p>I could also instance in Gods dispensation during the persecution under Manasses and other idolatrous Kings, as also under the Captivitie of Babylon; in all which severall times, doubtlesse, there was a fail in many ceremoniall duties otherwise observable. The truth is, all ceremoniall laws have respect to the latitude of Jury, and the land of Canaan, as well in a morall as a literall sense; viz. they are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med onely for the Church, whilest she enjoyeth a visible and open profession of her religion, whilest her peace remaineth indisturbed: for when the fury of persecution hunteth her like a partridge on the mountains, when times of tribulation and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie seise upon her, God then accepteth what service she can with her own safety afford him; he standeth not upon shadows, the substance is that he onely then looketh after. Ceremonies are but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94568:74"/>
dresse of religion, onely made to decore her in publick profession, and therefore not absolutely of the essence of a Church; and so but respectively necessary: The very Sacraments themselves are but so, as the glory of our Church <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Perkins, case consc. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>q.</hi> 1.</note> hath rightly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon that fail of circumcision in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; yet Sacraments (I take it) are the highest stair and degree of ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Now these premises considered, nothing discern I to the contrary, but a constitution of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles concerning labour to be omitted on this day there might be, though not to take a full effect untill the Church should attain her land of Canaan, a settled and flourishing peace. And the event seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to prove the ordinance: for no sooner did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine (a second Joshuah or Josiah) sit sure in his throne, then Gods externall worship began to be magnificently solemnized, and (as an especiall badge thereof) his day superlatively honoured both by Imperiall edict and example; and that with strict vacation from all worldly avocations: <hi>ab omni opere,</hi> from all work, so his Histriographer <note n="m" place="margin">

To this I answer, consider Paula as a subject, and then tell me how can you acquit her of the breach (I will not say of the fourth but) of the fifth precept, if Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem was within the latitude of Constantine's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; and certainly it was: for that reached <hi>Omnes Romano Imperio parentes,</hi> all men subject to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire. And if this Lady was not within the verge of the dispensation, for that was for husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94568:75"/>
onely, was not then this her act a disobedience to her Princes law, and therefore her example no rule of those times, it being it self irregular. Besides, S. Hierome telleth us of religious persons of the other sex, Monks, that they did <hi>orationi tantùm, &amp; lectionibus vacare,</hi> busie themselves in prayer and reading on the Lords day. Now consider Paula and her Nunnes as women, and compare their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice with that of these Monks, and then if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sculine practice be not more worthy then the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, let Grammar scholars judge.</p>

                  </gap>served with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from all work.</hi> To which I answer, There are two things which Gregorie here reproveth in the observation of the Dominicall Day: first a Jewish not a moderate and sober restraint; and this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for in the very same epistle he saith, <note n="r" place="margin">Dominico die à labore cessandum est, &amp; omni modo oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> 
               <hi>On the Lords day we must cease from labour, and by all means attend our prayers</hi>; secondly, the celebrating it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Sabbath, for it is <hi>Diem Dominicum &amp; Sabbatum,</hi> the Lords Day and Sabbath both, which was the errour of the Ebionites. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gregorie, for ought I see, standeth their friend no more then Hierome. This Gregory was a man of the sixth Centurie, an age wherein themselves acknowledge this restraint took deep root, and so it continued successively downward, even to the times of Reformation; nor did the first Reformers, those of our Church especially, exercise themselves in varying any thing at all in this point from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94568:76"/>
practice, as may appear both in the statute and canon laws both of this and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</p>
            <p>But hitherto I have onely insisted upon restraint from labour and servile work, there is yet another question concerning restraint, not from work, but play, and from recreations, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (such as are at other times lawfull) are tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and lawfull on the Lords day.</p>
            <p>To this I answer in short, All recreations at other times lawfull are interdicted on this day, but such whereby the mind is better disposed towards the sanctification of the day, or such as are no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to that sanctification. For the day is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be sanctified, that is to be an holy, not a playday: and it is a rule in the decalogue and all other divine laws, that where any thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done, all things subservient to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it are consequently enjoyned, as also all lets and hinderances prohibited.<note place="margin">

Nor is it enough that these recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be not an hindrance to publick exercises in the Church, but they must not disturb even private du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at home, as meditation, prayer, holy confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp;c. For God commandeth not the sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of some few houres, but of a day, that is an hole day, allowing sufficient time for repose and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past to the body. And so our Church <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note> interpreteth the command: <hi>Gods obedient people,</hi> saith she, <hi>should use the Sunday holily, and rest from their common and

These arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are it seemeth called in; for what reason I not dispute: sure I am the nulling of them was very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the disciples and followers of Arminius (<hi>Men too bold and frequent in these Dominions</hi>

            <p>As an appendix to this discourse of recreations, if now my opinion be demanded concerning his Majesties book, I shall say of that onely this, His Princely intentions were therein (I doubt not) pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough; not so, I fear, theirs who first suggested the convenience and fitnesse of that liberty unto him. But in regard the foundation thereof seemeth especially to be the preserving in observation <hi>Encae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> or Church dedications, of them I shall say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, perhaps not known to all. Of their first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution (innocent enough) I will not speak nor trouble my self and you in shewing by what grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they ceased to be what they ought, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came what they ought not; of their corrupt and degenerate estate I purpose onely to give you some small hint, collected from what I have read, and partly from what I have seen.</p>
            <p>First therefore you must understand, there were in the late times of superstition and blindnesse in our Church (in our Church I say, for in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys I confesse they were united) two feasts, <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nechmi,</hi> very near resembling one the other; one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <hi>the Feast of Dedication,</hi> the other, <hi>the Feast of the Patrone</hi> or <hi>Church Holiday</hi>: the impious and profane fooleries were almost the same and common to both, onely the Feast of the Patrone had this peculiar to it, The idol or image of the Patrone richly deckt and drest was set forth upon a table near the Church doore, to the view of the People,

            <p>But the first spark of light which shone in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Reformation soon quitted the world of this grosse abuse: King Henry the eighth, <hi>anno</hi> 1536 amongst other things, enjoyning that this Feast of the Patrone of every Church, commonly called <hi>the Church Holiday,</hi> should be no more observed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm. The Feasts of Dedication indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued still, yet much eclipsed in their former wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abominable solemnity; for whereas before the custome was for divers vicine Parishes to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselves together there where the Feast of Dedication was to be held, to feast and riot in the very Churches, to erect stalls for pedlars in the Churchyard, to spend the hole day in swinish swill, lascivious wantonnesse, in cudgellplay-matches, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94568:77"/>
in the true service of Satan; and because every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall Church had its proper Sunday whereon the Feast was kept, and it was rare by reason thereof to have a Lords Day observed (especially in summer time, wherein these Feasts are most frequent) with any tolerable devotion and exercise of Piety, it was therefore by the same Prince strictly injoyned,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicto.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That the Feasts of Dedication of Churches should in all places of the Realm be celebrated upon the first Sunday in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for ever, and upon none other day.</hi> The scope of this King was doubtlesse to restrain the disordered licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse of the people on this day, being occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their joynt resort to other Parishes where these Feasts were observed; and in this I cannot but commend that Declaration of his sacred Majesty, which restrained and prohibited that disorder so far as in it lay. Had there been due inquiry made into the violation of his Majesties will in this, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment inflicted upon the offendours, great I dare say had been the good it would have produced: but through generall impunity, and the perverse cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humane nature, chusing in every thing that which serveth its own (though never so inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate) ends, and neglecting the rest, his Majesties godly purpose was (I know) much abused, and Gods sacred Day not lesse dishonoured. And for proof thereof, I will give you a Relation of mine own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topsie, of what these eyes saw. It was some few years since my fortune to visit a kinsman (seated in a countrey where these Feasts are frequent) upon a saturday, and though I purposed to depart that day, yet he importuned and prevailed with me to repose
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94568:78"/>
my self with him the ensuing Lords Day. I did so, and as dutie required, in the morning I accompanied him to Church: A full assembly there was; service being read, the preacher, a man of no mean note or degree,<note place="margin">Nè tantum nefas non ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re fieret, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2.24.</note> maketh a sermon, <hi>lest such profanation should want its due ceremony,</hi> upon this Text, <hi>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better for a man then that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul to enjoy good in his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi> he insisted his hole time upon the lawfulnesse of Feasting, and of Christian liberty in the use of the creatures; and to give him his due, nothing did he deliver amisse: something I grant he might, nay ought to have added, as in setting down the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Christian Feast, and in opening to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his Majesties will and pleasure concerning these Feasts, which certainly gave them not so free a scope as they took. Well, the sermon ended and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation dismissed, in our return home I inquired of my kinsman the occasion of that Text; he told me it was the Feast of dedication of their Church. Home we went, took a moderate repast, and scarce had we dined before the bells summoned us to Church, whither with all convenient speed we hasted; and being come, behold the congregation, which in the morning amounted to about nine or ten score, could not (except the family we brought with us) make up now so many single persons: as the congregation was thinne, so was the service suitable, being posted over in great haste. After this service, I was much requested by my kinsman to accompany him to the place of rendez-vous where the Feast was kept; many denials had I given him, as fearing to be a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94568:78"/>
spectatour of Gods dishonour, and did partly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse as much, but he assured me I should find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but honest and innocent disport: at length, I confesse not without much inward conflict, I yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him (and the rather out of a desire to inform my self of the manner of those Feasts, whereof I had heard much talk) So I accompanied him to the green which was the scene of their pastime, where loe we beheld a multitude of people, the muster whereof could not be lesse then a thousand. The main pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of that assembly was to give testimony of their manhood by wrestling, cudgel-play, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that end a confederacy, league and siding of the neighbour towns, so many against so many) which exercises imployed the body, and greater part of that multitude: but they who listed not to be either spectacles or spectatours wanted not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to entertain themselves, there being an ale-house by. The disorders of that meeting by drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, swearing, malicious reviling one the other, which may easily be conceived, I purpose not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; that which I offer to consideration is, whether there was not by this assembly a great affront to his Majesties royall Declaration, which prohibited all concourse of people out of their own parish, yea or in their own parish untill Evening Prayer were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when as I dare say there were near a thousand of this meeting, which were not of the parish where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was held, and of those not fourtie (I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) had been present at Evening service; for how could they in regard some of them came foure or five, most two or three, and all at least a mile off?

which abuse of our Princes pleasure is I think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignly meritorious of severe punishment, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof I leave to those whom it concerneth.</p>
            <p>Having thus stated the Dominicall Day, having proved it to be a Day divinely instituted, a Day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, a Day holly to be appropriated to sacred duties, I have finished my last part, and in that (my imperfect way) perfected what I first intended. Which done, my earnest sute is that my Christian perusers would fervently pray that this work under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for the honour of my Lord and blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Day may through his merits <hi>So much</hi> (to speak with devout Salvian) <hi>avail the Authour with God,</hi>
