            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Shall have all the Reaſon
in the World to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the Injuſtice of
the Public, if my Charitable
Deſign in Publiſhing this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Treatiſe be look'd upon as
an effect of my Vanity, or
an Arrogant Undertaking to
preſcribe Rules to Phyſicians.
I am ſenſible of the vaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
we owe for
<pb facs="tcp:40916:3"/>
the daily and important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
they make in that
uſeful Art; and that they do
not ſtand in need of any
Light to direct 'em, but what
they acquire by their own
Experience and Studies. I
never entertain'd a Thought
of controverting the juſt
Right they are poſſeſs'd of,
to give Laws to the reſt of
Mankind; nor was ever
guilty of the leaſt Intention
to diſſwade my Readers from
following the Inſtructions of
their lawful Guides: My on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Deſign was to ſerve the
Neceſſities of thoſe, who,
tho' they are not profeſs'd
<pb facs="tcp:40916:3"/>
Phyſicians, are nevertheleſs
Maſters of a ſufficient Stock
of Senſe and Judgment, and
are neither too ſcrupulouſly
fond, nor unreaſonably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent
of their Health; for
'tis eertain that the two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
Extremities are equally
to be avoided upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.
I hope I ſhall eaſily
obtain pardon for retaining
ſome Terms of Art, when
the Subject cou'd not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
handl'd without 'em,
eſpecially ſince I have always
taken care to explain 'em. I
never intended to court any
Approbation but that of the
Candid Reader; and I ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:40916:4"/>
think my ſelf abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compens'd
for all my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40916:13"/>
This is the Opinion of <hi>Plato, Socrates, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
and, in a Word, of all the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers:
But, according to <hi>des Cartes,</hi> and
other modern Writers, the Inſtinct of Beaſts
is a certain Principle, which is the cauſe of
all their Actions, juſt as the Wheels of a
Watch make it point out and ſtrike the Hours;
for, according to the Moderns, Beaſts are
nothing but a ſort of Clock-Work, or meer
Machines: But this Opinion begins to loſe
Ground, as well as others.</p>
                     <p>This being premis'd, we may define the
Inſtinct of Animals to be a Power of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting;
which is, as it were, the Cauſe of the
Actions that contribute to their Preſervation,
which we commonly aſcribe to their Inſtinct
And may not Man then have ſuch a Principle,
which in him may be the Cauſe of the like
Actions? if we conſider him purely as an
Animal, for, <hi>Abſtrahentium non eſt mendaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
ſay the Philoſophers, we may preſume
that Man, as well as the Beaſts, acts by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
for his own Preſervation.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon and Experience confirm this Truth;
for it cannot be deny'd, that Man in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
while Reaſon is clogg'd and obſcur'd
by the Imperfections of the Organs of his
Body, does many things which are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to him, and which can not proceed
but from that Principle which is common
to him with the Beaſts, ſince at that time he
has no uſe of his Reaſon; for we find that
an Infant, aſſoon as 'tis born, applies it ſelf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40916:13"/>
to the Nipple which is preſented to it by the
Mother or Nurſe, and ſucks out the Milk,
without conſidering that it wants it for its
Nouriſhment. And ſoon after, when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of his Senſes are ſtrengthen'd, and when
he begins to fix his Eyes upon ſuch Objects
as preſent themſelves to his ſight, do not we
ſee that he endeavours to avoid thoſe that
are diſagreeable to him; that he cries and
is troubled when an unknown or deform'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
takes him out of his Nurſe's Arms?
And is it not plain that theſe are the Effects
of Inſtinct, ſince Beaſts do the ſame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Light of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But we are not only guided by Inſtinct
during our Infancy, for we are ſenſible of it
even in the Vigour of our Age. How often
does it happen that while our Thoughts are

ſince there is no Effect that does not depend

which can hardly be allow'd to Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Reaſon enables a Man to chooſe,
out of many Remedies, that which he knows
to be the moſt proper for himſelf; whereas
all other Animals of the ſame Species, uſe the
ſame Remedies, becauſe they are not capable
of making ſo nice a Diſtinction.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; as 'tis plain that certain Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of Time, and other Circumſtances, have
a conſiderable influence upon the Effect of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
it muſt alſo be acknowledged as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
owing to Reaſon, that a Man who has made
uſe of the ſame Remedies at different times,
when he comes to reflect upon their various
Effects, is able with more exactneſs and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to chooſe fit Opportunities to ſecure or
promote their Succeſs. 'Tis thus that many
Husbandmen, Labourers, and other Country
People preſerve their Health for the ſpace of

Age, without having need of any but their
own Internal Phyſician, that is, their natural
Inſtinct, and the Light of their Reaſon, which
admoniſhes 'em to avoid Debauchery, Exceſs,

                     <p>The <hi>Temperate</hi> Conſtitution is that which
is compoſed of a due and convenient Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the four firſt Qualities, either accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

or according to the <hi>Quality, ad juſtitiam,</hi> fit
for every Faculty to perform its Operations
aright. I leave it to be decided by my more
Learned and Experienc'd Brethren, whether
they ever met with ſuch a Conſtitution in their
Practice.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Intemperate</hi> Conſtitution is that in which
there is an Exceſs of one or more Qualities
above the <hi>Temperate;</hi> and it is twofold,
<hi>viz. Simple</hi> and <hi>Compound.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Simple</hi> is that which is cauſed by the
Exceſs of any one Quality, <hi>viz. Hot, Cold, Dry,</hi>
or <hi>Moiſt</hi> ſeparately.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Compound</hi> is that which is produc'd by
the Exceſs of two or more Qualities: Thus
<hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Moiſture</hi> conjunctly make a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine</hi>
Conſtitution, which anſwers to Adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcency
and the Spring; <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Dryneſs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with Youth; Choler, and the Summer;
and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Intemperate</hi> Conſtitution, as well <hi>Simple</hi>
as <hi>Compound,</hi> may be either Healthful or
Sickly, Equal or Unequal, with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſince theſe Diſtinctions
wou'd engage me in unprofitable Debates, I
refer the Reader to thoſe Authors who have
treated on that Subject.</p>
                     <p>And tho' the Knowledge of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be of ſome uſe, to diſcover the
Inclinations of Men, and many Diſeaſes to
which they are ſubject, I will chuſe rather
to ſay with a late Author, that there are
but two ſorts of Perſons, one that are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40916:16"/>
endow'd with a healthy and ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
and the other with a feeble and
weak Conſtitution, who are almoſt always
ſick, and enjoy but very little Health.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a great Advantage to be naturally
well-diſpoſed both in Body and Mind; for
ſuch a Perſon may enjoy a perfect Health
by leading a regular Life: But when one is
naturally of an ill Conſtitution, he loſes his
Health as often as he neglects the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
of his <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> and conſequently muſt
lead a very troublſome and uneaſie Life.</p>

Of the bad Effects which it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
both in the Body and Mind;
and of its Remedies.</head>
                           <p>THere are very few Perſons who are not
acquainted with Melancholy, either by
Reaſon or Experience, ſince the Life of Man
is a continual Revolution of Proſperity and
Adverſity; and the Oppoſitions betwixt
thoſe two Conditions, excite in us contrary
Motions, and very different Paſſions. That
Tranquillity of Mind which accompanies good
Fortune, is very proper to preſerve the Health;
for tho' the Mind and the Body are of a
different Nature, yet they have an Affinity,
which keep 'em in ſuch Dependance one to the
other, that there is nothing regularly done in
the whole Compoſition, unleſs it be carry'd
on by an equal Combination of the two
Parts.</p>
                           <p>All our Actions are perform'd by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Vital and Animal Spirits; and
'tis their Commerce which maintains that
perfect Union, between the Heart and the
Brain, which are the principal Organs of the
Body. For 'tis plain that the Brain cannot
produce the Animal Spirits, unleſs the ſubtil
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40916:17"/>
parts of the Blood be convey'd thither through
the Arteries; and that the Heart, which is
a Muſcle, hath not power by its continual
Motion, to diffuſe the Blood through the
whole Body, but by the aſſiſtance of the
Animal Spirits: Now when the Mind is
ſerene and undiſturb'd, that all the Parts may
be ſenſible of her Impreſſions, ſhe furniſhes
'em with a ſufficient quantity of Spirits, to
enable 'em to perform their reſpective A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                           <p>But, on the other hand, when the Mind
is agitated with a Croud of diſmal Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
that give Entrance to Grief and
Melancholy, ſhe is perpetually ruminating on
the Cauſes of her Diſaſters, and endeavouring
with all imaginable Application, to remove
'em, which muſt needs occaſion a vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Spirits. So that all the Animal
Spirits which are generated in the Brain, are
ſcarce able to ſupply thoſe Parts which are
ſubſervient to the deſigns of the Soul, in
the performance of thoſe haſty Motions ſhe
requires from 'em; and conſequently ſince
ſo large a quantity of the Spirits flows into
the Nerves, that are beſtow'd upon thoſe
Parts, there are but few left for the other
Nerves: Now the Parts which help to change
or digeſt the Aliments, and are ſubſervient
to all the Actions which are call'd Natural,
being of no uſe to the Paſſions, 'tis plain
that the Nerves which go to thoſe Parts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but few Spirits from the Brain, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40916:17"/>
conſequently that their Fibres are very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mov'd, and their Actions diſorderly and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular;
ſo that the Excrements can hardly
be expell'd; and their too long continuance
in the Guts is the immediate Cauſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                           <p>We may add, that the great diſſipation of
the Animal Spirits, when the Soul is vex'd
and diſturb'd, is the occaſion that a greater
quantity of Blood than uſual is ſent from
the Heart to the Brain, to make up the Loſs
of thoſe Spirits; and conſequently the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
of all the other Parts is both much
leſſen'd and chang'd as to its quality. For
'tis always the beſt part of the Blood that
runs to the Brain, and the Body is depriv'd
of its beſt Nouriſhment, particularly the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
Parts, which are weakned and dry'd
up, for want of fit Matter to preſerve them;
and this Inconveniency reaching the Inteſtines,
as well as all the other Parts, 'tis certain that
they cannot expel the Excrements with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
by their Vermicular or Periſtaltick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being depriv'd of the Animal Spirits,
by whoſe Aſſiſtance they were moved.</p>
                           <p>We alſo ſee, that thoſe who are naturally
of a melancholy and peeviſh Humour, who
apply themſelves to ſtudy, or to other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
which require much application,
are uſually lean, and ſubject to be often Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive,
and commonly fancy themſelves to be
extremely ſick, before they have the leaſt

of an afflicted Mind: For as it is eaſie for
thoſe on whom Fortune ſmiles, to comfort

                           <p>As for Example; if a Man was entirely
ruin'd, or reduc'd to extreme want by a litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Action enter'd againſt him by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40916:18"/>
a grave Philoſopher might indeed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
him that the Eſtate he had loſt was
tranſitory and periſhable, and that he ought
not to have ſettl'd his Affections on it, neither
as a <hi>Man,</hi> becauſe he ſhou'd have conſider'd
that he muſt have left it ſooner or later;
nor as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe as ſuch he ought
not to look upon ſuch fleeting Enjoyments as
his Portion, but upon thoſe which are Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting?
Theſe are certain and undoubted
Truths, but wou'd not, in all probability quiet
the Mind of a Perſon in ſuch Circumſtances,
or make him forget his Loſs. And 'tis no leſs
certain that the Recovery of his Eſtate wou'd
be the moſt effectual Expedient to reſtore the
Tranquility of his Mind.</p>
                           <p>Grief may be alſo occaſion'd by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cauſes, which are no leſs without our
power, and beyond the reach of Medicines,
than the former.</p>
                           <p>But that which ſeems to be peculiar to this
troubleſome Diſtemper, is, that whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſtempers are commonly cur'd by things
that are contrary to 'em; that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this, commonly augments, rather
than abates the Diſtemper.</p>
                           <p>For a Man who is drowned in Sorrow is
incapable of taking Pleaſure in any thing;
and Joy, which is oppoſite to his Grief, is
ſo far from eaſing him, that he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to perceive the leaſt appearance of it in
another.</p>

                              <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40916:19"/>
'Twou'd be needleſs then to attempt the
Cure by endeavouring to divert his Thoughts;
and therefore, (in expectation that Time,
which is the only Phyſician in ſuch Caſes,
may heal the Wounds of his Mind, or ſome
of thoſe unexpected Revolutions, to which all
the World is ſubject, may put an end to the
Cauſe of his Sorrow) we muſt content our

                           <p>DEbauchery conſiſts chiefly in two things,
<hi>viz.</hi> in exceſs of Drinking and Eating,
and in the immoderate uſe of the Pleaſures

and ſhorten their Days, even tho' they be

                     <head type="sub">Of Exceſs in Drinking and Eating.</head>
                     <p>THAT we may comprehend the manner how
Diſeaſes are occaſion'd by exceſs in Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Drinking, we muſt examine the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Stomach and Guts in converting
the Food into Chyle: for if we conſider that
all the Fibres which compoſe the Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of thoſe Parts, are as it were ſo many ſmall
Springs, being which ſucceſſively ſlacken'd and
contracted, keep the Food in a continual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which, with the aſſiſtance of diſſolving
Acids, attenuates, bruiſes, and entirely changes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40916:20"/>
its Nature. Now 'tis plain that theſe Springs
may loſe their force and activity by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Preſſure and diſtenſion, occaſion'd by
an exceſſive quantity of Food, which fills the
Spaces that are formed by their Turnings
and Windings, even as the Springs of our
Machines are ſtopt when their Relaxation is
hinder'd by a ſtrong Preſſure: For as a
Bow cannot long retain its Spring if it be
kept continually bent, and the fineſt Machine
in the World will decay inſenſibly if it be
not diligently kept in Order, ſo the moſt
vigorous Stomach may be ſpoil'd by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-proportion'd
quantity of Food, becauſe
the Fibres both of that and of the other
Parts which help Digeſtion, are either broken,
or ſo weaken'd by a continual Extenſion, that
they cannot afterwards contract and expand
themſelves, either to concoct the Food, or to
expel the Excrements that are ſeparated from
it: Now Indigeſtion and the Stoppage of the
Excrements in the Body, are, in a great
meaſure, the immediate Cauſes of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſuppoſe that the Stomach, tho
loaded with Food, may nevertheleſs be able
to digeſt it when the Body is very ſtrong and
vigorous, what muſt be the conſequence of
ſuch a Digeſtion, but that the redundant Chyle
flowing out of the Stomach, and not being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Milky-Veſſels of the <hi>Meſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi>
muſt remain in the ſmall Guts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
paſs with the Excrements into the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40916:20"/>
greater, where it muſt quickly be corrupted,
for want of a ſufficient ferment to keep up
its Motion, and conſequently muſt of neceſſity
corrupt the Excrements, and occaſion all thoſe
Diſorders which ſhall be mentioned in the
Chapters that treat of the immediate Cauſes of
Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>We ought therefore diligently to avoid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in Drinking and Eating; and for that
reaſon 'tis neceſſary that every one ſhould be
acquainted with his own Conſtitution: As
for Example; the Cholerick have occaſion to
eat oftener than the Phlegmatick, becauſe
thoſe are much hotter than theſe, and the
Heat not meeting with Matter to digeſt, takes
hold of the Alimentary Juice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
inſenſibly weakens the principal parts of
the Body.</p>
                     <p>Whoever enjoys a perfect Health, ought
to uſe indifferently every thing that is fit to
Nouriſh him, eſpecially when he has obſerv'd
that any particular ſort of Food is endu'd
with all the neceſſary Qualities; as firſt,
when it is agreeable to the Taſte; for
when the Stomach loaths any particular
kind of Meat, tho' at the ſame time it be
very good and wholſome, we ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from it, becauſe it will infallibly
either cauſe Indigeſtion, or provoke Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> When 'tis eaſily digeſted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
occaſioning either a ſlackneſs or ſtraitneſs
in the Belly: Theſe are the ſureſt Marks of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40916:21"/>
wholſome Food; and there remains nothing
more to be obſerv'd, but that the Quantity
muſt always be moderate. We muſt then,
to preſerve our Health, eat when we are
hungry, and drink when we are thirſty, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is proper to be eaten or drunk, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
forcing Nature, and without either ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or cloying our Stomachs.</p>

                     <p>THIS ſort of Intemperance is no leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

I need not mention thoſe infamous Marks

ſimple and virulent, <hi>Phimoſis, Paraphimoſis,</hi>
Excreſcencies, Bubo's, and in a Word, the

Nations, tho' none of 'em are willing to own
it as a Native, theſe are the uſual Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and the juſt Rewards of unbridl'd
Luſt. But beſides, it is certain that the
immoderate uſe of thoſe Pleaſures diſſipates
the Spirits, extremely weakens the Brain,
robs the Nerves, and Membranous Parts
of their proper Nouriſhment, is fatal to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40916:21"/>
thoſe who have a weak Breaſt, heats and

Fibres.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore neceſſary to moderate the
Pleaſures of Love, if we wou'd preſerve our
ſelves from irrecoverable Ruine; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in our amorous Inclinations, we
ought to conſult our Strength, and never to
give a full career to our eager Deſires.</p>
                     <p>We muſt be entirely Maſters of our ſelves,
that we may be able, upon Occaſion, to curb

fooled the wiſeſt Heads, and baffled the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt
Vertue; ſince the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi>

                     </p>

puzzl'd than when ſhe attempts to calm the
impetuous Motions of Love, that are ſtirr'd
up in us by an infinite Number of Objects,
and after a thouſand ſeveral ways.</p>
                     <p>To make our ſelves Maſters of this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we muſt not only be poſſeſt of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken

                     </p>
                     <p>This Conſideration obliges me to adviſe
all unmarry'd Perſons to abſtain entirely from
the Pleaſures that are propos'd to them by
this Paſſion, provided their ordinary Food
be not too Juicy and provocative, ſuch as
new-laid Eggs, Capons, Partridges, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,
Pigeons, Artichokes, Aſparagus, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
all ſorts of Salt and Pepper'd Meats;
as alſo ſome kinds of Pulſe, becauſe of their
Windineſs, as Peaſe and Beans; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch Perſons muſt content themſelves
with leſs Nouriſhing Food, and cool their
Bodies more or leſs, according to their Age
and Conſtitutions; which they may do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eaſily by conſulting their Phyſicians; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
they may, by abſtaining entirely

obnoxious to many Diſeaſes, as Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
of Urine, the Gravel, Stone, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
Faintings, the Jaundice, and Green-Sickneſs.</p>
                     <p>'Tis certain that an exceſſive uſe of the
Pleaſures of Love is more dangerous than an
entire abſtinence from them; for the Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Blood ending ſooner or later with
Age, the Paſſions are extinguiſh'd with it,
and the Calm we enjoy after the Storm,
makes us ſoon forget all the Pain we ſuffer'd
to reſiſt it: whereas the Inconveniencies that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40916:22"/>
remain after the immoderate uſe of thoſe
Pleaſures, ſuch as the trembling of the
Nerves, Palſie, Shortneſs of Breath, Phthiſis,
Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make us pay very dear, in a

                     <p>THE Blood, which is the Treaſure of Life,
when it exceeds either in Quantity or
Quality, may prove the Cauſe of Death
when there is more than a ſufficient quantity
of it in the Body, which we call a <hi>Plethora,</hi>
or a fulneſs of Blood; or when it hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
ſome bad Quality, which we call <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymia,</hi>
or a depravation of the Humours:
<hi>Bleeding</hi> deſtroys or removes the former, and
<hi>Purging</hi> the latter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40916:23"/>
We may eaſily comprehend how Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
may be occaſion'd meerly by the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Blood, if we reflect upon the
Diſpoſition of the Organs which contain and
convey the Blood, and conduce to its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>In order to this we may compare the Veins
and Arteries of our Bodies to the Pipes of a
Fountain, the firſt of which, or thoſe that
are next the Spring-head, are very big and
large, but grow inſenſibly ſmaller as they
ſpread themſelves into Branches; ſuppoſing,
for Example, that the firſt gives paſſage to a
Foot of Water, and that the laſt do not give
paſſage to above an Inch. The ſame Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
may be apply'd to the Blood-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
                     <p>The Arteries which proceed from the Heart
are very large, and are divided into others
of a middle bigneſs; theſe again are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into ſmaller Branches which are ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
ſubdivided, till they become ſo ſmall,
that they are uſually call'd <hi>Capillarie</hi> (or Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)
and <hi>Inviſible.</hi> And in all parts of the
Body where theſe inviſible Arteries are found,
they meet with very ſmall Veins, which grow
larger as they meet, and join with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and return at length to the Heart,
where they terminate, and are as large as the
Arteries at their coming out of the Heart.
Now the Blood flows thro' all thoſe Pipes,
and the Heart directs its Motion, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-Maker
directs that of the Water in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40916:23"/>
Pipes of the Fountain. And as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
that the Water-Pipes are either ſtopt
or broken when a Body that is Bulky e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to fill up the Paſſage enters with the
Water, or a greater quantity of Water than
they can contain; ſo the Blood-Veſſels are
frequently obſtructed, and ſometimes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
when the Liquor they contain is either
redundant, or thicker than it ought to be,
from whence proceed Fevers, Ebullitions of
the Blood, Abſceſſes or Impoſtumes, both
in the inward Parts, and upon the Surface of
the Body, Bleeding at the Noſe, and other
Parts, Apoplexies, Suffocating Defluxions, and
Obſtructions of the Intrals, which make way
for an infinite Number of Diſeaſes. But if
the Abundance of Blood may be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as the Cauſe of ſo many Diſtempers,
'tis certain that the depravation of it may
produce a far greater Number of more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
and dangerous Diſeaſes.</p>

Diſeaſes; 'twill be convenient to give
the Reader a comprehenſive View of this fatal
Source of Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>The Meat which we eat receives its firſt
Change in the Mouth, by the help of the
Teeth, which are as it were ſmall natural
Knives, to mince it; and of the Spittle,
which may not improperly be ſaid to ſerve
inſtead of Salt, to help its Concoction. From
the Mouth 'tis carry'd through a long Chanel,
which Anatomiſts call the <hi>Oeſaphagus</hi> or Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
into a ſpacious Cavity, call'd the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi>
where either by a proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Vertue belonging to that Part, or by
the help of an Acid, or ſome other Ferment
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40916:24"/>
which it meets with there, 'tis chang'd into
a liquid and greyiſh Subſtance, which they
call <hi>Chyle.</hi> Then continuing its Journey
downwards, it goes out of the Stomach by
its inferiour Orifice, and ſlips into the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part of the Inteſtines, to the ſeveral Parts
of which Anatomiſts have given different
Names, according to certain Remarks and
Obſervations they have made upon theſe
Parts.</p>
                     <p>The firſt part, which in the diſſection of
ſeveral Animals, they found to be about
twelve Inches long, is call'd the <hi>Duodenum;</hi>
that which follows, which ſome pretend is
not ſo full as the reſt, is term'd the <hi>Jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi>
that which conſiſts of moſt Folds is
call'd the <hi>Ileon;</hi> and ſo of the reſt. The
greateſt part of this Inteſtine is faſten'd about
a Part, which by reaſon of its Folds or Plaits,
reſembles thoſe Ruffs that were formerly worn
about the Neck, and is call'd the <hi>Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:</hi>
Its Figure renders it very apt to retain
in a ſmall ſpace a conſiderable part of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine,
which is variouſly wound or twiſted
about its Folds.</p>
                     <p>'Tis in this part of the Inteſtines that the
moſt uſeful part of the Chyle inſinuates it ſelf
into the Mouths of certain Veſſels, call'd the
<hi>Lactean</hi> or <hi>Milky,</hi> which run along between
the Membranes of the Meſentery. And the
groſſer Particles, which cannot enter into the
Branches of thoſe Veſſels, continuing their
Courſe, deſcend from that part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40916:25"/>
which is fix'd to the Meſentery,
and enter into the great Guts, where they
are ſtopt.</p>
                     <p>This being premis'd, I proceed to ſhew
that the remaining part of the Chyle, which
is properly an Excrement, after its entry

It may by objected, that it does not ſeem
probable that the Excrements ſhou'd be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by remaining in the Body, ſince it has
been obſerv'd, that thoſe which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
long in the Body are not ſo ſtinking,
as thoſe that have lain there only ſo long as
they ought to do naturally; that Stench is
the moſt certain Mark of Corruption, and
that conſequently the longer they ſtay they
ought to ſtink the more, if they corrupted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
to the time of their continuance
in the Guts.</p>
                     <p>But the reaſon why the Excrements ſtink
leſs when they have remain'd long in the
Guts, is, becauſe their Humidity is diſſipated
by the continu'd Action of the Heat; for
the moiſt Particles being rarify'd and ſubtiliz'd
by the Heat, exhale from the Maſs of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
and finding, as I obſerv'd before, the
Pores of the Veſſels which environ the great
Guts, diſpoſed to receive 'em, they ſlip into
theſe ſmall Paſſages, and produce an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in all the Blood that paſſes that way,
which makes it degenerate from its natural
State; and therefore it will not follow that
the Excrements which are retain'd are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from Corruption, becauſe their
Smell is not ſo offenſive, but that the Heat ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conſum'd all the Moiſture that was on
their Surface, and having dry'd, or rather
burnt it up, they cannot be ſuppos'd to yield
ſo noiſome a Smell as before thoſe Steams
were exhal'd.</p>

For a ſatisfactory Anſwer to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we muſt examine whether the Liver is
able to purge the Blood of all its Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
now 'tis certain that the Liver alone is
not able to perform ſo great a Task, ſince
the Spleen, Reins, and other parts, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the ſame uſe, and ſince the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſerves properly to purge the Blood on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Bile.</p>
                     <p>It will not then follow, when the Blood
is infected with corrupt Particles, that ſlip
into the Veſſels which environ the great
Guts, that in its paſſage thro' the Liver,
it throws off all its Infection upon that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral,
becauſe that Part being only proper
to ſeparate the Bile, 'tis probable that
the Corpuſcles which inſinuated themſelves
into the Veſſels of the Inteſtines, being of
another Figure than thoſe of the Bile,
may paſs thro' the Liver with the reſt
of the Blood, without any Stoppage or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place we muſt conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſmall quantity of bad Blood which
paſſes thro' the minute Veſſels of the Gut
<hi>Colon,</hi> is able to communicate its ill qualities
to all the Blood of the Body.</p>
                     <p>To this ſecond Difficulty, I anſwer, that
ſince the Blood circulates thro' the whole
Body, 'tis plain that a great quantity muſt
paſs in one Day thro' the ſmalleſt Veſſels,
and conſequently that the Fermentation of
the Excrements which are not unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

retain'd eight Days, and ſometimes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

of Subtil Particles, which are receiv'd into

may in many Circulations corrupt ſo large
a quantity of Blood, that it may in a

the Body, may, in leſs than an Hour, ſpread
their Infection thro' the whole Maſs of the

                     <p>We may have recourſe to the firſt, when
we perceive ſome inconſiderable Symptoms of
Diſeaſes that proceed from the exceſſive
quantity of the Blood; in which caſe we may
content our ſelves with a very regular Diet,
which tho' it has not ſo quick an Operation
as Bleeding, at laſt it produces the ſame
Effect, and that without occaſioning any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable

proceed with Caution in the means we uſe to

                     <p>We muſt not begin with the quickeſt ways,

                     <p>Inſtinct has furniſh'd Animals with two ſure
and effectual Expedients to procure the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Excrements that are retain'd in the

<hi>Purgative Potions,</hi> which, 'tis probable Men

which Animals receiv'd from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:40916:28"/>
                        <hi>Bleeding</hi> and <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> which ſecond the
Effects of the former Remedies, are alſo
Leſſons which Men owe to the Brutes; and
theſe four Expedients acting either jointly or
ſeparately, are the ſafeſt and moſt effectual
Means that can be made uſe of, to hinder the
ſtoppage of the Excrements in the great Guts,
and conſequently to prevent the Diſeaſes which
proceed from ſuch Obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſie to conceive how <hi>Abſtinence</hi> or a
regular <hi>Diet</hi> may contribute to the Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Excrements, if we conſider that
thoſe Excrements are the remainders of our
Nouriſhment; That the more we eat and
drink, the more Excrements are bred in thoſe
Parts, ſo that the Evacuation of thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
wou'd be an endleſs Work, if the
empty'd Guts were preſently fill'd with the
ſuperfluities of a greedy Stomach.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time, a Diet which is only
preſcrib'd for prevention, ought not to be ſo
regular or thin as that which is enjoyn'd to
ſick Perſons.</p>
                     <p>It is known that too nice or ſparing a Diet
is prejudicial to Health, and is ſo far from aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
Nature in the Evacuation of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
that it renders her unable to expel
'em. Beſides, the Liquor which ſerves to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the Food, not finding Matter to work
upon, acts upon the parts that contain and
receive it, by drying and conſuming them.</p>

                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40916:29"/>
It may be further added, that a Man who
takes Phyſick only for prevention, does not
abſtain from Labour and Exerciſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſtands in need of Nouriſhment to repair
the expence of his Spirits.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, to prevent Diſeaſes, one ought
only to faſt moderately; at the ſame time
he ought to avoid as much as he can, eating
in Company, becauſe People are uſually wont
to eat a little more than is neceſſary; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
he ought to chuſe ſuch Aliments as will
leave but few Excrements in the Body; and
eſpecially he muſt take care never to eat
to ſatiety.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Expedient we propos'd to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Paſſage of the Excrements, is <hi>Bleeding,</hi>
which is doubtleſs one of the beſt Methods that
Nature cou'd ſuggeſt to Animals; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that beſides that there is no Remedy which
depends more abſolutely upon the Pleaſure of
the Perſon who either orders or performs it,
ſo there is none which in moſt Caſes gives
more ſpeedy relief to the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Every Surgeon knows how uſeful Bleeding
is to put a ſtop to Defluxions, and the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down of Humours, which are always
apt to fall upon wounded Parts, how effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
it is to diſſolve large Tumours, with
which Wounds are frequently accompany'd;
how powerfully it ſtops the inordinate Flux
of Blood in the Wounds of the Veſſels;
and both Surgeons and Midwives know
how helpful it is to facilitate ſo difficult a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40916:29"/>
Work. Our Buſineſs at preſent is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how it may contribute to the Expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Excrements out of the Cavities of
the great Guts.</p>
                     <p>The Expulſion of the Excrements retain'd in
the Cavities of the great Guts, is perform'd
chiefly by the Contraction of its moving Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,
aſſiſted by thoſe of the Muſcles of
the lower Belly, and by the continual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
which obliges the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> to
preſs all the Guts. All theſe Actions are
perform'd by means of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which upon ſuch Occaſions flow plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to the Parts which are the Organs of
theſe Actions. Now theſe Spirits are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
diſſipated, and that expence muſt be
repair'd by the Blood of which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
provided there be a reaſonable quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Veſſels which are appointed to
contain it; for when there is a Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
of Blood, the Spirits are as it were
ſuffocated and drown'd in the abundance of
their Matter; ſo that the beſt Office we can
do to Nature on ſuch Occaſions, is, by Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to reduce the Maſs of Blood to a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
quantity, in order to eaſe her of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
Burthen which obſtructs the liberty
of her Actions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bleeding</hi> ought always to precede <hi>Purgations</hi>
when both theſe Remedies are indicated by
the ſigns of a Redundancy, exceſſive Heat, or
Corruption of the Blood: For we find by
Experience that <hi>Purgatives</hi> operate both more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40916:30"/>
gently and effectually, when the Veſſels are
empty'd, and the exceſſive heat of the Blood
allay'd, and its Depravation corrected by
<hi>Bleeding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis further obſervable, that we ought
rather to bleed early in the Morning, than
at any other Hour of the Day; and that
when we are oblig'd to have recourſe to
this Remedy in very hot Weather, we ought
to be let Blood before the Riſing, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Setting of the Sun; and in very cold
Weather, at Noon: But, in the general, we
ought to avoid Bleeding as much as we
can, when the Seaſon is either exceſſively
hot or cold; for 'tis certain that Bleeding is
always attended with better Succeſs when theſe
Cautions are obſerv'd than when they are
neglected,</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the Age of the Patient, we
ought to bleed Infants leſs frequently, and to
take leſs Blood from them than from other
Perſons, becauſe a great part of their Blood is
conſum'd in the Nouriſhment and Growth
of their Body in all its Dimenſions: So
that from ſix Weeks or two Months after
the birth of an Infant, which is the time
at which we may begin to let him Blood,
if there be a preſſing Occaſion, to the
Age of five or ſix Years, I wou'd not take
away more than from three to ſix Ounces of
Blood: From ſix to ten or twelve Years,
you may take ſix or eight Ounces: From
twelve to fifteen, and ſo to fifty, you muſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40916:30"/>
obſerve the Signs of Repletion, and the
Strength of the Patient, and accordingly you
may take away from nine to twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Ounces of Blood.</p>
                     <p>After fifty Years of Age, we muſt be more
cautious and moderate both as to the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Bleeding, and the quantity of Blood we
take away, for fear of cauſing too great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation
of the Spirits, which from that Age to
extreme old Age are daily decaying both in
Quantity and Quality.</p>
                     <p>The viſible Signs of a Redundancy of Blood
in the Veſſels, are the large or frequent Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations
of it by the Noſe, or other parts of
the Body, the ſwelling or diſtenſion of the
Veins, Boils, Pimples, or other Eruptions, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Ebullitions or Fluſhings towards the
Skin, <hi>Eryſipela's,</hi> Inflammations of the Eyes
and Throat, a continual deſire to Sleep,
and a Wearineſs and Heavineſs of the whole
Body, not occaſion'd by any Labour or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>When you perceive all, or moſt of thoſe
Symptoms, and when they continue for ſome
time, you muſt immediately open a Vein, and
take away a large quantity of Blood; for the
ſuperfluous Blood which is not employ'd in
the Nouriſhment of the Body if it be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated,
will ſoon putrefy, and occaſion a
Fever, Obſtructions in the ſmall Paſſages of
the Inteſtines, or an Accumulation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in ſome part of the Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40916:31"/>
In fine, that we may make right uſe of
Bleeding, we ought to conſider how the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
uſually bears it; for thoſe who undergo it
eaſily, may be let Blood oftener, and more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
than thoſe who cannot bear it without
trouble and difficulty. Thus one who commonly
finds himſelf weak or faint after Bleeding, ought
rather to Bleed twice, and in ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
than to put himſelf in danger of fainting
or ſwooning away, by a large Evacuation:
For 'tis certain that Fainting and Swooning
do extremely diſturb the whole Oeconomy
of the Body, notwithſtanding the ridiculous
Opinion of thoſe who imagine that Bleeding
can never be effectual, unleſs it be continu'd
till the Patient faint away.</p>
                     <p>Bleeding without neceſſity, that is, when
there is no Superfluity to be voided, no exceſs
of Heat to be allay'd, and no Putrefaction to
be corrected, robs Nature of the pure Blood,
which is neceſſary for the Nouriſhment of the
Body, and the production of Spirits, which
are the principal Inſtruments of the Soul in
all its Actions. 'Tis plain from hence, that
after ſuch unneceſſary Evacuations, Nature
acts ſlowly and feebly, that the Entrails are
heated, and that all the Parts are dry'd up,
which makes way for a long Train of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.
It is not therefore pertinent to uſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
at all times for the preſervation of our
Health: But 'tis neceſſary before we take 'em,
that our Inſtinct ſhall let us know the neceſſity
of 'em by the preſages of ſome future Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

                     <p>All theſe Symptoms, and many others, of
which every one may have had Experience,
are ſo many ſigns to give us notice that our
Health is in danger of yielding to the Inſults
of a Diſeaſe, if we do not take care to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it.</p>
                     <p>The Inquiry wou'd be more curious than
neceſſary, to examine for what Reaſons thoſe
Symptoms give us notice of approaching
Diſtempers; for as it is ſufficient for a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
to have a Needle touch'd with a Load-Stone,
and to know that it turns always towards
a certain Pole, without being oblig'd to know
the natural Cauſe of ſo ſurprizing a <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi>
ſo 'tis alſo enough for any Body to
know that the ſigns of which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
are ſo many Fore-runners of Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
without troubling himſelf to examine
particularly why every one of theſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
is an effect of this general Cauſe;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40916:33"/>
wherefore we are forewarn'd ſometimes by
ſome of them, and ſometimes by others;
ſometimes by one alone, and ſometimes by
many: But it being generally known that
one or many of 'em, or this and that Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom,
are certain Marks of a Depravation
of the Health, we may chuſe either to wait
till the Diſeaſe appears, and afterwards cure
it with difficulty, or to prevent it eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is form'd: Now 'tis moſt certain that
a Man ſhou'd rather be his own Phyſician,
while the Diſeaſe is yet unform'd, than to
wait till it appear, that he may avoid fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into thoſe Extremities to which it may
reduce the ſtouteſt Heart, by exceſs of Pain,
impatient uneaſineſs under the Cure, and
perpetual fear of Death.</p>
                     <p>From this Principle we may infer that 'tis
not only unneceſſary, but even dangerous to
take Phyſick when we are not troubl'd with
any of thoſe Symptoms, becauſe nothing that
is able to cauſe an Alteration in the Body
can be taken without making ſome Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
on it, either good or bad: For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
the Food which we take in too great a
quantity, or which is of hard Digeſtion,
engenders a great quantity of Crudities and
Excrements, which are, as we have already
intimated, the Cauſe of moſt Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Purgative Medicines taken without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
drive the uſeful Liquors or Juices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the places where they are expell'd,
and not finding any that are ſuperfluous or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40916:33"/>
deprav'd, weakens the Fibres of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
Veins, and Arteries, by unneceſſary
Irritations, and produces an unuſual Heat in
the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>When we are forewarn'd of Diſeaſes, either
the Symptoms are many and preſſing, or
few and inconſiderable: When they are many
and our Inſtinct ſeems to redouble its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
we muſt loſe no time, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having regard either to the Seaſon of
the Year, the Age of the Moon, or the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of the Air, take ſuch Phyſick as
we think neceſſary to preſerve us from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into any Diſeaſe. But if theſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
are but ſmall, and few in Number,
ſince we know by Experience that Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
work more mildly and eaſily in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Seaſon, as in the Spring and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,
than during the exceſſive Heat of the
Summer, and great Cold of the Winter;
when the Moon is in her Wane or Declination,
than during her Increaſe; in Dry rather than
Moiſt Weather, and that they weaken the
Body much more in the Dog-Days, the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
and Equinoxes, than at other times; we
may defer the uſe of Phyſick for ſome Days,
that we may take it at a time when all
thoſe Circumſtances, or moſt of them will
be in a condition to make it ſucceed the
better.</p>
                     <p>'Tis commonly believ'd that only weak and
ſickly Perſons ought to take care to preſerve
their Health, that thoſe who are of a ſtrong
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40916:34"/>
or healthy Conſtitution, ought not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themſelves about it, becauſe Nature can
in ſtrong Bodies remove and deſtroy, by its
own Force, the Cauſes of all their Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
and becauſe Phyſick diſturbs the Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of our Body much more than it is of
uſe to ſupport it; ſince we ſee by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that moſt of thoſe imaginary ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who ſpend all their time in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of their Health, die ſooner than
thoſe who never have recourſe to Phyſick
but when they are abſolutely forc'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by ſome preſſing Diſtemper. I know that it
is dangerous to be too fond of Medicines, that is,
either to take too much, or too often; but I
may venture to affirm, that there is no Man, let
him be never ſo ſtrong and healthy, but has
ſometimes need of the help of Phyſick; for
as the beſt Water in the World leaves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſome Dregs in the Pipes thro' which
it paſſes, which gathering inſenſibly, Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thoſe who ſtand in need of the Water,
to cleanſe the Pipes, and to hinder their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quite ſtopt; ſo it is certain that the beſt
Blood that can be imagin'd to flow in a
perfectly ſound Body, will leave ſome Dregs
and Filth in the Veſſels thro' which it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to all the Parts of the Body: And theſe
Dregs gathering by degrees in the Veſſels,
hinders the free Motion of the Blood, the
interruption of which occaſions thoſe premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory
Diſorders which we call Preſages of
<hi>Inſtinct;</hi> and in this Caſe 'tis plain we ought
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40916:34"/>
to take Phyſick to prevent Sickneſs: For
it happens at laſt, that moſt of thoſe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
People, who deſpiſe all ſorts of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
under pretext of the healthineſs of their
Conſtitution, are attack'd with Diſeaſes which
are ſo much the more troubleſome and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
as their Health ſeem'd to be perfect;
ſo that oftentimes their Averſion to Phyſick coſts
'em their Life. And tho' they eſcape, they
muſt expect to ſuffer all the Incommodities
of a tedious languiſhing Diſtemper, and
will never be able to recover what they have
loſt.</p>

                     <p>AS for the way of purging by Clyſters,
'tis certain that they may be us'd at all
times when we find any Symptoms of the
Stoppage or retention of the Excrements in
the great Guts; for it being impoſſible to
make theſe Injections aſcend higher than
the Inteſtine call'd <hi>Caecum,</hi> becauſe of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles

                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:40916:35"/>
We muſt not make the taking of Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
a ſetl'd Practice or Cuſtom, as many
People do, who wou'd fanſie themſelves ſick
if they ſhou'd omit 'em two Days; for the
too frequent uſe of Clyſters, makes Nature
lazy, and the lazineſs of Nature is the fatal
Cauſe of many Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Yet I will not pretend to cenſure thoſe
who bleed and purge conſtantly in the Spring
and in Autumn, eſpecially if they be young,
vigorous, and of a full Body, if they eat much,
or live a ſedentary Life, without Motion or
Exerciſe, or if they are already habituated to
that Cuſtom; for it is certain that many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
may be prevented by this means, and
that one expoſeth himſelf almoſt infallibly to
very dangerous Diſtempers, by interrupting
this practice after he has once accuſtom'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thereto.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo be proper to take Phyſick after
a long Journey, or extraordinary Labour;
and, to conclude, we ought always to purge
once a Year, if our Inſtinct diſcovers any Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
of a future Diſeaſe; for thereby we may
prevent the great Collection of Excrements
in the great Guts, where they are always apt

Order to the Preſervation of
Health.</head>
                     <p>SINCE Health is no leſs preſerv'd by
the right uſe of Meat and Drink than
by Medicines that are able to remove the
Cauſes of our Diſtempers, the Reader muſt
remember what we hinted about Diet, that
we muſt avoid all manner of Exceſs, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from all ſorts of crude Aliments, and
ſuch as are apt either to make the Belly too
looſe or too coſtive; that every Man is able
to make a right choice and Judgment of the
Medicines that are moſt proper for him, and
that after he has found ſome that are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to thoſe Rules, he ought to prefer them
before any Remedies that may be recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him by others.</p>
                     <p>I will not repeat what I have already ſaid
about <hi>Diet,</hi> or the uſe of Aliments, which
do not deſerve the Name of Medicines, but
briefly conſider the two general ways of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to Health, <hi>viz. Bleeding</hi> and <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſince I have alſo deliver'd my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning <hi>Bleeding,</hi> and the Rules that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40916:36"/>
ought to be obſerv'd in that caſe, I ſhall
content my ſelf with referring the Reader to
what I have already ſaid on that Subject,
and only treat of the uſe of <hi>Laxatives,</hi> or
<hi>Purging</hi> Medicines.</p>
                     <p>'Tho' the Purgatives of which Clyſters are
compos'd, cannot much diſorder the Body,
yet there are ſome Meaſures to be taken in
order to the right uſe of theſe Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they ought to precede the uſe of ſuch
Purgatives as are to be taken by the Mouth,
becauſe they facilitate their Operation by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the Expulſion of the Excrements that
are retain'd in the great Guts, which wou'd
oppoſe their Paſſage, and that of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
Humours which they draw from
the Stomach, ſmall Guts, Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for as in a Woodmonger's-Yard when
People come to buy Wood for Fuel, when
one Pile is ſold, and the Woodmonger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
to sell another, ſince it wou'd be a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
trouble to climb up to the top of the
Pile to ſerve every ſingle Cuſtomer, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
the whole Pile, by drawing out five
or ſix pieces of Wood at the bottom; the
ſame effect is produc'd by Clyſters, which,
by voiding the greateſt part of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Filth retain'd in the Cells of the
Inteſtines, facilitate the Operation of purging
Potions, which finding the Paſſage free, are
eaſily able to carry off the Matter they have
ſqueez'd out of the Arteries, and the ſlimy
and groſs Humours which they bring from the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40916:36"/>
Stomach, and from the ſmall Guts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
expel the reſt of the Groſs Excrements
which they find lodg'd in the Cells of the
great Guts.</p>
                     <p>We muſt further obſerve, that the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Clyſters is very irregular; for in ſome
Perſons a Clyſter of <hi>Oxycrate</hi> will procure
wonderful Evacuations, which in others
wou'd be altogether unprofitable; and in
ſome the ſtrongeſt Clyſters will not produce
the leaſt effect: And that which operates
well at one time, will not work at all at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
wherefore we muſt learn to prepare ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſorts, obſerving, nevertheleſs, to chuſe
always ſuch as are mild and ſimple rather
than ſuch as are violent, and hard to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd.</p>
                     <p>As for Purgatives that are taken by the Mouth,
'tis better to take them by way of <hi>Infuſion</hi>
than in <hi>Subſtance,</hi> that we may ſpare the parts
thro' which they muſt paſs, a double Labour;
for beſides, that they muſt ſuffer the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Medicines that are taken in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
they muſt alſo unfold and diſentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
the Particles in which their Purgative
Vertue conſiſts, from many others of which
they are compos'd; whereas the Liquor in
which they are infus'd, imbibes only their
Purgative Particles, and, by reaſon of its flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
infinuates it ſelf more eaſily into the
ſmall Paſſages of the Body, than the groſs Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
can be ſuppos'd to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:40916:37"/>
In order to the right uſe of theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
there are four Obſervations to be
made.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, to take 'em by degrees, that
is, to begin with the moſt Mild and Simple:
But if their Weakneſs hinder their Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we muſt augment the Doſe, or take a
ſtronger Medicine, till ſuch time as the Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
be made proportionable to the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
we perceive of a greater or ſmaller
fulneſs or redundancy of Humours.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Obſervation concerns the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Paſſage, which is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
becauſe they cannot remain long in
the Body without occaſioning a violent Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the parts they touch, which may
be attended with very dangerous Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for a purging Medicine has almoſt the
ſame Operation on the parts of the Body
thro' which it paſſes, as a Spur has upon a
Horſe; becauſe as the Horſe goes faſter when
the Rider ſpurs him but once, and kicks and
winces when he keeps the Spur conſtantly in
his Sides, ſo the Purgative by its firſt Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
moves the Parts thro' which 'tis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd,
to expel the Excrements that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in 'em; but when it ſtays too long,
it enflames the Parts, and renders the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
hot and dry, and conſequently unfit for
Evacuation; ſo that its Operation is both
inconſiderable, and extremely troubleſome to
the Patient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:40916:37"/>
To avoid this Inconveniency in the uſe of
Laxatives, they ought always to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with ſome Vehicle, that is to ſay, a
Subſtance fit to inſinuate it ſelf into the
cloſeſt parts of the Body, notwithſtanding all
the Obſtructions it may meet with in the
Parts that are appropriated for ſeparating the
Humours, as the Liver, Spleen, Pancreas, and
all the Entrals.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Vehicles may be made of Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
impregnated with the ſubtil Parts of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Plants that are proper to ſlip into the
ſmalleſt Pores of the Capillary Veſſels, as are,
for Example, the Decoctions of the Roots of
<hi>wild Succory, Strawberry-Leaves, Dog-Graſs,
Agrimony, Sorrel, Chervil,</hi> and many other
<hi>Herbs</hi> which are endu'd with the ſame Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of theſe Decoctions, you may uſe
the Juice of a <hi>Limon,</hi> or <hi>Orange, Verjuice,
White-Wine, Whey,</hi> and many other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which every one may chuſe from his
own private Experience, to facilitate the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Purgatives.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Rule to be obſerv'd in the uſe
of purging Medicines, is, to chuſe ſuch as do
not make you coſtive after the uſe of 'em;
for this is the ſureſt Mark that the Phyſick
is proportionated to the Strength of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
on whom it works, eſpecially ſince 'tis
but too frequently confirm'd by Experience,
that the more violent the Medicines are, the
Patient is the more coſtive after the uſe of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40916:38"/>
them. One might inferr from hence, that
the ſame thing happens on theſe Occaſions to
the moving Fibres of the Inteſtines, as to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who being forc'd to undergo involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Labour, are ſo wearied and jaded with
their forc'd Exerciſe, that they work no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than while the Rod is over their Heads;
ſo the Fibres of the Inteſtines having been
too roughly and frequently ſhaken by the
Operation of the Medicine, are ſo weary'd
with theſe forc'd Contractions, that they cannot
afterwards perform the Motions that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the Expulſion of the Excrements
which gather daily in their Cavities; ſo that
we are obliged either to accuſtom our ſelves
to Phyſick, or, if we neglect to uſe it, muſt
expect a new Accumulation of Excrements,
which will ſoon after be the Cauſe of a new
Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; The laſt Obſervation in the
uſe of Purgatives relates particularly to thoſe
weak Medicines that produce little or no
Effect, when they are often repeated in a
little time; for the moving Fibres of the
Inteſtines are ſoon accuſtom'd to the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſuch Remedies, and become perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſenſible of ſuch feeble Irritations: Juſt
as the Organs of the Senſes are not ſenſible
of the Impreſſion of theſe Objects to which
they are accuſtom'd. In this caſe we muſt
change the Remedies, becauſe even the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Purgatives remaining in the Body, cannot
but occaſion ſome diſturbance in it.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of Purgatives, and how they operate:
Of the Time and Manner of uſing
them.</head>
                     <p>IT is certain that the Operation of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
deſtroys the moſt immediate Cauſes
of the greateſt part of our Diſeaſes, whether
they be taken inwardly, or injected by
way of Clyſters.</p>
                     <p>However, it muſt be acknowledg'd, that
the way of adminiſtring 'em occaſions ſome
difference in their Operation; for ſince Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
reach no further than the great Guts,
they can only facilitate the Evacuation of
the Excrements that are retain'd in thoſe
Inteſtines; whereas, when they are taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
they not only cauſe the ſame Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in all the Parts which they touch, and
conſequently by augmenting their Natural
Motion, haſten the expulſion of the Matter
which they contain; but many of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
mingle with the Chyle in the Veſſels
which carry it to the Heart, in which, as
well as in the Arteries, they excite divers
Fermentations, that promote the ſeparation
of the different Particles of the Blood, in the
ſeveral Parts of the Body where they are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40916:39"/>
uſually ſeparated from its Maſs, according
to the diſpoſition that each of thoſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
has, to put certain parts of the Blood
in Motion, rather than others.</p>
                     <p>Thus we may obſerve that a viſible Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
or Ebullition is produc'd in certain
Liquors, when they are mix'd with other
Fluids that are diſpos'd to put 'em in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereas they remain undiſturb'd when
they are mixt with others.</p>
                     <p>And from the Operation of Purgatives on
different parts of the Blood, there ariſes a
diſtinction of Names: For Example; ſome
are call'd ſimply <hi>Purgatives,</hi> which are again
divided into <hi>Hydragogues, Cholagogues, Melana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi>
and <hi>Phlegmagogues;</hi> or Medicines that
purge Watery Humours, Choler, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Phlegm: Others are call'd <hi>Emeties,
Sudorifics, Errhines, &amp;c.</hi> Now thoſe Names
are very fitly impos'd, either with reſpect to
the Parts of the Body thro' which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Evacuations, or to the parts of
the Blood which they are particularly apt
to put in Motion.</p>
                     <p>From hence we may obſerve, that all thoſe
Remedies are endu'd with one common
Property, that is, to excite a Motion in the
Blood; and that their different ways of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
proceed only from the different Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
or Contexture of their Parts; for by
reaſon of their peculiar Configuration, they
are more eaſily admitted into certain parts
of the Body than into others, and by the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40916:39"/>
Irritation they occaſion in the Parts, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Separation which is perform'd there,
of ſome particular Excrements from the Blood.
And upon this Score we may reaſonably ſay,
that they are proper to purge ſuch and ſuch
Parts; as for Example, ſuch as are proper to
purge the Liver, we call <hi>Hepatics;</hi> and thoſe
that are peculiarly adapted to the Spleen,
are term'd <hi>Splenetics.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, according to the various ſituation
or contexture of their Parts, they are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to agitate Certain Particles of the Blood,
to which they unite ſooner than to others:
And upon this account we may ſay that ſuch
a Medicine is proper to purge ſuch a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                     <p>This Obſervation is confirm'd by Experience,
particularly what relates to <hi>Hydragogues,</hi> or
Medicines that purge Watery Humours; for
the Evacuation of Seroſities is much more
ſenſible than that of the other Particles which
compoſe the Blood, becauſe that which the
Purgative drives into the Inteſtines, whether
it be ſeparated by the Glands of their inward
Membrane, or ſqueez'd out of the Biliary and
Pancreatic Ducts, being mixt with the Slime
and Excrements which it finds in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
it is very hard to determine what
Humour hath been chiefly wrought upon or
expell'd by the Purgative Medicine.</p>

is the Conſequence thereof.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Emetics</hi> or <hi>Vomits</hi> may be
uſeful to ſome Perſons when they are troubl'd
with an inclination to Vomit, ſuch as thoſe
who have a ſtrong and large Breaſt. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may profitably uſe <hi>Sudorifics,</hi> namely,
thoſe who are Choleric, and whoſe Pores
are very open. <hi>Diuretics,</hi> or Medicines that
provoke Urine, are proper for thoſe who feel
a heavineſs and heat in their Kidneys, ſuch
as are ſubject to the Gravel, live unmarried,
and abſtain from the uſe of Women.</p>
                     <p>Some may make uſe of ſuch as occaſion

                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40916:40"/>
Thoſe who have a weak Breaſt, and wet
Brain, may find benefit by the uſe of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
provided they have no <hi>Polypus,</hi> or other
Impediment in the Noſtrils. In a Word, every
Man ought to be directed by his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and either have recourſe to, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from ſuch ſorts of Evacuations, according
to the good or bad Effects which he finds
they produce upon him.</p>
                     <p>For Example; a Perſon who is apt to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
without any conſiderable trouble, when
he finds his Stomach over-charg'd, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
greater benefit by a Vomit than by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Purgations; whereas thoſe who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Vomit without an unuſual diſturbance,
ought rather to uſe Simple Laxatives, leaſt
the Fibres of the Stomach be weaken'd by
ſuch over-violent Motions.</p>
                     <p>Others who labour under Faintneſs or
Wearineſs, provided they be not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too dry or lean, will find themſelves eaſed
if after Bleeding they take a Medicine to
procure a moderate Sweat. The People in
the <hi>Levant</hi> by this means prevent a great
number of Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are troubl'd with Pains in their
Kidneys, and whoſe Urine is of a high Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or thick, may, after the uſe of cooling
Remedies, have recourſe to Medicines that
provoke Urine, either alone, or mixed with
Laxatives.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:40916:41"/>
Thoſe who are naturally inclin'd to Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and have a moiſt Brain, may both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and cure their Diſtempers by raiſing a
Salivation by the uſe of Remedies that are
proper to produce that Effect.</p>
                     <p>In fine, every Man ought to conſult his
own Experience, and ſtudy the Conſtitution
of his Body; and afterwards uſe thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
which he finds to be moſt uſeful and
agreeable to him.</p>
                     <p>There is one important Rule to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in the adminiſtring of all thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and that is, To begin always with
the gentleſt and moſt ſimple. It is certain that
when we uſe Remedies meerly for preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we ought to be our own Phyſicians;
for ſince the bare Preſages or Signs of a
future Diſeaſe cannot be ſuppos'd to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
us of the uſe of our Reaſon, we may
chuſe thoſe Medicines which upon trial have
formerly ſucceeded, and which cannot be ſo
well known by a Stranger as by our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it ought to be obſerv'd, that there
is nothing more various or uncertain than
the Operation of Purgatives on Humane
Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Some Perſons are violently purg'd by weak
Medicines, when a ſtronger Remedy wou'd
not produce the leaſt effect upon 'em: There
are others on whom mild Phyſick will not
work at all, and even the ſtrongeſt Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
are ſcarce effectual: On the other hand,
ſome are ſo eaſily purg'd, that a Decoction
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40916:41"/>
of Herbs will ſuffice; and to others half an
Hours Converſation in an Apothecary's Shop:
Some are purg'd by <hi>Strawberries, Cherries,
Gooſeberries, Peaches, Pears, &amp;c.</hi> Some by
ſour Milk, freſh Pork, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and others by a
moderate Entertainment with jovial Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
for Mirth contributes as much to the
Paſſage of the Excrements, as Melancholy or
Sadneſs does to their Stoppage in the Guts.</p>
                     <p>Some are purg'd by a ſimple cooling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
when they begin firſt to drink it;
and in others Clyſters produce a plentiful
Evacuation, tho' they are hardly mov'd by
internal Medicines.</p>
                     <p>To conclude; there is nothing leſs regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
than the Operation of Purges on different
Bodies; and it is impoſſible for the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Phyſician in the World to diſcover this
variety in every particular Perſon: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as I intimated before, we ought to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
our ſelves, that we may be able to chuſe
out of ſo great a number of Remedies that
have been often try'd, thoſe that are moſt
agreeable to our Bodies.</p>
                     <p>The gentleſt Purges, and thoſe that are
moſt agreeable to our Conſtution, are of two
ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome are brought to us from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries, aud others grow in our own
Climate.</p>
                     <p>The ſafeſt foreign Purgatives are <hi>Senna,
Caſſia, Tamarinds, Rubarb, Manna, &amp;c.</hi> and
the mildeſt that grow in our own Climate are
<hi>Roſes, Peach-Flowers, Violets,</hi> our Garden <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burb,</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40916:42"/>
the great and ſmall <hi>Centory, Briony, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarabacca,
Mint, Bawm, Spaniſh Broom, Thyme,

<hi>Hops,</hi> the Yellow-flower'd <hi>Flagg</hi> or <hi>Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-Luce,</hi>
the Bark of <hi>Elder,</hi> the Black <hi>Plum</hi> or
<hi>Prune, Wallwort,</hi> wild <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> and many
other Plants. You may preſs out the Juice
of theſe Herbs, or infuſe 'em, or make 'em
up into Powders, Syrups, Conſerves, Tablets,
Pills, Troches, or any other Form what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, tho' I prefer ſimple Remedies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch as are compounded, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to blame the uſe of certain Mixtures
that are common in Pharmacy; for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Sugar, or ſome other ſuch Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
cannot take away the Vertue of the
Simples.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, 'tis certain that we ought
to abſtain from all violent Remedies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Chymical Preparations, when we only
take Phyſick for prevention.</p>
                     <p>I am perſuaded that the moſt Simple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
are the beſt, and that all the Secret lies
in the right uſe of them; for as the Colours
upon a Painter's Pallet are of themſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fit to make a confus'd and diſagreeable
Mixture, ſo Medicines, eſpecially Purgatives,
are in their own Nature only fit to weaken
the Patient, and to cauſe a violent Motion
in his Blood: But, on the other hand, as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40916:42"/>
the ſame Colours placed upon a Cloth by an
Ingenious Painter, make a very valuable and
beautiful Picture, ſo the ſame Remedies,
tho they are contrary to Nature when miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply'd,
may aſſiſt her to overcome a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
when they are rightly adminiſter'd.</p>

                        <p>YOU adviſe me, Sir, ſays one to his
Phyſician, to take a Clyſter, or a Purging
Medicine, but I have no occaſion for ſuch
Remedies; I go daily and regularly to ſtool,
and why ſhou'd I be tormented with Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and Purgatives?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40916:43"/>
I anſwer, That tho a Man goes daily and
regularly to ſtool, yet it does not follow that
he ought to be exempted from Purgation
either by Clyſters and Medicines, ſince 'tis
frequently obſerv'd that thoſe who go natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to ſtool every Day, do, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
perceive by the above-mention'd Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,
that there are ſome Excrements left
behind in thoſe Paſſages which ſerve for
their Expulſion: Now 'tis plain that their
Excrements muſt be evacuated, to prevent
the Diſeaſes that proceed from the Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of theſe Impurities.</p>
                        <p>If any Perſon deſire to be ſatisfy'd how
when a Man goes daily and regularly to
ſtool, any Excrements can remain in the
great Guts;</p>
                        <p>The Anſwer is eaſie, if we remember what
has been already ſaid of the Structure of the
great Inteſtines, the Parts of which are as it
were ſo many Bags or Cavities faſten'd at
certain diſtances to thoſe Inteſtines. Now
'tis ſufficient for the Paſſage of the greateſt
part of the Excrements which are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from our daily Nouriſhment that
the middle Part of the Gut be open and
free; but in the mean time, ſome of the
Excrements may ſlip into the bottom of
thoſe Cells or Bags, and by degrees fill up
their Cavity; ſo that at laſt the middle Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
may be almoſt entirely ſtopt by thoſe
diſtended Bags; and 'tis then that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Signs of an unuſual Load and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
in thoſe Parts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40916:43"/>
This Doctrine may be further illuſtrated by
comparing theſe Obſtructions in the great
Gut to the Stoppages that happen frequently
in the Conduits that are made to convey the
Filth from our Streets; for the Dirt ſticks
by degrees to the ſides of the Pipes, and fills
up all the Holes and Cavities it meets with,
tho' it does not immediately hinder even
ſome of the thickeſt Mud to ſlip away;
ſo that unleſs they be ſometimes ſcour'd by
a pretty violent Shower, that may force a
great quantity of Water into the Cavities of
the Pipes, and by the Rapidity of its Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
carry off the Filth; they muſt be
open'd from time to time, and the ſtagnant
Dirt looſen'd, and driven forwards into the
Common Sink, by the help of Convenient
Inſtruments.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Obſervation may be apply'd
to the great Guts, both with reſpect to the
Excrements that are detain'd in its Cells,
and which paſs daily through its Cavity;
for when a great quantity of em is gather'd
in theſe Bags or Cells, and begin to corrupt
there, the preſſure of theſe diſtended Cells
upon the neighbouring Parts, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Corpuſcles which ſlip into the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
that environ them, produce the Symptoms
of an approaching Indiſpoſition tho a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
part of our daily Nouriſhment
having ſtill a free Paſſage through the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Gut, may furniſh ſufficient Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Stools. 'Tis plain then, that we have need
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40916:44"/>
of Clyſters and purging Medicines, to draw
the Excrements out of the places where they
are ſtopt; and that conſequently tho' we go
to ſtool naturally every Day, we may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſtand in need of an artificial Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

there be any Matter left to be evacuated in
a Body ſo empty as mine muſt be after ſo

                        <p>But this ſeeming Difficulty may be very
eaſily anſwer'd, for when a Man for
ſome Days has been troubl'd with a conſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Averſion to all ſorts of Nouriſhment, 'tis an
evident ſign that there is a great Collection
of Impurities in the place where we have
made it appear that they are uſually apt to
ſtop. Nor will it appear ſtrange that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſhould loſe his Appetite when the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Stomach is drawn downwards
by ſuch a Load of Excrements, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that the unuſual weight that hangs like
a Clog upon the Stomach, may be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſuppos'd to produce the ſame Effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as if it were fill'd with a hearty Meal.</p>

                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:40916:44"/>
So when we adviſe a Man in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to take Phyſick, our deſign is not to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate
the remainder of his Meat, ſince we
