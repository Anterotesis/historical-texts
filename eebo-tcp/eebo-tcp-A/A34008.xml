            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to this purpoſe, I have made a

ſlender Eſſay, the truth whereof, I hope,
will excuſe the plainneſs of the dreſs;
the ſtuff is courſe, and the thread not

both pleaſant and profitable. Having
had therefore fair opportunities, and
good intelligence, I am the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give you an account of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
Indeed, hitherto no man of parts
or abilities has been ſuffered to travel the
Country. For the people are very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and ſuſpect thoſe who ask them
any queſtions concerning their Policy,
or Religion, they being wholly devoted
to their own Ignorance, and Education;
(which is altogether illiterate, and rude,
both in Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Affairs)
look upon Learning as a Monſter, and
fear it no leſs than a Ship of Wildfire;
and thus they verifie the old Saying,
<hi>Ars nullum habet inimicum praeter igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year of our Lord, 1560. the
Art of Printing was brought in amongſt
them (as <hi>Thevet</hi> relates in the life of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil)</hi>
and a Latin School alſo was erected,
but the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> ſoon deſtroyed it,

my diſcourſe with them, who
are not ſet apart for this Function, as in
other Nations, but any Lay-man of a
good life and converſation may take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>This Nation received the Chriſtian
Faith about ſix hundred years ſince, from
a certain Prieſt of <hi>Chioff,</hi> who is ſaid to
cure one of the Dukes of <hi>Muſco</hi> by
prayer, upon which Miracle he and all
his people were baptized. They bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
their Liturgy from the Greek
Church, which is written in the Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian
Language, and uſed in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
with as much knowledge, as the
Latin amongſt the Papiſts. They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Greeks, though lamely, in the
Architecture of their Churches, whoſe
chief ornaments are Images, adorned
with rich Stones and Pearls, wherein
they admit no Sculpture but only paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for they look upon the Romiſh
Statue-worſhip as Idolatry. They kneel
not in their devotions, but lie proſtrate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and upon ſome great Vigils they ſtay all
night in their Churches, at certain
times proſtrating and croſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and knocking their heads againſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52932:15"/>
the Ground. At certain Intervals they
diſcourſe of buſineſs, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the Emperor diſpatches the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in the time of their Service, where
he is attended with all his Nobility;
and if he miſs any, he makes inquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them. At <hi>Whitſontide</hi> they fall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
upon Sycamore branches (our
Maple, which they call Sycamore with
us, but falſely) wherewith their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are ſtrew'd, upon a fond perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the holy Ghoſt deſcends upon
theſe leaves, as <hi>Manna</hi> upon Oake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves.
They have no Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
for the laſt Patriarch abrogated it,
becauſe the Papiſts uſed it. In their
Prayers, three hours after Sun-riſing,
they call <hi>Obedny,</hi> at Sun-ſet <hi>Vecherney;</hi>
about one a clock in the morning, <hi>Zaou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinys.

A Pariſh-Prieſt they call a Pope; as
Pope <hi>Petro,</hi> Pope <hi>Iuan;</hi> a Biſhop <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolite;</hi>
a chief Pope <hi>Protopope.</hi> The
Popes go moſt commonly in Purple,
ſome in Green, others as they fancy, only
diſtinguiſh'd with two flaps on both
ſides their breaſt, and a purple Scul-cap
to cover their ſhaven crowns. They
never cut the hairs of their heads or
beards; a thing not obſerved by any
other Clergy in the world. A Pope
muſt be a married man, and the Husband
but of one Wife; grounded on that
Text, <hi>a Biſhop must be the Husband of one
Wife.</hi> Hereby it appears, the Popes
Prieſthood is wrapped up in his Wives
Smock; for when ſhe dies he muſt offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
no longer, which makes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
their Wives more then ordinary
for their Office ſake. They marry young,
that they may come early into a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
their Wives are alſo diſtinguiſh'd
from others by a flap on each ſide their
breaſt. Their Baptiſm differs not from
the Romiſh, but only in dipping all over.
He that takes up the Ruſſian Faith, be
he Lutheran or Papiſt, muſt firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his former Baptiſm, curſe Father
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52932:16"/>
and Mother, and ſpit thrice over his
ſhoulder. It was a cuſtom to hire
Strangers to chriſten the Ruſſians, but now
they are grown wiſer than to buy ſouls at
that rate. 'Tis obſerved by ſome old
Standers here, that of two hundred <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
Scotch</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

Ruſſian Children; when and how wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
of their Faſts and Pennances.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THeir Marriages are not very ſolemn;
a few attend the Bride about three
a clock in the afternoon, and at their
coming out of the Church, the <hi>Panna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
or Clerk, ſtrews Hops upon the
Bride, and wiſhes her children as thick
as Hops; another with a Sheep-skin
coat turn'd outward meets her, and prays
ſhe may have as many children as there
are hairs on his coat.</p>
               <p>The Bridegroom is led home by
young Fellows, and the Bride (being
cover'd all over) by an old Woman, and
the Pope marches before with his Croſs.
They ſit a while down at Table with
Bread and Salt before them, but eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
In the mean time a Quire of Boys
and Girls ſtanding aloft, ſing <hi>Epithala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums,</hi>
or nuptial Songs, ſo bedawb'd
with ſcum of bawdry and obſcenity, that
it would make <hi>Aretines</hi> ears glow to
hear them. After this they are conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Pope and Old-women to a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52932:17"/>
Room, where ſhe adviſes the Bride to be
debonair and buxom, and exhorts the
Bridegroom to beſtow due benevolence,
and here they are ſhut up for two hours;
the old Woman in the interim attends
for the tokens of Virginity, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten, ſhe goes triumphantly, and
demands <hi>Albricias</hi> of the Parents, firſt
tying up the Brides hair which before
hung over her ears. The married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
muſt have no earth over their
heads (a Ceremony ſtrictly obſerved, as
if mortality then ought not to be the
object of their meditations) for you muſt
know all warm Rooms are covered with
earth half a yard thick to keep in the
heat.</p>
               <p>The Bridegroom has a Whip in one
Boot, and a Jewel or ſome Money in the
other, he bids the Bride pull them off,
if ſhe happens upon the Jewel, he counts
her lucky, and beſtows it upon her; but
if ſhe lights upon the Boot with the
Whip in it, ſhe is reckon'd amongſt the
unfortunate, and gets a Bride-laſh for
her pains, which is but the earneſt-penny
of her future entertainment. The
Ruſſians diſcipline to their Wives is very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52932:17"/>
rigid and ſevere, more inhumane in

ſoon as any one is dead they open the

that he may eat, having a long Journey
to go.</p>
               <p>After this they put on his feet a pair

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52932:26"/>

then the Popes go and bury them, and
cover them with earth.</p>
               <p>Thirty daies after burial, they read
the Pſalter over daily upon the Grave,
having a little Booth made up of Mats

               <p>In the <hi>Carnaval</hi> before <hi>Quadrageſſima,</hi>

manner of debauchery and luxury, and
in the laſt week they drink as if they
were never to drink more. Some drink
<hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> four times diſtill'd, until it
fire in their mouths, and kindle a flame
not unlike that of <hi>Bocca di inferno,</hi> which
iſſues out at their throat; if they have
not milk given them to drink, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
die. Much wiſer in my judgment
are our Engliſh Bully-rocks, who love

               <p>THeir Imagery is very pitiful paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
flat and ugly, after the Greek
manner; I asking why they made their
God's ſo deformed, they anſwered me,
they were not proud. When a Picture
is worn out, they bring it into the God-market,
where laying it down, they
chuſe out a new one, and depoſite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for the exchange (for they muſt not
be ſaid to buy it) if the money be not
enough the God-maker ſhoves it back,

any of their Brethren meets with <hi>Jove,</hi>
he turns into <hi>Neptune,</hi> and they croſſing

ſtrive above all things to ſave their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
but if they eſcape not the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
they muſt not be ſaid to be
burnt, but gone up. If a Church be
burn'd, they ſay it is aſcended, they muſt
not ſay burn'd. <hi>Theſe are their pretty ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous

               </p>
               <p>Sometimes they will hold their Gods
to the fire, truſting they can help them,
if they will. A Fellow thinking to have
ſtaid the fire by that means, held his

been burnt himſelf, and ſeeing he did
him no good, he threw him into the

               <p>NOw that I am diſcourſing of the
Ruſſian Church, it will not be amiſs
to relate a ſad Tragical ſtory, which
was acted in the time of our Engliſh
Reſident, who it ſeems had a Monkey
famous amongſt the Muſcovites to this
day, for he would take money in his
mouth, and go into the Market, and
ſhew it to the Coſtard-mongers, who
in kindneſs would give him Nuts and
Apples; many ſuch apiſh pranks he was
wont to play. But we come now to the
Cataſtrophe of his mirth. Being not
content to act a merry part in <hi>Foro,</hi> he
begins <hi>lu dere cum Sacris,</hi> and goes into a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52932:29"/>
Church hard by the Engliſh Houſe,
where he crept in and tumbled down
their Gods. The Prieſt amaz'd to ſee
what was done, croſſes himſelf a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times, and ſets their God-ſhips in
their places again, exorciſes the foul
Fiend, taking his Horſe-tail dipt in holy
water, he daſhes the doors and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
that this Devil might not re-enter.
But for all this, one morning early Pug
came in at a window, and began with
St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> and the reſt of the Gods
and Goddeſſes in order, as they ſtood in
his way; down he throws <hi>Dagon</hi> and
the wares of <hi>Rimnon</hi> as zealouſly as if
he had been bred up in new <hi>England,</hi> and
ever and anon he grinn'd in the Popes
face, who ſtanding arm'd with a Croſs
and holy Water, therewith beſprinkled
Pug, who (hating it as bad as the Devil,)
fled home.</p>
               <p>Preſently the Pope goes to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,
and complains moſt bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a <hi>Nincheen</hi> (or Stranger) living
in the Engliſh houſe, for throwing down
many of their Gods, breaking their
Lamps, pulling off their Jewels and
Chains of Pearl wherewith they were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52932:29"/>
adorn'd and laſtly for prophaning the
holy place. Hereupon an order was
ſent to ſearch and examine the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
houſe; all his Retinue was brought
forth. No, it was none of them, but
a little <hi>Ninicheen;</hi> ſo the young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were brought out, and by chance
the Monkey came jumping in with the
Children: O that is the <hi>Nincheen,</hi> quoth
the Pope, apprehend him, which was
done accordingly, and the Patriarch
finding out the folly, was aſham'd, and
ſent away the Prieſt with diſgrace for a
Fool. But however, poor Pug (to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
the angry Gods) was deliver'd over
to the ſecular power, who chaſtiſd him
ſo ſeverely that he dyed upon it. Now
Chronology would be enquir'd into,
Whether <hi>Ben Johnſons</hi> Zeal of the Land,
or Countrey man of <hi>Banbury,</hi> who in a
Fanatick fury deſtroy'd the Ginger-bread-Idols
in <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair, for
which he ſuffer'd perſecution, and was
put into the ſtocks: Or this American
Reformer, who threw down the Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Ginger-bread (for if you ſaw their

willing to gratifie his ears with the beſt

it, to which he replied; very well, for
the Beggars uſe to beg in ſuch Tunes in

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52932:31"/>
as well Priſoners as Cripples, and a

harſh notes. For the Ruſſians love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſoft or ſmooth but their womens
fat ſides. But I come to their Muſick,
leaſt I ſhould tyre you with tuning it.
You muſt know they have Muſick-Schools,
where Children are brought
up with great diligence, and in much
ſeverity. Their notes are very ſtrange,
borrowed, I ſuppoſe, of the Greeks, or
Sclavonians. Their Gamut has ſmall
variety; inſtead of <hi>Fa, ſol, la,</hi> they ſing
<hi>Ga, ga, ge,</hi> warbling them out, as if they
were indeed either gag'd or throttled.</p>
               <p>Their Cadences and Cloſes are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected,
that they ſeem frighted into
them, as our Fidlers are when a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
comes in the midſt of a Leſſon.
Sometimes they will run hard upon a
ſcent, as though they meant to imitate
the Italian Recitative Muſick. Finally,
when they have brought up theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to a perfection, what with Baſes,
Tenors, Contratenors, and Trebles, you
ſhall hear as good a Conſort, as ever
was ſung a at <hi>Cats Veſpers.</hi> They have
but little Inſtrumental Muſick, it being
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52932:31"/>
prohibited by the Patriarch in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Romiſh Church. And it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
been thought State policy to forbid
all Muſick or Jollity among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
to prevent Effeminacy. They
have Bagpipes, and ſmall Fiddles with
bellies like Lutes, wherewith they play
four or five notes.</p>
               <p>As for their Warlike Muſick they
have Kettle Drums, whoſe dull ſound
does well agree with the Ruſſian Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine

I think has not been long uſed, for they
can hardly blow it ſo well as a Sow-Gelder

there is a Nunnery alſo, for commonly
they are near together. In this Lake,
about twenty years ſince, a Fiſh was
ſeen of ſuch a magnitude, that they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
it could not be a Fiſh, but rather
ſome <hi>ſpectrum, Leviathan,</hi> or Water-Devil.
It would often appear half a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
water, which made an Eagle ſtoop
at it with ſuch violence, that piercing
his Talons into the Fleſh, he could not
pull them out again; but <hi>Leviathan</hi>
plunging to the bottom with his enemy,
carried him into an unknown element,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52932:34"/>
and ſo overcame him, but could not be
ſo rid of him, for his Talons ſtill ſtuck
faſt, which made him repair to the
ſhore, where being ſeen by the Friars
with feathers on his back, he confirm'd
their Fears; and therefore to prevent
further miſchief, they fell a ringing the
Bells, went on proceſſion with all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
and weapons of defence,
wherewith theſe Friars-militant wont
to reſiſt the foul Fiend, but all this did
little avail to profligate the ſuppoſed
enemy of Mankind. At laſt one Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Eaton</hi> a Merchant coming by, hears
this ſad Relation, and being curious to
ſee with the reſt, who ſtood upon the
ſhore, he undertook to encounter the
Monſter; an attempt no doubt as peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
by Water, as that of St. <hi>Georges</hi> was
by Land; the worſt was, he could not
find a <hi>Ruſs</hi> ſo bold &amp; hardy as to row the
Boat for him, till he had made one cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
by drinking. In ſhort, he ſhots
the Beaſt with a ſcrew'd Gun, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken up, proved to be nothing elſe

Play ended. But a worſe Tragedy was
acted, when they took another Pike not
ſo large at this, intending to entertain
one Mr. <hi>White</hi> an Engliſh Merchant; for
the Cook cutting it open, found a new-born
Infant in its belly, which was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

This Empire is impoveriſh'd, depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

as it will not recover its priſtine proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in forty. Seven years ago the Plague

The Emperours Pallace to this
day is called, <hi>Crimlena Gorod,</hi> or <hi>Crim-Caſtle.
Juan Vaſilowidg</hi> (that is called
the Tyrant) was a ſtout Prince, but had
many ſtrange humours. One day he came
to his <hi>Diac,</hi> and gave him a Petition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
him that he would be pleaſed to
make ready 20000 Men and Arms by
ſuch a time, and he ſhould be very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him, and pray for his health, and
ſo he ſubſcrib'd himſelf, <hi>Thy humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
Jocky <hi>of</hi> Moſcua. In this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he conquer'd <hi>Caſan,</hi> a thouſand
<hi>Verſts</hi> down the River <hi>Volga,</hi> and <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
(quaſi civitas)</hi> the Imperial City two
thouſand <hi>Verſts</hi> hence; Took <hi>Syberia</hi>
three thouſand <hi>Verſts</hi> diſtant, and one of
the beſt flowers of the Empire. The
people loved him very well, for he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them kindly, but chaſtiſed his <hi>Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars.</hi>
He had a Staff with a very ſharp
Spike in the end thereof, which in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
he would ſtrike through his <hi>Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi>
feet, and if they could bear it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52932:40"/>
out any flinching, he would highly prefer
them.</p>
               <p>He once ſent to <hi>Vologda</hi> for a <hi>Colpack</hi>
of Fleas, and becauſe they could not
bring him full meaſure, he fined them.</p>
               <p>On a Feſtival he play'd certain mad
pranks, which cauſed ſome Strangers,
<hi>viz.</hi> Dutch and Engliſh Women to
laugh; he taking notice hereof, ſent for
them all to his Pallace, and had them
ſtrip't ſtark naked before him in a great
Room, then he commanded four or five
buſhels of peaſe to be thrown down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and made them pick them all
up, when they had done he gave them
ſome wine, and bad them take heed how
they laugh'd before an Emperour again.
He ſent for a Nobleman of <hi>Caſan,</hi> who
was call'd <hi>Pleſheare,</hi> which is Bald, and
the <hi>Vayod</hi> miſtaking (as the Ruſſians ſay)
thought he had ſent for an hundred and
fifty Baldpates: <hi>Polteraste</hi> ſounding like
his name ſignifi'd ſo many. He therefore
got together about eighty or ninety, and
ſent them up ſpeedily, with an excuſe
that he could find no more in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and deſir'd pardon. The Emperor
ſeeing ſo many Baldpates, wonder'd what
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52932:40"/>
it meant, and croſſ'd himſelf; at laſt
one of the chief delivering the Letter, he
ask'd his <hi>Diack</hi> what he wrote to the
<hi>Vayod,</hi> who ſhew'd him the copy, by
which he found out the miſtake, and ſo
making the Bald-pates drunk for three
dayes, he ſent them whom again. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Vayod</hi> had taken a Gooſe for a
bribe ſtuff'd full of Ducats, and being
complained of, he took no notice of
him, till one day paſſing through the
<hi>Poſhiarr</hi> (an open place like <hi>Smithfield,</hi>
where execution was uſ'd to be done) he
commanded the Hangman to cut off his
Arms and his Legs; and at every blow
the Hangman asked him whether Gooſe
was good meat.</p>
               <p>He courted Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> very
much to marry her, and was a great
friend to the Engliſh. Once upon a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of Treaſon, he fortified <hi>Vologda,</hi>
and drew all his Treaſure thither, and
as ſome think upon extremity, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his flight for <hi>England.</hi> This Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
erected the beſt buildings in all
<hi>Moſcua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Juan Vaſilowidg</hi> nail'd a French

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52932:41"/>
Boze</hi> a while after came as Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
and put on his Hat, and cock't it
before him, at which he ſternly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
how he durſt do ſo, having
heard how he chaſtiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.
Sir <hi>Jerom</hi> anſwer'd, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
a cowardly King of <hi>France,</hi>
but I am the Embaſſador of the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Queen of <hi>England,</hi> who does not
vail her Bonnet, nor bare her Head to
any Prince living; and if any of her
Miniſters ſhall receive any affront a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
ſhe is able to revenge her own
quarrel. Look you there (quoth <hi>Juan
Vaſilowidg</hi> to his <hi>Boyars)</hi> there is a brave
Fellow indeed, that dares do and ſay
thus much for his Miſtris; which
Whoreſon of you all dare do ſo much
for me your Maſter? This made them
envy Sir <hi>Jerom,</hi> and perſwade the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to give him a wilde Horſe to tame;
which he did, managing him with ſuch
rigour, that the Horſe grew ſo tyr'd and
tam'd, that he fell down dead under
him; this being done, he asked his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
if he had any more wild Horſes to
tame. The Emperour afterwards much
honour'd him, for he loved ſuch a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52932:41"/>
fellow as he was, and a madd blade
to boot.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Juan</hi> went his progreſs, many
of the Commons as well as Gentry
preſented him with fine Preſents: A
good honeſt Bask-ſhoemaker, who made
ſhoes of Bask for a <hi>Copeak</hi> a pair, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
with his wife what to preſent his
Majeſty; ſays ſhe, a pair of fine <hi>Lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyes,</hi>
or ſhoes of Bask; that is no rarity
(quoth he); but we have an huge great
Turnip in the Garden, we'l give him
that, and a pair of <hi>Lopkyes</hi> alſo. Thus
they did; and the Emperour took the
preſent ſo kindly, that he made all his
Nobility buy <hi>Lopkyes</hi> of the fellow at
five ſhillings a pair, and he wore one
pair himſelf. Thus put the man in ſtock,
whereby he began to drive a Trade, and
in time grew ſo conſiderable, that he
left a great eſtate behnd him. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
are now Gentlemen, and call'd
<hi>Lopotsky's.</hi> There is a tree ſtanding
near his <hi>quondam</hi> houſe, upon which it
is a cuſtom to throw all their old <hi>Lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyes</hi>
as they paſs by, in memory of this
Gallant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52932:42"/>
A Gentleman ſeeing him ſo well paid
for his Turnep, made account by the rule
of proportion to get a greater Reward
for a brave Horſe; but the Emperour
ſuſpecting his deſign, gave him nothing
but the great Turnep, for which he was
both abaſh'd and laugh'd at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juan</hi> in a diſguiſe ſought a lodging in a
Village nigh the City, none would let
him in but a poor man whoſe wife was
then in Travel, and deliver'd whilſt he
was there; away he went before day,
and told the man he would bring him
ſome Godfathers next day; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he and many of his Nobility came
and gave the poor Fellow a good largeſs,
and burn'd all the houſes in the Village
but his, exhorting them to charity, and
telling them, becauſe they refuſed to
admit Strangers into their houſes, they
ſhould be forced to ſeek their Fortunes,
and try how good it was to lie out of
doors in the Winter.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he would aſſociate with
Thieves in a diſguiſe, and once he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſ'd
them to rob the Exchequer; for
(ſays he) I know the way to it; but one
of the Fellows up with his Fiſt, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52932:42"/>
ſtruck him a hearty good blow on the
Face, ſaying, Thou Rogue, wilt thou
offer to rob his Majeſty who is ſo good
to us; let us go rob ſuch a rich <hi>Boyar</hi>
who has cozen'd his Majeſty of vaſt
ſums. At this <hi>Juan</hi> was well pleaſed,
and at parting changed caps with the
fellow, and bid him meet him next
morning in the <hi>Duaretz</hi> (a place in the
Court where the Emperour uſed often
to paſs by) and there (ſaid he) I will
bring thee to a good cup of <hi>Aqua vitae</hi>
and <hi>Mead.</hi> The Thief came accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
and being diſcover'd by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
was call'd up, admoniſh'd to ſteal
no more, preferr'd in the Court, and
ſerv'd for a diſcoverer of Thieves.</p>

fifteen years old, nor of many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
but then he is expoſed to publick
view, carried upon mens ſhoulders, and
ſet on high in the Market-place, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52932:44"/>
is to prevent Impoſtors, wherewith
this Land has often been deceived.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Czar</hi> marries not out of his own
Dominions, but takes a wife where he
pleaſes, though ſeldom out of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
When ſhe dyes, all the intereſt
of her Kindred and Relations dies with
her. <hi>Eliah</hi> the preſent Emperours Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in law was of ſo mean account, that
within this twenty years he drew wine
to ſome Engliſh men, and his daughter
gather'd <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> and ſold them in the
Market. The other which he ſhould
have had was a Captains Daughter.
The Imperial Pallace is built of Stone
and Brick, except ſome lodgings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Majeſty ſleeps and eats all the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For they eſteem wooden Rooms
far wholſomer than Stone; and they
have ſome reaſon to think ſo, becauſe
their ſtone Rooms being arched thick
reverberate a dampneſs when the Stove
is hot. The Emperour lodges three ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high. His drink is <hi>Brague</hi> made of
Oates. His bread is made of Rye, which
the Ruſſians eſteem a ſtronger nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than Wheat. The <hi>Czar</hi> lyes in no
ſheets, but in his Shirts and Drawers,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52932:45"/>
under a rich ſable Coverlid, and one
Sheet under him. His Recreations are
hunting and hawking. He keeps above
three hundred Falconers, and has the
beſt Ger-Falcons in the World, which
are brought from <hi>Syberia;</hi> he flyes at
Ducks or other Fowl. He hunts the
Bear, Wolf, Tyger, Fox, or rather baits
them at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Whenſoever he goes forth, the Eaſt
Gate of the inner Wall of the City is
ſhut till he returns. He ſeldom viſits
any Subject, yet the laſt year he did,
but went not in the common way, for the
ſide of a wall was pull'd down. At the
birth of the <hi>Czaroidg</hi> the Commons for
joy bring him great Preſents, which he
returns back again, but if he likes any
of them, he gives the full worth. On
the <hi>Saturday</hi> after Good <hi>Friday,</hi> he goes
into ſome of the Priſons, examines the
Priſoners crimes, and delivers many of
them. An Engliſh man put in for coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was lately releaſ'd. They put very
few to death here, only whip them,
which is worſe than the paines of death.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS the Emperours Territories are
great, ſo is his Revenue; For (Firſt)
he is maſter in a manner of every man's
Eſtate, the Son does alwaies petition

               <p>Secondly, his Cuſtoms are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Cabacks</hi> (or places where

10000 Rubbles <hi>per annum,</hi> and ſome

               <p>Fourthly, His Bath-Stoves, which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52932:46"/>
are very frequent here, are a great <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trado,</hi>

When they are hiſſing hot, they

out into the Snow, and tumble in it ſtark

               <p>Fifthly, He is the chief Merchant in
all the Empire.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, His Sable Trade in <hi>Syberia</hi>
yields a vaſt treaſure, brought in by the
exil'd Slaves ſent thither in diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The <hi>Caviare</hi> made at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracan,</hi>

ſight of their underſtanding is dazled
with the bright beams of truth. When
the Greeks or Perſians come the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
ingroſſes all their Commodities at
a price. To <hi>Archangel,</hi> he ſends great
quantities of Hides, Wax, Potaſh,
Hemp and Flax, and ſo furniſhes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with their Commodities, which
ſerve him to give away amongſt his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;

in Silks, Sables, Cloth, Velvet,
or cloth of Gold. To his Houſhold
Servants he gives allowances of Meal,
Honey, Fiſh, Nut-oyl, Oates, Beer and

with an high brick Wall, larger
by half than the circumference of the
Tower, herein are twenty four Churches
and Chappels, moſt of them have guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

high Tower, called <hi>Ivan Velicky,</hi> was
built by <hi>Juan Vaſilowich.</hi> It ſtands by
its ſelf, and ſerves for a Belfry, wherein
are thirty or forty Bells. The <hi>Cupola</hi> of
this Tower is guilt, the body of Brick

St. <hi>Marks</hi> Tower at <hi>Venice.</hi> Some of

the <hi>Apotheca,</hi> or Ammunition Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.
The <hi>Czar</hi> has Officers of State as
other Princes have, but not of ſo great
value. His Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber
come not into his Chamber,
but wait in the next Room to it, and at
the Table alſo, ſome two or three Rooms
off. The <hi>Czar</hi> is temperate in his Diet,
drinks very little Wine, ſometimes he
drinks at meales a little Cinnamon wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or oyl of Cinnamon in his ſmal beer.
For Cinnamon here (you muſt know)
is the <hi>Aroma Imperiale,;</hi> the ſcents of
Musk and Ambergreece are not
much eſteem'd, but Roſe water is much

the Church.</p>

At the entertainment of his Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Emperour ſits in his Chair, and
delivers out of his hand a <hi>Chark</hi> of treble
or quadruble Spirits, which are able to
take away his breath who is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
to them. His Majeſty will
laugh to ſee his Subjects handſomly
fuddled, and ſometimes he will put <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
into their Liquor. Old General
<hi>Alexander Leſhly</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> aged ninety nine
years; now alive at <hi>Smolensko,</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with the Emperour about the

his modeſty kept him a little too long,
but at laſt being neceſſitated, he got away
abruptly: The Emperour wondring at
it, demanded the reaſon of his ſuddain
departure; but underſtanding how the
caſe went with the old man, who had loſt
nothing but the bolt of his back-gate,
he fell into ſuch a laughter as ſufficiently

               <p>I Cannot at preſent give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Judiciary proceedings,
which are very confuſed, and yet they
have a method, and every Province its
<hi>Precause</hi> or Office, wherein is a <hi>Bayor,</hi>
or Lord, and a Chancellor call'd a <hi>Diac,</hi>
who hath many Clerks under him: He
repreſents the <hi>Boyar,</hi> who is the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
of his Imperial Majeſty. If
there be a Suit in Law, and no bribes on
either ſide, moſt commonly the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
gets the better for they preſume he
has moſt right.</p>
               <p>Murther is here to be bought off with
money; If a Man kill his Slave or his
Wife in correcting them, there is no
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52932:53"/>
law againſt them. Or if a man is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
and no body proſecured his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
the law takes no notice of his
death.</p>
               <p>The accuſed cannot be condemn'd
although a thouſand witneſſes come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, except he confeſſes the Fact;
and to this end they want not torments
to extort Confeſſions; For firſt, they
put them upon the Strappado, if this
does not, they ſecondly whip them, and
herein their Hangmen are very exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite:
For 'tis ſaid at ſix or ſeven laſhes
they are able to kill a man. Sometimes
the conſederate will ſee the enemy to
execute ſuch a piece of his office, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
farther miſchief.</p>
               <p>They can ſtrike to an hairs breadth,
and with a ſharp kind of Iron pierce
through the very Ribs; they will ſlice
down a mans back like a Chine of Pork,
and when that's done, they will ſalt the
raw place, bind his hands and legs, and
putting a Cowlſtaff through them, hold
him over the Fire, and Carbonadoe him.
If he perſiſts (for may be the party has
nothing to confeſs) they let him looſe,
and the Hangman ſets his ſhoulders, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52932:53"/>
lets him reſt twenty days, till he be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
well, and then repeats the former
Torments, and perhaps pull out a Rib
or tow with a pair of hot Pincers; If
all this will not do (for ſome will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
all theſe Tortures) they will then
ſhave the crown of his Head, and drop
cold water upon the bare place, which
ſome that have felt, acknowledge to be
the quinteſſence of all Torments; for
every drop ſtrikes like a dart to the
very heart. All this is done where the
Hangman is not brib'd, for he will then
cut deep. I have ſeen ſome whoſe backs
have been ſcarifi'd like the bark of a
Tree, which afterwards were healed,
but they could never wear out the ſcars
and marks thereof.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment of Coyners is to

them, with further information. They
hunt ſix or ſeven weeks together, and
are drawn by Dogs, whom they feed
with Fiſh, wherewith their Lakes and
Rivers abound,: they put forty or fifty
Dogs in a Sledge, and are cloth'd with
treble Furs; they lie out all night in
the coldeſt ſeaſon, and make fires, with
which they dreſs their Fiſh. The Dogs
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52932:55"/>
are expert in finding out the <hi>Sable,</hi> and
the Men as dextrous in ſhooting them in
the noſe with a bolt, which makes
them become a prey to the hounds. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they hit the <hi>Sable</hi> in the noſe they
loſe him, for he is an hardy Beaſt, and
will run away with an Arrow in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
beſides, it ſpoils the Fur.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſo exceſſive cold here, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thrown up into the Air will deſcend
congeal'd into Ice. The moſt Northern
parts afford no Bread, but Fiſh in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
which they eat dryed inſtead of
bread, and yet they live to a great age.
They feed their Cows with Fiſh during
the froſt, which makes the milk taſte
fiſhy. The River <hi>Ob</hi> is a vaſt River,
whoſe end is as yet unknown: there is
great ſtore of Fiſh call'd <hi>Bebuga,</hi> much
like a Whale, but better meat, out of
whoſe ſpawn and the Sturgeons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they make <hi>Caviare</hi> at <hi>Astracan,</hi>
which they lay in great heaps of ſalt,
and after a little fermentation preſs it,
and barrel it up. We have ſome here
unpreſſ'd; 'tis a great dainty, but will
not keep.</p>

The North of <hi>Syberia</hi> is call'd <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geda,</hi>
or <hi>Tſamoeida,</hi> which ſignifies Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals,
or Men-eaters, for they eat thoſe
whom they conquer in battel. Their
food is moſt Fiſh, their riches Deer, of
which they have great herds, and ſo
tame, that at whiſtle they will appear at
hand, and ſuffer themſelves to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed,
and put to the ſledges by pairs,
which they will draw ſwiftly as wind
eighty miles a day. When they hunt
for new Deer, they conſult the Prieſt,
who, after many ceremonies and conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
tells them in what quarter they
muſt go, and moſt commonly they find
his predictions true. There is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
in the clothes of Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
but both are made of Deer
skins, with the hair ſide outward, which
by experience they find the warmeſt.
You can hardly diſtinguiſh the men and
women by their viſage, neither wear
Beards, and both have faces like Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boons.</p>
               <p>Their Manners, Language and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are brutiſh, for they worſhip the Sun
and Moon, and good reaſon have they to
adore the one, and make good uſe of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52932:56"/>
his light, which they enjoy ſo little in
the winter. They are exceſſively jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of their Wives, which puts me in
mind of the ſtrength of fancy and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom:
One being ask't if he thought
not an Engliſh Woman (then preſent,
young and handſom) as pretty and fair
as his Lady ugly; anſwer'd, no ſurely,
thy Wives complexion is pale, like the
belly of a Fiſh, our Womens colours
are natural and genuine. Their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are eſteem'd great Riches, and muſt
not be ſeen by young men, till contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Marriage, which they are at ſix or
ſeven years old, that they may be ſure
to have them Virgins: they buy them of
their Parents for ſo many head of Deer,
and take them home to their houſes, and
lock them up <hi>al Italiano.</hi> The men like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſerve their wives ſo, when they go an
hunting, and 'tis as ordinary as ſtrings
to a purſe. For they have a Proverb,
<hi>He that leaves his purſe open invites a
Thief to it;</hi> ſuch as have ſeen their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
ſay they come not ſhort of the
Italian ones.</p>
               <p>Their houſes are only round tents
made of Deer-skins and Matts, with a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52932:57"/>
fire in the midſt, and a hole at the top
for the ſmoke, about which they lye
round, and find themſelves warm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
In the Summer they remove
near the Rivers to fiſh, which they dry,
and preſerve againſt Winter, they kill
their fiſhes with arrows, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
eat them raw: they eat young
Puppies, and count them a rare diſh.
They are not thought worthy of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
by his Imperial Majeſty, nor
ſo conſiderable as to be taxed, only vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
they pay a few Deer. None
underſtand their barbarous language
but themſelves, nor yet their Laws
which they execute ſecretly. When
they ſell a Deer to Strangers, they are
ſure to indent to have the garbage, which
they eat after a ſlight ſqueezing out of
the excrements. He is beſt qualifi'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them who knows moſt in Magick,
wherein they are excellent, eſpecially

they have extorted a vaſt Eſtate out of
the bowels of poor people, and grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the faces of Strangers, they think to
expiate all their wicked actions at laſt by
building a Church, and endowing it with
abundance of Images adorn'd with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,

Greater Rogues there are not in

is little better than a painted Rudder,
which ſeems to ſteer, but does not.
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third, afterwards King of
<hi>France</hi> was (as I take it) King of <hi>Poland,</hi>
and ſo weary of his Kingſhip, that he
would willingly have chang'd it for a

On a certain day he made an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

he made drunk, having for his own wine
nothing but fair water colour'd red:
One of theſe drunken Lords he laid in
his own Royal Bed, the Curtains were

               </argument>
               <p>MY Lady <hi>Lues Venerea</hi> is as well
known in <hi>Poland</hi> as in the place
where ſhe was born; not a <hi>muſhy panny</hi>
(Lord) nor a <hi>pannya</hi> (Lady) but are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
acquainted with her, and ſo is
the Court and the Countrey.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ruſſes</hi> in the conqueſts of <hi>Vilna,</hi>
and many other Towns and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
on the Borders of <hi>Poland,</hi> have
taken her Ladiſhip priſoner, whom they
are like to keep longer than their Towns.
For till this War ſhe was not known
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52932:65"/>
here this thouſand years: But when ſhe
gets into ſuch a cold Countrey as this,
ſhe earths like a Badger ſo deep, that
there's no driving of her out without a
Pickaxe or Firebrand; <hi>juxta illud, les
Veroles de Rouen et la boue du Paris ne ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais
ſortont la pais ſans oſter la piece.</hi> The
Pox of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and the Dirt of <hi>Paris</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>But what is worſe, the <hi>Poles</hi> have the
<hi>Plica</hi> as familiar among them, as the
French have the Itch; and ſo infectious
too, that few in a houſe eſcape it when
'tis once crept in amongſt them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there cannot be a greater plague
in the world, for beſides its many
dreadful ſymptoms, the naſty elfiſh lock
ſtinks like an old Ulcer, and yet they
wear it as a badge of Nobility. Some
you ſhall have with hair full of
brayds or knots, as I ſaw a Monks, which
look'd like <hi>Meduſa's,</hi> who for this
monſtroſity was accounted a man of
more than ordinary ſanctity. The like
eſteem they have of Horſes, who are
troubled herewith in their Manes, or
Foretops, for they think them Steeds of
good courage and ſervice, If an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52932:66"/>
perſon cuts off never ſo little of the
<hi>Plica,</hi> the Horſe either dyes, runs mad,
or becomes blind and lame.</p>
               <p>They ſay the firſt uſe of Hair-powder
came from the <hi>Poles,</hi> who were fain to
perfume the <hi>Plica</hi> to abate its odious
ſtench. 'Tis hard eſcaping this diſeaſe
if you paſs through the Countrey, where
Arſenical Mines poyſon the water, for it

               <p>The Poles are more honourable in
keeeping their Articles and Covenants
than the Ruſſians, who ſeldom keep faith
with an enemy, if the breach thereof be
but advantageous. Yet in private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the <hi>Ruſs</hi> fears an oath, becauſe 'tis
ſeldom adminiſtred, which makes it the
more to be reverenced.</p>
               <p>Their Languages differ not much, juſt
as Engliſh and Scotch, the Poliſh is
ſaid to be the more copious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental,
but to my ears, which judge
by outward ſounds, it ſeems the more
harſh in pronunciation, and worſe than
a medly of Welſh, Iriſh and Corniſh.</p>
               <p>They ſpit in your face when they talk.
Their Orthography is like the Welſh,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52932:66"/>
ſix Conſonants to one Vowel. Their
ſalutations are in lofty terms, they bow
not ſo much as the Ruſſians. The Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
ſalute with their fore-finger upon
their mouth, and a little nod, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
their Superiors about the knees.
The Chircaſſes ſalutes are blunt and
rude, as, how do thy Children and thy
Servants, thy Cows and thy Sheep, thy
Horſes and Goats and Swine, thy Cocks,
Hens and Turkeys, are they all in good
health? This they punctually repeat
every morning they meet. They are of
the Greek ſaith, but not ſo ſuperſtitious
as the Ruſſians, who think their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
defiled if a Stranger ſets his foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and therefore waſh them after
that pollution, and the Stranger muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

He is the only Patron the Engliſh have.

never went to any Subjects houſe but his
Governours when he was thought paſt

placed round about his Court, ſtand
like ſilent and immoveable Statues. No

Every meal he ſends diſhes of meat to

cloth, but very little money; for they
have all Trades, and great Priviledges.</p>
               <p>The Emperour with his <hi>Pottaſh,</hi> Wax

made away. The <hi>Czar</hi> reproves
him. He and <hi>Naſhockin</hi> no good
friends. Of the <hi>Czars</hi> Religion,
vvherein he is very zealous and
conſtant. He faſts at ſeveral
times eight months in a year, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of all Eccleſiaſtical Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               </argument>
               <p>THis Summer a Jew turn'd
Perſian Mahometan, and an
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52932:78"/>
Interpreter to the Perſian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
came in their behalf with
a loud complaint againſt <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhockin</hi>
for a buſineſs depending
in the Embaſſadors <hi>Precauſe,</hi> or
Court. To whom the <hi>Czar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
ſaying, I have left <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhockin</hi>
to determine all affairs of
Merchants, let him do you Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
but if I find your Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
complaint impertinent, I
ſhall place all my diſpleaſure on
his back; and ſo it prov'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was graced with thirty
good aſhes laid on in order like
red tape upon tawny leather, and
doubtleſs they will out-laſt the
beſt Garment he hath: For their
whippings are very keen, and cut
to the bone.</p>
               <p>The Jews of late are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
crept into the City and Court,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52932:79"/>
by means of a Jewiſh Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(pretendedly baptiz'd Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran)
who aſſiſts <hi>Bogdan Matfeidg</hi>
(Steward of the Houſhold) in his
amours, and ſupplies him with
Poliſh handmaids, he being bred
up in <hi>Poland.</hi> But his Lady (as
ſhe had good cauſe) being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of theſe handſome Slaves
which her Husband kept, ſome
in his Gardens, and ſome in his
Houſe, became a burthen unto
him; they therefore one night
laſt Winter brought her ſome
Dainties, which ſhe eat, and was
merry after it, but in the morning
was found dead in her bed. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſay 'twas a poyſoned glaſs
of wine they gave her, which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her of all diſeaſes. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
much grumbling among the
Commons, and ſince that time
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52932:79"/>
the <hi>Czar</hi> has urged him to marry,
and abandon that wicked life he
led with his Poliſh Doxies, or elſe
he ſhould his place. 'Twas ſaid
he would take one of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
for his wife. This <hi>Bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
is the <hi>Czars</hi> great Favourite,
Lord High Steward, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
all domeſtick Affairs. He
was bred up from a child with the
<hi>Czar,</hi> and is of the ſame age.
They call him the whiſpering Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
becauſe when ever he
comes to Council, he acts behind
the Door. <hi>Naſhockin</hi> is no friend
to him, nor he to the Engliſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
better ſuppli'd with money
from the Dutch.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Czars</hi> Religion, he
is of the Greek Faith, and very
ſtrict in the obſervation thereof.
He never miſſes divine Service,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52932:80"/>
if he be well he goes to it, if ſick
it comes to him in his chamber.
On Faſt-dayes he frequents mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
prayers (the old vigils of
the Church) ſtanding four, five
or ſix hours together, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
himſelf to the ground
ſometimes a thouſand times, and
on great Feſtivals fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
In the great Faſt he eats
but three meals a week, <hi>viz.</hi> on
<hi>Thurſday, Saturday Sunday;</hi> for
the reſt he takes a piece of brown
bread and ſalt, a pickled Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room
or Cucumber, and drinks a
cup of ſmall beer. He eats Fiſh
but twice in the great Lent, and
obſerves it ſeven weeks together,
beſides <hi>Maſlinets</hi> (or cleanſing)
week, wherein they eat milk and
eggs. Out of the Faſt he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<hi>Mondays, Wedneſdays</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52932:80"/>
                  <hi>Fridays,</hi> and will not then eat
any thing that comes of fleſh. In
fine, no Monk is more obſervant
of Canonical hours, then he is of
Faſts. We may reckon he faſts
almoſt eight months in twelve,
with the ſix weeks faſt before
<hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and 2 other ſmall faſts.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that inſtituted ſo many
Faſts advanced fiſh to ſpare fleſh,
which elſe would be deſtroy'd,
becauſe they are forc'd to houſe
their Cattle all the winter, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
five months ſpace. The
<hi>Czar</hi> does not diſdain to aſſiſt at
the Proceſſions bare-headed, and
on foot if it be not rainy. He is
a great Patron of the Church, yet
reſtrains the profuſe bounty of
dying men to the Clergy. None
can found a Monaſtery without
his licence. He makes bold with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52932:81"/>
the Church Treaſary upon loan
in time of war, and pays it again
<hi>ad Graecas Calendas.</hi> For indeed
ſhould he not do ſo his contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would fall ſhort, ſeeing the
Church holds almoſt two third
parts of the <hi>Czardom.</hi> In his
Pallace he has an Hoſpital of very
old men, 120 years old, with
whom he often diſcourſes, and
delights to hear them tell what
paſſ'd in his Anceſtors time. Once
a year, <hi>viz</hi> upon good <hi>Friday,</hi>
he viſits all the priſons in the
night, and taking perſonal cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of all the Priſoners, buys
out ſome that are in debt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes
others that are criminal, as
he thinks fit: He pays great
ſums for ſuch as he is inform'd are
really neceſſitated. His <hi>Czaritza</hi>
buys out Women. He diſpoſes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52932:81"/>
of all Eccleſiaſtical preferments,
but has left the election of the
Patriarch to lot, having (as he
thinks) had ill luck in uſing his
Prerogative for the late Patriarch
<hi>Nicon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this Chapter,
without doubt this preſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> is as pious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious,
clement, merciful and
good a Prince as any in the world.
As for his People and Miniſters
of State, they are like other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ready to act any thing for
Bribes or Money, and to deceive
as many as they can.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Trading in Ruſſia very low. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Cloth a drug, why ſlighted.
The Authors Reflection. If
Perſians trade there, what Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
are like to ſuffer. What the
Ruſſians are in general. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Dutch, what the Engliſh
muſt do to out-vye them. How
much they abuſe us to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
'Twere convenient for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to undeceive the <hi>Czar.</hi> How
things ſhould be repreſented to
<hi>Naſhockin</hi> and <hi>Bogdan.</hi> The
Ruſſians mightily pleaſed with
their peace with <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Trade laſt Summer was
very low in <hi>Moſco,</hi> by reaſon
of their late war, which had
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52932:82"/>
dreyn'd them of two Fifths, beſides the
raiſing of their Cuſtoms, and taking
their Goods by force for copper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which fell from an hundred to
one, till at laſt it was call'd in, to the
undoing of many men. Divers hang'd
themſelves, others drunk away the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
of their States, and dyed with
drinking,</p>
               <p>Engliſh Cloth is a Drug, becauſe
dearer than the Dutch, which though
ſlight, and ſhrinks a ſixth part in wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
yet the Ruſſians like it, becauſe
they ſay none but new cloth will ſhrink,
but we are too blame for not fitting
them with the like. Again, we keep
our old trade of Cloth, but they bring
Silks, and all manner of pedlary ware,
which vends better than cloth, the
which grows now much out of Faſhion.
<hi>Sed ſi populus vult decipi, decipiatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Perſian and Indian Silk trade
prevail in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the <hi>Czar,</hi> I fear will
think it too great a boon to reſtore the
Engliſh Immunities, and 'twill be as
hard for them to regain their priviledges,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52932:83"/>
as it was for <hi>Pharoahs</hi> people to drive
their Charriots through the Red Sea,
when their wheels fell off.</p>
               <p>As I have nothing to ſay againſt the
magnificence, ſplendor, clemency and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rtue of the <hi>Czars</hi> own perſon, So I
have no reaſon to recommend the <hi>Ruſſes</hi>
integrity, for the generality of them
are falſe, Truce-breakers, ſubtile Foxes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ravenous Wolves, much altered,
ſince their traffick with the Hollander,
by whom they have much improv'd
themſelves in villany and deceit,</p>
               <p>The Dutch, like Locuſts, ſwarm in
<hi>Moſco,</hi> and eat bread out of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-mens
mouths, they are more in
number, and richer, and ſpare no gifts
to attain their ends; whereas the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
depending on their old priviledges,
think 'tis enough to ſay with the Jews,
<hi>We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father,</hi> we
are Engliſh men, do us right, or we
will complain: But the Ruſſians are of
<hi>Solomons</hi> opinion, that money anſwers
all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:52932:83"/>
If we would out-do the Dutch
Trade, it muſt not be driven on by ſuch
as take up Goods upon truſt and time,
as it has been theſe twenty years laſt
paſt. At preſent they come like Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts
out of the bottomleſs pit, and ſo
they do all the world over, where there
is a Sun-ſhine of gain. In <hi>Ruſſia</hi> they
are better accepted than the Engliſh,
becauſe they gratifie the Nobility with
gifts, which they will have if they lend
any aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Hollanders have another advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
by rendring the Engliſh cheap and
ridiculous by their lying pictures, and
libelling pamphlets, this makes the
Ruſſian think us a ruined Nation. They
repreſent us by a Lyon painted with
three Crowns reverſ'd and without a
tail, and by many Maſtive Dogs, whoſe
ears are cropt and tails cut off. With
many ſuch ſcandalous prints, being

It would not be impertinent, in my

Naſhockin,</hi> to breed in him an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Brittiſh Majeſties real
greatneſs, which the Dutch have ſo
much extenuated. <hi>Bogdan Matfoidg</hi>
the Chamber-Favouritie ſhould not be
neglected neither. He fancies Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and therefore ſhould be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

maintains reaſon of State, ſo <hi>Bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
muſt be the man to procure the

Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Ruſſes</hi> are very proud of, and
much pleaſed, with the honourable
peace they have made with <hi>Poland,</hi>

The length of the Fiſh <hi>Bellu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga.</hi>
                     <hi>Caviare</hi> of two ſorts.
The <hi>Belluga</hi> ſwallows abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

               <p>HAving elſewhere mentioned <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viare,</hi>
I ſhall now give you a full
account thereof; It is made at <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
of the Rows of Sturgeon and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luga.</hi>
The <hi>Belluga</hi> is a large Fiſh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twelve or fifteen foot long, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſcales, not unlike a Sturgeon, but
more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſhious and large; his fleſh is
whiter than Veal, and more delicious
than Marrow. Of theſe two Fiſhes
they take great numbers only for their
Rows ſake, which they ſalt and preſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and put up into Casks, ſome they ſend

unpreſſ'd, and a little corn'd with Salt
being accounted a great Dainty. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viare</hi>
is of two ſorts, the firſt made of
the Sturgeons ſpawn, this is black, and
ſmall grain'd, ſomewhat waxy, like
<hi>Potargo,</hi> and is call'd <hi>Eekra</hi> by the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,
the Turks make this. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſort is made of the <hi>Belluga's</hi> Row,
in whoſe belly is found an hundred and
fifty, and two hundred weight of ſpawn,
'tis a grain as large as a ſmall pepper
corn of a darkiſh gray. The <hi>Belluga</hi>
lyes in the bottom of the River, and
ſwallows many large pebbles of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible

            <p>THis Copy I received from the hands of
a Gentleman that attended upon
the learned Dr. <hi>C.</hi> all the time of his
being with the Emperor of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> It was
then in the form of a Letter written with
the Doctors own hand to an eminent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of Phiſick here in <hi>London.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I was adviſed by ſeveral Perſons of
Quality to put it into the hands of ſome
that were learned and skilful, to diſtribute
it into Chapters and Sections, for the more
eaſie finding out anything contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and the better methodizing it, that it
might anſwer the Title deſigned for it. And
in regard the Author died before it came to
the Preſs, which prevented his looking it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or correcting any thing that might be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
through his hasty writing of it, I was
neceſſitated to get another worthy perſon to
Tranſcribe it, who being altogether a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
not only to the Doctors ſtile and way of
writing, but alſo to the ſtile and language
of this Country of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> except by reading.
The Reader I humbly conceive will not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:52932:95"/>
if ſome litteral and other ſmall errors
in that Language have eſcaped his hand,
which is moſt in the proper names of Men
