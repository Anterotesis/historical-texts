            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Subject of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourses is of that inestimable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that it deserves our deepest reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and care to consider and apply it: 'Tis the great <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the design of Eternal Wisdom, the chiefest of all Gods Works, that contains the Glorious Wonders of his Mercy and Power, wherein he renders himself most worthy of our Supreme Veneration and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our most raised Thoughts are
<pb facs="tcp:42565:3"/>
infinitely beneath its Dignity. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Light of the Gospel hath clearly reveal'd so much of it as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit to be known in our earthly state, yet the sublimer parts are still secret, and reserv'd for a full discovery by the brightness of our Saviour's Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Now if the Excellency of things excites our Spirits to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive in searching into their nature, this Divine Object should awaken all our Powers, and arrest our Minds, in the serious steady contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of it, being alone capable to satisfy their immortal appetite. The Importance of it is correspondent to its excellency: for 'tis no less than the recovery of us from extream and eternal misery, and the Restoring of us to the enjoyment of the Blessed God, a felicity without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or end. If we have any regard to
<pb facs="tcp:42565:3"/>
Salvation, (and who would be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to neglect it for unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frivolous Vanities) it will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to know the means by which we may obtain it; and to employ the flying moments of our short time in those things that are profitable for our last End, that we may not lose Temporal and Eternal Life toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Many of the Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines have written of this noble Argument, from whom I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived benefit in the following compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But none, as I know, hath consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all the parts together, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them in one view. There still remains a rich abundance for the perpetuall exercise of our Spirits. The <hi>Eternal Word</hi> alone was able to perfect all things by once speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Humane words are but an Eccho

that answers the Voice of God, and cannot fully express its Power, nor pass so immediately through the sence to the Heart, but they must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. May these Discourses be effectual to inflame us with the most ardent Love to our Saviour, who ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som'd us with the unvaluable price of his own blood, and to perswade us to live for Heaven, the purchase of that Sacred Treasure, I shall for ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Divine Grace, and obtain my utmost aim.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Introduction. A short view of Mans primitive State. His Conformity to God; natural, moral, and in Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and Dominion over the Creatures. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral resemblance, as it refers to all the faculties. The happiness of Man with respect to his sensitive and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Nature. Of all sublunary Creatures he is onely capable of a Law. What the Law of Nature contains. God entred into a Covenant with Man. The Reasons of that Dispensation. The Terms of the Covenant were becoming God and Man. The special clause in The Covenant concerning the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil. The Reasons of the Prohibition.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He felicity which the Lord Jesus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for Believers, includes a perfect freedom from Sin,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.36.</note> and all afflictive evils, the just consequents of it: and the <hi>fruition</hi> of <hi>Righteousness, Peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> and <hi>Joy,</hi> wherein the Kingdom of God consists. In this the second Covenant excels the first; the Law supposes Man upright, and the happiness it promises to exact Obedience, is called Life, it rewards Innocence with Immortality: but the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness of the Gospel is stil'd Salvation, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the rescuing of lapsed Man from a state of misery, and the investing of him with unperishing Glory.</p>
            <p>In order to the Discovery of the excellency of this Benefit, and the endearing Obligations laid on us by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42565:5"/>
our Redeemer, 'tis necessary to take a view of that dreadful and desperate Calamity which seiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind: the wretchedness of our Captivity, illustrates the Glory of our Redemption. And since the misery of Man was not the original condition of his nature, but the effect of his guilty choice, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to make some reflection upon his first state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he came out of the pure hands of God, that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our present misery with our lost happiness, we may revive in our breasts the affections of Sorrow, Shame and Indignation against our selves; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the Heavenly <hi>Adam</hi> hath purchased for us a title to a better Inheritance than was forfeited by the Earthly one, we may with the more affectionate gratitude, extol the Favour &amp; Power of our <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God who is the living Fountain of all Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, spent an intire Eternity, in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his own Excellencies, before any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was made.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Happiness and Dignity of Mans state, which was the <hi>consequent,</hi> and <hi>accession</hi> to his Holiness. The Natural resemblance I shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on: for the distinct Illustration of the other, we must consider God in a <hi>threefold</hi> respect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In respect of his <hi>absolute</hi> Holiness, <hi>unspotted</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>infinite</hi> Goodness, <hi>incorruptible</hi> Justice, and whatever we conceive under the notion of <hi>moral</hi> Perfections.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With respect to his <hi>compleat</hi> Blessedness, (the result of his infinite Excellencies;) as he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly exempt from all evils, which might allay, and lessen his felicity, and enjoys those pleasures, which are worthy of his pure Nature, and glorious State.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In regard of his <hi>supreme</hi> Dominion, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it self to all things in Heaven and Earth. Now in the Participation of these, the Image of God did principally consist. The Holiness of Man was the copy of the Divine purity: his Happiness a represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Divine Felicity: and his Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the lower World, the resemblance of Gods So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.</p>
            <p>I will take a particular survey of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Man was conformed to God in Holiness. This appears by the expressions of the Apostle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sanctification of corrupt man; which he sets forth, by the <hi>renewing of him in knowledg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and holiness, after the image of the Creator.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42565:6"/>
The Renovation of things, is the restoring of them to their <hi>Primitive</hi> state,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> and is more, or less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by its proportion to, or distance from the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</hi> Holiness, &amp; Righteousnesse, are the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive <hi>Sum</hi> of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law,<note place="margin">Luke 1.73.</note> which not only represents the Will, but the Nature of God in his Supream Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and in conformity to it the Divine likeness eminently appear'd. <hi>Adam</hi> was created with the perfection of Grace, the progress of the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Saints is incomparably short of his beginning; By this we may in part conjecture at the Beauty of Holinesse in him, of which one faint <hi>ray</hi> appearing in renewed persons is so amiable. This primitive Beauty is exprest in Scripture by rectitude: <hi>God made Man upright.</hi> There was an universal entire <hi>rectitude</hi> in his <hi>Faculties,</hi> disposing them for their proper Operations. This will more fully appear, by considering the distinct powers of the Soul, in their regular Constitutions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The understanding was inrich'd with knowledg. Nature was unveiled to <hi>Adam,</hi> he enter'd into its Sanctuary, and discover'd its <hi>mysterious</hi> Operations. When the Creatures came to pay their <hi>Homage</hi> to him,<note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.19.</note> 
               <hi>whatsoever he called them, that was the name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> And their Names exprest their Natures. His knowledg reach'd through the whole compass of the Creation, from the <hi>Sun</hi> the glorious vessel of Light, to the <hi>Gloworm</hi> that shines in the <hi>hedg.</hi> And this knowledg was not acquir'd by Study, 'twas not the fruit of anxious inquiry, but as the <hi>illumination</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> is in an instant by the light of the Morning, so his Understanding was enlightned, by a pure beam from the Father of Lights.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42565:6"/>Besides, He had such a knowledg of the Deity, as was sufficient for his Duty and Felicity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His mind did not stick in the <hi>material</hi> part of things, but ascended by the several ranks of <hi>Beings,</hi> to the Universal <hi>Cause.</hi> He discover'd the Glory of the Divine <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> by their wonderful <hi>effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Almighty Power. When he first open'd his eyes, the stupendious <hi>Fabrick</hi> of Heaven and Earth presented itself to his view, and in it the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and clear <hi>characters</hi> of that Glorious Power, which produced it. For what could overcome the Infinite distance, between not being, and being, but Infinite Power? As there is no proportion between not being, and being, so the <hi>cause</hi> which unites those <hi>terms,</hi> must be without <hi>limits.</hi> Now the Divine Word alone, (which calls the things <hi>that are not, as if they were</hi>) caused the World to rise from the <hi>Abyss</hi> of empty nothing. <hi>At Gods Command the Heavens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.17.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 33.6.</note> 
               <hi>and all their Host were created.</hi> And this led him to consider the Immensity of the Divine Essence; For Infinite Power is <hi>incompatible</hi> with a <hi>finite</hi> Essence, and by the consideration of the <hi>Immensity,</hi> he might ascend to the Eternity of God. To be Eternal, without beginning, and Infinite without bounds, <hi>infer,</hi> one another, and necessarily <hi>exist</hi> in the same <hi>subject.</hi> For 'tis impossible, that any thing which is form'd by another, and hath a beginning, should not be limited in its Nature by the cause that produced it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle declares, that the <hi>Eternal Power of God</hi> is set forth in the Creation of the World,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> joyning with the discovery of his Power, that of his Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Admirable Wisdom appear'd to Man in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42565:7"/>
Creation. For by considering the Variety and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Order and Efficacy, the Beauty and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the World, he clearly discerned that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which so regularly disposed all. 'Tis thus that <hi>Wisdom</hi> speaks in the Book of <hi>Proverbs; When he prepared the Heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 8.27, 28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>When he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the Clouds above: When he strengthened th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Fountains of the Deep: when he gave the Sea his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that the Waters should not pass his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: when he appointed the Foundations of the Earth: I was with him,</hi> contriving all in the best manner for Ornament and Use. The knowledg of this, fill'd his Soul with wonder, and delight. The <hi>Psamist</hi> breaks forth with astonishment, as one in the midst of innumerable Miracles, <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in Wisdom hast made them all:</hi> And if he discovered such wonderful and Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Works of God,<note place="margin">Psa. 104.24.</note> when the vigour of the <hi>humane</hi> Understanding was so much impair'd by the <hi>Fall</hi>; how much more did <hi>Adam,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly understood <hi>Universal Nature,</hi> the <hi>offices</hi> of its parts, the <hi>harmony</hi> of the whole, and all the just Laws of <hi>Union,</hi> by which God hath joined together such a multitude of <hi>beings,</hi> so distant and disagreeing, and how the <hi>Publick</hi> Peace is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by their <hi>Private</hi> Enmity. This discovery caused him to acknowledge, that <hi>Great is the Lord, and of great Power, his Understanding is infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Infinite Goodness shin'd forth in the Creation. This is the leading Attribute, that call'd forth the rest to work. As there was no matter, so no motive to induce God to make the World, but what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42565:7"/>
arose from his Goodness: For he is an <hi>All-sufficient</hi> Being, perfectly blessed in himself. His Majesty is not encreased by the Adoration of Angels, nor his Greatnesse by the Obedience of Nature; neither was he less happy, or content, in that Eternal Duration before the existence of any Creature, than he is since. His Original Felicity is equally incapable of accession; as of diminution. 'Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident therefore, that only free, and unexcited Goodness, moved him to create all things, that he might impart being and happiness to the Creature, not inrich his own.</p>
            <p>And as by contemplating the other works of God, so especially by reflecting upon himself, <hi>Adam</hi> had a clear sight of the Divine <hi>Attributes,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd in his Creation. Whether he consider'd his lowest part, the Body, 'twas form'd of the Earth, the most artificial and beautiful piece of the <hi>visible</hi> World. The contrivance of its parts,<note place="margin">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Hom.</note> was with that proportion and exactness, as most conduc'd to Comliness and Service. Its stature was erect and raised, becoming the Lord of the Creatures, and an observer of the Heavens. A Divine Beauty and Majesty was shed upon it. And this was no vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ray,</hi> soon <hi>eclips'd</hi> by a Disease, and extinguisht by Death, but shin'd in the countenance without any declination. The <hi>Tongue</hi> was Man's peculiar glory, being the <hi>interpreter</hi> of the mind, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to signifie all the Affections of the Soul. In short, the Body was so fram'd, as to make a visible discovery of the Prerogatives of his Creation. And when he reflected upon his Soul, that animated his dust, its excellent endowments, wherein 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42565:8"/>
to the Angels, its capacity of enjoying God himself for ever, he had an internal and most clear testimony of the glorious perfections of his Creator. For Man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Miratur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> homo, cum sit ipse mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum.</hi> Aug.</note> who alone admires the works of God, is the most admirable of all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Image of God was <hi>resplendent</hi> in mans Conscience, the seat of practical Knowledg, and Treasury of moral Principles. The <hi>directive</hi> facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was sincere, and incorrupt, not infected with any disguising tincture: 'twas clear from all prejudices, which might render it an incompetent Judg of good and evil. It instructed Man in all the parts of his <hi>relative</hi> Obligations to God, and the Creatures. 'Twas not fetter'd and confin'd, fearfully restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what is Lawful; nor licentious and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in what is forbidden. <hi>Briefly,</hi> Conscience in <hi>Adam</hi> upright, was a <hi>subordinate</hi> God, that gave Laws, and exacted obedience to that glorious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who is its Superior.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There was a Divine Impression on the Will. Spiritual Reason kept the Throne, and the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Faculties observed an easy and <hi>regular</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to its <hi>dictates.</hi> The Affections were exercis'd with proportion to the quality of their Objects. Reason was their inviolable Rule. Love the most noble, and Master-affection, which gives being and goodness to all the rest, even to hatred it self; (for so much we hate an object, as it hinders our enjoyment of the good we love) this precious Incense was offer'd up to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and supreme Being, which was the Author of his Life. <hi>Adam</hi> fully obeyed the <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>great</hi> Command, of loving the Lord with all his heart,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42565:8"/>
soul, and strength. His love to other things was regulated by his love to God. There was a perfect accord between flesh and spirit in him. They both joyn'd in the service of God, and were naturally mov'd to their happiness. In short, the image of God, in <hi>Adam,</hi> was a living, powerful Principle, and had the same relation to the Soul, which the Soul hath to the Body, to animate and order all its Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in their Offices and Operations, according to the Will of his Creator.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Image of God consisted (though in an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour degree) in the happy state of man. Herein he resembled that infinitly Blessed Being. This happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had relation to the <hi>two</hi> Natures, which enter into Mans Composition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Sensitive,</hi> and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in <hi>two</hi> things. 1. In the excellent disposition of his Organs. 2. In the enjoyment of convenient Objects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the excellent disposition of the Organs. His body was form'd immediately by God, and so not liable to those defects, which proceed from the weakness of second causes. No blemish, or disease, which are the effects and footsteps of sin, were to be found in him. His health was not a frail inconstant disposition, easily ruin'd by the jarring elements, but firm and stable. The humours were in a just temperament, to prevent any destemper, which might tend to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of that excellent frame. Briefly all rhe senses were quick and lively, able to perform with facility, vigour, and delight, their operations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There were convenient Objects, to entertain his sensitive faculties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42565:9"/>He enjoyed Nature in its <hi>original</hi> Purity, crown'd with the <hi>benediction</hi> of God; before 'twas blasted with the curse. The World was all Harmony and Beauty, becoming the goodness of the Creator; and not as 'tis since the Fall disorder'd and deform'd in many parts, the effect of his Justice. The Earth was liberal to <hi>Adam</hi> of all its Treasures: the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of their Light, and sweetest Influences. He was seated in <hi>Eden,</hi> a place of so great beauty and delight, that it represented the <hi>Celestial</hi> Paradise, which is refresht <hi>with Rivers of Pleasure.</hi> And as the <hi>ultimate</hi> End of the Creatures was to raise his mind, and inflame his heart with the love of his great Benefactor; So their first and natural use was the satisfaction of the Senses, from whence the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of the <hi>Animal</hi> Life did proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>supreme</hi> Happiness consisted in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his most noble Faculties, on their proper Objects. This will appear by considering, that as the <hi>spiritual</hi> Faculties have <hi>objects</hi> which infinitely excel those of the <hi>sensitive</hi>; So their capacity is more inlarged, their union with <hi>objects</hi> is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, and their perception is with more quickness and vivacity; and thereby are the greatest instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pleasure to the <hi>rational</hi> being. Now the highest Faculties in Man, are the <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>; and their happiness consists in union with God, by Knowledg and Love.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Knowledg of God. As the desire of Knowledg is the most natural to the humane Soul, so the obtaining of it produces the most noble and sweetest pleasure. And proportionably to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of excellency that are in <hi>objects,</hi> so much of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42565:9"/>
               <hi>rational</hi> Perfection and Satisfaction accrues to the mind by the knowledg of them. The discovery of the Works of God greatly affected Man, yet the excellencies scatter'd among them, are but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and mutable shadow of God's infinite and unchangable Perfections. How much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful was it to his pure understanding, tracing the footsteps and impressions of God in <hi>Natural</hi> things, to ascend to him, who is the glorious <hi>Original</hi> of all Perfections. And although his finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing could not comprehend the Divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, yet his knowledg was answerable to the degrees of Revelation, wherein God was manifested. He saw the admirable Beauty of the Creator through the <hi>transparent</hi> vail of the creatures. And from hence there arose in the Soul, a pleasure pure, solid, and satisfying, a pleasure divine; for God takes infinit contentment in the contemplation of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Happiness of Man consisted in the Love of God. 'Twas not the naked <hi>speculation</hi> of the Deity that made him happy, but such a knowledg as ravisht his Affections. For happiness results from the <hi>fruitions</hi> of all the Faculties. 'Tis true, that by the mediation of the understanding, the other Faculties have access to an <hi>object</hi>; the Will and Affections can't be enclin'd to any thing, but by vertue of an <hi>act</hi> of the mind which propounds it as worthy of them. It follows therefore that when by the discovery of the <hi>transcendent</hi> excellencies in God, the Soul is excited to love and to delight in Him as its <hi>Supreme</hi> Good; 'tis then really and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy. Now as <hi>Adam</hi> had a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42565:10"/>
of God, so the height of his love was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his knowledg, and the compleatness of his enjoyment was according to his Love. All the Divine Excellencies were amiable to him. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, Purity, Justice, and Power of God, which are the terrour of guilty creatures, secur'd his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness whilst he continued in his <hi>Obedience.</hi> His Conscience was clear and calm, no unquiet fears discompos'd its Tranquillity, 'twas the seat of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Peace. Briefly, His love to God was perfect,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.18.</note> without any allay of tormenting fear; and Delight, its inseparable attendant, was pure without the least mixture of Sorrow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There was in Mans dominion and power over the Creatures, a shining part of God's Image. He was appointed God's Lieutenant in the world, and adorn'd with a Flower of his Crown. God gave him the solemn Investiture of this dignity, when he brought the Creatures to receive their <hi>names</hi> from him,<note place="margin">Psal. 8.5, 6.</note> which was a mark of their <hi>homage,</hi> and a <hi>Token</hi> of his supreme Empire to command them by their names. As this Dominion was establisht by the order of God, so 'twas exercised by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body. In his Face and Words there was something so powerful, as commanded all the hosts of the lower world. And as their subjection was most easie without constraint, or resistance, so 'twas most equal without violence and oppression.</p>
            <p>Thus holy and blessed was <hi>Adam</hi> in his <hi>Primitive</hi> state. And that he might continue so, he was obliged for ever to obey the Will of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him Life and Happiness. By the first neglect of his Duty, he would most justly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42565:10"/>
incur the loss of both. This will appear by considering the design of God in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>God did not make the World and Man for the meer exercise of his Power, and so left them; but as the production of all things was from his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so their resolution and tendency is for his Glory. He is as universally the <hi>final,</hi> as the <hi>efficient</hi> cause of all creatures. For that which receives its being from another, can't be an end to it self; for the <hi>prevision</hi> of the end in the mind of the Creator, sets him a work, and is <hi>antecedent</hi> to the being of the creature. Therefore the <hi>Wiseman</hi> tells us, that <hi>God made all things for himself.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note> that <hi>Of him, and to him, and through him are all things:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11.36.</note> 
               <hi>to whom be glory for ever.</hi> The lower rank of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>objectively</hi> glorifie God; as there is a visible demonstration of his excellent Attributes in them. Man is only qualified to know, and love the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: And as the benefit of all redounds to him, 'tis his duty to pay the tribute for all. By his mouth the world makes its acknowledgment to God. He is the Interpreter of the silent and uninterrupted Praises,<note place="margin">Psal. 145.10.</note> which the full <hi>Quire</hi> of Heaven and Earth renders to him. <hi>O Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all thy works praise thee,</hi> (from the most noble to the least worthy) <hi>thy Saints bless thee.</hi> Thankfulness is the <hi>homage</hi> due from understanding Creatures.</p>
            <p>And from hence it follows, that Man was only in a state of <hi>moral dependance,</hi> and capable of a Law. For a Law being the declaration of the Superiours Will, requiring Obedience, and threatning Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the <hi>failure</hi> thereof; there must be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Reason and choice in that nature that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42565:11"/>
by it. 1. To discover the Authority that enjoins it. 2. To discern the matter of the Law. 3. To determine it self out of judgment and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Obedience, as most excellent in it self and advantageous to the performer.</p>
            <p>Now all inferiour Creatures are moved by the secret force of <hi>natural</hi> inclinations; they are insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of <hi>moral</hi> engagements, and are not wrought on in an <hi>illuminative</hi> way by the foresight of rewards and punishments. But Man who is a reasonable creature owes <hi>a reasonable service.</hi> And it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that Man should be exempt from a Law.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> For as the notion of a God, that is of the first and supreme Being, excludes all possibility of obligation to another,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.35.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath first given to the Lord, and it shall be recompensed to him again?</hi> And of subjection to a Law, for supremacy and subjection are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible; so the quality of a Creature includes the relation of dependance, and natural subjection to the Will of God. This is most evident from that <hi>common</hi> Principle which governs the <hi>intelligent</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis a moral <hi>Maxime</hi> to which the reasonable <hi>nature</hi> necessarily assents, That the dispensing of benefits acquires to the Giver a Right to command, and lays on the Receiver an Obligation to obey; and these rights and duties are measured by the nature of the benefits as their just Rule. This is visible in that Dominion which is amongst men.</p>
            <p>If we ascend to the <hi>first</hi> Springs of Humane Laws, we shall find the <hi>original</hi> Right of Power to arise either from Generation in Nature, or Preservation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n War, or some <hi>publick</hi> Good accruing to the Society by the prudent care of the Governor. Now the being and blessedness of the creature are the greatest
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42565:11"/>
and most valuable benefits that can be received; and in the bestowing of them is laid the most real founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Power and Authority. Upon this account Man who derives his life and felicity from God, is under a natural and strong obligation to comply with his will. From this right of Creation God asserts his universal Dominion: <hi>I have made the Earth, and created Man upon it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 45.12.</note> 
               <hi>even my hands have stretcht out the Heavens, and all their hosts have I commanded.</hi> And the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, <hi>Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is He that made us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 100.3.</note> 
               <hi>and not we our selves; we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.</hi> His Jurisdiction is grounded on his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in Man; and that arises from his giving being to him. <hi>Remember, O Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 44.21.</note> 
               <hi>for thou art my servant, I have formed thee.</hi> From hence he hath a supreme Right to impose any Law, for the performance of which Man had an original Power. Universal Obedience is the just consequent of our obligations to the Divine Goodness.</p>
            <p>Suppose that Man were not the work of God's hands, yet the infinite excellency of his nature gives him a better title to command us, than Man hath upon the account of his reason to govern those Creatures that are inferiour to him. Or suppose that God had not created the matter of which the Body is compos'd, but only inspir'd it with a living Soul, yet his right over us had been unquestionable. The <hi>Civil</hi> Law determines, that when an Artificer works on rich materials, and the engraving be not of extraordinary value, that the whole belongs to him who is the owner of the materials. But if the matter be mean, and the workmanship excellent, in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42565:12"/>
which the price wholly lies; as if a Painter should draw an admirable Picture on a piece of Canvas, the Picture of right belongs to him that drew it. So if, according to the errour of some <hi>Philosophers,</hi> the matter of which the World was made had been Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,<note place="margin">Plato.</note> yet God having infused a reasonable Soul into a piece of <hi>clay,</hi> which is the principle of its life, and gives it a transcendent value above all other beings which were made of the same element, it is most just he should have a property in him, and dominion over him.</p>
            <p>The Law of Nature to which Man was subject up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Creation, contains those <hi>moral</hi> Principles concerning good and evil, which have an essential equity in them, and are the measures of his duty to God, to himself, and to his fellow creatures. This was publisht by the voice of Reason, and is <hi>holy, just and good:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.12.</note> Holy as it enjoins those things wherein there is a conformity to those Attributes and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, which are the pattern of our imitation: So the general Rule is, <hi>Be holy, as God is holy, in all manner of conversation</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15.</note> and this is most honourable to the humane nature. 'Tis just, that is, exactly agreable to the frame of mans faculties, and most suitable to his condition in the world: and good, that is, beneficial to the observer of it. <hi>In keeping of it there is great reward.</hi> And the obligation to it is eternal,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.11.</note> it being the unchangeable will of God grounded on the natural and unvariable relations between God and Man, and between Man and the Creatures.</p>
            <p>Besides the particular directions of the Law of Nature, this general Principle was planted in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42565:12"/>
reasonable Soul, to obey God in any instance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he did prescribe his pleasure.</p>
            <p>Moreover, God was pleased to enter into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Adam,</hi> and with all his Posterity, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally descending from him: And this was the effect;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of admirable Goodness: For by his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over Man he might have signified his Will meerly by the way of Empire, and requir'd Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But he was pleased to condescend so far as to deal with Man in a sweeter manner, as with a Creature capable of his Love, and to work upon him by rewards and punishments, congruously to the reasonable Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of Wisdom to secure Man's obedience: For the Covenant being a mutual engagement between God and Man, as it gave him infallible assurance of the reward to strengthen his Faith, so it was the surest bond to preserve his Fidelity. 'Tis true the Precept alone binds by vertue of the authority that imposes it, but the consent of the Creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases the Obligation; It <hi>twists</hi> the cords of the Law, and binds more strongly to Obedience. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> was God's servant, as by the condition of his nature, so by his choice, accepting the Covenant, from which he could not recede without the guilt and infamy of the worst perfidiousness.</p>
            <p>The terms of the Covenant were becoming the Parties concern'd, God and Man; It established an inseparable Connexion between Duty and Felicity. This appears by the Sanction, <hi>In the day thou eatest of the forbidden fruit, thou shalt die.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> In that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>species</hi> of Sin the whole <hi>genus</hi> is included; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Apostles</hi> Exposition: <hi>Cursed is every

one that doth not continue in all the works of the Law to do them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> The threatning of Death was exprest, it being more difficult to be conceiv'd.</p>
            <p>The promise of Life upon his Obedience was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and easily suggested it self to the rational Mind. These were the most proper and powerful <hi>motives</hi> to excite his Reason, and affect his Will. For Death <hi>primarily</hi> signifies the dissolution of the <hi>vital</hi> union between the Soul and Body, and <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> all the preparatory dispositions thereunto; Diseases, Pains, and all the Affections of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which terminate in Death as their <hi>center.</hi> This is the extremest of <hi>temporal</hi> Evils, which inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Nature shrunk from, it being a <hi>deprivation</hi> of that excellent state which Man enjoyed. But prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally it signified the separation of the Soul from God's reviving presence, who is the only Fountain of Felicity. Thus the Law is interpreted by the Lawgiver, <hi>The Soul that sins shall die.</hi> Briefly, Death in the threatning is <hi>comprehensive</hi> of all kinds and degrees of evils,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.4.</note> from the least Pain, to the compleatness of Damnation. Now 'tis an invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Principle deeply set in the <hi>Human</hi> Nature, to preserve its being and blessedness, so that nothing could be a more powerful restraint from Sin, than the fear of Death which is destructive to both.</p>
            <p>This constitution of the Covenant was founded not only in the Will of God, but in the nature of the things themselves: And this appears by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Holiness is more excellent in it self, and separately considered, than the reward that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it. 'Tis the peculiar glory of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>God is glorious in Holiness.</hi> And as He prefers
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42565:13"/>
the infinite purity of his Nature, before the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal felicity of his state, so he values in the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature the vertues by which they represent his Holiness, more than their perfect Contentment by which they are like Him in Blessedness. Now God is the most just esteemer of things, his judgment is the infallible measure of their real worth; 'tis therefore according to natural order that the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of Man should depend upon his Integrity, and the reward be the fruit of his Obedience.</p>
            <p>And although it is impossible that a meer Creature, in what state soever, should obtain any thing from God by any other title but his voluntary Promise, the effect of his Goodness; yet 'twas such Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as God was invited to exercise, by the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Mans obedience. And as the neglect of his Duty had discharged the Obligation on God's part, so the performance gave him a claim, by right of the Promise, to everlasting Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the <hi>first</hi> part of the alliance was most reasonable, so was the <hi>Second,</hi> that Death should be the wages of Sin. It is not conceivable that God should continue his favour to Man, if he turn'd Rebel against Him: For this were to disarm the Law, and expose the Authority of the Lawgiver to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and would reflect upon the Wisdom of God. Besides, If the reasonable Creature violates the Law, it necessarily contracts an obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, So that if the Sinner who deserves death should enjoy life, without satisfaction for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or Repentance to qualifie him for pardon, (both which were without the compass of the <hi>first</hi> Covenant) this would infringe the unchangable rights of Justice, and disparage the Divine Purity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42565:14"/>In the <hi>first</hi> Covenant there was a special <hi>clause,</hi> which respected Man as the inhabitant of <hi>Paradise,</hi> That he should <hi>not eat of the Tree of Knowledg of good and evil</hi> upon pain of Death.<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> And this <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was upon most wise and just reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To declare God's Sovereign Right in all things. In the quality of Creator he is <hi>Supreme</hi> Lord. Man enjoyed nothing but by a derived title from his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Allowance, and with an obligation to render to him the <hi>Homage</hi> of all. As <hi>Princes</hi> when they give estates to their <hi>Subjects,</hi> still retain the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi> and receive a small <hi>rent,</hi> which though incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in its value, is an acknowledgment of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon them. So when God placed <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> he reserved this mark of his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that in the free use of all other things, Man should abstain from the <hi>forbidden Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To make trial of Mans Obedience in a matter very congruous to discover it.<note place="margin">In minimis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientiae pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculum faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt Legislato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, quia Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislatoris ad Obedientiam obligantis potius haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da est ratio, quam rei de qua lex lata est.</note> If the <hi>Prohibition</hi> had been grounded on any <hi>moral</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> internal evil in the nature of the thing it self, there had not been so clear a testimony of God's Dominion, nor of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Subjection to it. But when that which in it self was indifferent, became unlawful meerly by the Will of God, and when the Command had no other excellency, but to make his Authority more sacred, this was a confining of Man's liberty, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain was pure Obedience.</p>
            <p>Besides, The restraint was from that which was very grateful and alluring to both the parts of Mans compounded Nature.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> The <hi>Sensitive</hi> Appetite is strongly excited by the Lust of the Eye; and this fruit being beautiful to the sight, the forbearance was an excellent exercise of vertue in keeping the lower
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42565:14"/>
appetite in obedience. Again, The desire of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is extremely quick and earnest, and in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance most worthy of the <hi>rational</hi> Nature; <hi>Nullus animo suavior cibus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lactan.</note> 'Tis the most high and luscious food of the Soul.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Tree of Knowledg</hi> was forbidden; So that the observance of the Law was the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, in keeping the <hi>intellectual</hi> Appetite in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity.</p>
            <p>In short, God required Obedience as a Sacrifice. For the <hi>Prohibition</hi> being in a matter of natural Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and a curb to Curiosity,<note place="margin">Obsequii glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria est in eo major, quod quis minus velit. <hi>Plin.</hi>
               </note> which is the Lust and Concupiscence of the Mind after things conceal'd; by a reverent regard to it, Man presented his Soul and Body to God as a living Sacrifice, which was his reasonable service.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note>

            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <argument>
               <p> Mans Natural state was mutable. The Devil, moved by hatred and envy, attempts to seduce him. The Temptation was suitable to Mans compounded Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Woman being deceived, perswades her Husband. The quality of the <hi>first</hi> Sin. Many were combin'd in it. 'Twas perfectly voluntary. Man had Power to stand. The Devil could only allure, not compel him. His Understanding and Will the causes of his Fall. The punishment was of the same date with his Sin. He forfeited his Righteousness and Felicity. The loss of original Righteousness, as it signifies the purity and liberty of the Soul. The torment of Conscience that was consequent to Sin. A whole Army of Evils enter with it into the World.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MAN was created perfectly holy, but in a natural, therefore mutable state. He was invested with power to prevent his <hi>Falling</hi>; yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a possibility of it. He was compleat in his own order, but receptive of sinful impressions. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Perseverance in Holiness belongs to a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural state; 'tis the priviledg of Grace, and exceeds the design of the <hi>first</hi> Creation.</p>
            <p>The rebellious Spirits, who by a furious ambition had raised a war in Heaven, and were fallen from their obedience and glory, designed to corrupt Man, and to make him a companion with them in their revolt. The most subtile amongst them sets about this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42565:15"/>
work, urged by <hi>two</hi> strong passions, Hatred and Envy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>Hatred.</hi> For being under a final and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable Doom, he lookt on God as an irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enemy: And not being able to injure his Essence, he struck at his Image: As the fury of some beasts discharges it self upon the Picture of a Man. He singled out <hi>Adam</hi> as the mark of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that by seducing him from his Duty, he might defeat God's design, which was, to be honoured by Mans free obedience, and so obscure his Glory as if He had made Man in vain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He was sollicited by <hi>Envy,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> native of Hell: For having lost the favour of God, and being cast out of Heaven the Region of Joy and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the sight of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Felicity exasperated his Grief. That Man who by the condition of his nature was below him, should be Prince of the world, whilst he was a Prisoner under those chains which restrain'd him and tormented him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the power and wrath of God, this made his state more intollerable. His torment was incapable of allay, but by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering man as miserable as himself. And as hatred excited his envy, so envy inflam'd his hatred, and both joyn'd in mischief. And thus pusht on, his Subtilty being equal to his Malice, he contrives a Temptation which might be most taking and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Man, in his raised and happy state. He attempts him with art, by propounding the <hi>lure</hi> of Knowledg and Pleasure, to inveigle the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Sensitive</hi> Appetites at once. And that he might the better succeed, he addresses to the Woman the weakest and most liable to seduction. He hides himself in the body of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> which before Sin
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42565:16"/>
was not terrible unto her: And by this instrument insinuates his Temptation. He <hi>first</hi> allures with the hopes of impunity, <hi>Ye shall not die,</hi> then he promiseth an universal knowledg of <hi>good and evil.</hi> By these pretences he ruin'd innocence it self. For the Woman deceived by those specious <hi>Allectives,</hi> swallowed the poison of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and having tasted Death, she perswaded her Husband by the same motives to despise the Law of their Creator. Thus Sin enter'd and brought confusion into the World. For the <hi>moral</hi> Harmony of the World consisting in the just subordination of the several ranks of beings to one another, and of all to God: When Man who was placed next to God, broke the Union, his Fall brought a desperate disorder into God's Government.</p>
            <p>And although the matter of the Offence seems small, yet the Disobedience was infinitely great; it being the transgression of that command, which was given to be the instance and real proof of Mans subjection to God. <hi>Totam legem violavit in illo lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis obedientiae praecepto.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> The Honour and Majesty of the whole Law was violated in the breach of that <hi>symbolical Precept.</hi> 'Twas a direct and <hi>formal</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, a publick and universal renouncing of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Many Sins were combin'd in that single act.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Infidelity:</hi> This was the <hi>first</hi> step to ruine. It appears by the order of the Temptation: 'twas first said by the Devil, <hi>Ye shall not die,</hi> to weaken their Faith; then <hi>ye shall be like gods,</hi> to flatter their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The fear of Death would have contrould the efficacy of all his Arguments; till that restraint was broke, he could fasten nothing upon them. This
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42565:16"/>
account the Apostle gives of the Fall; <hi>The woman being deceiv'd, was in the transgression.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.14.</note> As Obedience is the effect of Faith, so Disobedience of Infidelity. And as Faith comes by hearing the Word of God, so Infidelity by listening to the words of the Devil. From the <hi>deception</hi> of the Mind proceeded the <hi>depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of the Will, the <hi>intemperance</hi> of the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and the <hi>defection</hi> of the whole Man. Thus as the <hi>natural,</hi> so the <hi>spiritual</hi> Death made its <hi>first</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance by the Eye.<note place="margin">Primi in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine moriun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>li. <hi>Plin.</hi>
               </note> And this Infidelity is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely aggravated, as it implies an accusation of God both of envy and falshood.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Envy</hi>; As if he had deni'd them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections becoming the humane Nature; and they might ascend to a higher <hi>Orb,</hi> than that wherein they were placed, by eating the forbidden fruit. And what greater disparagement could there be of the Divine Goodness, than to suspect the Deity of such a low and base Passion, which is the special <hi>character</hi> of the Angels of Darkness.</p>
            <p>And 'twas equally injurious to the honour of God's Truth. For it is not easy to conceive that <hi>Adam</hi> who was so lately the effect of Gods Omnipotence should presently distrust it as unable to inflict the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned, but his assent was weakened as to the truth of the threatening: He did not believe the danger to be so great or certain upon his Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And he that <hi>believes not God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.16.</note> 
               <hi>makes him a Liar.</hi> An impiety not to be thought on without horror. And that which heightens the affront, is, that when he distrusted the Fountain of Truth, he gave credit to the Father of Lies; as appears by his compliance, the real evidence of his Faith. Now what viler contumely could be offered to the Creator.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:42565:17"/>2. Prodigious <hi>Pride.</hi> He was scarce out of the state of nothing, no sooner created, but he aspir'd to be as God. Not content with his Image, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected an equality,<note place="margin">The promise of the Tempter that they should not die, encouraged him to believe that he should enjoy an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, not depending on Gods Will, but absolute; which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> to be like him in his inimitable Attributes. He would rob God of his Eternity to live without end; of his Soveraignty, to command without dependance; of his Wisdome, to know all things without reserve. Infinite Insolence! and worthy of the most fiery indignation. That Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Son of the Earth, forgetful of his Original, should usurp the Prerogatives which are <hi>essential</hi> to the Deity, and set up himself a real Idol, was a strain of that arrogancy which corrupted the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Horrid Ingratitude. He was appointed Heir apparent of all things; yet undervaluing his present portion, he entertains a <hi>project</hi> of improving his Happiness. The excellent state newly conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, was a strong obligation to pay so small an acknowledgment to his Lord. The use of all the Garden was allowed to him, only a <hi>Tree</hi> excepted. Now in the midst of such variety and plenty, to be inflam'd with the intemperate appetite of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit, and to break a Command so equal and easie, what was it but a despising the rich Goodness of his great Benefactor. Besides, Man was endued with a diviner Spirit than the inferiour order of Creatures: Reason and Liberty were the special priviledges of his Nature, and to abuse them to Rebellion, renders him as more unreasonable, so more disingenuous than the Creatures below him, who inflexibly obey the Will of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The visible Contempt of God's Majesty, with a slighting his Justice. For the <hi>Prohibition</hi> was so
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42565:17"/>
express and terrible, that till he had cast off all respects to the Lawgiver, 'twas not possible he should venture to disobey him. The Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by the Apostle, <hi>Disobedience</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note> as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently such, it being the <hi>first</hi> and highest instance of it. 'Twas the profanation of <hi>Paradise</hi> it self, the place of God's special presence. There he fell, and trampled on God's Command before his face. What just cause of astonishment is it, that a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature should bid open Defiance to the Author of its Life! That a little breathing dust should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn its Creator! That Man should prefer <hi>servile</hi> compliance to the will of the Tempter, before <hi>free</hi> subjection to his Father and Sovereign! To depose God and place the Devil in his Throne, was double Treason, and provok'd his infinite jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Unaccountable and amazing Folly. What a despicable acquisition tempted him out of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? If there had been any possible comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, the choice had been more excusable. But that the pleasures of Taste and Curiosity should outvie the favour of God, which is better than Life, that the most pernicious <hi>evil,</hi> guilded with the thin appearance of <hi>good,</hi> should be preferr'd before the substantial and supreme Good, is the reproach of his Reason, and makes the choice so <hi>criminal.</hi> And what less than voluntary Madness could encline him to desire that, which he ought infinitely to have fear'd, that is, the knowledg of <hi>evil</hi>: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could destroy his Happiness, but the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Evil. What but a wilful <hi>distraction</hi> could induce him to believe that by defacing God's image, he should become more like him? Thus <hi>Man being
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42565:18"/>
in honour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 49.12.</note> 
               <hi>but without understanding, became like the beasts that perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. A <hi>bloody</hi> cruelty to himself, and all his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. When God had made him a <hi>depositary</hi> in a matter of infinite moment, that is of his own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and all mankinds, this should have been a powerful <hi>motive</hi> to have kept him vigilant: But giving a ready ear to the Tempter, he betraid his trust, and at once breaks both the Tables of the Law, and becomes guilty of the highest Impiety and Cruelty. He was a Murderer before a Parent, he disinherited all his Children before they were born, and made them Slaves before they knew the price of Liberty.</p>
            <p>And that which increases the malignity of this Sin, and adds an infinite <hi>emphasis</hi> to it, is, that 'twas perfectly voluntary, his Will was the <hi>sole</hi> cause of his Fall. And this is evident by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Adam</hi> innocent had a sufficient power to persevere in his holy State.<note place="margin">Deseruit, &amp; desertus est. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> There was no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction of any Grace which was requisite to his standing; He left God before he was forsaken by Him. Much less was there any <hi>internal</hi> impulsion from God. 'Tis inconsistent with the Divine Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to encline the Creature to sin: As God cannot be tempted to evil, neither tempts he any man. 'Tis injurious to his Wisdom to think that God would spoil that work, which he had compos'd with so much design and counsel. And 'tis dishonourable to his Goodness; He loved his Creature, and Love is an inclination to do good; 'twas impossible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for God to induce Man to sin, or to withdraw that power which was necessary to resist the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42565:18"/>
when the consequent must be his inevitable ruine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Devil did only allure,<note place="margin">In meritò ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminanda ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niunt, Causa quae impulit, causa quae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahere debu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, &amp; personae idonietas ad utrumque. <hi>Grot.</hi>
               </note> he could not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish his consent. Though his malice is infinite, yet his power is so restrain'd that he can't fasten an immediate, much less an irresistable impression on the Will: he therefore made use of an <hi>external</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to invite him. Now <hi>Objects</hi> have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining force, they are but partial <hi>agents,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive all their efficacy from the Faculties to which they are agreable. And although, since Sin hath disordered the flesh, there is difficulty in resisting those <hi>objects</hi> which pleasantly insinuate themselves, yet such an universal rectitude was in <hi>Adam,</hi> and so entire a subjection in the sensual <hi>Appetite</hi> to the superiour power of Reason, that he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an easie conquest. A resolute <hi>Negative</hi> had made him victorious:<note place="margin">Quantò po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas vitandi fuit faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior, tantò contumaciae crimine one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur. Diffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium facilis venia. <hi>Tertul</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> l. 2. ad uxor.</note> by a strong <hi>Denial</hi> he had baffled that proud Spirit. As the heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> when he, who is only rich in promises, offer'd to him the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the World with all its glory, disdain'd the offer, and cast off Satan with contempt. The true Rock was unmov'd, and broke all the proud waves that dasht against it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will fully appear that the Disobedience was <hi>Voluntary,</hi> by considering what denominates an action to be so. The <hi>two</hi> springs of <hi>humane</hi> actions are the Understanding and Will; and as there is no particular good but may have the appearance of some difficult unpleasant quality annexed, upon which account the Will may reject it; so any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>evil</hi> may be so disguised by the false lustre of <hi>goodness,</hi> as to encline the Will to receive it. This is clearly verified in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall. For a <hi>specious</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:42565:19"/>
Object was conveighed, through the unguarded Sence to his Fancy, and from that to his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which by a vicious carelesness neglecting to consider the danger, or judging that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the end did out-weigh the evil of the means, commended it to the Will, and that resolved to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. It is evident therefore, that the action which resulted from the direction of the Mind, and the choice of the Will was absolutely free.</p>
            <p>Besides, As the <hi>regret</hi> that is mixt with an action, is a certain <hi>Character</hi> that the person is under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint; So the delight that attends it, is a clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he is free.<note place="margin">Jam. 1.14.</note> When the <hi>Appetite</hi> is drawn by the <hi>lure</hi> of Pleasure, the more violent, the more voluntary is its <hi>motion.</hi> Now the representations of the <hi>forbidden fruit</hi> were under the notion of Pleasure. The Woman saw the <hi>fruit was good for food,</hi> that is, pleasurable to the Palate, and <hi>pleasant to the Eyes, and to be desired to make one wise</hi>; that is, to increase Knowledg,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> which is the pleasure of the Mind, and these <hi>Allectives</hi> drew her into a snare. <hi>Adam</hi> with complacency receiv'd the temptation, and by the enticement of <hi>Satan</hi> committed adultery with the Creature, from whence the cursed race of Sin and Miseries proceed.</p>
            <p>Suppose the Devil had so disguis'd the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that notwithstanding all his circumspection and care, <hi>Adam</hi> could not have discovered its <hi>evil:</hi> his invincible <hi>Ignorance</hi> had rendered the action invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary: But <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>conscious</hi> of his own action, there was <hi>light</hi> in his mind to discern the <hi>evil,</hi> and strength in his will to decline it. For the manner of the <hi>defection,</hi> whether it was from affected Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or secure Neglect, or transport of Passion,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42565:19"/>
it doth not excuse: The action it self was of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the supreme Law-giver so worthy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, that it should have awakened all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Soul to beware of that which was Rebellion against God, and ruin to himself.</p>
            <p>Or suppose he had been tried by Torments, whose extremity and continuance had vehemently opprest his nature; this had only lessen'd the guilt, the action had still been voluntary; for no external force can compel the Will to choose any thing, but under the notion of <hi>comparative</hi> goodness. Now to choose Sin rather than pains,<note place="margin">Job 36.21.</note> and to prefer ease before obedience, is highly dishonourable to God, whose Glory ought to be infinitely more valuable to us than Life and all its endearments. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though sharp Pains by discomposing the Body, make the Soul unfit for its highest and noblest Operations, so that it cannot perform the acts of Vertue with delight and freedom, yet then it may abstain from <hi>evil.</hi> But this was not <hi>Adam's</hi> case: The Devil had no Power over him (as over <hi>Job,</hi> who felt the extremity of his rage, and yet came off more than conqueror) to disturb his felicity, he prevailed by a simple <hi>suasion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briefly,</hi> Though Man had strength sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel all the Powers of Darkness, yet he was vanquisht by the assault of a single Temptation. These are the circumstances which derive a crimson guilt to Man's rebellious Sin, and render it above measure sinful.</p>
            <p>This will more fully appear by the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing declaration of God's displeasure against it, in the dreadful effects that ensued. The punishment of Man was of the same date with his Sin. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after his Treason against Heaven, he made
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42565:20"/>
a deadly forfeiture of his Original Righteousness and Felicity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He lost his Original Righteousness; which we may consider under the notion of the purity and beauty of the Soul, or of its dominion and liberty, in opposition to which, Sin is represented in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> by loathsom Deformity and Servitude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Soul degenerated from its purity; the Faculties remain'd, but the <hi>moral</hi> perfections were lost, wherein the brightness of God's Image was most conspicuous. How is Man disfigur'd by his Fall? How is he transform'd in an instant from the Image of God, into the Image of the Devil? He is defiled with the filthiness of flesh and spirit; he is asham'd at the sight of his own nakedness that reproach'd him for his crime; but the most shameful was that of the Soul: The one might be cover'd with leaves, the other nothing could conceal. To see a Face of exquisite Beauty devour'd by a <hi>Cancer,</hi> how doth it move compassion; but were the Natural Eye height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that clearness and perspicacity, as to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the deformity which Sin hath brought upon the Soul, how would it strike with grief, horrour and aversation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He was deprived of his Dominion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Understanding was so wounded by the violence of the fall, that not onely its light is much impaired, but its Power is so weakned as to the lower faculties, that those which according to the order of nature should obey, have cast off its just authority, and usurp the Goverment. The will hath lost its true Freedom, whereby 'twas enlarg'd to the extent and <hi>amplitude</hi> of the Divine Will, in loving whaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was pleasing to God, and is contracted to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42565:20"/>
mean and base Objects. What a furious disorder is in the Affections? The restraint of Reason to check their violent course, provokes them to swell higher and to be more impetuous, and the more they are gratified, the more insolent and outragious they grow.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senses,</hi> whose office is to be the Intelligencers of the Soul, to make discovery and to give a naked report without disturbing the higher Faculties, they sometimes mistake disguised enemies for friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sometimes by a false <hi>alarm</hi> move the lower Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and fill the Soul with disorder and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the voice of Reason can't be heard. By the <hi>irritation</hi> of Grief, the <hi>insinuation</hi> of Pleasure, or some other <hi>Perturbation,</hi> the Soul is captivated and wounded through the <hi>Senses.</hi> In short, when Man turn'd Rebel to God, he became a slave to all the Creatures. By their <hi>primitive</hi> Institution they were appointed to be <hi>subservient</hi> to the Glory of God, and the use of Man, to be <hi>motives</hi> of Love and Obedience to the Creator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Sin hath corrupted and changed them into so many instruments of vice, they <hi>are made subject unto vanity:</hi> And Man is so far sunk into the <hi>dregs</hi> of Servitude,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.20.</note> that he is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them. For by forsaking God the Supreme <hi>Object</hi> of Love, with as much injustice as folly, and choosing the Creature in his stead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he becomes a Servant to the meanest thing, upon which he places an inordinate affection.</p>
            <p>Briefly, Man who by his Creation was the son of God, is made a slave to <hi>Satan</hi> that damned spirit and most cursed creature. Deplorable <hi>Degradation!</hi> and worthy of the deepest shame and sorrow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Man lost his Felicity. Besides the trouble
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42565:21"/>
that Sin hath in its own nature, which I have toucht on before, there is a <hi>consequent</hi> guilt and torment attends it. <hi>Adam</hi> whilst obedient enjoyed peace with God, a sweet <hi>serenity</hi> of mind, a divine calm in the Conscience, and full satisfaction in himself. But after his Sin, he trembled at God's Voice and was tormented at his Presence.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>I heard thy voice, and was afraid,</hi> saith guilty <hi>Adam.</hi> He lookt on God as angry, and arm'd against him, ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the severe Sentence; Conscience began an early Hell within him: <hi>Paradise</hi> with all its Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures could not secure him from that sting in his Breast, and that sharpen'd by the hand of God. What confusion of Thoughts, what a combat of Passions was he in? when the Temptation which deceived him vanisht, and his spirit recovered out of the surprise, and took a clear view of his guilt in its true horrour, what indignation did it kindle in his Breast? How did Shame, Sorrow, Revenge, Despair, those secret executioners torment his spirit. The <hi>intelligent</hi> Nature, his peculiar excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency above the <hi>brutes,</hi> arm'd misery against him, and put a keener edge to it: 1. By reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foolish exchange he made of God himself, for the <hi>fruit</hi> of a <hi>tree</hi>; That so slender a Temptation should cheat him of his Blessedness. His present misery is aggravated, by the sad comparison of it with his <hi>primitive</hi> Felicity. Nothing remains of his <hi>first</hi> Innocence, but the vexatious <hi>regret</hi> of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost it. 2. By the foresight of the Death he deserved. The conscience of his Crimes rackt his Soul with the certain and fearful expectation of judgment.</p>
            <p>Besides the inward torment of his Mind, he was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42565:21"/>
expos'd to all miseries from without. Sin having made a breach into the World, the whole Army of Evils enter'd with it; the Curse extends it self to the whole Creation. For the World being made for Man, the place of his residence, in his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it hath felt the effects of God's displeasure. The whole course of Nature is set on fire. Whereas a general <hi>Peace</hi> and amicable <hi>Correspondence</hi> was establisht between Heaven and Earth, whilst all were united in subjection to the Creator: Sin that broke the <hi>first</hi> Union between God and Man, hath ruin'd the <hi>second.</hi> As in a <hi>State</hi> when one part of the <hi>Subjects</hi> fall from their Obedience, the rest which are constant in their Duty, break with the Rebels and make war upon them till they return to their <hi>Allegiance.</hi> So universal Nature was arm'd against rebellious Man, and had destroyed him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the merciful interposition of God.</p>
            <p>The Angels with flaming Swords expell'd him from <hi>Paradise.</hi> The Beasts who were all innocent, whilst Man remained innocent, they espouse Gods interest, and are ready to revenge the quarrel of their Creator. The insensible Creation which at first was altogether <hi>beneficial</hi> to Man, is become <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> The Heavens somtimes are hardened as <hi>Brass,</hi> in a long &amp; obstinate <hi>serenity:</hi> Sometimes are dissolved in a Deluge of <hi>rain:</hi> The <hi>earth</hi> is barren, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to the <hi>Sower,</hi>

            <argument>
               <p> All Mankind is involv'd in <hi>Adam</hi>'s guilt, and under the <hi>penal</hi> consequences that follow upon it. <hi>Adam</hi> the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> Principle of Mankind. An <hi>hereditary</hi> Corruption is transmitted to all that are propagated from him. The account the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives of the Conveiance of it. 'Tis an <hi>innate</hi> Habit. Tis universal. Corrupt <hi>Nature</hi> contains the seeds of all Sins, though they do not shoot forth together. 'Tis voluntary and culpable. The permission of the <hi>Fall</hi> is suitable to the Wisdom, Holiness, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God. The imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin to his Posterity is consistent with God's Justice.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Rebellion of the <hi>First</hi> Man against the great Creator, was a Sin of <hi>universal</hi> efficacy, that derives a guilt and stain to Mankind in all Ages of the World. The account the Scripture gives of it, is grounded on the <hi>relation</hi> which all men have to <hi>Adam</hi> as their <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> Principle.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their <hi>Natural.</hi> God created <hi>one</hi> Man in the beginning, from whom all others derive their beings: And that the <hi>unity</hi> might be the more entire, he form'd of him that aid which was necessary for the communicating his kind to the world.<note place="margin">Acts 17.26.</note> 
               <hi>He made of one Blood all Nations of Men, to dwell on the face of the earth.</hi> And as the whole race of Mankind was <hi>virtually</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Loins, so it was presumed to give <hi>virtual</hi> consent to what he did. The Angels were created immediatly and distinctly, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42565:23"/>
upon one another as to their Original; therefore when a great number revolted from God, the rest were not <hi>complicated</hi> in their Sin and Ruine. But when the <hi>first</hi> Man who was the Father of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind sinn'd, there was a Conspiracy of all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> in that Rebellion, and not one Subject left in his Obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He was the <hi>moral</hi> Principle of Mankind. In the <hi>first</hi> Treaty between God and Man, <hi>Adam</hi> was consider'd not as a single person, but as <hi>caput gentis,</hi> and contracted for all his <hi>desccndants</hi> by ordinary generation. His Person was the Fountain of theirs, and his Will the representative of theirs. From hence his vast <hi>Progeny</hi> became a party in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and had a title to the benefits contain'd in it, upon his Obedience, and was liable to the Curse upon his violation of it. Upon this ground the Apostle institutes a <hi>parallel</hi> between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Christ. That as by one Mans disobedience many were made sinners;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note> 
               <hi>so by the obedience of One, many were made righteous.</hi> As Christ in his Death on the Cross did not suffer as a private person, but as a surety and <hi>sponsor</hi> representing the whole Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the testimony of Scripture, <hi>If one died for all, then all were dead:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.15.</note> so the first <hi>Adam</hi> who <hi>was the figure of him that was to come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note> in his Disobedience was esteem'd a <hi>publick</hi> Person, representing the whole race of Mankind; and by a just Law it was not restrain'd to himself, but is the Sin of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature. <hi>Adam</hi> broke the <hi>first</hi> link in the chain whereby Mankind was united to God, and all the other parts which depended upon it, are necessarily separated from him. From hence the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note> that <hi>by Nature we are Children of wrath,</hi> that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42565:23"/>
is, liable to punishment, and that hath relation to guilt.</p>
            <p>And of this we have convincing Experience in the common Evils which afflict Mankind, before the commission of any <hi>actual</hi> Sin. The Cries of Infants who are only <hi>eloquent</hi> to grief, but <hi>dumb</hi> to all things els, discover that Miseries attend them. The Tears which are born with their Eyes, signifie they are come into a state of Sorrow. How many Troops of <hi>Deadly</hi> Diseases are ready to seize on them, immediatly after their Entrance into the World? So that 'tis apparent God deals with Man as an enemy, and therefore guilty of some great crime from his Birth.<note place="margin">Ut non fit aestimare Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens melior homini, an tristior nover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca fuerit. <hi>Plin.

They are not under so hard a Law of coming into the world. They are presently instructed to Swim, to Fly, to Run for their preservation. They are cloathed by Nature, and their Habits grow in proportion with their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, some with Feathers, some with Wool, others with Scales which are both Habit and Armour: But Man who is alone sensible of shame, is born naked, and though of a more delicate temper, is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to injuries by distemper'd Seasons, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unable to repel, or avoid the evils that encompass him. Now the account the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Sin silences all these complaints. Man is a Ttransgressor from the Womb, and how can he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a favourable Reception into the Empire of an offended God? Briefly, Sometimes Death enters into the retirements of Nature, and changes the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42565:24"/>
Womb into a Grave, which proves that assoon as we partake of the <hi>human</hi> Nature, we are guilty of the Sin that is common to it; <hi>For the wages of Sin is Death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocent state had the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Immortality, but by him <hi>Sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.12, 14, 17.</note> as a just Sentence upon the guilty, for that all men have sinned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An <hi>Hereditary</hi> Corruption is transmitted to all that naturally descend from him. If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in his Obedience, the <hi>spiritual</hi> as well as the <hi>natural</hi> Life had been conveighed to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but for his Rebellion he lost his <hi>primitive</hi> rectitude, and contracted an universal Corruption; which he derives to all his Posterity. And as in a Disease there is the <hi>defect</hi> of Health, and a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>humours</hi> that affects the Body; so in the <hi>depravation</hi> of Nature there is not the meer want of holiness, but a strong <hi>proclivity</hi> to sin. This <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of <hi>original</hi> Righteousness considerd as a Sin, is naturally from <hi>Adam,</hi> the principle of <hi>lapsed</hi> and corrupt Nature: But as a punishment, 'tis <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously</hi> from him, and falls under the ordination of Divine Justice.

               </gap> it is ineffectual to the <hi>cure.</hi> And what greater folly than to make our own evils the <hi>object</hi> of simple Speculation. I shall consider only that general account of it, which is set down in the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the universal and unchangable Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that every thing produce its like, not only in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42565:24"/>
regard of the same nature that is propagated from one <hi>individual</hi> to another, without a change of the <hi>species,</hi> but in respect of the qualities with which that nature is eminently affected. This is visible in the several kinds of Creatures in the world, they all preserve the nature of the principle from whence they are derived, and retain the <hi>vein</hi> of their <hi>original,</hi> the quality of their <hi>extraction.</hi> Thus our Saviour tells us that <hi>the fruit partakes of the rottenness of the tree:</hi> and <hi>whatever is born of the flesh, is flesh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.18. John 3.6.</note> The title of Flesh doth not signifie the <hi>material</hi> part of our <hi>humanity,</hi> but the Corruption of Sin with which the whole nature is infected. This is evident by the description the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives of it;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> 
               <hi>That the flesh is not subject to the Law of God,</hi> and that which ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates the evil is, that it can't be. Sinful Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is exprest by this title, partly in regard it is transmitted by the way of <hi>carnal</hi> propagation: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I was shapen in iniquity,</hi>

               <hi>and in Sin did my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceive me</hi>; And partly in regard 'tis exercised by the <hi>carnal</hi> members. This Corruption is a poison so subtile, that it pierces into all the powers of the Soul; so contagious, that it infects all the Actions; so obstinate, that only <hi>Omnipotent</hi> Grace can heal it.

The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is peremptory, <hi>Not one.</hi> The Fountain was poison'd in <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the Streams partake of the infection. All that are derived from him in a <hi>natural</hi> way, and have a relation to him as their <hi>common</hi> father, are sharers in this <hi>depravation.</hi> What difference soever there is in their <hi>Climates,</hi> Colours and <hi>external</hi> conditions of life, yet the blood from whence they spring taints them all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Corrupt Nature is <hi>pregnant</hi> with the seeds of all Sin, although they do not shoot forth together: And for this several accounts may be given. 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all Sins agree in their <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>end,</hi> yet some are contrary in their exercise. 2. The <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> spirit is not capable of many Passions in their height at the same time; and 'tis the <hi>art</hi> of our <hi>spiritual</hi> Enemies to suit their Temptations to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Man. 3. As the same Poison produces different <hi>effects</hi> in different Bodies, according to those various <hi>Humours</hi> which are <hi>predominant</hi> in them; so the same Corruption of Nature works va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously according to the different tempers of Men. For although the <hi>conception</hi> of Sin depends imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly upon the Soul, yet to the bringing of it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42565:25"/>
forth, the concurrence of the <hi>external</hi> Faculties is requisite. Thus a <hi>Voluptuary</hi> who is restrain'd from the <hi>gross</hi> acts of <hi>Sensuality</hi> by a Disease, or Age, may be as vicious in his Desires, as another who follows the pernicious swing of his Appetite, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a vigorous Complexion. Briefly, The variety of circumstances, by which the inward corruption is excited and drawn forth, makes a great difference as to the open and visible <hi>acts</hi> of it. Thus an <hi>ambitious</hi> person who uses <hi>Clemency</hi> to accomplish his design, would exercise <hi>Cruelty</hi> if 'twere necessary to his end.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, some are really more <hi>temperate,</hi> and exempted from the <hi>tyranny</hi> of the flesh than others; <hi>Cicero</hi> was more vertuous than <hi>Catiline,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> than <hi>Aristophanes:</hi> But these are priviledged persons, in whom the efficacy of Divine Providence either by forming them in the Womb, or in their Education, or by conducting them in their <hi>maturer</hi> Age, hath corrected the <hi>malignity</hi> of Nature. <hi>All men have sinn'd and come short of the glory of God's image.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.23.</note> And that Sin breaks not forth so outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in some as in others, the <hi>restraint</hi> is from an higher Principle, than common and corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Corruption although <hi>natural,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>Voluntary</hi> and <hi>Culpable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Voluntary:</hi> All <hi>Habits</hi> receive their <hi>character</hi> from those acts by which they are produced, and as the Disobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> was voluntary, so is the Depravation that sprung from it. 2. 'Tis inherent in the Will. If <hi>Adam</hi> had derived a Leprosie to all Men, it were an involuntary evil: Because the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of the Body are forreign to the Soul; But when the Corruption invades the <hi>internal</hi> Faculties,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42565:26"/>
'tis denominated from the <hi>subject</hi> wherein 'tis seated. 3. 'Tis the voluntary cause of <hi>actual</hi> Sins; and if the <hi>acts</hi> proceeding from this corruption are volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary the principle must be of the same nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis <hi>Culpable.</hi> The <hi>formality</hi> of Sin consists in its opposition to the <hi>Law,</hi> according to the <hi>defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Apostle, <hi>Sin is a transgression of the Law.</hi> Now the <hi>Law</hi> requires an entire <hi>rectitude</hi> in all the Faculties. It condemns corrupt inclinations, the <hi>originals</hi> as well as the <hi>acts</hi> of Sin. Besides, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence</hi> was not <hi>inherent</hi> in the <hi>humane</hi> Nature in its Creation, but was contracted by the <hi>Fall.</hi> The Soul is stript of its <hi>native</hi> Righteousness and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and is invested with contrary qualities. There is as great a difference between the corruption of the Soul in its degenerate state, and its <hi>primitive</hi> puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as between the loathsomness of a <hi>Carcass,</hi> and the beauty of a <hi>living Body.</hi> Sad change! and to be lamented with tears of confusion.</p>
            <p>That the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> should be so <hi>fatal</hi> to all his Posterity, is the most difficult part in the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Divine Providence.</hi> Nothing more offends <hi>carnal</hi> Reason, which forms many <hi>specious</hi> Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against it. I will briefly consider them.</p>
            <p>Since God saw that <hi>Adam</hi> would not resist the Temptation, and that upon his <hi>Fall,</hi> the whole race of Mankind, which he supported as the foundation, would sink into ruine, Why did he not confirm him against it, was it not within his Power, and more suitable to his Wisdome, Holiness, and Goodness?</p>
            <p>To this I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Divine Power could have preserved Man in his Integrity, either by laying a restraint on the <hi>apostate</hi> Angels, that they should never have made
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42565:26"/>
an attempt upon him; or by keeping the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing waking and vigilant, to discover the danger of the Temptation, and by fortifying the Will, and rendring it impenetrable to the <hi>fiery</hi> darts of Satan, without any prejudice to its freedom. For that doth not consist in an absolute Indifference, but in a judicious and deliberate choice; so that when the Soul is not led by a blind instinct, nor forc'd by a forreign power,<note place="margin">Quando Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma tanta satiabitur visione, &amp; tanta inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabitur Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris boni, ut ad seipsam sibi placendo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere ab illius dilectione non possit, <hi>Aug. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cont.</hi> Jul.</note> but embraces what it knows and approves, it then enjoyes the most true Liberty. Thus in the glorified Spirits above, by the full and constant Light of the Mind, the Will is indeclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fixt upon its <hi>supreme</hi> Good, and this is its Crown and Perfection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was most suitable to the Divine Wisdom, to leave Man to stand or fall by his own choice:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To discover the necessary dependance of all <hi>Second</hi> Causes upon the <hi>first.</hi> No Creature is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>impeccable,</hi> but the most perfect is liable to <hi>imperfection.</hi> He that is <hi>essentially,</hi> is only unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Good. Infinite Goodness alone excludes all possibility of receiving Corruption. The Fall of Angels and Man convince us, that there is one <hi>sole</hi> Beeing, immutably Pure and Holy, on whom all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and without whose <hi>Influence</hi> they cannot be, or must be eternally miserable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Twas very fit that <hi>Adam</hi> should be <hi>first</hi> in a state of trial, before he was confirm'd in his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The reason of it is clear, he was left to his own <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>election,</hi> that <hi>Obedience</hi> might be his choice, and in the performance of it, he might acquire a <hi>title</hi> to the reward. A determining ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue over him had crost the <hi>end</hi> of his Creation, which was to glorifie God in a free manner. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42565:27"/>
in <hi>Paradise</hi> there were amiable <hi>objects</hi> to allure the lower Faculties, before they were disordered by Sin. The <hi>forbidden Fruit</hi> had beauty to invite the <hi>Eye,</hi> and sweetness to delight the <hi>Palate.</hi> And if upon the competition of the <hi>Sensual</hi> with the <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi> Good he had re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ected the one and chose the other, he had been rais'd to an unchangeable state; his Innocence had been crown'd with Perseverance. As the Angels who continued in their Duty, when the rest revolted, are finally establisht in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Felicity. And the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives us an account of this order, when he tells us, <hi>That was first which was natural,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.46</note> 
               <hi>then that which is spiritual and supernatural</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man was created in a state of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but 'twas natural, therefore mutable, the confirming of him immediatly had been Grace, which belongs to a more excellent Dispensation. Now to bring Man from not <hi>being</hi> to a <hi>supernatural</hi> state, without trial of the <hi>middle</hi> state of Nature, was not so congruous to the Divine Wisdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The permission of the Fall doth not reflect on the Divine Purity; For</p>
            <p n="1">1. Man was made Upright; He had no inward Corruption to betray him; There was <hi>Antidote</hi> enough in his Nature to expel the strongest Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God was not bound to hinder the <hi>commission</hi> of Sin: 'Tis a true <hi>Maxime,</hi> that <hi>in debitis causa d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens efficit moraliter:</hi> But God is not only free from subjection to a Law, as having no Superiour, but was under no voluntary <hi>Obligation</hi> by Promise to prevent the Fall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither doth that <hi>first</hi> Act of Sin reflect on Gods unspotted Providence which suffer'd it, as if
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42565:27"/>
Sin were in any degree allowed by Him. The Holy Law which God gave to direct Man, the terrible Threatning annext to warn him, declare his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable <hi>Hatred</hi> against Sin. He permits innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Sins every day, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> He is as jealous of the Honour of his Holiness now, as in the beginning. 'Tis the worst impiety for the Sinner to <hi>think God like himself,</hi> as if he took complacency in sin,<note place="margin">Psal. 50.21.</note> because he is silent for a time and suffers the commission of it. In the next state he will fully vindicate his Glory, and convince the whole World of his eternal aversation from sin, by inflicting on sinners the most dreadful and durable torments.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The goodness of God is not disparag'd by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the fall: This appears by considering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God bestowed on Man an excellent being, and a happiness that might satisfie his nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd as humane, or holy. But he perverted the favours of God, to his dishonour, and this doth not lessen the goodness that gave them. 'Tis unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to judg of the value of a Benefit, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful abuse of the receiver, and not from its own nature. 'Tis a chosen <hi>Misery</hi> that is come upon Man, and not to be imputed to any defect of the Divine Goodness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is infinitely Good notwithstanding the entrance of Sin and Misery into the World. We must distinguish between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>voluntary agents.</hi> Natural agents have no power to suspend their <hi>acts,</hi> but are entirely determin'd, and their <hi>Operations</hi> are <hi>ad extremum virium,</hi> to the utmost of their efficacy. If there were infinite degrees of Heat, there would be no Cold, it being overcome by the force of its contrary. But God is a wise and free
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42565:28"/>
               <hi>Agent,</hi> and as he is Infinite in Goodness; so the exercise of it is <hi>voluntary,</hi> and only so far as he pleases.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God is an <hi>omnipotent</hi> Good, and 'tis his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar glory to bring Good out of Evil, that by the opposition and lustre of <hi>Contraries,</hi> his Goodness might be the more conspicuous. To speak strictly, Sin is the only evil in the world: for all the rest which appear so to our fancies and appetites, are either absolutely good, or upon the supposal of Sin: <hi>viz.</hi> either for the <hi>reformation</hi> of Sinners, or for the <hi>ruine</hi> of the Obstinate. Now the <hi>Evil</hi> of Sin God permitted as a fit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>casion for the more glorious discovery of his <hi>Attributes,</hi> in sending his Son into the world to repair his Image which was defac'd, and to raise Man from an <hi>Earthly</hi> to <hi>Celestial</hi> Happiness. I shall conclude with the excellent Answer of St. <hi>Austin</hi> to the adversary of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: <hi>Quibus autem videter sic hominem fieri debuisse, ut peccare nollet,</hi>

Aut voluisse quidem &amp; minime potuisse? Avertat hoc Deus a Cordibus piorum.</hi> The substance of which is; that 'tis an impious folly to imagine that God was either defective in wisdom, not to know what was the best state for man in his Creation; or defective in goodness, that knowing it, he would not confer it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; or defective in power, that willing, he was unable to make him better.</p>
            <p>There is another Objection vehemently urg'd, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42565:28"/>
the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin to all his posterity who were not existent at that time, and did not give their personal consent to the treaty between God and him, is inconsistent with Justice; To this I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The terms of the first Covenant are such, that the common Reason of Mankind cannot justly refuse. For suppose all the Progeny of <hi>Adam</hi> had appear'd with him before their Creator, and this had been propounded, that God would make an agreement with their common father on their behalf, That if he continued in his Obedience, they should enjoy a happy Immortality; if he declin'd from it, they should be depriv'd of Blessedness. What shadow of exception can be form'd against this proposal? For God who is the Master of his own favours, and gives them upon what terms he pleases, might upon their refusal have justly <hi>annihilated</hi> them. The Command was equal, and his Obedience for all was as easie, as that of every particular person for himself.</p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>Adam</hi> was as much concern'd to observe the Conditions of the Covenant, for securing his own interest, as theirs, and after a short time of trial they should be confirm'd in their Blessedness. By all which 'tis apparent how reasonable the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the <hi>original</hi> Agreement between God and Man are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath a power over our Wills superiour to that we our selves have. If God offers a <hi>Covenant</hi> to the Creature, the terms being equal, it becomes a Law, and consent is due as an <hi>act</hi> of Obedience. And if a <hi>Community</hi> may appoint one of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be their <hi>Representative,</hi> to transact affairs of the greatest moment, and according to his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42565:29"/>
the benefit, or damage, shall accrue to them; may not God who hath a supreme dominion over us, constitute <hi>Adam</hi> the <hi>Representative</hi> of Mankind, and unite the consent of all in his general Will,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Ward</hi> de Peccat. origin.</note> so that as he fulfilled or neglected his Duty, they should be happy or miserable? This Consideration alone, that the <hi>First</hi> Covenant was order'd by God, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly satisfie all enquiries. As <hi>Salvian</hi> having confest his Ignorance of the reasons of some disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence, silences all <hi>Objections</hi> with this; <hi>Nihil in hac re opus est aliqiud audire,</hi>

               <p> The impossibility of <hi>Mans</hi> Recovery, by his <hi>Natural</hi> Power. He cannot regain his <hi>Primitive</hi> Holiness.

            </argument>
            <p>WHen <hi>Adam</hi> was expell'd from <hi>Paradise,</hi> the entrance was guarded by a <hi>flaming Sword,</hi> to signifie, That all hopes of Return by the way of <hi>Nature</hi> are cut off for ever. He lost his Right, and could not recover it by Power. The chiefest ornaments of <hi>Paradise</hi> are the Image and Favour of God, of which he is justly depriv'd: and there is no possibility for him to regain them. What can he expect from his own Reason that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him to ruin? If it did not support him when he stood, how can it raise him when he is fallen? If there were a power in <hi>lapsed</hi> Man to restore himself,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42565:30"/>
it would exceed the <hi>original</hi> Power he had to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>obey:</hi> It being <hi>infinitely</hi> more difficult for a <hi>dead</hi> man to rise, than for a <hi>living</hi> man to put forth <hi>vital</hi> Actions.</p>
            <p>For the clearer opening of this Poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, concerning Mans <hi>absolute</hi> Disability to recover his <hi>Primitive</hi> State, I will <hi>distinctly</hi> consider it, with respect to the Image and Favour of God, upon which his Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness depends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot recover his <hi>Primitive</hi> Holiness. This will appear by considering, that whatsoever is corrupted in its noble parts, can never restore it self; the power of an <hi>external agent</hi> is requisite for the recovering of its Integrity. This is verified by innumerable instances, in things <hi>artificial</hi> and <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> If a <hi>Clock</hi> be disorder'd by a fall, the <hi>Workman</hi> must mend it, before it can be useful. If <hi>Wine</hi> that is rich and generous declines by the loss of spirits, it can never be <hi>revived</hi> without a new supply.

               </hi> form, and more powerful to redress any evil that may happen to the parts, if a <hi>Gangrene</hi> seize on any Member, nothing can resist its course, but the application of outward means; it cannot be cured by the <hi>internal</hi> principles of its constitution. And proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in <hi>moral</hi> Agents, when the Faculties which are the principles of <hi>action</hi> are corrupted, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without the virtue of a Divine cause, they should ever be restor'd to their <hi>original</hi> Rectitude. As the Image of God was at first imprinted on the <hi>Humane</hi> Nature by Creation, so the renewed Image is wrought in him by the same <hi>creating</hi> Power. This will be more evident by considering that inward and deep <hi>depravation</hi> of the Understanding and Will,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.24.</note> the

               <hi>two</hi> Superiour Faculties which command the rest.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Understanding</hi> hath lost the right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of things. As <hi>Sin</hi> began in the darkness of the Mind, so one of its worst <hi>effects</hi> is, the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that Darkness, which can only be dispell'd by a <hi>supernatural</hi> Light.

And by this we may understand how irrecoverable Man is by his own Reason.

            <p n="2">2. The Corruption of the Will is more incurable than that of the Mind. For 'tis full not only of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, but contrariety to what is <hi>spiritually</hi> good. There are some weak <hi>strictures</hi> of Truth in <hi>lapsed</hi> Man, but they dye in the Brain, and are powerless and ineffectual as to the Will, which rushes into the embraces of worldly <hi>Objects.</hi> This the universal Experience of Mankind since the <hi>Fall,</hi> doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prove, and the account of it is in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a strong inclination in Man to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.

The Soul is incarnated, and it shapes a Happiness to it self, in the enjoyment of those things which are delicious to the Senses. The sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of felicity is pursued with equal ardour, as that which is real and <hi>substantial.</hi> The <hi>supreme</hi> part of Man, the Understanding, is employ'd to serve the lower Faculties, Reason is used to make him more ingenious and luxurious in <hi>Sensuality:</hi> So much more <hi>brutish</hi> than the <hi>Brutes</hi> is he become, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that part which is so by its natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the most noble part is made so by unnatural choice and corruption.

            <p>But the Bondage is so pleasing, that corrupted Man prefers it before <hi>spiritual</hi> and real Freedom. Sensual Lusts blind the Understanding, and bind the Will so that he is unable because unwilling to rescue himself.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42565:32"/>
He is deluded with the false appearance of Liberty, and imagines that to live according to Rule, is a slavish Confinement. As if the <hi>Horse</hi> were free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his <hi>Rider</hi> allowes him a full <hi>career</hi> in a pleasant <hi>Road,</hi> when the <hi>bridle</hi> is in his <hi>mouth,</hi> and he is under its imperious check at pleasure. Or a Galley-slave were free, because the Vessel wherein he <hi>rows</hi> with so much toil, roams over the vast <hi>Ocean.</hi> And whereas there are <hi>two</hi> Considerations which are proper to convince Man that the full and unconfin'd enjoyment of Worldly things, cannot make him happy, because they are wounding to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and unsatisfying to the Affections; yet these are ineffectual to take him off from an eager pursuit of them. I will particularly consider this, to shew how unable Man in his <hi>lapsed</hi> condition is to disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle himself from miserable vanities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to recover his lost Holiness.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sensual</hi> Pleasures are wounding to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. There is a secret acknowledgment in every Mans breast of a Superiour Power to whom he must give an account, and though Conscience is much impair'd in its Integrity, yet somtimes it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils upon the Sinner by the foulness of his actions, and its testimony brings such terrour, as makes Sin very unpleasant. The <hi>Poet</hi> tells us, that of all the Torments of Hell, the most cruel and that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the rest is,
<q>Nocte dieque suum gestare in pectore testem.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And how can the Sinner delight freely in that which vexes and frets the most <hi>vital</hi> and tender part. He cannot enjoy his <hi>charming</hi> Lusts without guilt, nor embrace them without the <hi>reluctancy</hi> of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42565:33"/>
Principle within him. As the fear of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will imbitter the sweetest Cup, so the purest Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are allayed with afflicting apprehensions of the <hi>future,</hi> and the <hi>presage</hi> of Judgment to come. Now Man in his <hi>Sensual</hi> state tries all waies to disarm Conscience, that he may please the lower <hi>appetites</hi> without <hi>regret.</hi> I will instance in the principal.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He uses many pleas and pretexts to justifie, or extenuate the evil, and if possible to satisfie <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,</hi> and Conscience too. <hi>Self-love,</hi> which is the eloquent <hi>advocate</hi> of Sence, puts a <hi>varnish</hi> upon Sin, to take off from its horrid appearance; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors not only to colour the object, but to corrupt the Eye by a disguising <hi>tincture,</hi> that the sight of things may not be according to <hi>truth,</hi> but the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</hi> Thus the <hi>Heathens</hi> allowed Intemperance, Uncleanness, and other infamous Vices as innocent gratifications of Nature. Now if the Principles in Man are poisoned, so that <hi>evil</hi> is esteemed <hi>good,</hi> he then lives in the quiet practice of Sin without reflection or remorse. There is no sting remains to awaken him out of Security. But if he cannot so far bribe Conscience as to make it silent, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to that which delights the Sence, if he cannot escape its <hi>internal</hi> condemnation, the next <hi>method</hi> is by a strong diversion to lessen the trouble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the <hi>carnal</hi> Mind sees nothing within but what torments, and finds an intollerable pain in conversing with it self, it runs abroad, and uses all the arts of <hi>oblivion</hi> to lose the remembrance of its true state. As <hi>Cain,</hi> to drown the voice of Conscience, fell a building Cities; and <hi>Saul,</hi> to dispel his <hi>Melancholy,</hi> call'd for <hi>Musick:</hi> The busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and pleasures of this life are dangerous <hi>amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:42565:33"/>
to divert the Soul, by the <hi>representation</hi> of what is profitable or pleasant, from considering the <hi>moral</hi> qualities of good and evil. Thus Conscience, like an intermitting <hi>Pulse,</hi> ceases for a while. Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable consolation! which doth not remove, but conceal the <hi>evil</hi> till it be past remedy. But if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, notwithstanding all these evasions, still pursues a Sinner, and at times something disturbs his reason, and his rest, yet he will not part with <hi>carnal</hi> Pleasures. For being only acquainted with those things that affect the Senses, &amp; having no relish of that Happiness which is <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>supernatural,</hi> if he parts with them he is deprived of all delight, which is to him a state more intollerable than that wherein there is a mixture of delight and torment. From hence it appears that the interposition of Conscience, though with a <hi>flaming sword</hi> between Man <hi>carnal,</hi> and his beloved <hi>objects,</hi> is not effectual to restrain him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All worldly things are unsatisfying to the Affections. There are <hi>three</hi> Considerations which <hi>depreciate</hi> and lessen the value of any good.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The shortness of its <hi>duration.</hi>

            <p>All which are contrary to the <hi>essential</hi> properties of the <hi>supreme</hi> Good, which is perpetual, and sincere without the least mixture of <hi>evil,</hi> and produces the highest delight to the Soul.

<q>Aestuat infelix angusto limite mundi,</q>
            </p>
            <p>That the whole World seem'd to him as a narrow Prison, wherein he was miserable, and as it were suffocated, is true of every one. If the World was seated in the Heart of Man, it can no more satisfie it, than the Picture of a Feast can fill the Stomach. Besides, vexation is added to the vanity of worldly things. And that either because the vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of <hi>Sense</hi> corrupt the <hi>temperament</hi> of the Body in which the <hi>vital</hi> complexion consists, and expose it to those sharp Diseases, that it may be said

without an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> That a <hi>thousand</hi> Pleasures are not equal to <hi>one</hi> Hours pain that attends them: or, because of the inward torture of the Mind, arising from the sence of Guilt and Folly, which is the <hi>anticipation</hi> of Hell it self, the beginning of eternal Sorrows.</p>
            <p>Now these things are not obscure <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> nor <hi>abstracted Doctrines,</hi> to be consider'd only by refined Reason, but are manifest and clear as the Light, and verified by continual Experience: 'Tis therefore strange to amazement, that Man should search after Happiness in these things where he knows 'tis not to be found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and court real <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> under a deceitful appearance, when the <hi>Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is transparent. Who from a <hi>principle</hi> of Reason would choose for his Happiness a real Good, which after a little time he should be depriv'd of for ever: or a slight good for ever; as the sight of a <hi>Picture,</hi> or the hearing of <hi>Musick.</hi> Yet thus unreasonable is Man in his <hi>lapsed</hi> state, whose Soul is truely <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,</hi> and capable of <hi>infinite</hi> Blessedness, yet he chooses those delights which are neither satisfying, nor lasting. And because the <hi>Humane</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing from time to time is convinc'd of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all <hi>sublunary</hi> things, therefore to lessen the vexation which arises from Disappointment, and that the <hi>Appetite</hi> may not be taken off from them, corrupted <hi>Man</hi> tries;</p>
            <p n="1">1. By variety of <hi>objects</hi> to preserve uniformity in Delight. The most pleasing if confin'd to them grow <hi>nauseous</hi> and <hi>insipid,</hi> after the expiring of a few moments there remains nothing but <hi>satiety</hi> and sickly <hi>resentments:</hi> and then changes are the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to take off the weariness of one pleasure by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42565:35"/>
another. The <hi>Humane</hi> Soul is under a perpetual instability of restless desires, it despises what it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes, and values what is <hi>new,</hi> as if <hi>Novelty</hi> and Goodness were the same in all <hi>temporal</hi> things. And as the <hi>Birds</hi> remain in the Air by constant motion, without which they would quickly fall to the Earth as other heavy bodies, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>solid</hi> to support them; so the Spirit of Man, by many unquiet <hi>agitations</hi> and continual changes subsists for a time, till at last it falls into Discontent and Despair, the <hi>center</hi> of corrupt Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When present things are unsatisfactory, he entertains himself with Hope: for that being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated on a <hi>future</hi> Object which is of a doubtful nature, the Mind attends to those <hi>Arguments</hi> which produce a pleasant <hi>belief,</hi> to find that in several <hi>objects</hi>

Upon this ground <hi>Sensual</hi> Pleasure is more in <hi>expectation</hi> than <hi>fruition:</hi> For Hope by a marvellous <hi>enchantment</hi> not only makes that which is <hi>future</hi> present, but representing in one view that which cannot be enjoyed but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of time, it unites all the successive parts in one point, so that what is divided and lessen'd in the fruition, which is alwaies <hi>gradual,</hi> is offer'd at once and entire. Thus Man <hi>carnal</hi> deceived by the imperfect light of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and the false glass of <hi>Hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 3.6.</note> chooses a <hi>fictitious</hi> felicity. <hi>Man walks in a vain shew.</hi> His <hi>original</hi> Errour hath produced this in its own image.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42565:35"/>
discovers the deceit that is in them; as smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to an artificial <hi>Rose,</hi> undeceives the Eye; yet he will embrace his Error. <hi>Man</hi> is in a voluntary Dream, which represents to him the World as his Happiness, and when he is awakened, he dreams again, choosing to be deceiv'd with delight rather than to discover the truth without it. This is set forth by the Prophet, <hi>Thou art wearied in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy way, yet saidst thou not there is no hope:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 57.10.</note> that is, Thou art tired in the chase of satisfaction from one thing to another, yet thou wouldst not give over, but still pursuest those shadows which can never be brought nearer to thee. And the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it is, that in the <hi>humane</hi> Nature there is an <hi>intense</hi> and continual desire of Pleasure, without which Life itself hath no satisfaction. For Life consisting in the <hi>operations</hi> of the Soul, either the <hi>external</hi> of the Senses, or the <hi>internal</hi> of the Mind, 'tis sweetned by those delights which are suitable to them. So that if all pleasant <hi>operations</hi> cease, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out possibility of returning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Death is more desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than Life. And in the corrupt state there is so strict an <hi>alliance</hi> between the Flesh and Spirit, that there is but one <hi>appetite</hi> between them, and that is of the flesh.</p>
            <p>All the Designs and Endeavors of the <hi>carnal</hi> Man are by fit means to obtain satisfaction to his <hi>Senses:</hi> as if the Contentment of the Flesh and the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Soul were the same thing; or as if the Soul were to die with the Body, and with both, all Hopes and Fears, all Joys and Sorrows were at an end. The <hi>Flesh</hi> is now grown <hi>absolute,</hi> and hath acquir'd a perfect Empire, and taken a full possession of all the Faculties. For this reason the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells

               <hi>They that are in the Flesh cannot please God.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>natural Impotence</hi> which protects from the severity of Justice.

They are inculpably without our power. Now the <hi>Law</hi> enjoins nothing but what Man had in his Creation an <hi>original</hi> Power to perform.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>moral Impotence,</hi> which arises from a perverse disposition of the Will, and is join'd with a delight to Sin, and a strong aversion from the holy Commands of God; and the more deep and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this is, the more worthy 'tis of punishment. <hi>Aristotle</hi> asserts,<note place="margin">

The <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> conceives, the <hi>Will</hi> chooses, the <hi>Appetite</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires freely. A distracted Person that kils is not guilty of <hi>Murder,</hi> and therefore secure from the Sentence of the Law. For his <hi>Understanding</hi> being distemper'd by the disorder of the <hi>images</hi> in his Fancy, it doth not judg aright, so that the action is involuntary, and therefore not <hi>culpable.</hi> But there is a vast difference between the causes of <hi>Distraction,</hi> and those which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42565:36"/>
induce a <hi>carnal</hi> Man to sin. The <hi>first</hi> are seated in the distemper of the <hi>Brain,</hi> over which the <hi>Will</hi> hath no Power: whereas there should be a <hi>regular</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the lower <hi>appetite</hi> to the Will enlightned and directed by the Mind. The <hi>Will</hi> it self is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and brought into <hi>captivity</hi> by things pleasing to the lower <hi>Faculties:</hi> It cannot disintangle it self, but its <hi>impotence</hi> lies in its obstinacy. This is the meaning of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> speaking concerning unclean Persons, <hi>That their eyes are full of adultery, and they cannot cease from Sin.</hi> 'Tis from their fault alone that they are without power. Therefore the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> represents Man to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, weak but wicked. His disability to <hi>supernatural</hi> Good, arises from an <hi>inordinate</hi> Affection to that which is <hi>sensual.</hi> So that 'tis so far from excusing, that it renders inexcusable, being voluntary and <hi>vitious.</hi> And in this the Diseases of the Body are different from those of the Soul. In the <hi>first</hi> the desire of <hi>healing</hi> is ineffectual, through want of knowledg or power to apply <hi>Sovereign</hi> Remedies. Whereas in the <hi>second,</hi> the sincere desire of their Cure is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for the Diseases are corrupt desires.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Natural</hi> Man is wholly led by <hi>Sence,</hi> by <hi>Fancy,</hi> and the <hi>Passions,</hi> and he esteems it his <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> to be otherwise; as the degenerous <hi>Slave,</hi> who was displeased with a <hi>Jubile,</hi> and refused Liberty. <hi>Servitude</hi> is his <hi>Sensuality.</hi> He is not only in love with the unworthy <hi>object,</hi> but with the <hi>vitious</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and abhors the cure of it. As one in the <hi>Poet</hi> that was so delighted in his pleasant Madness, that he was offended at his Recovery;
<q>
                  <l>—Cui sic extorta voluptas</l>
                  <l>Et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:42565:37"/>
This is acknowledged by St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> where he describes the <hi>conflict</hi> between <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> in his Soul. He tells us in the strife between Reason and Lust, that he had recourse to God, and his Prayer was, <hi>Da mihi continentiam, sed noli modo,</hi> he desired <hi>Chastity,</hi> but not too soon. This is the general <hi>sence</hi> though not the general <hi>discourse</hi> of men. As the <hi>Sick</hi> Person that desired his <hi>Physician</hi> to remove his <hi>Fever,</hi> but not his <hi>thirst,</hi> which made his drink very pleasing to him: So Man in his <hi>sensual</hi> state would fain be freed from the <hi>aestuations</hi> of Conscience, but he cherishes those <hi>carnal</hi> desires, which give a high tast to <hi>objects</hi> suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them.<note place="margin">Inter caetera Mortalitatis incommoda, hoc est, erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di necessitas, &amp; erroris a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. <hi>Senec.</hi>
               </note> From hence it appears, that although in the corrupt Nature there is no liberty of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to good and evil, yet there is a liberty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in evil; and though the Will in its <hi>natural</hi> capacity may choose <hi>good,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>morally</hi> determin'd by its love to <hi>evil</hi>·</p>
            <p>In short, There is so much power not to sin as is sufficient to sin; that is, that the forbidden action be free, and so become a Sin. Which strange combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Liberty and Necessity is excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by St. <hi>Bernard,</hi>

The Law therefore remains in its full force, and God is righteous in the commanding and condemning Sinners. From all that hath been discours'd 'tis evident, how impossible it is for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>Man</hi> to recover his <hi>lost</hi> Holiness: For there are only <hi>two</hi> Motives to induce the reasonable Creature to seek after it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Its <hi>Beau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <item>2. The <hi>Reward</hi> that attends it. And both these <hi>Arguments</hi> are ineffectual to work upon him.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Beauty of Holiness,</hi> which excels all other created Perfections, it being a <hi>conformity</hi> to the most glorious <hi>Attribute</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> doth not allure him; For, <hi>Unusquisque ut affectus est ita judicat</hi>; Man understands according to his Affections. The renewed Mind can only see the <hi>essential</hi> and intimate Beauty of Holiness.</p>
            <p>Now in <hi>faln</hi> Man the clearness of the discerning power is lost. As the <hi>natural</hi> Eye till 'tis purged from vicious qualities, can't look on things that are bright and <hi>sublime,</hi> and if it hath been long in <hi>darkness,</hi> it suffers by the most pleasing Object the <hi>light:</hi> so the <hi>internal</hi> eye of the Mind, that it may see the lively <hi>lustre</hi> of Holiness, it must be cleansed from the filthiness of <hi>carnal</hi> Affections, and having been so long under thick <hi>darkness</hi> it must be strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, before it can sustain the brightness of things <hi>spiritual.</hi> Till it be prepar'd, it can see nothing <hi>amiable</hi> and desireable in the Image of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Reward of Holiness hath no <hi>attractive</hi> power on the <hi>carnal</hi> Will; because 'tis <hi>Future,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. 'Tis <hi>Future,</hi> and therefore the <hi>conceptions</hi> of it are very dark and imperfect: The Soul is sunk down

into the <hi>Senses,</hi> and they are short-sighted and can't look beyond what is present, to the next life. And as the images of things are weaken'd and confus'd proportionably to their distance, and make a fainter impression upon the Faculty; so the representation of Heaven and Blessedness, as a Happiness to come hereafter, and therefore <hi>remote,</hi> doth but coldly affect the Will. A present <hi>vanity,</hi> in the judgment of the <hi>carnal</hi> Soul, outweighs the most glorious <hi>futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> 'Till there be taken from before its eyes the (in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s language) thick curtain of the visible World,<note place="margin">Quae illi dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positioni aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis, aul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. 'Tis <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and there must be a <hi>divine</hi> Disposition of the Soul, before it is capable of it. <hi>The pure in heart can only see the pure God.</hi> The Felicity above is that which <hi>Eye hath not seen,</hi>

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> Now the <hi>carnal</hi> Man is only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>corporeal</hi> things. The <hi>certainty, immensity,</hi> and <hi>immortality</hi> of the Heavenly Reward, doth not prevail with him to seek after it. He hath no <hi>palate</hi> for <hi>Spiritual</hi> Pleasures, 'tis <hi>vitiated</hi> by luscious Vanities, and can't rellish <hi>rational</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Joys. 'Till the temper of the Soul be altered, the bread of Angels is distastful to it. For the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi> is according to the disposition of the <hi>Stomack,</hi> and when that is corrupted, it longs for things hurtful and rejects wholsome food. If a <hi>carnal</hi> Man were translated to Heaven, where the Love of God reigns, and where the brightest and sweetest discoveries of his Glory appear, he would not find <hi>Paradise</hi> in Heaven it self. For Delight arises not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42565:38"/>
meerly from the excellency of the <hi>object,</hi> but from the proportionableness to the Faculty. Though God is an <hi>infinite</hi> Good in himself, yet if he is not conceiv'd as the <hi>Supreme</hi> Good to Man, he cannot make him happy.</p>
            <p>Suppose some slight Convictions to be in the Mind, that Happiness consists in the enjoyment of God, yet this being offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d upon the terms of quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all <hi>sensual</hi> Lusts, the <hi>carnal</hi> Man esteems the condition impossible and therefore is discourag'd from using any endeavours to obtain it. For to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Hope, 'tis not sufficient to propose a Reward that is real and excellent, but that is attainable. For although Hope hath its tendency to a difficult Good, as its proper <hi>object,</hi> and the difficulty is so far from discouraging, that it quickens the Soul, and draws forth all the <hi>active</hi> Powers, by rendering it greater in our esteem, yet when the difficulty is <hi>excessive</hi> and confines upon <hi>impossibility,</hi> it dejects the Soul and enclines it to <hi>despair:</hi> Thus when the condition of obtaining some <hi>good</hi> is necessary, but insufferable, it takes off from all endeavours in order to it.</p>
            <p>To consider it in a <hi>temporal</hi> Case, will make it more clear. As one that labours under a <hi>Dropsie,</hi> and is vext with an intollerable and insatiable <hi>thirst,</hi> if a <hi>Physician</hi> should assure him of <hi>Cure</hi> upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would abstain from <hi>drinking,</hi> he could not conceive any real hope of being healed, judging it impossible to resist the importunity of his <hi>drought,</hi> he therefore neglects the means, he drinks and dies. Thus the corrupt Heart of Man, that is under a perpetual thirst of <hi>carnal</hi> Pleasures, and is more inflamed by the satisfaction it receives, judges it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42565:39"/>
an <hi>insuperable</hi> condition to part with them for the acquiring of <hi>spiritual</hi> Happiness: And this <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>sottish</hi> Despair causes a <hi>total</hi> neglect of the means. 'Tis thus exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>est by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when God commanded them to return from the evil of their waies in order to their Happiness, and they said, <hi>There is no hope, but we will walk after our own devices,</hi>

The <hi>sum</hi> of all is, That as Man fell from his Obedience, and lost the <hi>Image</hi> of God, by seeking Perfection and Satisfaction, that is, Happiness in the <hi>creature</hi>; so he can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Obedience, and acknowledg God as his <hi>Supreme</hi> Lord, till he chooses him for his Happiness. And this he can never <hi>entirely</hi> do, till he is born again, and hath a <hi>new</hi> principle of Life that may change the complexion of the Soul, and qualifie it for those delights which are <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>spiritual.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:42565:39"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faln Man can never recover the Favour of God; And this is evident upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is not able to make satisfaction to Gods Justice, for the dishonour brought to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is incapable of real Repentance, which might qualifie him for Pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He is unable to satisfie Justice for his offence, either by exact obedience for the future, or by enduring the punishment that is due to Sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Supposing that Man could perform exact Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience after his <hi>Fall,</hi> yet that could not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. 'Tis <hi>essential</hi> to Satisfaction, that the <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> by which 'tis made, be in the power of the person that satisfies. A Servant as a Servant cannot make satisfaction for an injury done to his Lord, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever service he performs was due before the offence, and is not properly a restitution, because 'tis not of his own. Now the compleat Obedience of the Creature is due to God. He is the Lord of all our Actions, and whatever Man doth is but the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>original</hi> Debt. The Law requires a perpetual reverence of the Law-giver, and express Obedience to his Will in all things. So that 'tis impossible that the highest respect to it afterwards, should compensate for the least violation of it.</p>
            <p>Besides, To make Satisfaction for a Fault, 'tis necessary the Offender do some <hi>voluntary</hi> act, that may be as honourable to the person, and as much above what he was before obliged to, as the contempt was dishonourable and below that which was due. Unless God receive that which is as estimable in the nature of Obedience, as the injury he received is in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42565:40"/>
the nature of Contempt, there can be no Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Now there is a greater dishonour brought to God by the commission of <hi>one</hi> Sin, than there is honour by the perfect Obedience of all the Angels: For in their Obedience God is preferr'd by the Creature, before things infinitely beneath him, which is but a small honour, but by <hi>one</hi> Sin he is disvalued in the comparison, which is <hi>infinite</hi> Contempt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Man cannot make satisfaction by Suffering. For the Punishment must be equal to the Offence, which derives its guilt from the dignity of the Person offended, and the indignity of the offender. Now God is the <hi>Universal</hi> King, his Justice is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> which Man hath injur'd, and his Glory, which Man hath obscur'd; and Man is <hi>finite.</hi> And what proportion is there between <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>infinite</hi>? How can a worthless Rebel that is hateful to God expiate the offence of so excellent a Majesty? If he sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice himself, he can never appease the <hi>Divine</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, for what doth he offer but a lump of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Ingratitude? He can make no other Satisfaction but that of the Devils, which continues for ever, and is not compleated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faln Man considered only in his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and miserable state is incapable of real Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is a necessary Condition to qualifie him for Pardon. For whereas <hi>Repentance</hi> includes an ingenuous sorrow for Sin past, and a sincere forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, he is utterly indispos'd for both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot be ingenuously sorrowful for his offence. 'Tis true, when the circumstances are changed, that which was pleasing will cause trouble of Spirit; As when a Malefactor suffers for his Crimes, he reflects upon his Actions with Sorrow.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42565:40"/>
But this hath no <hi>moral</hi> worth in it: For 'tis a forc'd <hi>act,</hi> proceeding from a violent Principle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.10. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>·</note> and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with as great a love to Sin as he had before, and is intirely terminated on himself. But that grief which is divine, and is accompanied with a change in heart and life, respects the stain more than the punishment of Sin: and arises from <hi>Love</hi> to God, who is disobeyed and dishonored by it: Now 'tis not conceivable, that the guilty Creature can love God, whilst he looks on him as an irreconcileable enemy. Distrust of the favour of a person, which is a degree of fear, is attended with coldness of affection, a strong fear, which still intimates an uncertainty in the event, inclines to hatred: But when fear is turn'd into despair, it causeth direct hatred. An instance of this we have in the Devils, who curse the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Blessedness.</hi> If the Evil be past Remedy, the sence of it is attended with <hi>rage</hi> and transports of blasphemy against God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.<note place="margin">Rev. 16.21.</note> A despairing Sinner begins in this life the gnashing of teeth against his Judg, and kindles the fire that shall torment him for ever.</p>
            <p>'Tis for this reason the <hi>Scripture</hi> propounds the Goodness of God, as the most powerful <hi>persuasive to lead men to Repentance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> There can be no kindly <hi>relentings</hi> without <hi>filial</hi> Affection, and that is alwaies temper'd with the expectation of favour. Without hope of Pardon, all other <hi>motives</hi> are ineffectual to melt the heart.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>first</hi> Covenant obliged Man to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Punishment: It required <hi>Innocence,</hi> and did not accept of <hi>Repentance.</hi> The <hi>final</hi> voice of the Law is, <hi>Do,</hi> or <hi>Die.</hi> Guilty Man cannot look on God with comfort under the notion of a Holy Creator,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42565:41"/>
that delights to view his own <hi>resemblance</hi> in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent creature, nor of a compassionate Father that spares an offending Son, but he apprehends him to be an inexorable Judge, who hath Right and Power to revenge the Disobedience. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an find no expedient for his Deliverance, nor conceive how Mercy can save him, without the violation of <hi>Justice,</hi> an <hi>Attribute</hi> as <hi>essential</hi> to the Divine Nature as <hi>Mercy.</hi> And what can induce him to make an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confession of his <hi>fault,</hi> when he expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an irrevocable <hi>Doom:</hi> An instance of this we have in <hi>Adam,</hi> who being under the <hi>conviction</hi> of his Sin, and an <hi>apprehension</hi> that God would be severe, did not sollicite for Mercy, but endeavour'd to <hi>transfer</hi> the guilt on God himself. <hi>The woman thou gavest me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.12.</note> 
               <hi>she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</hi> As if she had been design'd for a snare, and not to be an aid in his innocent state.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A sincere <hi>Resolution</hi> to forsake Sin, is built on the hopes of Mercy. Till the reasonable Creature know that Heaven is open to Repentance, to his <hi>second</hi> and better thoughts, he is irreclaimable.

               <hi>In short,</hi> When the reasonable Creature is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vitious, and knows that God is <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and that He will be <hi>severe</hi> in revenging all Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, he hath no Care nor Desire to <hi>reform</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

            <argument>
               <p> Of the Divine Wisdome in the contrivance of Man<hi>'s Redemption.</hi> Understanding <hi>agents</hi> propound an <hi>End,</hi> and choose <hi>Means</hi> for the obtaining it. The <hi>End</hi> of God is of the highest consequence, his own Glory and <hi>Man</hi>'s Recovery. The difficulty of accomplishing it. The <hi>Means</hi> are proportionable. The <hi>Divine</hi> Wisdome glorified in taking occasion from the <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> to bring Glory to <hi>God,</hi> and to raise <hi>Man</hi> to a more excellent <hi>State.</hi> It appears in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining such a <hi>Mediator,</hi> as was fit to reconcile <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> 'Tis discovered in the designation of the <hi>Second</hi> Person to be our <hi>Saviour.</hi> And making the <hi>Remedy</hi> to have a proportion to the cause of our <hi>Ruine.</hi> 'Tis visible in the manner whereby our <hi>Redemption</hi> is accomplisht. And in the ordaining such contemptible <hi>means</hi> to produce such glorious <hi>effects.</hi> And laying the design of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> so as to provide for the comfort, and promote the holiness of <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>GOD by his infallible <hi>Prescience</hi> (to which all things are eternally present) viewing the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that all <hi>Mankind</hi> lay bleeding in him, out of deep compassion to his Creature, and that the <hi>Devil</hi> might not be <hi>finally</hi> victorious over him, in his Councel decreed the <hi>Recovery</hi> of Man from his languishing and miserable state. The design and the means are most worthy of God, and in both his <hi>Wisdom</hi> appears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42565:42"/>This will be made visible by considering, that all understanding <hi>Agents</hi> first propound an <hi>end,</hi> and then choose the <hi>means</hi> for the obtaining of it. And the more perfect the <hi>Understanding</hi> is, the more excellent is the <hi>end</hi> it designs, and the more fit and convenient are the <hi>means</hi> it makes use of for the acquiring it. Now when God whose <hi>Understanding is infinite,</hi> (and in comparison of whom the most prudent and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised are but as dark shadows) when he determines to work, especially in a most glorious manner, the <hi>end</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> are equally admirable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>end</hi> is of the highest <hi>Consequence.</hi> Were it some low inconsiderable thing, it were unworthy one thought of God for the effecting it. To be curious in the contriving how to accomplish that which is of no importance, exposes to a just impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Folly; But when the most excellent Good is the <hi>end,</hi> and the difficulties which hinder the obtaining of it are <hi>insuperable</hi> to a <hi>finite</hi> understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it then becomes the <hi>only wise God</hi> to discover the Divinity of his Wisdom,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.17.</note> in making a way where he finds none. And such was the <hi>end</hi> of God in the work of our <hi>Redemption.</hi> This was declar'd by the Angels, who were sent Ambassadors <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> to bring tidings of peace to the world,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>They praised God, saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth Peace, good Will towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The supreme <hi>End</hi> is his own Glory, and in order to it, the Salvation of <hi>Man</hi> hath the nature and respect of a <hi>medium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>subordinate</hi> is the Recovery of the world from its <hi>lapsed</hi> and wretched state.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The supreme <hi>End</hi> is the Glory of God. This signifies principally his <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> Glory:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42565:43"/>
and that consists in the Perfections of his Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which can never be fully conceived by the Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but overwhelm by their excellent greatness all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Understandings. But the Glory that results from Gods works is properly intended in the present Argument, and implies,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>manifestation</hi> whereby he is pleased to represent Himself in the exercise of his <hi>Attributes.</hi> As the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature is the <hi>primary</hi> and compleat <hi>Object</hi> of his Love, so he takes delight in those Actions wherein the image and brightness of his own vertues appear.</p>
            <p>Now in all the works of God there is an <hi>evidence</hi> of his <hi>Excellencies.</hi> But as some Stars shine with a different glory, so there are some noble effects, wherein the <hi>Divine</hi> Attributes are so conspicuous, that in <hi>compare</hi> with them, the rest of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s works are but <hi>obscure</hi> expressions of his Greatness. The principal are Creation and Redemption. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 19.1.</note> 
               <hi>and the Firmament his handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work.</hi> And when God surveyed the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> and <hi>saw that all which he had made was good,</hi> He ordain'd a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to signifie the content and satisfaction he had in the discovery of his <hi>eternal</hi> Perfections therein.</p>
            <p>But especially his Glory is most <hi>resplendent</hi> in the Work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> wherein more of the Divine <hi>Attributes</hi> are exercis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis here that <hi>Wisdom, Goodness, Justice, Holiness</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are united in their highest degree and exaltation.

               <note place="margin">Psal. 50.23.</note> An eminent <hi>example</hi> of this is set down in <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. when at the birth of the World, <hi>The Morning Stars sang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the Sons of God shouted for joy.</hi> And at its new Birth,<note place="margin">Psal. 66.2.</note> they descend and make his <hi>praise glorious</hi> in a triumphant Song. It will be the <hi>eternal</hi> exercise of the Saints in Heaven, where they more fully understand the <hi>Mystery</hi> of our Redemption, and consider every circumstance that may adde a lustre to it, to ascribe <hi>Blessing, Honour, Glory and Power to him that sits on the Throne,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>subordinate</hi> End is the restoring of Man: And this is inviolably joyn'd with the other. 'Tis exprest by <hi>Peace on earth, and good will towards men.</hi> Sin had broke that <hi>sacred</hi> Alliance which was between God and Man: and exposed him to his just displeasure. A misery inconceivable. And what is more becoming God, who is the <hi>Father of Mercies,</hi> than to glorifie his dear <hi>Attribute,</hi> and that which in a peculiar manner <hi>characterises</hi> his Nature, by the Salvation of the <hi>miserable?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>God is love.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9.</note> What is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to Him, than by his Almighty Mercy to raise so many Monuments from the dust, wherein his Goodness may live and reign for ever? Now
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42565:44"/>
for the accomplishing of these excellent <hi>Ends,</hi> the <hi>Divine</hi> Wisdom pitcht upon those means which were most fit and congruous, which I shall <hi>distinctly</hi> consider:</p>
            <p>The Misery of <hi>faln</hi> Man consisted in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his nature by Sin, and the Punishment that ensues: And his Happiness is in the restoring him to his <hi>primitive</hi> Holiness, and in Reconciliation to God, and the full <hi>fruition</hi> of him. The way to effect this was beyond the compass of any created Understanding.</p>
            <p>That God, who is rich in Goodness, should be favourable to the Angels, who serve him in perfect Purity, we may easily conceive; for although they do not merit his favour, yet they never provokt his Anger. And 'tis impossible but that he should love the Image of his Holiness wherever it shines.</p>
            <p>Or suppose an innocent <hi>creature</hi> in Misery, the <hi>Divine</hi> Mercy would speedily excite his power to rescue it: For God is <hi>Love</hi> to all his Creatures as such, till some <hi>extrinsecal</hi> cause <hi>intervenes,</hi> which God hates more than he loves the Creature; and that is Sin, which alone stops the effusion of his Goodness, and opens a wide passage for wrath to fall upon the guilty. But how to save the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is undone by its own choice, and is as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as miserable, will <hi>pose</hi> the wisdom of the world. Heaven it self seem'd to be divided. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> enclin'd to save, but <hi>Justice</hi> interpos'd for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. <hi>Mercy</hi> regarded Man with respect to his misery, and the <hi>pleas</hi> of it are, Shall the Almighty build to ruine? Shall the most excellent creature in the lower world perish, the fault not being <hi>solely</hi> his? Shall the enemy triumph for ever, and raise
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42565:44"/>
his <hi>Trophies</hi> from the Works of the most High? Shall the <hi>reasonable</hi> Creature lose the <hi>fruition</hi> of God, and God the <hi>subjection</hi> and <hi>service</hi> of the Creature, and all Mankind be made in vain? <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> consider'd Man as guilty of a transcendent <hi>Crime,</hi> and 'tis its nature to render to every one what is due; now <hi>the wages of Sin is Death,</hi> and <hi>shall not the Judg of all the world do right</hi>? All the the other <hi>Attributes</hi> seem'd to be <hi>attendants</hi> on <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi> The Wisdom of God enforc'd its <hi>Plea,</hi> it being most indecent that Sin which provokes the execution, should procure the <hi>abrogation</hi> of the Law; this would encourage the commission of Sin without fear. The <hi>Majesty</hi> of God was concern'd, for it was not becoming his excellent <hi>Greatness</hi> to treat with defiled <hi>dust,</hi> and to offer Pardon to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Rebel immediately after his Offence, and before he made Supplication to his Judge. The Holiness of God did quicken his Justice to execute the threatning, <hi>For he is of purer eyes than to behold Iniquity.</hi>

God was to overcome Himself before He restored Man. In this <hi>exigence</hi> his <hi>Mercy</hi> excited his <hi>Wisdom</hi> to interpose as an <hi>Arbiter,</hi> which in the Treasures of its <hi>incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> Light, found out an admirable expedient to <hi>save</hi> Man, without prejudice to his other <hi>Perfections:</hi> That was, by constituting a <hi>Mediator</hi> both able and willing, between the guilty <hi>creature</hi> and Himself: That by transferring the punishment on the <hi>Surety,</hi> he might punish Sin, and pardon the <hi>Sinner.</hi> And here, the more severe and rigorous Justice is, the more admirable is the Mercy that saves. In the same stupendious Sacrifice he declared his respect to Justice, and his delight in Mercy. The <hi>two</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal relations of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> are, the one of a <hi>gift</hi> from God to man, the other of an <hi>oblation</hi> for men to God. By the one God satisfies his <hi>infinite</hi> Love to Man, and by the other satisfies his <hi>infinite</hi> Justice for Man. Neither is it unbecoming God to condescend in accepting the returning Sinner, when a <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>infinite</hi> dignity intercedes for favour. The <hi>Divine</hi> Majesty is not lessen'd when <hi>God is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.</hi> Neither is the <hi>Sanctity</hi> of God disparag'd by his <hi>Clemency</hi> to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> for the <hi>Redeemer</hi> is the principle and pattern of Holiness to all that are saved.

            <p n="3">3. Neither was it fit that the <hi>Third</hi> Person should undertake that work. For besides the Sacrifice for <hi>Propitiation,</hi> it was necessary the <hi>Divine</hi> Power should be <hi>exerted</hi> to enlighten the Minds, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Wills of men to receive the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> that the Benefits of his Death might be applied to them.<note place="margin">

By providing compleat <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to offended <hi>Justice.</hi> The guilty convinced Creature is restless, and inquisitive after a way <hi>to escape the wrath to come.</hi> For being under the apprehension that God is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed Judg, 'tis very sensible of the greatness and nearness of the danger, there being nothing between it and eternal Torments, but a thin vail of flesh. Now God hath prepared such a Satisfaction, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the guilt of Sin: that is a <hi>temporary</hi> act, but of infinite evil being committed against an <hi>infinite</hi> object; the Death of Christ was a <hi>temporary</hi> Passion, but of <hi>infinite</hi> value in respect of the subject; the honour of the Law is fully repaired, so that God is justly merciful, and dispenses <hi>Pardon to the glory of his Righteousness. He hath set forth his Son to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteousness, that he might be just,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.25.</note> 
               <hi>and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus.</hi> And what stronger Security can be given, that God is ready to pardon Man, upon his accepting the termes of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> than the giving his Son to be our <hi>Atonement</hi>? If the Stream swell so high as to overflow the Banks, will it stop in a descending Valley? Hath He with so dear an <hi>expence</hi> satisfied his Justice, and will he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Mercy to relenting and returning Sinners?

This Argument is powerful enough to overcome the most obstinate Infidelity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the unspeakable Gift of his Son, he assures our hopes of Heaven, which is a Reward so great and glorious, that our guilty Hearts are apt to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect we shall never enjoy it. We are secure of his Faithfulness, having his <hi>infallible</hi> Promise; and of his Goodness, having such a <hi>Pledg</hi> in our hands. As the <hi>Apostle</hi> argues, <hi>If he hath given us his Son, will he not with him give us all things?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> Will He give us the Tree of Life, and not permit us to eat of the Fruit of it? Is it conceivable that having laid the Foundation of our Happiness in the Death of his Son, an act to which his tender Affection seem'd so <hi>repugnant,</hi> that He will not perform the rest, which He can do by the meer signification of his Will? 'Tis an excellent encouragement St. <hi>Austin</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds from hence; <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He hath performed more than He promised. 'Tis more incredible that the <hi>Eternal</hi> should die, than that a <hi>mortal</hi> Creature should live for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In short,</hi> Since no <hi>mortal</hi> Eye can discover the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Glory, to convince us of the reality of the <hi>invisible</hi> state, and to support our departing Souls in their passage through the dark and terrible Valley, our Saviour rose from the Grave, ascended in our Nature to Heaven, and is the <hi>model</hi> of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: He is at the right Hand of God to dispense Life and Immortality to all that believe on Him. And what can be more comfortable to us, than the assurance of that Blessedness, which as it <hi>eclipses</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:42565:57"/>
all the glory of the World, so it makes Death it self desirable in order to the enjoyment of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Comfort, so the Holiness of Man is most promoted in this way of our Redemption. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we had been recovered upon easier terms, the <hi>evil</hi> of Sin would have been lessen'd in our esteem. We are apt to judg of the danger of a Disease from the difficulty of its Cure. <hi>Hunger</hi> is reputed a small trouble, (although if it be not satisfied 'twill prove deadly) because a small price will procure what may remove it. And the Mercy that saves us, had not appeared so great. He that falls into a <hi>Pit,</hi> and is drawn forth by an easie pull of the Hand, doth not think himself greatly obliged to the person that helpt him, though if he had remained there he must have perish'd. But when the Son of God hath suffered for us, more than ever one Friend suffered for another, or a Father for a Son, or than the strength and patience of an Angel could endure; Who would not be struck with horrour at the thoughts of that Poison which required such a dreadful Cure? And the benefit we receive in so costly a way, is justly magnified by us. Now what is more apt to inflame our love to God, than the admirable expression of his Love to us, in that with the most precious Blood he ransom'd us from Hell? How doth it endear Obedience, that God hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed his Son, to keep us from acts of hostility. So that the Grace of the Gospel is so far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging Sin, that it gives the most deadly wound to it. Especially when the <hi>tenour</hi> of the <hi>new</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is, That the Condemned Creature, in order to receiving Pardon, and the Benefits that are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, must receive the Benefactor with the most
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42565:58"/>
intire consent for his Prince and Saviour. The Law of Faith requires us to submit to his Scepter, as well as to depend upon his Sacrifice. The Gospel is a conditional <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Oblivion,</hi> that none may venture to sin upon confidence of Pardon.</p>
            <p>And since the occasion of the <hi>Fall</hi> was from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that Man could better his estate by complying with the Tempter, and obtain a more desirable Happiness in the Creature, than in the Favour of God: his Recovery is by revealing to him wherein true Blessedness consists; and giving him an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he may obtain it. For Man will never subject himself to God as his Highest Lord, till he looks on him as his last End, and Soveraign Good. Now the Gospel offers to us the most effectual means, to convince Man of the folly of his choice, in making the Creature his Happiness. For the Son of God who was Heir of all things when He came into the world, was in the perpetual exercise of Self-denial. He lived a despised Life, and died an ignominious Death, to discover to us, That as the miseries of this Life can't make us miserable, so the good things of it can't make us happy. Besides, how is it possible that the wretched enjoyment of this World, should be the Blessedness for which He spent his Sweat, his Tears, his Blood. The rich price he laid down doth most powerfully convince us, That our Felicity is infinitely more valuable than all earthly things, and can be no less than the fruition of God himself. Thus the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath so ordered the way of our Salvation, that as Mercy and Justice in God, so Holiness and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort may be perfectly united in the reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

            <p n="1">1. WHat a <hi>Superlative</hi> degree of Praise and Thankfulness is due to God, for revealing his eternal and compassionate Counsel in order to our Salvation. The Fall of Man was so wounding and deadly, that only an <hi>Infinite</hi> Understanding could find out the means for his Recovery. And if that Mercy which mov'd the Lord to ordain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, had not discover'd it, a thick cloud of Despair had cover'd Mankind, being for ever unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the way of our Redemption.

They are the <hi>Senses</hi> of Discipline, the other <hi>three</hi> or <hi>immerst</hi> in matter,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42565:59"/>
and are incapable to make such clear discoveries. Besides those impressions that are made on the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, we may form some Ideas in the imagination; upon which the mind reflecting may argue and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: Thus far the light and vigour of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding can only go. So that the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that the whole plot of the Gospel was without the compass of our most searching faculties: this will be evident by considering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There was no discovery of it in the Creation: the Voice of the Heavens instruct us concerning the being of God, but not in the secrets of his Will. The oeconomy of Mans Redemption is the merciful design of God, which hath no connection with the existence of the creatures, but depends only upon his good pleasure. 'Tis as impossible to read the Divine Decrees in the Volume of the World, as for the eye to discover a sound, which hath neither Figure, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, nor visible motion. Besides, the Glorious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God in three Persons, which is the foundation of this Mysterious Mercy, is not made known by the visible frame of the Universe. 'Tis true in all Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Works the three Persons are equally concerned: being of one Essence, they are of one Efficacy, and the Essential perfections of the Deity as they concur, so they are evident in the production of all things. The first motive is Goodness, that which orders and directs is Wisdom:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> that which executes is Power. And the several ranks of Creatures, according to their state, reflect an honour on their Author. Things endued with life, declare him to be the fountain of Life, and intellectual creatures represent him to be the Father of Lights. But the personal being as Personal, operating nothing out of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42565:59"/>
there is no resemblance in the World that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses the Distinction, Propriety, and Singularity of the Persons, so as to discover them to the humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Those deeper Mysteries of the Deity are only made known by the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis above the strain and reach of natural Reason to attain to the knowledge of it. There are seminal sparks of the <hi>Law in the heart of Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note> some common principles of Piety, Justice, and Charity, without which the World would soon disband, and fall into confusion; but there is not the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption or conjecture of the contrivance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. Though misery sharpens the mind, and makes it more ingenious to find out wayes of Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet here Reason was utterly at a loss. How could it ever enter into the thoughts of the <hi>Israelites</hi> that by erecting a Brazen Serpent on a Pole, and looking towards it, the wounds made by the Fiery Serpents should be healed. And how could guilty Man find out a way to satisfie Infinite Justice by the Sufferings of a Mediator, and to heal the wounded spirit by believing on him. The most inquiring Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, could never have thought of the Wonders of the Incarnation, that a <hi>Virgin</hi> should conceive, and a God be born, nor of the Death of the Prince of Life, and the Resurrection, and Ascension of the Lord of Glory. We may see how impossible it is for the natural understanding to discover the mystery of Redemption, when those that had the highest repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for wisdom were ignorant of the Creation. The Philosophers were divided in nothing more,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Facilius inter Horologia quam inter Philosophos conveniet,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec.</note> then in their account of the Worlds Original. Some imagin'd it to proceed from Water, others from Fire; some from Order, others from Confusion; some to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42565:60"/>
be from Eternity, others in Time. If the Souls eye be so weakned as not to see that Eternal Power, which is so apparent in its effects, much less could it pierce into the Will, and free determinations of God, of which there is not the least intimation or shadow in the things that are made. This Wisdom comes from above and <hi>was hidden from Ages,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 16.25. Ephes. 3.4.</note> 
               <hi>and Generations.</hi> 'Tis called the <hi>Mystery of Christ</hi>; he is the Object, and Revealer of it.

               <note place="margin">Ephes. 1.9.</note> an inviolable Secret till he was pleased to make it known. Were the humane understanding as clear as 'tis corrupt, yet it cannot by the strength of discourse arrive to the knowledge of it. Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation was necessary to discover it to the Angels. The thoughts of Men are a secret, into which the Creator alone hath right to enter, it being his prerogative to search the heart.<note place="margin">2 Chr. 6.30.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Angels conjecture only, from the dispositions of Men, from outward circumstances, from the Images in the Fancy, and from material impressions on the Blood and Spirits, what are the thoughts of the Heart: and much less can they discover the Counsel of God himself.<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.10.</note> The Apostle tells us <hi>to Principalities and Powers in heavenly places, by the Church the manifold Wisdom of God is made known</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By the first coming of Christ, and the conversion of the World, the depths of the Divine Wisdom were opened, and there remains much undiscover'd, which his second coming shall gloriously make known. Before the first they understood not the foundation, til the second not the perfection of our recovery. Briefly,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.10.</note> the <hi>Spirit that searches the mysterious Counsels of God,</hi> is the alone Intelligencer of Heaven, that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42565:60"/>
reveals them to the world. And the more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us with sincere and humble Thankfulness to acknowledg this invaluable Mercy, it will be useful to reflect on the state of the Heathen world, who are intirely ignorant of this Mystery.</p>
            <p>The Apostle describes the case of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in such terms as argue it to be extreamly dangerous, if not desperate. <hi>Their understandings were darkened, being alienated from the life of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.12.</note> 
               <hi>through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in them. They were without Christ, aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel, strangers from the Covenant of the Promise, without hope.</hi> They had no sense of their misery, no expectation, nor desire of Mercy. Not only the barbarous and savage, but the polisht and civiliz'd Nations are called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, being without the knowledg of the true God, and of a Saviour. <hi>Philosophy</hi> never made one Believer. And as the want of a Sovereign Remedy exposes a man that hath a <hi>mortal</hi> Disease to certain ruin; so the <hi>single</hi> Ignorance of the Gospel leaves men in a state of Perdition. 'Tis true, where the Faculties are not capable, or the Object is not revealed, God doth not impute the want of Knowledg as a crime. But Salvation is obtain'd only by the Covenant of Grace, which is founded in the Satisfaction of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.<note place="margin">Isa. 53.11.</note> And 'tis by <hi>the knowledg of him that he justifies many</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God would have <hi>all men saved by coming to the knowledg of the Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.4.</note> that is the Doctrine of the Gospel, so called in respect of its excellency, being the most profitable that ever was reveal'd. The Infants of Believers are sav'd by special Priviledg, for the merits of Christ, without any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of him. But others who are come to the use of Reason, and made partakers of Blessedness by the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42565:61"/>
Knowledg of God in Christ. <hi>This is Life eternal, to know thee to be the only true God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 17.3.</note> 
               <hi>and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> quickens some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by its <hi>vital</hi> Influences, which are buried in the caves of the Earth, and never see the Light. But the <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> illuminates all whom he saves. What degree of Knowledg is necessary of the Dignity of his Person, and the Efficacy of his Mediation, I cannot determine; But that the Heathens, who are absolutely strangers to the only means of our recovery, and do not believe on God reconciled in the Son of his Love, should partake of Saving Mercy; I do not see any thing in the Gospel (which is the revelation of God's Will concerning our Salvation) upon which to build a rational Hope. Indeed if any Heathen were seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously penitent, God is so merciful, that He would rather dispatch an Angel from Heaven, saying, <hi>Deliver him from going down into the pit, I have found a ransome,</hi> or by some other extraordinary way instruct him in the necessary knowledg of our Saviour, than suffer him to perish to the prejudice of his Mercy. But Repentance as well as Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is purchased &amp; dispenced alone by our Saviour. And that any received this benefit,<note place="margin">Act. 5.31.</note> who are intirely ignorant of the Benefactor we cannot tell. Now this should raise our esteem of the <hi>discriminating</hi> favour of God to us.</p>
            <p>What a flood of Errors and Miseries cover'd the Earth, when the <hi>Grace of God that brings Salvation first appeared.</hi> The <hi>Deluge</hi> was universal, and so was the Destruction.

the Church of Christ is triumphant over the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless waters.

            <p n="2">2. This incomprehensible Mystery is worthy of our most serious thoughts and study, that we may arrive to a fuller knowledge of it. And to incite us, it will be fit to consider those excellencies, which will render it most desirable. Knowledge is a quality so eminent, that it truly enobles one Spirit above another. As Reason is the singular Ornament of the humane Nature, whereby it excels the Bruits, so in proportion Knowledge, which is the perfection of the Understanding, raises those who are posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of it, above others that want it. The Testimony of <hi>Solomon</hi> confirms this,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.13.</note> 
               <hi>Then I saw that Wisdom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells Folly as far as Light excelleth Darkness.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and quality of the Knowledge, such is the advantage it brings to us. Now the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel excels the most noble Sciences, as well contemplative as practick: it excels the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative in the sublimity of the object, and in the certainty of its Principle.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the sublimity and greatness of the Object: and it is no less then the highest design of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wisdom, the most glorious work of the great God. In the Creation his foot-steps appear, in our Redemption his Image: In the Law his Justice and Holiness, but in the Gospel all his Perfections shine forth in their brightest luster. The bare theory of this inriches the mind, and the contemplation of it affects the Soul, that is conversant about it, with the highest admiration and the most sincere and lasting delight.</p>

               </note>1. It affects the Soul with the highest admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The strongest Spirits cannot comprehend its just greatness: the understanding sinks under the weight of Glory. The Apostle who had seen the light of Heaven, and had such knowledg as never any man before; yet upon considering one part of the Divine Wisdom, breaks forth in astonishment, <hi>Oh the depth of the riches of the Wisdom and Knowledg of God! how unsearchable are his Decrees, and his waies past finding out!</hi> 'Tis fit when we have spent the strength of our minds in the consideration of this excelling object, and are at the end of our subtilty, to supply the defects of our Understandings with Admiration. As the <hi>Psalmist</hi> expresses himself, <hi>Lord, how wonderful are thy thoughts to us-ward!</hi> The Angels adore this glorious Mystery with an humble Reverence.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> The admiration that is caused by it, is a principal delight of the Mind: 'Tis true, the wonder that proceeds from Ignorance (when the cause of some visible effect is not known) is the imperfection and torment of the spirit, but that which ariseth from the knowledg of those things which are most above our conception and our hope, is the highest advancement of our Minds, and brings the greatest satisfaction to the Soul. Now the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of our Redemption, was infinitely above the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light of Reason,<note place="margin">Psa. 126.1.</note> and our expectation. <hi>When the Lord turned the captivity of Sion, they were as in a dream</hi>: The way of accomplishing it was so incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that it seem'd rather the picture of Fancy, than a real Deliverance. And there is far greater reason that the rescuing of us from the Powers of Hell, and the restoring us to Liberty and Glory by Christ, should raise our wonder.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note>The Gospel is called <hi>a marvellous Light,</hi> upon the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42565:64"/>
account of the objects it discovers. But such a perverse judgment is in men, that they neglect those things which deserve the highest admiration, and spend their wonder on meaner things. Art is more admir'd than Nature: a counterfeit Eye of <hi>Christal,</hi> which hath neither sight nor motion, than the living Eye, the Sun of the little world, that directs the whole Man. And the effects of Nature are more admir'd, than the sublime and supernatural works of Grace. Yet these infinitely exceed the other. The World is the work of Gods hand, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is his plot, and the chiefest of all his waies. What a combination of Wonders is there in the great Mystery of Godliness? That He who fills Heaven and Earth should be confin'd to the Virgins Womb; that Life should die, and being dead revive; that Mercy should triumph without any disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Justice: these are Miracles that transcend all that is done in Nature.</p>
            <p>And this appears by the judgment of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who best knows the excellency of his own works. For whereas upon the finishing the first Creation, he ordain'd the <hi>Seventh</hi> Day, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Creatures might more solemnly ascribe to him the Glory of his Attributes, which are visible in the things that are made; he hath upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating our Redemtion, by the rising of Christ from the Dead, made the <hi>First-Day</hi> Sacred for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Praise, there being the clearest illustration of his Perfections in that Blessed Work. God is more pleased in the contemplation of the <hi>new</hi> World, than of the <hi>old.</hi> The latter by its extraordinary Magnificence hath lessen'd the dignity of the former, as the greater Light obscures the less. Therefore the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42565:65"/>
               <hi>Sabbath</hi> is changed into the <hi>Lords</hi>-Day. And what a just reproach is it to Man that he should be inob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant and unaffected with this glorious Mercy, wherein he may alwaies find new cause of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Psal. 92.5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord, how great are thy Works! and thy Thoughts how deep! a brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand this.</hi> The admiring of any other thing in comparison of this Mystery, is the effect of Inconsideration, or Infidelity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It produces the most sincere and lasting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. As the taste is to meat, to allure us to feed for the support of our bodies; that is delight to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to excite the mind to seek after it. But its vast capacity can never be satisfied with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of inferior things. The pleasure is more in the acquisition, than in the possession of it. For the mind is diverted in the search, but having attained to that knowledge which cannot fill the rational appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, 'tis disgusted with the fruits of its travel, and seeks some other object to relieve its langour. From hence it is, that variety is the spring of delight, and pleasure is the product of novelty. We find the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the first taste in learning something new, is alwayes most sensible. The most elegant compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and excellent discourses, which ravisht at the first reading, yet repeated often are nauseous and irksome. The exercise of the mind on an object fully known, is unprofitable, and therefore tedious: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by turning the thoughts on something else, it may acquire new knowledge. But the Apostle tells us that the Mystery of our Redemption contains all the <hi>Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge,</hi> to intimate their excellence,<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> and abundance: the <hi>unsearchable riches of Grace are laid up in it.</hi> There is infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42565:65"/>
and perpetual matter for the inquiry of the most excellent understanding: no created reason is able to reach its height or sound its depths: by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual study, and increase in the knowledge of it, the mind enjoys a persevering pleasure, that far exceeds the short vehemence of sensual delights.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It excels other Sciences in the certainty of its Principle; which is divine Revelation. Humane Sciences are built upon uncertain maximes, which being admitted with precipitation, and not confirm'd by sufficient Experiments, the Mind can never fully acquiesce in them. Those Doctrines which were esteemed in one Age, the vanity of them is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in another. <hi>Modern</hi> Philosophy discards the <hi>Antient.</hi> But the Doctrine of Salvation is the <hi>Word of Truth,</hi> its original is from Heaven, it bears the <hi>characters</hi> and marks of its Divine descent. 'Tis confirmed by the <hi>Demonstration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> 'Tis alwaies the same,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> unchangeable as God the Author, and Christ the Object of it, who is the same <hi>yesterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> And the knowledg which the sincere and enlightned Mind hath of it, is not uncertain opinion, but a clear,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> solid and firm apprehension. 'Tis a <hi>Contemplation of the Glory of God with open face.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> This appears by the <hi>effects</hi> it produces in those that have received the true <hi>tincture</hi> of it in their Souls, they despise all things which <hi>carnal</hi> Men admire, in comparison of this inestimable Treasure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Gospel exceeds all <hi>practic</hi> Sciences in the excellency of its end, and the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the means to obtain it.</p>
            <p>The end of it is, The Supreme Happiness of Man: the restoring of him to the Innocence and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42565:66"/>
Excellency of his <hi>first</hi> state. And the means are appointed by <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom, so that the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable <hi>obstacles</hi> are removed: and these are the Justice of God that condemns the guilty, and that strong and obstinate aversion which is in corrupted man from true Felicity. Here is a Mediator re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> who is <hi>able to save to the uttermost:</hi> who hath quencht the Wrath of God by the Blood of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sacrifice: who hath expiated Sin by the value of his Death, and purifies the Soul by the vertue of his Life, that it may consent to its own Salvation. No less than a <hi>Divine Power</hi> could perform this work. From hence the <hi>superlative</hi> excellency of <hi>Evangelical</hi> Knowledg doth arise: all other Knowledg is unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table without it, and that alone can make us perfectly blessed;<note place="margin">Joh. 17.3.</note> 
               <hi>This is Life eternal, to know thee, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> I will briefly consider how ineffectual all other Knowledge is, whether <hi>Natural, Political,</hi> or <hi>Moral,</hi> to recover us from our Misery.</p>
            <p>The most exact insight into <hi>Natural</hi> things leaves the Mind blind and poor, ignorant of Happiness, and the way to it. <hi>Solomon</hi> who had an extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>Natural</hi> Knowledg, and was able to set a just price upon it, tels us that the <hi>increase of knowledg was attended with proportionable degrees of sorrow.</hi> For the more a man knows,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.</note> the more he discerns the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of that knowledg to supply his defects, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his desires. He was therefore weary of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well as of his Folly. The <hi>Devils</hi> know more than the profoundest <hi>Philosophers,</hi> yet their Knowledge doth not <hi>alleviate</hi> their Torments. 'Tis so far from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting how to escape misery, that it will more expose to it, by enlarging the Faculties, and making them more capable of Torment. 'Tis the observation of St.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42565:66"/>
               <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that when God discovered the Creation of the World to <hi>Moses,</hi> He did not inform him of the greatness of the Heavens, the number of the Stars, their <hi>Aspects</hi> and <hi>Influences</hi>; whether they derive their light from the <hi>Sun,</hi> or have it inherent in their own bodies; from whence <hi>Eclipses</hi> are caused; how the <hi>Rainbow</hi> is painted; how the <hi>Winds</hi> fly in the <hi>Air,</hi> or the causes of the <hi>ebbing</hi> and <hi>flowing</hi> of the <hi>Sea</hi>; but so much as might be a foundation of Faith and Obedience, and left the rest,<note place="margin">Ambros.

            </p>
            <p>And as natural, so political Knowledge in order to the governing of Kingdoms and States, hath no power to confer happiness upon man. It concerns not his main interest, 'tis terminated within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of this short life, and provides not for Death, and Eternity. The Wisdom of the World is folly in a disguise, a specious Ignorance, which although it may secure the temporal state, yet it leaves us naked and exposed to Spiritual enemies which war against the Soul. And all the moral knowledg which is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd up in the Books of the Heathens, is insufficient to restore man to his original integrity and felicity. Reason sees that Man is ignorant, and guilty, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and miserable, that he is transported with vain passions, and tormented with accusations of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but it could not redress these evils. Corrupt Nature is like an imperfect Building that lies in rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish, the imperfection is visible, but not the way how to finish it, for through ignorance of the first design, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one follows his own fancy, whereas when the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42565:67"/>
comes to finish his own project, it appears regular and beautiful. Thus the various directions of Philosophers to recover fallen Man out of his ruines, and to raise him to his first state, were vain. Some glimmerings they had, that the happiness of the reasonable nature consisted in its union with God, but in order to this, they propounded such means as were not only ineffectual, but opposit. Such is the pride and folly of carnal wisdom, that to bring God and Man together, it advances Man, and depresses God. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> ascribed to their Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man those prerogatives whereby he equall'd their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God.<note place="margin">Sapiens cum Diis ex pari vivit. Deorum Socius, non Supplex, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversiam facit Diis de Felicitate. <hi>Senec.</hi>
               </note> They made him the architect of his own vertue and felicity, and to vie with <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself, to be one of his <hi>Peers.</hi> Others reduced the Gods to live like Men, and Men like Beasts, by placing happiness in sensual pleasures. Thus instead of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they fomented the hereditary, and principal Diseases of mankind, Pride, and Concupiscence, which at first caus'd the separation of man from God, and infinitely increas'd the distance between them. For what sins are more contrary to the Majesty and Purity of God than Pride, which robs him of his Excellency; and carnal lust, which turns a man into a beast. Besides, all their inventions to expiate sin, to appease the Deity and make him favorable, to calme the Conscience, were frivolous and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And their most generous principles, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Precepts, were short of that purity and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on werewith moral duties are to be perform'd to God and men. Briefly, they wasted their Candle in vain, in searching for the way to true happiness. But God who created Man for the enjoyment of himself, hath happily accomplisht his eternal Decree, by the work
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42565:67"/>
of our Redemption, wherein his own Glory is most visible. And the Gospel which reveals this to us, humbles whom it justifies, and comforts those that were condemned: it abases more then the Law, but without dispair, and advances more then Nature could, but without presumption. The Mediator takes away the guilt of our old sins, and our inclination to new sins: we are not only pardoned but preferred, made <hi>Heirs of God, joynt-Heirs with Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> For these reasons the Apostle sets so high a value upon the Heavenly Doctrine, that reveals a Saviour to the undone World.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note>

It discovers our misery in its causes and the Almighty Mercy that saves us. Other knowledge inlightens the understanding, without changing the heart, but this inspires us with the love of God, with the hatred of sin, and makes us truly better. In seeking after other knowledge, the mind is perplext by endless inquiries: here 'tis at rest, as the wavering Needle is fixt when turn'd to its beloved Star. Ignorance of other things may be without any real damage to us; for we may be directed by the skilful how to preserve Life and Estate.<note place="margin">Isa. 5.11.</note> But this Knowledge is absolutely necessary to Justifie, Sanctifie, and Save us. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge is useless at the hour of death, then the richest stock of Learning is lost, the vessel being split wherein the treasure was laid; but this Pearl of inestimable price, as 'tis the ornament of our prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so 'tis the support of our adversity: A little

ray of this is infinitely more desirable, then the light of all humane Sciences in their lustre and perfection.</p>
            <p>And what an amazing folly is it, that men who are possest with an earnest passion of knowing, should waste their time and strength in searching after these things, the knowledge of which can't remove those evils which oppress them, and be careless of the saving knowledge of the Gospel. Were there no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to diminish the esteem of earthly knowledge, but the difficulty of its acquisition, that error often sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises those who are searching after truth, this might check our intemperate pursuit of it. Sin hath not only shortned our understandings, but our lives, that we cannot arrive to the perfect discovery of inferior things. But suppose that one by his vast mind should comprehend all created things, from the Centre of the Earth to the Circumference of the Heavens, and were not savingly inlighten'd in the Mystery of our Redemption, with all his knowledge he would be a prey to Satan, and increase the triumphs of Hell.

               </note> and injurious to his Perfections, than to take the frail garment of Flesh, to be torn and trampled on. Their <hi>natural</hi> Knowledg of the Deity enclin'd them to think the <hi>Incarnation</hi> impossible. There is no resemblance of it in the whole compass of Nature. For natural Union supposes the parts incompleat, and capable of Perfection by their joyning together: But that a Being infinitly perfect should assume by personal Union a nature inferiour to it self, the Heathens lookt on it as a Fable forg'd according to the model of the fictions concerning <hi>Danae,</hi> and <hi>Antiope.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Orig. <hi>contra</hi> Cels.</note> And the Doctrine of our Saviours Death on the Cross they rejected as an impiety contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious to God. They judged it inconsistent with the Majesty and Happiness of the Deity, to ascribe to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42565:70"/>
Him that, which is the punishment of the most guilty and miserable. In the account of <hi>carnal</hi> Reason they thought more worthily of God by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that of Him, which is only due to the worst of men. <hi>Celsus,</hi> who with as much Subtilty as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Orig.</hi> contra <hi>Cels.</hi> Lib. 1.</note> urges all that with any appearance could be objected against our Saviour, principally insists on his Poverty and Sufferings, the Meanness and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of his condition in the world. 'Twas fit, saith he, that the Son of God should appear as the <hi>Sun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>·</note> which renders it self conspicuous by its own light: But the Gospel having declared the Word to be the Son of God, relates that he was a man of Sorrows, that had no power to defend himself, and was deserted by his Father and Followers, scourged with Rods, and shamefully executed. He could not reconcile so many things that seem'd utterly <hi>incompatible,</hi> as Sovereignty and Servitude, Innocence and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the lowest of <hi>humane</hi> Miseries, Death, with the highest of <hi>divine</hi> Honours, Adoration. Briefly, Nothing was more contrary to Flesh and Blood, than to believe that person to be the Redeemer of the World, who did not rescue himself from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to expect Immortality from him that was overcome by Death. Now the Causes of this Infidelity are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Darkness of the Mind, which is so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Original <hi>Pravity,</hi> that it cannot behold Heavenly Mysteries in their proper light, so as to acquiesce in the truth of them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he cannot know them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are spiritually discerned.</hi> There is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the Natural Understanding and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42565:71"/>
Supernatural Truths. For although the <hi>rational</hi> Soul is a Spirit, as 'tis distinguisht from <hi>corporeal</hi> Beings, yet till 'tis purged from Errour, and vitious Affections, it can never discover the Divinity of things Spiritual, so as to embrace them with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and delight. As there must be a Spirit of Revelation to unvail the object,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.17.</note> so of Wisdom to enlighten the eye, that it may be prepar'd for the reception of it. As Heaven is only seen by its own Light, So Christ is by his own Spirit. Divine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Faith that discerns them are, of the same original, and of the same quality. The natural Understanding, as the effects declare, is like the Funeral Lamps which by the Antients were put into Sepulchers, to guard the ashes of their dead Friends, which shine so long as they are kept close, a thick moist vapour feeding them, and repairing what was consum'd: but in opening the Sepulchres, and exposing them to the free air, they presently faint and expire. Thus <hi>natural</hi> Reason whilst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in things below, and watching with the dead, that is in the <hi>Phrase</hi> of the Antients, studying the Books of Men who have left the world, it discovers something, although 'tis rather a Twilight than clear; But when 'tis brought from the narrow sphere of things sensible, to contemplate the immensity of things Spiritual and Supernatural, its light declines, and is turn'd into darkness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Pride of the <hi>Humane</hi> Understanding, which disdains to stoop to the height of these myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. 'Tis observable, that those who most excell'd in <hi>Natural</hi> Wisdom, were the greatest despisers of <hi>Evangelical</hi> Truths.<note place="margin">Porphyrius, Julianus, Maximus, Hierocles.</note> The proud Wits of the World chose rather to be Masters of their own, than Scholars

               </note> They made Reason their Supreme Rule, and <hi>Philosophy</hi> their highest Principle, and would not believe what they could not comprehend. They derided <hi>Christians</hi> as captives of a blind Belief, and their Faith as the <hi>effect</hi> of Folly; and rejected Revelation, the only means to conveigh the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Divine Mysteries to them. Therefore the <hi>Apostle,</hi> by way of upbraiding, enquires, <hi>Where is the wise man? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Disputer of this world? God hath made the wisdome of the world foolishness.</hi> As those who are really poor, and would appear rich in the Pomp of their Habits and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, are made poorer by that expence; so those who were destitute of true Wisdom and would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear wise in making Reason the Judg of Divine Revelation, and the last resolution of all things, by that false affectation of Wisdom, they became more foolish: By all their Disputes against the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing absurdities of the Christian Religion, they were brought into a more learned Darkness.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The prejudices which arose from <hi>Sensual</hi> Lusts hindered the Belief of the Gospel. As the <hi>carnal</hi> Understanding rebels against the sublimity of its Doctrine, so the <hi>carnal</hi> Appetite against the purity of its Precepts. And according to the Dispositions of Men from whence they act, such light they desire to direct them in acting. The Gospel is a <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> and those who are under the love of Sin, cherish an affected Ignorance, lest the Light should enflame Conscience, by representing to them the deadly guilt that cleaves to Sin, and thereby make it uneasie. This account our Saviour gives of the Infidelity of the world,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>That men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.</hi> And
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42565:72"/>
that this was the real cause, what ever was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is clear, in that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who opposed Christ, adored those impure Deities, whose infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lusts were acknowledged by them. And with what colour then could they reject our Redeemer because crucified? As if Vice were not more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the Deity, than Sufferings.</p>
            <p>Now though Reason enslav'd by prejudice, and corrupted by Passion, despises the Gospel, yet when 'tis enlightned by Faith, it discovers such a wise <hi>oeconomy</hi> in it, that were it not true, it would tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the most noble created Mind to invent it: 'Tis so much above our most excellent Thoughts, that no <hi>Humane</hi> Understanding would ever attempt to feign it, with confidence of persuading the world into a Belief of it. How is it possible that it should be contriv'd by <hi>natural</hi> Reason, since no man can believe it sincerely when 'tis reveal'd, without a <hi>supernatural</hi> Faith. To confirm our Belief of these great and saving Mysteries, I will shew how just it is, that the Understanding should resign itself to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation which hath made them known. In order to this, we must consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are some Doctrines in the Gospel, the Understanding could not discover, but when they are reveal'd, it hath a clear apprehension of them upon a rational account, and sees the <hi>characters</hi> of Truth visibly stampt on their Forehead. As the Doctrine of Satisfaction to Divine Justice, that Pardon might be dispens'd to repenting Sinners. For our <hi>natural</hi> conception of God includes his infinite Purity and Justice; And when the design of the Gospel is made known, whereby he hath provided abundantly for the honour of those Attributes, so
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42565:72"/>
that He doth the greatest Good without encouraging the least Evil, Reason acquiesces and acknowledges, this I sought, but could not find. Now although the <hi>primary</hi> Obligation to believe such Doctrines ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from Revelation, yet being ratified by Reason, they are embraced with more Clearness by the Mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are some Doctrines, which as Reason by its light could not discover, so when they are made known, it cannot comprehend; but they are by a clear and necessary connexion joyn'd with the other that Reason approves. As the Mystery of the Trinity, and the Incarnation of the Son of God, which are the Foundations of the whole work of our Redemption. The Nature of God is repugnant to <hi>Plurality,</hi> there can be but one <hi>Essence,</hi> and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Satisfaction requires a distinction of Persons: for he that suffers as guilty, must be distinguish'd from the person of the Judg that exacts Satisfaction; and no meer Creature is able by his obedient suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to repair the Honour of God, so that a Divine Person assuming the Nature of Man was alone ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to make that satisfaction, which the Gospel propounds and Reason consents to. Besides, 'tis clear that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> that is, of <hi>three</hi> glorious Relations in the Godhead, and of the Incarnation, are most firmly connected with all the parts of the Christian Religion, left in the Writings of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which as they were confirmed by Miracles, the Divine <hi>Signatures</hi> of their certainty, so they contain such <hi>authentick</hi> marks of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, that right Reason cannot reject them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas there are <hi>three</hi> Principles by which we apprehend things, <hi>Sense, Reason</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:42565:73"/>
these lights have their different objects that must not be confounded. <hi>Sense</hi> is confin'd to things <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Reason</hi> considers things <hi>abstracted</hi> from matter, <hi>Faith</hi> regards the <hi>Mysteries</hi> revealed from Heaven: and these must not transgress their order. <hi>Sense</hi> is an incompetent judg of things about which Reason is only conversant. It can only make a report of those objects, which by their natural <hi>characters</hi> are exposed to it. And <hi>Reason</hi> can only discourse of things within its sphere; <hi>Supernatural</hi> things which derive from Revelation, and are purely the objects of Faith, are not within its territories and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Those <hi>Superlative</hi> Mysteries exceed all our <hi>intellectual</hi> Abilities.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Understanding is a <hi>rational</hi> Faculty, and every act of it is really or in appearance groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Reason. But there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the proving a Doctrine by Reason, and the giving a reason why we believe the truth of it. For instance, we cannot prove the <hi>Trinity</hi> by natural Reason; and the subtilty of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> who affect to give some reason of all things, is here more prejudicial than advantageous to the Truth: For he that pretends to maintain a point by Reason, and is unsuccessful, doth weaken the credit which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Revelation gives. And 'tis considerable, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> in delivering <hi>supernatural</hi> truths, produce God's Authority as their only proof, without using any other way of arguing: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we cannot demonstrate these <hi>Mysteries</hi> by Reason, yet we may give a <hi>rational</hi> account why we believe them.</p>
            <p>Is it not the highest Reason to believe the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that God hath made of Himself, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees?
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42565:73"/>
For he perfectly knows his own Nature and Will; and 'tis impossible He should deceive us: This <hi>Natural</hi> Principle is the Foundation of <hi>Faith.</hi> When God speaks, it becomes Man to hear with Silence and Submission. His naked Word is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as a Demonstration.</p>
            <p>And is it not most reasonable to believe, that the Deity cannot be fully understood by us? The Sun may more easily be included in a spark of Fire, than the infinite Perfections of God be comprehended by a finite Mind. The <hi>Angels</hi> who dwell so near the Fountain of Light,<note place="margin">Isai. 6.2.</note> 
               <hi>cover their faces</hi> in a holy Confusion, not being able to comprehend Him. How much less can Man in this <hi>earthly</hi> state, distant from God, and opprest with a burthen of Flesh. Now from hence it follows;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Ignorance of the manner how Divine <hi>Mysteries</hi> exist, is no sufficient Plea for Infidelity, when the <hi>Scripture</hi> reveals that they are. For Reason that is limited and restrain'd, cannot frame a Conception that is <hi>commensurate</hi> to the <hi>Essence</hi> and Power of God. This will appear more clearly by considering the <hi>Mysterious</hi> Excellencies of the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, the certainty of which we believe, but the manner we cannot understand:<note place="margin">Infinitus, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensus &amp; soli sibi tantus, quantus est notus, nobis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verò ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pectus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustum est, &amp; ideò sic eum dignè aestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, cùm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aestimabilem dicimus, <hi>Min. Fal.</hi>
               </note> As that his <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> are the same, without the least shadow of composition, yet his Wisdom and Power are to our apprehensions distinct, and his Mercy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in some manner opposite. That his <hi>Essence</hi> is intire in all places, yet not terminated in any. That He is above the Heavens, and beneath the Earth, yet hath no relation of high or low, distant or near. That He penetrates all substances, but is mixed with none. That he understands, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42565:74"/>
no <hi>Idea's</hi> within Himself; that He wills, yet hath no motion that carries Him out of Himself; That in Him Time hath no Succession, that which is past is not gone, and that which is future, is not to come. That He loves without Passion, is angry without Disturbance, repents without Change. These Perfections are above the capacity of Reason fully to understand, yet <hi>essential</hi> to the Deity. Here we must exalt Faith, and abase Reason. Thus in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> that <hi>two</hi> such distant Natures should compose <hi>one</hi> Person, without the confusion of Properties, Reason cannot reach unto, but 'tis clearly reveal'd in the Word: Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must obey,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.14.</note> not enquire.</p>
            <p>The Obedience of Faith is, to embrace an <hi>obscure</hi> Truth with a firm <hi>assent,</hi> upon the account of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> testimony. If Reason will not <hi>assent</hi> to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, till it understands the manner of how <hi>Divine</hi> things are, it doth not obey it at all. The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing then sincerely submits, when 'tis enclin'd by those <hi>motives,</hi> which <hi>demonstrate</hi> that such a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is due to the Authority of the Revealer, and to the quality of the Object. To believe only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our narrow conceptions, is to disparage the <hi>Divine</hi> Truth, and debase the <hi>Divine</hi> Power. We can't know what God can do, He is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> though we are not <hi>omniscient</hi>: 'Tis just we should humble our Ignorance to his Wisdome, <hi>And that every lofty imagination, and high thing that exalts it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against the knowledg of God should be cast down,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> 
               <hi>and every thought captivated into the obedience of Christ.</hi> 'Tis our wisdom to receive the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Gospel in their simplicity: for in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to give an exact and curious explication of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42565:74"/>
them, the Understanding as in an Hedg of Thorns, the more it strives, the more 'tis wounded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled. <hi>Gods Ways are as far above ours, and his Thoughts above ours, as Heaven is above the Earth.</hi> To reject what we can't comprehend, is not only to sin against Faith, but against Reason, which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it self <hi>finite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job.</note> and unable <hi>to search out the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We are obliged to believe those <hi>Mysteries</hi> that are plainly delivered in <hi>Scripture,</hi> notwithstanding those seeming Contradictions wherewith they may be charged. In the objects of Sense, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of appearances doth not lessen the certainty of things. The Stars to our sight seem but glittering Sparks, yet they are immense Bodies. And 'tis one thing to be assured of a Truth, another to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all the difficulties that encounter it: A mean Understanding is capable of the first, the second is so difficult, that in clear things the profoundest <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> may not be able to untie all the intricate and knotty Objections which may be urged against them. 'Tis sufficient the Belief of <hi>Supernatural</hi> Mysteries is built on the Veracity and Power of God, this makes them prudently credible. This resolves all doubts, and produces such a stability of spirit as nothing can shake. A sincere Believer is assured, That all opposition against Revealed Truths is <hi>fallacious,</hi> though he cannot discover the <hi>Fallacy.</hi> Now the transcendent Mysteries of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, the <hi>Trinity</hi> of Persons in the Divine Nature, the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of God, are clearly and expresly set down in the Word, and although subtile and obstinate <hi>Opponents</hi> have used many guilty Arts to dispirit and <hi>enervate</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:42565:75"/>
those Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> in putting an inferiour sense upon them, and have rackt them with violence to make them speak according to their prejudices, yet all is in vain, the Evidence of Truth is victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. A <hi>Heathen</hi> who considers not the <hi>Gospel</hi> as a Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> but meerly as a <hi>Doctrine</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Writing, and judges of its sense by <hi>natural</hi> Light, will acknowledg that those things are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in it. And notwithstanding those who usurp a Sovereign Authority to themselves, to judg of Divine Mysteries according to their own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, deny them as meer Contradictions, yet they can never conclude them impossible: For no certain Argument can be alledged against the being of a thing, without a clear knowledg of its nature: Now although we may understand the nature of Man, we do not the Nature of God, the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Persons, and his Power to unite himself to a Nature below Him.</p>
            <p>'Tis true no Article of Faith is really repugnant to Reason, for God is the Author of Natural, as well as of Supernatural Light, and He cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Himself: they are <hi>emanations</hi> from Him, and though different, yet not destructive of each other. But we must distinguish between those things that are above Reason and incomprehensible, and those things that are against Reason and utterly inconceivable: Some things are above Reason in regard of their transcendent excellency, or distance from us; the Divine <hi>Essence,</hi> the Eternal <hi>Decrees,</hi> the <hi>Hypostatical</hi> Union are such high and glorious objects, that it is an impossible enterprise to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them: the <hi>intellectual</hi> Eye is dazled with their overpowring Light. We can have but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42565:75"/>
knowledg of them: And there is no just cause of wonder that <hi>Supernatural</hi> Revelation should speak incomprehensible things of God. For He is a singular and admirable Being, infinitly above the ordinary course of Nature. The <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>Philosophy</hi> are not to be extended to Him. We must adore what we cannot fully understand: But those things are against Reason, and utterly inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that involve a contradiction, and have a <hi>natural</hi> repugnancy to our Understandings, which cannot conceive any thing that is <hi>formally</hi> impossible: And there is no such Doctrine in the <hi>Christian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We must distinguish between Reason corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and right Reason. Since the <hi>Fall,</hi> the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Humane</hi> Understanding is lost, and the light that remains is <hi>eclipsed</hi> by the interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>sensual</hi> lusts. The <hi>carnal</hi> Mind cannot out of Ignorance, and will not from Pride and other malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>habits</hi> receive things <hi>spiritual.</hi> And from hence ariseth many suspicions and doubts, (concerning <hi>supernatural</hi> Verities) the shadows of darkned Reason, and of dying Faith. If any Divine Mystery seems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, 'tis from the corruption of our Reason, not from Reason it self, from its darkness, not its light. And as Reason is obliged to correct the Errors of Sense, when 'tis deceived either by some vicious quality in the <hi>organ,</hi> or by the distance of the <hi>object,</hi> or by the falsness of the <hi>medium,</hi> that corrupts the <hi>image</hi> in conveying of it: So 'tis the office of Faith to reform the judgment of Reason, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from its own weakness, or the height of things Spiritual, 'tis mistaken about them. For this end <hi>supernatural</hi> Revelation was given, not to extinguish
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42565:76"/>
Reason, but to redress it, and enrich it with the discovery of Heavenly things. <hi>Faith</hi> is called Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledg: it doth not quench the vigour of the Faculty wherein 'tis seated, but elevates it, and gives it a spiritual <hi>preception</hi> of those things that are most distant from its commerce. It doth not lead us through a <hi>mist</hi> to the inheritance of the Saints in light. <hi>Faith</hi> is a rational Light: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. It arises from the consideration of those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which convince the Mind, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is a Divine Revelation: <hi>I know,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>whom I have believed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.12</note> And we are commanded <hi>Alwaies to be ready to give an account of the hope that is in us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15.</note> Those that owe their <hi>Christianity</hi> meerly to the Felicity of their Birth, without a sight of that transcendent excellency in our Religion, which evidences that it came from Heaven, do not believe aright. As the Eye that is clouded with a <hi>Suffusion,</hi> so that all things appear <hi>yellow</hi> to it, when it judges things to be <hi>yellow</hi> that are so, its judgment is vitious: Because it proceeds not from the quality of the <hi>object,</hi> but from its own indisposition. So those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Gospel upon a false Principle, because 'tis the <hi>Religion</hi> of their Country, though in its self the word of Truth, yet they are not right Believers. 'Tis not Judgment but Chance that enclines them to embrace it. The <hi>Turks</hi> upon the same reason are zealous <hi>votaries</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as they are <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> makes use of Reason to consider what <hi>Doctrines</hi> are revealed in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce those <hi>Consequences</hi> which have a clear connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>supernatural</hi> Principles. Thus Reason is an excellent instrument to distinguish those things
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42565:76"/>
which are of a Divine <hi>Original,</hi> from what is <hi>spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and counterfeit. For sometimes that is pretended to be a Mystery of <hi>Religion,</hi> which is only the fruit of Fancy, and that is defended by the <hi>sacred</hi> respect of Faith, that Reason ought not to violate, which is but a groundless imagination; so that we remain in an Error, by the <hi>sole</hi> apprehensions of falling into one, as those that die for fear of Death. The <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended for their <hi>searching the Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> 
               <hi>whether the Doctrines they heard</hi> were <hi>consentaneous</hi> to them. But 'tis a necessary Duty that Reason, how stiff soever, should fully comply with God, where it appears reasonable that He hath spoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briefly,</hi> The richest Ornament of the Creature is <hi>Humility,</hi> and the most excellent effect of it is, the sense of the weakness of our Understanding. This is the temper of Soul that prepares it for Faith: partly as it puts us on a serious consideration of those things which are reveal'd to us in the Word: <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi> proceeds from the want of consideration, and nothing hinders that so much as Pride: Partly, as it stops all curious enquiries into those things which are unsearchable: and principally as it entitles to the Promise, God will instruct and give Grace to the humble. The knowledg of Heaven, as well as the Kingdom of Heaven is the inheritance of the poor in spirit. A greater progress is made in the knowledg and belief of these Mysteries by humble Prayer, than by the most anxious study. As at Court, an hour of Favour is worth a years atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Man cannot acquire so much as God can give.</p>
            <p>And as Humility, so Holiness prepares the Soul for the receiving of <hi>Supernatural</hi> Truths. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42565:77"/>
is clarified by the purification of the Heart. 'Tis not the difficulty and obscurity of things reveal'd, that is the real cause of Infidelity, since men believe other things upon far less Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but 'tis the prejudice of the lower Faculties that hinders them. When all Affections to sin are mortified, the Soul is in the best disposition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Divine Revelation. <hi>He that doth the will of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 7.17.</note> 
               <hi>shall know whether the Doctrine of the Gospel came from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spirit of God is the alone Instructer of the Spirit of Man in these Mysteries, so as to produce a <hi>Saving</hi> Belief of them. That Knowledg is more clear and satisfying, that we have by his Teaching, than by our own Learning. The <hi>Rational</hi> Mind may discern the <hi>Literal</hi> Sense of the Propositions in the Gospel, and may yield a naked assent to the truth of them; but without <hi>supernatural</hi> irradiation by the Spirit of Life, there can be no transforming and saving Knowledg and Belief of them. And as the vast expansion of Air that is about us, doth not preserve Life, but that part which we breath in, so 'tis not the compass of our Knowledg and Belief (though it were equal to the whole revealed Will of God) that is <hi>vital</hi> to the Soul, but that which is practised by us. The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.2.</note> 
               <hi>Though he had the understanding of all My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and all Knowledg, and all Faith, yet if it were not joyned with Love,</hi> the Principle of Obedience, <hi>it were unprofitable.</hi> There is the same difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Speculative</hi> Knowledg of these Mysteries, and that which is Affectionate and <hi>Operative,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the wearing of <hi>Pearls</hi> for Ornament, and the taking of them as a <hi>Cordial</hi> to revive the fainting spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:42565:77"/>In short, Such a Belief is required, as prevails upon the Will, and draws the Affections, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>There are severe and sad Truths, which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with fearful expectation, and the Mind is averse from receiving them: As the Law which like Lightning terrifies the Soul with its amazing Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and there are pleasant <hi>illusions</hi> which have no solid Foundation: And as Truth doth not delight the Mind, unless united to Goodness, such as is suitable to its <hi>Palate,</hi> so Goodness doth not affect the Will unless it be real. Now the Doctrine of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is as certain as the <hi>Law,</hi> and infinitly more comfortable than all the Inventions of Men. 'Tis in the knowledg of it alone that the sensible and considering Soul enjoys perfect Satisfaction and the most composed Rest. 'Tis evident that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing doth not behold these Truths in their proper light, when the Will doth not embrace them. For the <hi>rational</hi> Appetite follows the last judgment of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42565:78"/>
the Mind. When the <hi>Apostle</hi> had a powerful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of <hi>The Excellency of the Knowledg of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> this made him so earnest to gain an interest in Him. For this reason, those who are only <hi>Christians</hi> in Title, <hi>Having a form of Godliness and denying the power of it,</hi> are in <hi>Scripture</hi>-language stiled Infidels: It being impossible that those who truly and heartily believe this great <hi>Mystery</hi> of Godliness, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ungodly. 'Tis a strong and effectual <hi>Assent</hi> that descends from the Brain to the Heart and Life, that denominates us true Believers: So that when the Death of Christ is propounded as the cause of our Reconciliation with God, the wonder of the <hi>Mystery</hi> doth not make it incredible: when as the reason of the Morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>To conclude, The Doctrine of the Gospel clearly discovers its <hi>Divine</hi> Original: 'Tis so reasonable in itself, and profitable to us, so sublime and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above Man, yet hath such an admirable agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Natural</hi> Truths, 'tis so perfectly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responding in all its parts; that without affected Obstinacy no man can reject it.

            <argument>
               <p> The Mercy of God is represented with peculiar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages above the other Attributes. 'Tis eminently glorified in our Redemption in respect of its freeness and greatness. The freeness of it amplified from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the original and object of it. God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy in Himself, and needs not the Creature to preserve or heighten his felicity. The glorious reward conferred upon our Saviour doth not prejudice the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his love to Man. There was no tie upon God to save Man. The Object of Mercy is Man in his lapsed state. 'Tis illustrated by the consideration of what he is in himself. No motives of love are in him. He is a rebel impotent and obstinate. The freeness of mercy set forth by comparing him with the fallen Angels who are left in perfect irremediable misery. Their first state, fall, and punishment. The Reasons why the Wisdom of God made no provision for their recovery.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ALthough all the Divine Attributes are equal as they are in God, (for one Infinite cannot exceed another) yet in their exercise and effects, they shine with a different glory. And Mercy is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in Scripture with peculiar advantages above the rest. 'Tis God's natural off-spring, he is stiled <hi>the Father of Mercies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.3.</note> 'Tis his dear Attribute, that which he places next to himself, He is proclaim'd the <hi>Lord God Gracious and Merciful.</hi>

               <hi>Mercy rejoyces over Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Now in the performance of our Redemption, Mercy is the predominant Attribute, that sets all the rest a working. The acts of his Wisdom, Justice, and Power were in order to the illustration of his Mercy. And if we duly consider that Glorious Work, we shall find in it all the ingredients of the most sovereign Mercy. In discoursing of it, I shall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally consider two things wherein this Attribute is eminently glorified, the Freeness, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it. The Freeness of this Mercy will appear by considering the original, and object of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Original is God: and the notion of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty includes infinite perfections, so that it neeessarily follows that he hath no need of the creatures service to preserve or heighten his feli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>If thou be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</hi> From Eternity he was without external honour, yet in that infinite duration he was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyful and happy. He is the fountain of his own blessedness, the Theatre of his own Glory, the Glass of his own Beauty. One drop encreases the Ocean, but to God a million of Worlds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>an add nothing. Every thing hath so much of Goodness as it derives from him. As there was no gain to him by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so there can be no loss by the annihilation of all things. The World proceeded from his Wisdom as the <hi>Idea</hi> and Exemplar, and from his Power as the <hi>efficient</hi> cause; and it so proceeds from him, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main more perfectly in him. And as the possession of all things, and the obedience of Angels and Men is of no advantage to God, so the opposition of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Rebels cannot lessen his Blessedness. <hi>If thou sinnest, what do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es its day: if intelligent Beings do not esteem him for his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and love him for his Goodness, 'tis no injury to him, but their own infelicity. Were it for his interest, he could by one act of Power conquer the obstinacy of his fiercest Enemies. If he require subjection from his creatures, 'tis not that he may be happy but liberal, that his Goodness may take its rise to reward them. Now this is the special commendation of Divine Love, it doth not arise out of <hi>indigency</hi> as Created Love, but out of fulness and <hi>redundancy.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells us there is <hi>none good but God</hi>: not only in respect of the perfection of that Attribute,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.17.</note> as it is in God in a transcendent manner, but as to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his goodness, which are meerly for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the receiver. <hi>He is only rich in Mercy,</hi> to whom nothing is wanting, or profitable. The most liberal Monarch doth not always give, for he stands in need of his Subjects. And where there is an expectation of Service for the support of the giver, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tis trafique and no gift. Humane affection is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and nourisht by something without, but the Love of God is from within: the misery of the Creature is the occasion, but the reason of it is from himself. And how free was that Love, that caus'd the infinitely blessed God to do so much for our recovery, as if his felicity were imperfect without ours!</p>
            <p>It doth not prejudice the freeness of redeeming Mercy, that Christ's personal Glory was the reward of his Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis true, that our Redeemer for the <hi>Joy that was set before him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> 
               <hi>endured the Cross, despising the shame,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42565:80"/>
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God</hi>: but he was not first drawn to the undertaking of that hard service by the interest of the reward. For if we consider him in his Divine Nature, he was the second Person in the Trinity, equal to the first, he possest all the Supreme Excellencies of the Deity, and by assuming our Nature the only gain he purchas'd to himself, was to be capable of loss for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing our Salvation. Such was the <hi>Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.9.</note> 
               <hi>yet for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich.</hi> And although his humane Soul was encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Glorious recompence the Father promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to make him King and Judge of the World; yet his Love to Man was not kindled from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, neither is it lessened by his obtaining of it. For immediately upon the union of the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Eternal Son, the Highest Honour was due to him. When the first-begotten was brought into the World, 'twas said, <hi>Let all the Angels of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.6.</note> The Sovereign Power in Heaven and Earth was his inheritance, annext to the dignity of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture: <hi>the Name above every name</hi> was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment due to his Person. He voluntarily renounc'd his right for a time, and appear'd in the <hi>form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> upon our account, that by humbling himself he might accomplish our Salvation. He entred into Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after a course of Sufferings, because the Oeconomy of our Redemption so requir'd, but his original title to it was by the personal union. To illustrate this by a lower instance: the Mother of <hi>Moses</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was call'd to be his Nurse by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a reward, as if she had no relation to him: Now the pure love of a Mother, not the gain of a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42565:81"/>
Nurse, was the motive that inclin'd her to nourish him with her Milk.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim per na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam bonus non propter praemii cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatem; ideo passus est quia benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere eum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectavit, non quia incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae ex sua passione quae rebat.</hi> Ambros.</note> Thus the Love of Christ was the primary active cause that made him liberal to us of his Blood: neither did the just expectation of the reward take off from it.</p>
            <p>The Sum is: the essence of Love consists in desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the good of another without respect to our selves; and Love is so much the more free, as the benefit we give to another, is less profitable, or more damageable to us. Now among Men 'tis impossible that to a vertuous benefactour there should not redound a double Benefit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Eternal Reward which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the Internal Beauty of an honest action, which the Philosopher affirms, doth exceed any loss that can befal us. For if one dyes for his Friend, yet he loves himself most, for he would not chuse to be less vertuous than his Friend, and by dying for him he excels him in Vertue, which is more valuable than Life it self. But to the Son of God no such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage could accrue; for being infinitely holy and happy in his Essence, there can be no addition to his Felicity or Vertues by any external emanation from him. His Love was for our profit, not his own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The freeness of Gods Mercy is evident by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering there was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ye upon him to dispence it. Grace strictly taken differs from Love: for that may be a Debt, and without injustice not denied. There are inviolable obligations on Children to Love their Parents; and duty lessens desert: the performance of it doth not so much deserve praise, as the neglect merits censure and reproof. But the Love of God to Man is a pure, free, and liberal Affection, no way

due. <hi>The Grace of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.15.</note> 
               <hi>and the gift by Grace hath abounded unto many.</hi> The Creation was an effusion of goodness, much more Redemption. <hi>Thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 4.11.</note> 
               <hi>for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.</hi> 'Tis Grace that gave being to the Angels, with all the prerogatives that adorn their Natures: 'tis Grace confirm'd them in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal integrity. For God ows them nothing, and they are nothing to him. 'Twas Grace that plac't <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, and made him as a visible God in the lower World. And if Grace alone dispensed benefits to innocent Creatures, much more to those who are obnoxious to justice: the first was free, but this is merciful. And this leads to the second consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which exalts redeeming Love.</p>
            <p>The object of it is Man in his lapsed state. In this respect it excels the goodness that prevented him at the beginning. In the Creation as there was no object to invite, so nothing repugnant to mans being and happiness: the dust of the Earth did not merit such an excellent condition as it received from the pure bounty of God, but there was no moral unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Grace of the Gospel hath a different object, the wretched and unworthy, and it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces different operations, 'tis healing and medicinal, ransoming and delivering, and hath a peculiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter among the Divine Attributes. 'Tis goodness that crowns the Angels, but 'tis Mercy, the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of the guilty, and refuge of the miserable, that saves Man. The Scripture hath consecrated the name of <hi>Grace</hi> in a special manner, to signifie the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and admirable favour of God in recovering us from our justly deserv'd misery.

               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42565:82"/>
but did not find us so. Redemption is a free Favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not excited by the worth of him that receives it, but the grace of him that dispenses it;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>Herein God commended his Love to us, that while we were Sinners Christ died for us.</hi> Our goodness was not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his Love, but his Love the original of our goodness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a fixed Contrariety in the corrupted nature of Man to the Holy Nature and Will of God; For which he is not only unworthy of his Love, but worthy of his wrath. We are opposite to Him in our Minds, Affections and Actions: A strong <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy</hi> is seated in all our Faculties.

            <p>It will further appear that our Salvation comes

from pure favour, if we consider Man not only as a rebellious enemy to God, but impotent and obstinate, without power to resist Justice, and without affection to desire Mercy. Sometimes the interest of a Prince may induce him to spare the guilty, he may be compell'd to pardon, whom he cannot punish. The multitude is the greatest Potentate. <hi>The Sons of</hi> Zerviah <hi>were too strong for David:</hi> and then 'tis not pity, but policy to suspend the judgment. But our condition is described by the Apostle, <hi>that when we were sinners,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.6.</note> 
               <hi>and without strength, then Christ dyed for us.</hi> Man is a despicable Creature, so weak that he trembles at the appearance of a worm, and yet so wicked that he lifts up his head against Heaven. How unable is he to encounter with offended Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? How easily can God destroy him, when by his sole Word he made him? if he unclasps his hand that suports all things, they will presently relasp into their first confusion. The whole world of sinners was <hi>shut up,</hi> utterly unable to repel or avoid his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: And what amazing Love is it to spare Rebels that were under his feet? <hi>When a man finds his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>

               <hi>will he let him go well away?</hi> but God when we were all at his Mercy spar'd and sav'd us.</p>
            <p>Besides, Rebels sometimes sollicit the favour of their Prince by their Acknowledgments, their Tears and Supplications, the testimonies of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but Man persisted in his fierce enmity, and had the weapons of defiance in his hands against his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; he trampled on his Laws and despised his Deity, yet then the Lord of Host became the God of peace. In short, there was nothing to call forth the Divine Compassion but our misery: The Breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan on Man's part, but Reconciliation on God's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>God in creating the World, formed two natures capable of his Image and Favour, to glorifie and enjoy him, Angels, and Men; and plac'd them in the principal parts of the universe, Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>The Angels were the eldest Off-spring of his Love, the purest productions of that supreme Light: Man in his best state was inferiour to them.

The Prince of darkness was blinded with the lustre of his own excellencies, and attempted upon the <hi>Regalia</hi> of Heaven, affecting an independent state.

their torment: for when the Understanding by a strong and <hi>active</hi> apprehension, hath a terrible and unbounded prospect of the continuance of their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, that what is intolerable must be Eternal, this inexpressibly exasperates their Misery: There wants a word beyond Death to set it forth. This is the condition of the sinning Angels, and God might have dealt in as strict Justice with rebellious Man. 'Tis true there are many Reasons may be assigned why the Wisdom of God made no provision for their Recovery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was most decent that the <hi>first</hi> Breach of the Divine Law should be punisht, to secure Obedience for the <hi>future.</hi> Prudent Lawgivers are severe against the <hi>first</hi> Transgressors, the Leaders in Disobedience: He that <hi>first</hi> presumed to break the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> was by God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. The Malignity of their Sin was in the highest degree: For such was the clearness of the <hi>Angelical</hi> Understanding, that there was nothing of Ignorance and Deceit to lessen the voluntariness of their Sin; 'twas no mistake, but Malice: They fell in the light of Heaven, and rendered themselves incapable of Mercy. As under the Law, those who sinned <hi>with a high hand</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.7.</note> not out of Ignorance or Imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity to please their Passions, but knowingly and proudly despised the Command,<note place="margin">Num. 15.30 Heb. 10.26, 27, 28, 29.</note> their Presupmtion was <hi>inexpiable,</hi> no Sacrifice was appointed for it. And the Gospel, though the Declaration of Mercy, yet excepts those who sin the great Transgression against the Holy Ghost. Now of such a nature

was the Sin of the Rebellious <hi>Angels,</hi> it being a contemptuous violation of Gods Majesty,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unpardonable. Besides, they are wholly <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Beings, without any <hi>allay</hi> of flesh, and so fell to the utmost in evil, there being nothing to suspend the intireness of their Will: whereas the <hi>Humane</hi> Spirit is more slow by its <hi>union</hi> with the Body. And that which extremely aggravates their sin is, that it was committed in the state of perfect Happiness. They despised the full <hi>fruition</hi> of God: 'twas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>congruous</hi> to the <hi>Divine</hi> Wisdom, that their <hi>final</hi> Sentence should depend upon their <hi>first</hi> Election: whereas Mans Rebellion, though inconceivably great, was against a lower Light and less Grace dispensed to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They finn'd without a Tempter, and were not in the same capacity with Man to be restor'd by a Saviour. The Devil is an <hi>original</hi> Proprietor in Sin,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.44.</note> 'tis of <hi>his own</hi>; Man was beguiled by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents subtilty: as he fell by anothers Malice, so he is recovered by anothers Merit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Angelical</hi> Nature was not entirely lost, <hi>Myriads</hi> of blessed Spirits still continue in the place of their Innocency and Glory, and for ever ascribe to the Great Creator that <hi>incommunicable</hi> Honour, which is due to Him,<note place="margin">Psal. 103.</note> and perfectly do <hi>his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But all Mankind was lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> and no <hi>Religion</hi> was left in the lower world.</p>
            <p>Now although in these and other respects it was most consistent with the Wisdom and Justice of God, to conclude them under an irrevocable Doom, yet the principal cause that enclin'd him to save Man, was meer and perfect Grace. The Law mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no distinction, but awarded the same Punishment:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42565:85"/>
Mercy alone made the difference: and the reason of that is in Himself. Millions of them fell Sacrifices to Justice, and guilty Man was spared. 'Tis not for the excellency of our Natures, for Man in his Creation was lower than the Angels; nor upon the account of Service, for they having more eminent Endowments of Wisdom and Power might have brought greater honour to God; nor for our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, for though not equally, yet we had highly offended Him: But it must be resolved <hi>into that Love which passeth Knowledg.</hi> 'Twas the unaccountable Pleasure of God that <hi>preferr'd babes before the wise and prudent:</hi> and herein Grace is most glorious.<note place="margin">Ephes.</note>

            <p n="1">1. If we reflect upon the horrour of our natural state, it will exceedingly heighten the mercy that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us. This I have in part opened before, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will be the shorter in describing it. Man by his rebellion had forfeited Gods favour, and the honour and happiness he injoyed in Paradise. And as there is no middle state between Sovereignty and misery, he that falls from the Throne stops not till he comes to the bottom; so when Man fell from God and the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his innocent state, he became extreamly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable. He is under the servitude of sin, the tyranny
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42565:87"/>
of Satan, the bondage of the Law, and the empire of Death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Man is a captive to sin. He is fallen from the hand of his counsel, under the power of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Love, Hatred, Ambition, Envy, Fear, Sorrow, and all the other stinging Affections, (of which is true what the Historian speaks of the several kinds of Serpents in <hi>Africa, Quantus nomiuum tantus mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium numerus)</hi> exercise a tyranny over him. <hi>And if no man can serve two Masters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6.24.</note> as the Oracle of Truth tells us, how wretched is the slavery of Man, whose passions are so opposit, that in obeying one, he cannot escape the lash of many imperious Masters. He is possest with a Legion of impure lusts. And as the Demoniac in the Gospel was sometimes cast into the fire, and sometimes into the water; so is he hurried by the fury of contrary passions. This ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude to sin is in all respects compleat. For those who serve are either born servants, or bought with a price, or made captives by force: and sin hath all these kinds of title to man.<note place="margin">Psal. 51. Rom. 7. Isa. 28.15.</note> 
               <hi>He is conceived and born in sin: he is sold under sin: and sells himself to do evil.</hi> As that which is sold passes into the possession of the buyer,—so the sinner exchanging himself for the pleasures of sin, is under its power. Original sin took possession of our nature, and actual of our lives. He is the servant of corruption by yeilding to it: <hi>for of whom a man is overcome, of the same he is brought in bondage.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Man since his fall is under the tyranny of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who is call'd the <hi>God of this World,</hi> and is more absolute then all temporal Princes, his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being over the will. He overcame <hi>man</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and by the right of War he rules over him. The soul is kept in his bondage by subtile Chains, of which the spiritual nature is capable.

Never did cruel Pirat so incompassionately urge his Slaves to ply their Oares in charging, or flying from an enemy, as Satan incites those who are his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives <hi>to do his will.</hi>

His condition in this world is so wretched and unworthy the original excellency of his Nature, that it deserves not the name of Life: 'Tis a continual exercise of sinful Actions dishonourable to God, and damning to himself, and after the succession of a few Years in the defilements of Sin, and the accidents of this frail state, in doing and suffering evil, Man comes to his <hi>fatal</hi> Period, and falls into the bottomless Pit, the place of Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and Horrors, of Sin and Torments. 'Tis there <hi>That the wrath of God abides on him;</hi>

               <hi>and who knows the power of his wrath? According to his fear so is his wrath.</hi> Fear is an unbounded Passion, and can extend it self to the apprehension of such Torments, which no <hi>finite</hi> Power can inflict: But the Wrath of God exceeds the most jealous fears of the guilty Conscience. It proceeds from <hi>infinite</hi> Justice, and is executed by Almighty Power, and contains emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently all kinds of evils. A Lake of flaming Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and whatever is most dreadful to <hi>Sense,</hi> is but an imperfect <hi>Allusion</hi> to represent it.</p>
            <p>And how great is that Love which pitied &amp; rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from Sin and Hell? This Saving Mercy is set out for its tenderness and vehemence by the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of the bowels,</hi> at the sight of one in misery:<note place="margin">Luke 1.78.</note> especially the working of the Mother's, when any evil befals her Children: Such an inward deep <hi>resentment</hi> of our distress was in the Father of Mercies. <hi>When we were in our blood, He said to us, Live.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek.</note> And that which further discovers the eminent degree of his Love is, that He might have been unconcerned with our Distress, and left us under despair of Deliverance.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42565:89"/>
There is a Compassion which ariseth from Self-love, when the sight of anothers Misery surprises us, and affects us in such a manner as to disturb our Repose, and imbitter our Joy, by considering our liableness to the same troubles, and from hence we are enclin'd to help them. And there is a Compassion that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from pure love to the miserable, when the Person that expresses it, is above all the assaults of evil, and incapable of all Affections that might lessen his Felicity, and yet applies himself to relieve the afflicted; and such was Gods towards Man.</p>
            <p>If it had been a tollerable Evil under which we were faln, the Mercy that recovered us had been less: For Benefits are valued by the necessity of the receiver. But Man was disinherited of <hi>Paradise,</hi> an Heir of <hi>Hell,</hi> his Misery was inconceivably great. Now the measure of God's Love is proportionable to the Misery from whence we are redeemed. If there had been any possible Remedy for us in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, our engagements had not been so great: But only He that created us by his Power, could restore us by his Love. Briefly, it magnifies the <hi>Divine</hi> Compassion that our Deliverance is full and intire. It had been admirable Favour to have mitigated our Misery, but we have perfect Redemption, sweetned by the remembrance of those dreadful evils that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest us. As the <hi>three Hebrew</hi> Martyrs came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt out of the fiery Furnace, <hi>The hair of their heads were not singed, nor their coats changed, nor the smell of the fire had passed on them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 3.27.</note> So the Saints above have no marks of Sin or Misery remaining upon them, not the <hi>least spot or wrinkle</hi> to blast their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor the least trouble to diminish their Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but for ever possess the Fulness of Joy, and

Glory, a pure and triumphant Felicity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Greatness of the <hi>Divine</hi> Love towards faln Man appears in the means by which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is accomplisht.

            <p n="1">1. The essential condition of the humane nature assum'd by our Redeemer discovers his transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Love to us. For what proportion is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man? Infinite and Finite are not terms that admit comparison, as Greater and Less, but are distant, as All and Nothing. The whole World before him,<note place="margin">Isa. 40.15, 17.</note> is <hi>but as the drop of the Bucket that hath scarce weight to fall; and the small dust of the Ballance, that is not of such moment as to turn the scales; 'tis as nothing, and counted less then nothing and vanity.</hi> The Deity in its own nature includes Independence and Sovereignty. To be a Creature implys dependence, and subjection. The Angelical Nature is infinitely inferior to the Divine, and Man is lower then the Angels; yet <hi>the Word was made Flesh.</hi> Add to this, he was not made as <hi>Adam</hi> in the perfection of his nature, and beginning the first step of his life in the full exercise of Reason, and Dominion over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but he came into the World by the way of a natural birth, and dependance upon a mortal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Eternal Wisdom of the Father stoopt to a state of infancy, which is most distant from that of Wisdom, wherein though the Life yet the Light of the reasonable Soul is not visible, &amp; the mighty God to a condition of indigence and infirmity. The Lord
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42565:90"/>
of Nature submitted to the Laws of it. Admirable Love, wherein God seemed to forget his own Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the meanness of the Creature! This is more indeared to us by considering,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Servile state of the Nature be assumed. An account of this we have in the Words of the Apostle. <hi>Let this mind be in you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.5, 6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>which was also in Christ; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the form of God,</hi> that is, injoying the Divine Nature with all its Glory eternally, and invariably. As to be in the form of a King, signifies not only to be a King, but to have all the conspicuous marks of Royalty, the Crown, Scepter, Throne, the Guards and State of a King.<note place="margin">John 17.5. Isa. 6.1, 2. Prov. 8.15.</note> Thus our Saviour possest that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that is truly Divine, before he took our nature. The Angels adored him in Heaven, and by him <hi>Princes reigned on the Earth.</hi> 'Tis added, <hi>he thought it no robbery to be equal with God</hi>; that is, being the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Image of the Father, he had a rightful possession of all his perfections. Yet <hi>he made himself of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of Man</hi>; this is a lower degree of condescension, than the assuming the naked humane nature. A Servant is not simply a Man, there being many Men of higher quality, but a Man in a low State. Now he that was in the form of God, lessened himself into the form of a servant, that is, took the humane nature without honour, attended with its infirmities; So that by the visible condition of his life, he was judged to be an ordinary person, and not that under that meanness the Lord of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels had been concealed. This will more distinctly be understood, if we consider the lowness of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, the poverty of his birth, and the tenor of his life whilst he converst with Men. What Nation
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42565:90"/>
was more despicable in the esteem of the World than the <hi>Jews?</hi> and Christ came of their stock;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>are called by</hi> Tacitus, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissima pars servientium.</hi> Lib. 5. Hist. Joh. 7.50. Joh. 1.46. Luk. 2.14. Levit. 11.</note> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> none were more vilified than the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans,</hi> and in <hi>Galilee-Nazareth</hi> was a contemptible village, and in <hi>Nazareth</hi> the Family of <hi>Joseph</hi> was very obscure, and to him our Saviour was nearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied. His reputed Father was a Carpenter, and his Mother a poor Virgin, that offered <hi>two</hi> Pigeons for her purification. He first breathed in a Stable, and was covered with poor swadling-cloaths, who was Master of Heaven and Earth, and adorns all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with their glory. But Love made him who is Heir of all things, renounce the priviledge of his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Sonship. Incredible condesension! There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Angel was dispatcht from Heaven, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with a surprizing miraculous light, the visible character of his dignity, to prevent the scandal which might arise from the meanness of his condition, and to assure the Shepherds that the Babe which lay in the Manger, was the Redeemer of the World. The course of his Life was a preface,<note place="margin">Luke 2.12.</note> and preparative for the Death of the Cross. He had a just right to all that Glory, which a created Nature personally united to the Deity could receive. An eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it there is in his Transfiguration, when Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry descended from Heaven to encompass him; that which was so short should have been continual, but he presently returned to the: lowness of his former condition. <hi>The fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily,</hi> yet in his humble state he was voluntarily deprived of those admirable effects which should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from that union. Strange separation between the Deity, and the Glory that results from it! God is light, and the Son is the brightness of his Fathers
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42565:91"/>
Glory, yet in his Pilgrimage upon the Earth he was alwayes under a cloud. Astonishing Miracle! tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending all those in the course of Nature, yet the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Love effected it. He was made not only <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Angels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. Psal. 22.</note> 
               <hi>but less than all Men,</hi> joyning (Oh amazing abasement!) the Majesty of God, with the meanness of <hi>a Worm.</hi> The <hi>High and Lofty-One,</hi> whom the Prophet saw <hi>Exalted on a High Throne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay. 6.</note> and all the Powers of Heaven in a posture of Reverence about Him, <hi>was despised and rejected of Men: they turned their eyes from him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay. 53.</note> not for the lustre of his Countenance, but for shame.</p>
            <p>If the Lord had assumed our Nature in its most honourable Condition, and appeared in its Beauty, the condescension were infinite: For although Men are distinguish'd among themselves by <hi>Titles</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet as two <hi>Gloworms</hi> that shine with an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual brightness in the Night, are equally obscured by the light of the <hi>Sun</hi>; So all men, those that are advanc'd to the most eminent degree, as well as the most abject and wretehed, are in the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from God. But <hi>He emptied himself of all his Glory;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. Esa. 53.2.</note> 
               <hi>he grew up as a tender Plant, and as a Root out of a dry ground, there was no Form or Comliness in him.</hi> From his Birth to the time of his Preaching he lived so privately, as only known under the quality of the <hi>Carpenters</hi> Son. There was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual repression of that inconceivable Glory, that was due to him the first moment of his appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men. In short, His despised Condition was an abasement not only of his Divinity, but his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. And how conspicuous was his Love in this darkning Condescension?<note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 8 9.</note> 
               <hi>We know the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ; that though he was rich, he became
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42565:92"/>
poor for our sakes.</hi> He did not assume that which was due to the excellency of his Nature, but what was convenient for our Redepmtion, which was to be accomplisht by Sufferings.</p>
            <p>Where can be found an Example of such Love? Some have favourable Inclinations to help the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, and will express so much Compassion as is consistent with their state and quality: But if in order to the relieving of the miserable, one must submit to what is shameful, who hath an affection so strong and vehement as to purchase his Brothers Redemption at the loss of his own Honour? Yet the Son of God descended from his Throne, and put on our vile Mortality: He parted with his Glory that He might be qualified to part with his Life for our Salvation. How doth this exalt his Compassion to us?</p>
            <p>And further, He took our Nature after it had lost its <hi>Primitive</hi> Innocency. The natural distance between God and the creature is <hi>infinite,</hi> the <hi>moral</hi> between God and the sinful creature, if possible, is more than <hi>infinite:</hi> Yet the Mercy of our Redeemer overcame this distance. What an <hi>extasie</hi> of Love transported the Son of God so far as to espouse our Nature, after it was defiled and debased with Sin? He was <hi>essential</hi> Innocence and Purity, yet <hi>He came in the similitude of sinful flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> which to outward view was not different from what was really sinful. He was the Holy Lawgiver, yet He submitted to that Law, which made Him appear under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and disreputation of a Sinner.<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> He paid the bloody Tribute of the Children of wrath, being circumcised as guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin; and he was baptised as guilty of his own.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:42565:93"/>2. The most evident and sensible proof of the greatness of Gods Love to Mankind, is in the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Redeemer to obtain our Pardon. He is called in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 53.</note> 
               <hi>A man of Sorrows,</hi> the title signifies their number and quality. His whole Life was a continual Passion: He suffered the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of Sinners,</hi> who by their malicious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies obscur'd the lustre of his Miracles and most innocent Actions: He endured the Temptations of <hi>Satan</hi> in the Desert: He was often in danger of his Life; But all these were nothing in comparison of his last <hi>Sufferings.</hi> 'Tis therefore said, that at the bare apprehension of them, He <hi>began to be sorrowful,</hi> as if He had never felt any Grief till then: His former Afflictions were like scatter'd drops of Rain; But as in the Deluge <hi>All the Fountains beneath, and all the Windows of Heaven above were opened</hi>; So in our Saviours last <hi>Sufferings,</hi> the Anger of God, the Cruelty of Men, the Fury of Devils broke out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against him. And that the degrees of his Love may be measured by those of his Sufferings, it will be fit to consider them with respect to his Soul and his Body. The Gospel delivers to us the relation of both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon his entrance into the Garden, He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>My Soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto Death.</hi> There were present only <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> his happy Favourites, who assured him of their fidelity; there was no visible enemy to afflict Him, yet his Soul was environ'd with <hi>Sorrows.</hi> 'Tis easie to conceive the injuries He suffered from the rage of Men, for they were terminated upon his Body; But how to understand his inward Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the wounds of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> the cross to which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42565:93"/>
his Soul was nailed, is very difficult. Yet these were in expressibly greater as the visible effects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declare. The anguish of his soul so affected his body, that his <hi>Sweat was as it were great drops of Blood,</hi> the miraculous evidence of his Agony. The terror was so dreadful, that the assistance of an Angel could not calm it. And if we consider the causes of his grief, the dispositions of Christ, and the design of God in afflicting him, it will further appear that no sorrow was ever like his. The Causes were,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The evil of Sin which infinitely exceeds all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the just measure of an evil is taken from the good to which it is opposit, and of which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us. Now Sin is formally opposit to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature, and will of God, and meritoriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives of his blessed presence for ever. Therefore God being the supreme Good, Sin is the supreme evil. And grief being the resentment of an evil, that which is proportioned to the evil of Sin must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. Now the Lord Christ alone had perfect light to discover Sin in its true horrour, and perfect zeal to hate it according to its nature: for who can understand the excellency of good, and the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of evil, but the Author of the one and the Judge of the other? who can fully conceive the guilt of rebellion against God, but the Son of God who is alone able to comprehend his own Majesty? On this account the grief of our Redeemer exceeded all the sorrow of repenting Sinners, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World. For our knowledge is so imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and our zeal so remiss, that our grief for sin is much beneath what 'tis worthy of, but sin was as hateful to Christ as it is in it self, and his sorrow was equal to its evil.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:42565:94"/>2. The Death he was to suffer, attended with all the Curses of the Law, and the terrible marks of Gods Indignation. From hence 'tis said, <hi>he began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 14.34.</note> 'Tis wonderful that the Son of God, who had perfect patience, and the strength of the Deity to support him, who knew that his Passion should soon pass away, and that the issue should be his own glorious Resurrection and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of lapsed Man, that he should be shaken with fear and oppressed with sorrow at the first approches of it: how many of the Martyrs have with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed courage embraced a more cruel death? but to them 'twas disarm'd, whereas our Saviour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered it with all its formidable Pomp, with its Darts and Poison.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Wrath of God was inflamed against him. For although he was perfectly Innocent, and more distant from sin than Heaven is from the Earth, yet by the ordination of God, and his own consent being made our <hi>Sponsor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 53.</note> 
               <hi>the Iniquity of us all was laid upon him.</hi> He suffered as deeply as if he had been guilty. <hi>Vindictive</hi> justice was inexorable to his Prayers and Tears. Although he renewed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest with the greatest ardency, as 'tis said by the Evangelist, <hi>that being in an Agony he prayed more earnestly,</hi> yet God would not spare him. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies saw his Son humbled in his presence, prostrate on the Earth, yet deals with him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream severity. He <hi>was stricken, smiten of God, and afflicted.</hi> And who is able to conceive the weight of God's Hand when he punishes sin according to its desert? who can understand the degrees of those Sufferings when God exacts satisfaction from one that was obliged, and able to make it? how piercing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42565:94"/>
were those sorrows whereby Divine Justice, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incens'd, was to be appeas'd? Who knows the consequence of those words, <hi>My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me</hi>? 'Tis impossible to comprehend, or represent that great and terrible Mystery. But thus much we may understand, That Holiness and Glory being <hi>essential</hi> to the <hi>Deity,</hi> they are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Reasonable Nature when united to it; But with this difference, that Holiness necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily results from Union with God: For Sin being infinitely repugnant to His Nature, makes a <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> between Him and the creature: But Glory and Joy are dispensed in a free and arbitrary manner. This <hi>dereliction</hi> of our Saviour must be understood with respect to the <hi>second,</hi> not the <hi>first</hi> Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the extremity of his Torments all his Affections were innocent and regular, being only raised to that degree, which the vehemency of the object required. He exprest no murmur against God, nor anger against his enemies. His Faith, Love, Humility, Patience were then in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation. But that glorious and unspeakable Joy which in the course of his Life the <hi>Deity</hi> conveyed to Him, was then withdrawn. An impetuous torrent of pure unmixed Sorrows broke into his holy Soul; He felt no refreshing <hi>emanations,</hi> so that having lost the sense of present Joy, there remained in his Soul only the hope of future Joy. And in that sad moment, his Mind was so intent upon his Sufferings, that he seems to have been diverted from the actual conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Glory that attended the issue of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briefly,</hi> All comforting Influences were suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but without prejudice to the <hi>Personal</hi> Union, or the Perfection of his Grace, or to the Love of his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42565:95"/>
Father toward Him. His Soul was liable to sorrows, as his Body to death. For the <hi>Deity</hi> is the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of Life as well as of Joy; and as the Body of Christ was <hi>three</hi> days in the state of Death, and the <hi>Hypostatical</hi> Union remained entire; so his Soul was left for a time under the fearful impressions of wrath, yet was not separated from the God-head. And although He endured what ever was necessary for the <hi>Expiation</hi> of Sin, yet all vitious Evils, as Blasphemy, Hatred of God, and any other which are not inflicted by the Judg, but in strictness are accidental to the Punishment, and proceed from the weakness or wickedness of the Patient, he was not in the least guilty of. Besides when his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear'd an enemy against him, at that time He was <hi>infinitely</hi> pleased in his Obedience. But with these exceptions our Blessed Lord suffered whatever was due to us.</p>
            <p>The Sorrows of his forsaken state were inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly great; for according to the degree and sense we have of Happiness, such in proportion is our grief for the loss of it. Now Christ had the fullest enjoyment, and the highest valuation of Gods favour. His enjoyment was rais'd above what the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Spirits are capable of: All his Faculties were pure and vigorous, never blunted with Sin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately united to the <hi>Deity.</hi> How cutting then was it to his Soul, to be suspended from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vision of God? To be divorc'd as it were from himself, and to lose that <hi>Paradise</hi> He alwaies had within Him? If all the Angels of Light were at once depriv'd of their glory, the loss were not equal to this dreadful <hi>eclipse</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: As if all the <hi>Stars</hi> were extinguisht, the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42565:95"/>
darkness would not be so terrible, as if the <hi>Sun</hi> the fountain of light were put out. Whatever his Sufferings were in kind, yet in degree they were answerable to the full and just desert of Sin, and surpast the power of the <hi>Humane</hi> or <hi>Angelical</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to endure. In short, His Sorrows were only equall'd by that Love which procured them.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Sufferings</hi> infflicted by the hand of God, so the <hi>Evils</hi> He endured from men, declare the infiniteness of our Redeemers Love to us. For the further discovery of it, 'tis necessary to reflect upon his Death, which is set down by the <hi>Apostle</hi> as the lowest degree of his Humiliation, in which the succession of all his Bodily <hi>Sufferings</hi> is included, it being the complement of all. And if we consider the quality of it, the Goodness of our Redeemer will be more visible in his voluntary submission to it. <hi>Two</hi> Circumstances make the kind of death which is to be suffered, very terrible to us, Ignominy and Torment, and they eminently concur in the Death of the Cross.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greatest Ignominy attended it, and that in the account of God and Men. As honour is <hi>in hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> it depends upon the esteem of others; so infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my consists in judgment of others. Now in the acount of the World every Death inflicted for a Crime is attended with disgrace: But that receives its degrees from the manner of it. To be executed privately is a favour, but to be made a spectacle to the multitude, encreases the dishonour of one that suffers. When Death is speedily inflicted, the sence of shame is presently past; but to be exposed to publick view for many Hours, as a Malefactor, whilst the Beholders detest the Crime, and abhor the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42565:96"/>
Punishment, is an heavy aggravation of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading which is suddenly dispatcht by a Sword, a <hi>military</hi> Instrument, and therefore more honourable, was a Priviledg: But to hang on the Cross, was the most conspicuous mark of the publick Justice and Displeasure: a special Infamy was concomitant with it. Among the <hi>Jews</hi> hanging on a Tree was branded with the Curse: Therefore God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the <hi>bodies of those that were hanged on a tree,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 21.23.</note> 
               <hi>should be taken down in the Evening, that the Land might not be defiled with a Curse.</hi> And the judgment of other Nations was answerable: for it was only inflicted on the most infamous Offenders,<note place="margin">

               </note> as Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Slaves, Thieves, and Traitors, such whom the lowness of their Quality, or the height of their Crimes rendred unworthy of any respect.

            <p n="2">2. The pain of that Death was extreme. The Hands and Feet, those parts wherein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the Nerves meet, and are of exquisite <hi>Sence,</hi> were nailed. Crucified persons suffered a slow Death, but quick Torments: They felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves die. Therefore in pity the Soldiers broke their Legs, to put a period to their Misery. And to compleat their Punishment, they were judg'd unworthy of Burial, the last consolation of the dead; they were deprived of Repose in the bosom of the Earth our common Mother, and exposed as a prey to Birds and Beasts.</p>
            <p>Now the Son of God endured no gentler or nobler Death than that of the Cross. His pure and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Hands, which were never stretcht out but to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42565:96"/>
do good, were pierced;<note place="margin">Psal. 22.</note> and those Feet which bore the Redeemer of the World, and for which the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had a reverence, were nail'd. His Body, the precious workmanship of the Holy Ghost, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Deity, was destroyed. He that is the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven was made the scorn of the Earth: The King of Kings was crucified between <hi>two</hi> Thieves, in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at their <hi>Sacred</hi> Feast, in the face of the World. His naked Body was exposed on the Cross for <hi>three</hi> Hours, only covered with a Veil of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This was such a <hi>stupendious</hi> submission of the Son of God, that his Death astonisht the <hi>Universe</hi> in another manner, than his Birth and Life, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and Ascension. Universal Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented at his last <hi>Sufferings.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> was struck with horrour and withdrew its light; it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear crown'd with <hi>beams,</hi> when the Creator was with <hi>thorns.</hi> The Earth trembled, and the Rocks rent, the most insensible creatures <hi>sympathis'd</hi> with Him, and 'tis in this we have the most visible instance of Divine Love to us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> distinctly represents the Love of God in giving his <hi>Son,</hi> and the Love of <hi>Christ</hi> in giving Himself to die for Man, and both require our deepest consideration.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Father</hi> exprest such an excess of Love, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself speaks of it with admiration: <hi>God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes on Him should not perish,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>but have everlasting Life.</hi> If <hi>Abraham</hi>'s resolution to offer his son,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.12.</note> was in the judgment of God a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Evidence of his Affection, how much more is the <hi>actual</hi> sacrificing of <hi>Christ</hi> the strongest proof of God's Love to us? For God had a higher
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42565:97"/>
Title to <hi>Isaac</hi> than <hi>Abraham</hi> had: The Father of Spirits hath a nearer claim, than the Fathers of the Flesh. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s readiness to offer up his son was Obedience to a Command, not his own choice; 'twas rather an act of Justice than Love, by which he render'd to God what was his own. But God <hi>Spared not his own Son</hi> in whom he had an Eternal Right: And He was not only free from Obligation, but not sued to for our Salvation in that wonderful way. For what Love of Men, or of the most cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Spirits in Heaven could have conceived such a thought, that the Son of God should die for our Redemption? It had been an impious Blasphemy to have desired it; so that <hi>Christ</hi> is the most absolute <hi>gift</hi> of God to us. Besides, The love of <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be measured by the Reasons that might excite it; For according to the amiableness of the object, so much greater is the love that gives it. Many endearing cirumstances made <hi>Isaac</hi> the joy of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet at the best he was an imprafect mortal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so that but a moderate affection was regularly due to him. Whereas our Redeemer was not a meer Man, or an Angel, but God's only begotten Son, which Title signifies his unity with him in his state and perfections, and according to the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Nature such is his Fathers Love to him. <hi>In this was manifested the Love of God to us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 4.9.</note> 
               <hi>that we might live through Him.</hi> The Love of God in all <hi>temporal</hi> blessings is but faint in the comparison with the Love that is exprest in our Redeemer. As much as the Creator exceeds the creature, the gift of Christ is above the gift of the whole world. <hi>Herein is Love,</hi> saith the Apostle, that is the clearest and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42565:97"/>
highest expression of it that can be, <hi>God sent his Son to be a Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> The Wisdom and Power of God never acted to the utmost of their efficacy; he could frame a more Glorious World, but the Love of God cannot in a higher degree be exprest. As the Apostle to set forth how sacred and inviolable Gods promise is, saith,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17.</note> that <hi>because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself</hi>; so when he would give the most excellent testimony of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to mankind, he gave his Eternal Son, the Heir of his Love and Blessedness. The giving of Heaven it self with all its Joys and Glory, is not so perfect and full a demonstration of the Love of God, as the giving of his Son to die for us.</p>
            <p>According to the rule of common esteem, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Love was exprest to wretched Man, than to Christ himself: for we expend things less valuable for those that are more precious; so that God in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to die for us, declar'd that our Salvation was more dear to him then the life of his only Son. When no meaner Ransom than the Blood Royal of Heaven could purchase our Redemption, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the expence of that sacred Treasure for us. <hi>It pleased the Lord to bruise him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Though the Death of Christ absolutely consider'd was the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est provocation of God's displeasure, and brought the greatest guilt upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> for which <hi>Wrath came upon them to the uttermost</hi>; yet in respect of the end, namely the Salvation of Men, 'twas the most greatful Offering to him,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.2.</note> 
               <hi>a Sacrifice of a sweet smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling savour.</hi> This is an endearing circumstance of Gods Love to us. God repented that he made Man, but never that he redeem'd him.</p>
            <p>And as the Love of the Father, so the Love of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42565:98"/>
Christ appears in a superlative manner in dying for us.<note place="margin">Joh. 15.8.</note> 
               <hi>Greater Love hath no Man than this, that a Man lay down his life for his Friend.</hi> There is no kind of Love that exceeds the affection which is exprest in dying for another: but there are diverse degrees of it: and the highest is to die for our enemies. The Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.7.</note> 
               <hi>perhaps for a good man some would dare to die.</hi> 'Tis possible gratitude may prevail upon one who is under strong obligations, to die for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. Or some may from a generous principle be willing with the loss of their lives to preserve one, who is a general and publick good. But this is a rare, and almost incredible thing. 'Tis recorded as a miraculous instance of the power of Love, that the two <hi>Sicilian</hi> Philosophers <hi>Damon,</hi> and <hi>Pithias,</hi> each had courage to die for his Friend. For one of them being condemn'd to die by the Tyrant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to give the last farewel to his Family, his Friend entered into Prison as his Surety to die for him, if he did not return at the appointed time. And he came to the amazement of all, that expected the issue of such a hazardous caution. Yet in this example there seems to be in the Second such a confidence of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of the first, that he was assured he should not die in being a pledge for him: and in the first 'twas not meer friendship, or sense of the obligation, but the regard of his own honour that made him rescue his Friend from Death. And if Love were the sole motive, yet the highest expression of it was to part with a short life, which in a little time must have been resigned by the order of nature. But the Love of our Saviour was so pure and great, there can be no resemblance, much less any parallel of it. For he was perfectly Holy, and so the priviledge of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42565:98"/>
was due to him, and his life was infinitely more precious than the lives of Angels and Men, yet he laid it down and submitted to a cursed Death, and to that which was infinitely more bitter, the Wrath of God. And all this for sinful men, who were under the just and heavy displeasure of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>He loved us, and gave himself for us:</hi> If he had only interposed as an Advocate to speak for us,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> or only had acted for our recovery,<note place="margin">Qui me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; semel dicondo fecit, in reficiendo &amp; dixit multa, &amp; gessit mira, &amp; pertulit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digna. <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note> his Love had been admirable; but he suffered for us. He is not only our Mediator, but Redeemer; not only Redeemer, but Ransom.</p>
            <p>'Twas excellent goodness in <hi>David,</hi> when he saw the destruction of his People, to offer Himself and Family as a Sacrifice to avert the Wrath of God from them.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.17</note> But his pride was the cause of the Judgment, whereas our Redeemer was perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. <hi>David</hi> interceeded for his Subjects, Christ for his Enemies. He receiv'd the Arrows of the Almighty into his Breast to shelter us.<note place="margin">Isa. 53.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>He bore our griefs, and carried our sorrows, he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquites, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.</hi> Among the Romans the <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potick</hi> power was so terrible, that if a slave had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temped upon the Life of his Master, all the rest had been crucified with the guilty person. But our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Master dyed for his slaves who had conspir'd against him. He shed his Blood for those who spilt it.</p>
            <p>And the readiness of our Lord to save us, though by the sharpest sufferings, magnifies his Love. When the richest Sacrifices under the Law were insufficient to take away sin, and no lower price then <hi>the blood of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42565:99"/>
God</hi> could obtain our pardon, upon his entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to excute that wonderful Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which cost him his Life, with what ardour of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection did he undertake it!<note place="margin">Heb. 10.5, 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> from carnal affection deprecated his sufferings, <hi>Master spare thy self,</hi> he who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate goodness, and never quench'd the smoking flax,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.23.</note> expresses the same indignation against him, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> as he did formerly against the Devil tempting to worship him. He esteemed him the worst adversary that would divert him from his Sufferings: He long'd for the <hi>Baptism of his Blood.</hi> And when Death was in his view with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of terrour, and the supreme Judge stood before him ready to inflict the just punishment of sin, though the apprehension of it was so dreadful that he could scarce live under it, yet he resolved to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish his Work. Our Salvation was amiable to him in his Agony. This is specially observed by the Evangelist,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.1.</note> 
               <hi>that Jesus having loved his own, he loved them to the end.</hi> When the Souldiers came to seize upon him, though by one word he could have commanded Legions of Angels for his rescue, yet he yeilded up himself to their Cruelty: 'Twas not any defect of power, but the strength of his Love that made him to suffer. He was willing to be Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that we might be Glorified: our Redemption was sweeter to him, than Death was bitter, by which it was to be obtained. 'Twas excellently said by <hi>Pherecides,</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>THe <hi>Third</hi> Consideration which makes the Love of God so admirable to <hi>lapsed</hi> Man, is, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that state to which he is advanc'd by the Redeemer. To be only exempted from Death is a great favour: The grace of a Prince is eminent in releasing a condemned Person from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law. This is sufficient for the Mercy of Man, but not for the Love of God: He pardons and prefers the guilty; He rescues us from Hell, and raises us to Glory; He bestows Eternity upon those who were unworthy of Life. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our condition under the Gospel will be set off, by comparing it with that of <hi>innocent</hi> Man in <hi>Paradise.</hi> 'Tis true he was then in a state of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Honour, and in perfect possession of that Blessedness which was suitable to his Nature; yet in many respects our last state transcends our first, and <hi>redeeming</hi> Love exceeds <hi>creating.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Man had been only restor'd to his forfeited Rights, to the enjoyment of the same Happiness which was lost, his first state were most desirable; And it had been greater Goodness to have preserv'd him innocent, than to recover him from ruine. As
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42565:100"/>
he that preserves his Friend from falling into the hands of the Enemy, by interposing between him and danger, in the midst of the Combat, delivers him in a more noble manner, than by paying a Ransom for him after many daies spent in woful Captivity. And that <hi>Physician</hi> is more excellent in his <hi>Art,</hi> who prevents Diseases, and keeps the Body in health and vigour, than another that expels them by sharp Remedies. But the Grace of the <hi>Gospel</hi> hath so much mended our condition, that if it were offer'd to our choice, either to enjoy the innocent state of <hi>Adam,</hi> or the renewed by <hi>Christ,</hi> it were folly like that of our <hi>first</hi> Parents, to prefer the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter. The <hi>Jubilee</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> restor'd to the same Inheritance, but the <hi>Jubilee</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> gives us the Investiture of that which is transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently better than what we at first possest. Since <hi>The Day-spring from on High hath visited us in tender mercy,</hi> we are enricht with higher Prerogatives, and are under a better Covenant, and entitled to a more glorious Reward, than was due to Man by the Law of his Creation.</p>

In all those who are partakers of Grace and Glory by the Lord Jesus. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Son of God by Creation, but to be joyned to Christ as our head, by a union so intimate, that <hi>he lives in us,</hi> and counts himself incompleat without us,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20. Ephes. 1.23.</note> and by that union to be adopted into the line of Heaven, and thereby to have an interest in the <hi>exceeding great and precious promises</hi> of the Gospel;<note place="margin">Servo ut servo nihil potest donari.</note> to be <hi>constituted Heirs of God, and coheirs with Christ,</hi> are such discoveries of the dignity of our supernatural state, that the lowest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is advanced above <hi>Adam</hi> in all his honour. Nay, the Angels though superior to Man in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their nature, yet are accidently lower by the honour of our alliance: Their King is our Brother. And this relative dignity which seems to eclipse their Glory, might excite their envy, but such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous goodness dwells in those pure and blessed Spirits, that they rejoyce in our restoration and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>
            <p>To this I shall add, that as the Son of God hath a special relation to Man, so the most tender affections for him. To illustrate this by a sensible instance: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men are as two different Nations in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Customs, but under the same Empire: and if a Prince that commands two Nations should employ one for the safety and prosperity of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it were an Argument of special favour. Now the Angels are <hi>sent forth to minister for them who
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42565:101"/>
are Heirs of Salvation.</hi> Besides,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> in two other things the peculiar affection of the Prince would be most evident to that Nation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If he put on their habit, and attire himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their fashion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he fixt his residence among them. Now the Son of God was cloathed with our flesh, and <hi>found in fashion as a man,</hi> and for ever appears in it in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and will at the last day invest our bodies with glory like to his own. He now dwells in us by his Spirit, and when our warfare is accomplisht, he shall in a special manner be present with us in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mansions. As God incarnate he converst with Men on Earth, and as such he will converse with them in heaven. There he raigns as <hi>the first-born in the midst of many Brethren.</hi> Now all these Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives are the fruits of our Redemption.</p>
            <p>And how great is that Mercy which hath raised Mankind more glorious out of its ruines! The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle breaks out with a Heavenly astonishment, <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God!</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.1.</note> that we who are Strangers and Enemies, <hi>Children of Wrath by nature,</hi> should be dignified with the honorable, and amiable title of his Sons! 'Twas a rare and most merciful condescension in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to rescue an innocent and forsaken Infant from perishing by the waters, and adopt him to be her Son but how much greater kindness was it for God to save guilty and wretched Man from Eternal Flames, and to take him into his Family. The Ambition of the Prodigal rose no higher than to be a Servant; wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an inestimable favour is it to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42565:102"/>
make us Children! When God would express the most dear and peculiar affection to <hi>Solomon,</hi> he saith, <hi>I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son:</hi> this was the highest honour he could promise;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.14.</note> and all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are dignified with it. 'Tis the same relation that Christ hath: when he was going to Heaven he comforted his Disciples with these words, <hi>I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.</hi> There is indeed a diversity in the foundation of it: Christ is a Son by Nature, we are by meer Favour; he is by Generation, we are by Adoption. Briefly, <hi>Jesus Christ hath made us Kings &amp; Priests unto God &amp; his Father:</hi> These are the highest Offices upon Earth, and were attended with the most conspicuous Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and the Holy Spirit chose those bright Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to convey a clearer notice of the glory to which our Redeemer hath raised us. Not only all the Crowns and Scepters in this perishing World are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beneath this dignity, but the honour of our innocent state was not equal to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Gospel is a better Covenant than that which was establisht with Man in his Creation: and the excellency of it will appear, by considering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis more beneficial, in that it admits of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reconciliation after sin, and accepts of Sincerity instead of perfection. The Apostle magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Office of Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.6.</note> 
               <hi>By how much he is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of a better Covenant, which was established upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promises.</hi> The comparison there, is, between the Ministry of the Gospel and the <hi>Mosaical oeconomy.</hi> And the excellency of the Gospel is specified, in respect of those infinitely better promisses that are in it. The ceremonial Law appointed Sacrifices for sins of ignorance and error, and to obtain only legal
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42565:102"/>
impunity; but the <hi>Gospel</hi> upon the account of Christ's <hi>all-sufficient</hi> Sacrifice, offers full Pardon for all Sins that are repented of and forsaken. Now with greater reason the Covenant of Grace is to be preferr'd before the Covenant of Works. For the <hi>Law</hi> considered Man as holy, and endued with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Grace equal to whatsoever was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: 'Twas the measure of his Ability as well as Duty, and requir'd exact Obedience, or threatned extreme Misery. The least breach of it is fatal: A single Offence as certainly exposes to the curse, as if the whole were violated. And in our <hi>lapsed</hi> state we are utterly disabled to comply with its Purity and Perfection. But the <hi>Gospel</hi> contains the Promises of Mercy, and is in the <hi>hands of a Mediator.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> The <hi>tenor</hi> of it is, <hi>That Repentance and Remission of Sins be preached in the Name of Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>And if we judge our selves, we shall not be judged.</hi> 'Tis not if we are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, for then none could be exempt from Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: But if the convinced Sinner erect a <hi>Tribunal</hi> in Conscience, and strips Sin of its disguise, to view it in its <hi>native</hi> deformity; if he pronounce the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law against himself, and glorifie the Justice of God which he cannot satisfie, and forsake the Sins which are the causes of his sorrow, he is qualified for pardoning Mercy.</p>
            <p>Besides, The <hi>Gospel</hi> doth not only apply Pardon to us for all forsaken Sins, but provides a Remedy for those Infirmities to which the best are incident. Whilst we are in this <hi>mortal</hi> state, we are exposed to Temptations from without, and have Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within that often betray us: Now to support our drooping Spirits, our Redeemer sits in Heaven to plead for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perpetually renews the Pardon
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42565:103"/>
that was once purchased, to every contrite spirit, for those unavoidable frailties which cleave to us here. The promise of Grace is not made void by the sudden surprizes of Passions. <hi>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Jesus Christ the Righteous.</hi> The rigour of the Law is molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his <hi>Mediation</hi> with the Father: A title of Love and Tenderness. God deals not with the <hi>Severity</hi> of a Judg, but <hi>He spares us as a man spares his own son that serves him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Malac. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And as He pardons us upon our Repentance, so He accepts our hearty, though mean, services. Now the <hi>Legal,</hi> that is, unsinning and compleat Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot be performed; the <hi>Evangelical,</hi> that is, the sincere, though imperfect, is graciously received. God doth not require the duties of a Man by the measures of an Angel. Unfeigned Endeavours to please Him, unreserved Respects to all his Commands, single and holy aims at his Glory are rewarded. <hi>Briefly,</hi> Although the Law is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as a Rule of living, yet not as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Life. And what an admirable exaltation of Mercy is there in this new Treaty of God with Sinners? 'Tis true, the <hi>first</hi> Covenant was <hi>holy, just,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> but it made no abatements of favour, and <hi>'tis now weak through the flesh:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> that is, The <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> corrupt Nature is so strong and impetuous, that the restraints of the Law are ineffectual to stop its desires, and therefore cannot bring Man to that Life that is promised, by the performance of the Condition required. But the <hi>Gospel</hi> provides an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence for relenting and returning Sinners. This is the language of God in that Covenant, <hi>I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 8.</note>

their Iniquities will I remember no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The excellency of the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Covenant above the <hi>Legal,</hi> is, in that <hi>supernatural</hi> Assistance which is conveyed by it to Believers, whereby they shall be certainly victorious over all opposition in their way to Heaven. 'Tis true <hi>Adam</hi> was endued with perfect holiness and freedom, but he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle himself in the snares of Sin, and Death. The Grace of the Creator given to him was alwaies present, but it depended on the natural use of his Faculties, without the interposing any extraordinary operation of God's Spirit. The <hi>Principle</hi> of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was in himself, and 'twas subjected to his Will: He had a power to obey if he would, but not that <hi>actually</hi> determined his will, for then he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severed. But the Grace of the Redeemer that flows from Christ as our quickening Head, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to all his Members, enclines the Will so powerfully that 'tis made subject to it. <hi>God works in us to will and to do of his good pleasure</hi>;<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> The use of our Faculties, and the exercise of Grace, depends on the good pleasure of God, who is unchangeable, and the operations of the Spirit which are prevailing and effectual. And upon these <hi>two</hi> the stability of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant is founded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. On the Love of God, who is as unchangable in his Will, as in his Nature. This Love is the cause of Election,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.35. Isa. 9. Joh. 17.6.</note> from whence there can be no separation. This gives Christ to Believers, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to Him: <hi>Thine they were,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>and thou gavest them me.</hi> Which words signifie not the common title God hath to all by Creation: for Men thus universally consider'd, compose the world; and our Saviour distinguishes those that are <hi>given</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16.17.</note>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:42565:105"/>
               <hi>him from the world</hi>; but that special right God hath in them by election. And all those are given by the Father to Christ in their effectual Calling, (which is exprest by his <hi>drawing them to the Son)</hi> and are committed to his care,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.44.</note> to lead them through a course of Obedience to Glory. For them Christ absolutely praies as Mediator,<note place="margin">John 17.</note> 
               <hi>Father, I will that those whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, and see my Glory:</hi> And he is alwaies heard in his requests.</p>
            <p>'Tis from hence that the Apostle challenges all Creatures in Heaven and Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, with that full and strong persuasion, that nothing could separate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Believers,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38.</note> and their Happiness. <hi>For I am persuaded that neither Death nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities nor Powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor heigth, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the Love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</hi> His assurance is not built on the special Prerogatives he had as an Apostle, not on his rapture to Paradise, nor Revelations, nor the Apparition of Angels, for of these he makes no mention; but on that which is common to all Believers, the Love of God declar'd in the Word, and <hi>shed abroad in their hearts.</hi> And 'tis observable that the <hi>Apostle</hi> having spoken in his own person, changes the number, <hi>I am persuaded that nothing shall separate us,</hi> to associate with himself in the partaking of that blessed Priviledg, all true Believers, who have an interest in the same Love of God, the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Salvation, and had felt the <hi>sanctifying</hi> work of the Spirit, the certain proof of their <hi>Election.</hi> For how is it possible that God should <hi>retract</hi> his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful purpose to save his People? He that chose them
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42565:105"/>
from Eternity before they could know Him, and from pure Love (there being nothing in the Creature to induce Him) gave his Son to suffer Death for them, will He stop there, without bestowing that Grace which may render it effectual? What can change his Affections? He that prevented them in his Mercy, when they were in their pollutions, will He leave them after his Image is engraven upon them? He that loved them so as to unite them to Christ when they were strangers, will He hate them when they are his Members? No: His loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is everlasting,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.</note> and the Covenant that is built on it, is more firm than the Pillars of Heaven, and the Foundations of the Earth. This supported <hi>David</hi> in his dying hours, that <hi>God had made with him an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.5.</note> 
               <hi>for that was all his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>New</hi> Covenant is secur'd by the efficacy of Divine and Supernatural Grace.<note place="margin">Heb. 8.10.</note> 
               <hi>This is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that I will make with the house of</hi> Israel, <hi>saith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a People.</hi> The <hi>Elect</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to perform the conditions of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to which Eternal Life is promised. Our <hi>Redeemer blesses us in turning us from our Iniquities.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3.26.</note> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the instability of the <hi>humane</hi> Spirit, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>remanent</hi> Corruptions, and those vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Temptations to which we are liable, may excite our fear, lest we should fall short of <hi>the high prize of our Calling,</hi> yet the Grace of the Gospel secures true Believers against both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whilst we are in the present state, our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are not perfectly healed, but there are some
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42565:106"/>
remains, which like a <hi>Gangrene</hi> threaten to seize on the <hi>vital</hi> parts, wherein the <hi>spiritual</hi> Life is seated. But the <hi>divine</hi> Nature which is conveyed to all that are <hi>spiritually</hi> descended from Christ, is <hi>active</hi> and powerful to resist all <hi>carnal</hi> desires, and will prevail in the end. For if sin in its full vigor could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the efficacy of converting Grace, how can the reliques of it, after Grace hath taken possession, be strong enough to spoil it of its conquest. There is a greater distance from Death to Life, than from Life to Action. That Omnipotent Grace that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited us in the Grave, and restored life to the dead, can much more perpetuate it in the living. That which was so powerful as to pluck the heart of stone out of the Breast, can preserve the Heart of Flesh.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Grace that is given to Believers, in its own nature is a perishing quality, as that which was bestowed on <hi>Adam.</hi> Non only the slight superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial tincture in hypocrites will wear off, but that deep impression of sanctifying Grace in true Believers, if it be not renewed, would soon be defaced. But God hath promised to put his Spirit into their hearts, <hi>and to cause them to walk in his Statutes, and they shall keep his Commandments.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezec. 36.27.</note> He is a living reigning Principle in them, to which all their faculties are subordinate. The Spirit infused Grace at first, and enlivens it dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: he confirms their Faith, inflames their Love, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages their Obedience, and refreshes in their minds the <hi>Idea's</hi> of that glory which is invisible and future. In short, his influence cherishes the blessed beginnings of the spiritual Life. So that sincere Grace though weak in its degree, yet 'tis in a state of progress, til it come to perfection. The Waters of the Spirit have a cleansing vertue upon Believers,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42565:106"/>
till every spot be taken away, and their purified Souls ascend to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Grace of the Spirit shall make true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians finally victorious over Temptations to which they may be exposed. And those are various: Some are pleasant and insinuating, others are sharp and furious, and are managed by the Devil our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and industrious Enemy, to undermine, or by open battery to overthrow us. And how difficult is it for the Soul whilst united to Flesh, to resist the charms of what is amiable, or to endure the assaults of what is terrible to sense? But the renewed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hath no reason to be afrighted with disquieting fears, that any sinful temptation may come, which notwithstanding his watchfulness, may overcome him irrecoverably. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Temptations are External, and have no power over our spirits but what we give them. A volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry resistance secures the victory to us. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, <hi>Greater is he that is in Believers, then he that is in the World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.4.</note> God is stronger not only in himself, but as working in us, by the vigorous assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Grace to confirm us, than the Devil assisted with all the delights and terrours of the world, and taking advantage of that remaining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence which is not intirely extinguished, is, to corrupt, and destroy us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Temptations in their degrees and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, are ordered by Gods Providence. He is the president of the combat: none enters into the lists but by his call: in all Ages the Promise shall be verified,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rom. 8.37.</note> 
               <hi>God will not suffer his People to be tempted above what they are able. They shall come off more then Conquerours, through Christ that loves them.</hi> And
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42565:107"/>
as St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes;<note place="margin">Major quippe libertas est ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus tot, et tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas tentatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, quae in <hi>Paradiso</hi> non fuit dono per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severantiae munita, ac fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata, ut cum omnibus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roribus &amp; er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roribus suis, vincatur mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> more powerful Grace is necessary to fortifie Christians, in the midst of all opposition, then <hi>Adam</hi> at first received. This is visible in the glorious issue of the <hi>Martyrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who loved not their Lives unto the Death:</hi> For <hi>Adam</hi> when no person threatned him, nay against the prohibition of God, abusing his Liberty, did not abide in his Happiness, when 'twas most easie to him to avoid Sin. But the <hi>Martyrs</hi> remain'd firm in the Faith, not only under Terrors, but Torments. And which is the more admirable, in that <hi>Adam</hi> saw the Happiness <hi>present,</hi> which he should forfeit by his Disobedience, and the <hi>Martyrs</hi> believed only the <hi>future</hi> Glory they were to receive. This proceeded only from God who was so merciful, as to make them faithful. <hi>Briefly,</hi> Unless there were a power above the <hi>Divine,</hi> the <hi>Elect</hi> are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecured from <hi>final Apostacy.</hi> Our Saviour tells us that his Father <hi>is greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of his hand.</hi> His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable Will and Almighty Power prevents their perishing. Indeed if it were only by the strength of Natural Reason, or Courage, that we are to overcome Temptations, some might be so violent as to make the strongest to faint and fall away: But if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power be the Principle that supports us, it will make the weakest victorious. For the Grace of God makes us strong, and is not made weak by us.</p>
            <p>From hence we may fully discover the advantage we have by the Gospel, above the terms of the <hi>first</hi> Covenant. Restoring Mercy hath better'd our Condition: We have lost the integrity of the <hi>first,</hi> and got the perfection of the <hi>second Adam:</hi> Our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is put into a stronger and safer hand. <hi>I give,</hi> saith our Redeemer,<note place="margin">Joh. 10.</note> 
               <hi>unto my sheep eternal Life, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42565:107"/>
they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.</hi> That is an inviolable Sanctuary, from whence no Believer can be taken. Christ is our Friend, not only to the <hi>Altar,</hi> but now in the <hi>Throne</hi>: Our Reconciliation is <hi>ascribed to his Death,</hi> our Conservation <hi>to his Life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> He that was created in a state of Nature could sin and die, but <hi>He that is born of God can't sin unto death:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note> the new birth is unto Eternal Life. In short, As the Mercy of God is glorified in the whole work of our Salvation, so especially in the first, and last Grace, it confers upon us. In Vocation that prevents us, and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance that crowns us: according to the <hi>double</hi> change made in our state, translating us from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Light, and from the imperfect Light of Grace, to the full Light of Glory.</p>
            <p>I have more particularly discours'd of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the New Covenant, in regard the Glory of God, and the comfort of true Christians is so much concern'd in it. For if Grace and Free-Will are put in joint <hi>commission,</hi> so that the efficacy of it depends on the mutability of the Will, which may receive or reject it, the consequence is visible, that (which is impious to suppose) the Son of God might have died in vain. For that which is not effectual without a <hi>contingent</hi> condition, must needs be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, as the condition on which it depends. So that although the Wisdom of God so admirably formed the design of our Salvation, and there is such a connexion in his Counsels, yet all may be defeated by the mutability of Mans desires. And the most sincere Christians would be alwaies terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with perplexing jealousies, that notwithstanding their most serious Resolutions to continue in their

Duty, yet one day they may perish by their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie.</hi> But the Gospel assures us, that God will not reverse his own Eternal Decrees: And that the <hi>Redeemer shall see the travel of his Soul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa 53.11.</note> 
               <hi>and be satisfied: and that Believers are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is an excellent manifestation of Divine Love, in the glorious reward that is promised to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which far exceeds the primitive felicity of Man. <hi>Adam</hi> was under the Covenant of nature, that promised a reward sutable to his obedience, and state. The manner of declaring that Covenant was natural.</p>
            <p n="1">1. External, by the discovery of God's Attributes in his Works, from which it was easie for man to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his duty and his reward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Internal, by his natural faculties. By the light of Reason he understood that so long as he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his original Innocence, the Creator who from pure goodness gave him his being, and all the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness which was concomitant with it, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preserve him in the perpetual enjoyment of it. But there was no promise of Heaven annexed to that Covenant, without which <hi>Adam</hi> could attain no knowledg, nor conceive any hopes of it. If there had been a necessary connexion between his perfect Obedience, and the life of Glory, it would have been revealed to him, to allure his will: for there can be no desire of an unknown good. And whereas in the Covenant God principally and primarily regards the promise, and but secondarily the threatning, the exercise of goodness being more pleasing to him than of revenging justice; 'tis said, that God expresly threatned Death, but he made no promise of Heaven:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42565:108"/>
by which 'tis evident it did not belong to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. For it was easier for Man to understand the quality of the punishment that attended sin, than to conceive of Celestial Happiness, of which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable in his animal state.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, God might have bestowed Heaven as an absolute gift upon Man, after a course of obedience; but 'twas not due by the condition of the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. A natural work can give no title to a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural reward. Mans perseverance in his duty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Original Treaty, had been attended with Immortal Happiness upon the Earth; but the <hi>blessed Hope</hi> is only promised in the Gospel,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.13.</note> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably transcends the felicity of Nature in its consummat state.</p>
            <p>This Reward is answerable to the unvaluable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which was laid down for it. The Blood of the Son of God as 'tis a <hi>Ransom</hi> to redeem us from misery, so 'tis a <hi>Price</hi> to purchase glory for Believers.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.6.</note> 'Tis called the <hi>Blood of the New-Testament,</hi> because it conveys a title to the Heavenly Inheritance.<note place="margin">Mat. 26.28.</note> Our impunity is the effect of his Satisfaction, our positive happiness of his redundant merit. God was so well pleased with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience, which infinitely surpasses that of any meer creature, that he promised to confer upon those who believe in him, all the glorious qualities becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sons of God, and to make them associates with him in his Eternal Kingdom. The compleat happiness of the Redeemed, is the Redeemers recompence, in which he is fully satisfied for all his sufferings. Now the transcendent excellency of this above the first state of Man, will more distinctly appear by considering,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The place where 'tis enjoyed, and that is the <hi>Heaven of Heavens. Adam</hi> was put into the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42565:109"/>
               <hi>Paradise,</hi> a place sutable to his natural being, and abounding with all pleasing objects; but they were such as creatures of a lower kind enjoyed with him. But Heaven is the Element of Angels, their native seat, who are the most noble part of the Creation. 'Tis the true Palace of God, intirely separated from the impurities and imperfections, the alterations and changes of the lower World; where he reigns in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Peace. 'Tis the Temple of the Divine Majesty, where his <hi>exellent Glory</hi> is revealed in the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous manner. <hi>'Tis the habitation of his holiness, the place where his honour dwells.</hi> 'Tis the sacred Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Light, and Joy, and Glory. Paradise with all its pleasures was but a shadow of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Life of <hi>Adam</hi> was attended with innocent infirmities. For the body being composed of the same principles with other sensitive creatures, 'twas liable to hunger, and thirst, and weariness, and was to be repaired by food and sleep. <hi>Adam</hi> was made a <hi>living Soul,</hi> therefore subject to those inclinations and necessities which are purely animal.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.45</note> And although whilst innocent, no disease could seize on him, yet he was capable of hurtful impressions: though he should have been preserved from death, yet he was perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. His life was in a perpetual flux: 'twas Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal not meerly from the temperament of his Body, but to be sustained by the power of God in the use of means. From hence it follows that <hi>Adam</hi> in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was not capable of the vision of God. Heaven is too pure an Air for him to have lived in. The Glory of it is inconsistent with such a temper'd Body. <hi>Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.50</note> The faculties would be confounded with its overcoming brightness. Till the sensitive powers
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42565:109"/>
are refin'd, and exalted to that degree that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come spiritual, they cannot converse with glorified objects. Now the bodies of the Saints shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with Celestial qualities. The Natural shall be changed into a Spiritual body, and be preserved as the Angels by the sole vertue of the quickning Spirit. The life above shall flourish in its ful vigour, without any other support, than the Divine power that first created it. And as the body shall be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, so truely immortal, and free from all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive change; as the Sun which for so many ages hath shined with an equal brightness to the World, and hath a dureable fulness of light in it. In this respect the <hi>Children of the Resurrection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 20.36.</note> are equal to <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> who being pure Spirits, do not marry to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate their kind, for they never die. And the glorified body shall be cloathed with a more Divine beauty in the Resurrection, than <hi>Adam</hi> had in the Creation. The glory of the second Temple shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel that of the first. In short,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.47.</note> the first <hi>Man was of the Earth earthy,</hi> and could derive but an earthy condition to his descendents: But the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> is from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and is the principle of an Heavenly and Glorious life to all that are united to him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The felicity of Heaven exceeds the first, in the manner and degrees of the fruition, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Vision of God in Heaven is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. <hi>Adam</hi> was a spectator of God's Works, and his understanding being full of Light, he clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the Divine Attributes in their effects. The stroaks of the Creators Hand are engraven in all the parts of the Universe. The Heavens, and Earth, and all things in them, are evident testimonies of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42565:110"/>
the excellency of their Author. The <hi>invisible things of God from the Creation of the World are clearly seen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> And the knowledg that shined in his soul, produced a transcendent esteem of the Deity, in whom Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power are united in their supreme degree, and a superlative love and delight in him for his goodness. Yet his sight of God was but <hi>through a Glass,</hi> an eclipsing <hi>medium.</hi> For inferior beings are so imperfect, that they can give but a weak resemblance of his infinite perfections. But the sight of God in Heaven,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2.</note> is called, the <hi>seeing of him as he is,</hi> and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the most clear and compleat knowledge, which the rational soul when purified and raised to its most perfect state can receive; and out-shines all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of God in the lower World. <hi>Adam</hi> had a visible copy of his invisible beauty, but the Saints in Heaven see the glorious Original. He saw God in the reflection of the Creature, but the Saints are under the direct beams of Glory,<note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 13.12.</note> and <hi>see him face to face.</hi> All the Attributes appear in their full and brightest lustre to them. Wisdom, Love, Justice, Holiness, Power, are manifested in their exaltation. And the glorified Soul, to qualify it for converse with God in this intimate manner, hath a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent constitution then was given to it in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A new edge is put upon the faculties whereby they are fitted for those objects which are peculiar to Heaven. The intellectual eye is fortified for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate intuition of God. <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the <hi>Lord,</hi> in comparison of the Saints who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass his <hi>Throne,</hi> &amp; are in the presence of his <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, 'Tis the peculiar excellency of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Life, that the Saints every moment enjoy it without any <hi>allay,</hi> in the highest degree of its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42565:110"/>
The Life of <hi>Adam</hi> was alwaies in a circle of low and mean functions of the <hi>Animal</hi> Nature, which being common to him and Beasts, the acts of it are not strictly <hi>Humane.</hi> But the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Life in Heaven is entirely freed from those <hi>servile</hi> necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and is spent in the eternal performance of the most noble actions of which the <hi>intelligent</hi> Nature is capable. The Saints do alwaies contemplate, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, love, enjoy, and praise their everlasting Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. <hi>God is to them all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, That which prefers the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>infinitely</hi> before the <hi>first</hi> state of Man, is the continuance of it for ever: 'Tis an unwithering and never-fading Glory. <hi>Adam</hi> was liable to Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and capable of Change, he fell in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and was sentenc'd to die. But Heaven is the Sanctuary of Life and Immortality; 'tis inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible to any evil. The <hi>Serpent</hi> that corrupted <hi>Paradise</hi> with its Poison, can't enter there. As there is no seed of Corruption within, so no cause of it without. Our Redeemer offer'd Himself by the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> and purchased an eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his People. Their Felicity is full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, without encrease, for in the <hi>first</hi> moment 'tis perfect, and shall continue without declination. The Day of Judgment is called the <hi>Last Day</hi>: For Daies, and Weeks, and Months, and Years, the Revolutions which now measure Time, shall then be swallowed up in an unchangeable Eternity.<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The Saints shall be for ever with the Lord.</hi> And in all these respects, the Glory of the Redeemed, as far exceeds the Felicity of Man in the Creation, as Heaven, the bright Seat of it, is above the fading beauty of the <hi>terrestrial</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> Redeeming Love deserves our highest Admiration, and humble Acknowledgments. The illustration of it by several <hi>Considerations.</hi> God is infinitely amiable in Himself, yet his Love is transient to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 'Tis admirable in Creating and Preserving <hi>Man,</hi> more in <hi>Redeeming</hi> him and by the Death of his <hi>Son.</hi> The discovery of <hi>God's</hi> Love in our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> is the strongest persuasiue to <hi>Repentance.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> is ineffectual to produce real <hi>Repentance.</hi> The common benefits of <hi>Providence</hi> are insuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cient to cause <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> in the guilty Creature. The clear discovery of pardoning Mercy in the <hi>Gospel</hi> can only remove our Fears, and induce us to return to God. The transcendent Love of God should kindle in us a <hi>reciprocal</hi> Love to Him. His <hi>Excellency,</hi> and His ordinary <hi>Bounty</hi> to <hi>Mankind</hi> cannot prevail upon us to love Him. His <hi>Love</hi> to us in <hi>Christ</hi> only conquers our Hatred. Our <hi>Love</hi> to Him must be <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>superlative.</hi> The despising of Saving <hi>Mercy is</hi> the highest Provocation. It makes the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> of Men most just certain, and heavy.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. 'THis Redeeming Love deserves our highest Admiration, and most humble acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If we consider God aright, it may raise our wonder, that He is pleased to bestow kindness upon any <hi>created</hi> being. For in Him is all that is excellent and <hi>amiable</hi>; and 'tis <hi>essential</hi> to the <hi>Deity,</hi> to have the perfect knowledg of Himself, and perfect Love to Himself. His Love being proportioned to his Excellencies, the <hi>act</hi> is infinite, as the <hi>object:</hi> And
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42565:111"/>
the perfections of the Divine Nature, being equal to his Love, 'tis a just cause of admiration that 'tis not confined to himself, but is transient and goes forth to the Creature. When <hi>David</hi> looked up to the Heavens, and saw the Majesty of God written in Characters of light, he admires that Love which first <hi>made Man a litle lower then the Angels, and Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with Glory and Honour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 8.</note> and that providential care which is mindful of him, and visits him every moment. Such an inconceivable distance there is between God and Man, that 'tis wonderful, God will spend a thought upon us. <hi>Lord, what is Man that thou takest knowledge of him? or the Son of Man that thou makest account of him? Man is like to vanity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 144.</note> 
               <hi>his dayes are as a shadow that passeth away.</hi> His being in this world hath nothing firm, or solid; 'tis like a shadow, that depends upon a cause that is in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion, the light of the Sun, and is alwayes changing, till it vanishes in the darkness of the night. But if we consider Man in the quality of a sinner, and what God hath wrought for his recovery, we are overcome with amazement. All temporal favours are but foils to this miraculous Mercy, and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably below the least instance of it: without it all the priviledges we enjoy above inferior Creatures in this life, will prove aggravations of our future misery. God saw us in our degenerate state, destroyed by our selves, and yet, O Goodness truly Divine! he loved us so far, as to make the way for our recovery. High Mountains were to be levelled, and great depths to be filled up, before we could arrive at blessedness: all this God hath done. He hath brought the Curse of the guilty upon the innocent, and exposed his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son to the Sword of his Justice, to turn the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42565:112"/>
blow from us. What astonishing goodness is it, that God who is the Author and end of all things, should become the means of our Salvation? And by the lowest abasement? What is so worthy of admiration as that the Eternal should become mortal, that being in the form of God, he should take on him the form of a Servant, that the Judge of the World should be condemned by the guilty, that he should leave his Throne in Heaven to be nailed to the Cross, that the Prince of Life should taste of Death? These are the great Wonders which the Lord of Love hath performed, and all for sinful, miserable and unworthy Man, who deserved not the least drop of that Sweat and Blood he spent for him: and without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to himself, for what content can be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his felicity by a cursed Creature? Infinite Love, that is as admirable as saving! <hi>Love that passeth Knowledge!</hi> and is as much above our comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as desert. In natural things, admiration is the effect of ignorance, but here 'tis increased by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. For the more we understand the excellent Greatness of God, and the vileness of Man, the more we shall admire saving Mercy.</p>
            <p>And the most humble acknowledgments are due for it. When <hi>David</hi> told <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> that he should <hi>eat bread with him at his T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble continually,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 9.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>he bowed himself, and said, What is thy Servant, that thou shouldest look on such a dead Dog as I am?</hi> A speech ful of gratitude, and humility; yet he was of a Royal extraction, though at that time in a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. With a far greater sense of our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we should reflect upon that condescending Love, that provides the <hi>Bread of God</hi> for the food of our Souls, without which we had perisht for want. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:42565:112"/>
in that divine thanksgiving recorded in the Scripture, reflects upon his own meanness, and from that magnifies the favour of God towards him. <hi>Who am I, O Lord God? and what is my house,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.18.</note> 
               <hi>that thou hast brought me hitherto? and this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God, but thou hast spoken of thy Servants house, for a great while to come, and is this the manner of Man, O Lord God</hi>? if such humble and thankful acknowledgments were due for the Scepter of <hi>Israel,</hi> what is for the Crown of Heaven? and and that procured for us by the sufferings of the Son of God. Briefly, Goodness is the foundation of Glory, therefore the most solemn and affectionate Praise is to be rendered for transcendent Goodness, The consent of Heaven and Earth, is; <hi>in ascribing blessing, and honour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 5.13.</note> 
               <hi>and glory to him that sits on the Throne, and the Lamb for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Love of God discovered in our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the most powerful <hi>persuasive</hi> to Repentance. For the discovery of this we must consider, that real Repentance is the consequent of Faith, and always in proportion to it. Therefore, the <hi>Law</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents to us the Divine Purity and Justice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>allay</hi> of Mercy, can never work true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in a Sinner. When <hi>Conscience</hi> is under the strong conviction of guilt, and of Gods Justice as <hi>implacable,</hi> it causes a dreadful flight from him, and a <hi>retchless</hi> neglect of means. Despair hardens. Neither is the discovery of God in Nature, prevailing over the impenitent Hearts of men. 'Tis true, the visible frame of the World, and the continual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Providence, instruct Men in those <hi>prime</hi> Truths, the Being and Bounty of God to those that serve Him, and invite them to their Duty. <hi>God
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42565:113"/>
never left himself without a witness in any age:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4.17.</note> His Goodness is design'd <hi>To lead men to Repentance.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> aggravates the obstinacy of Men, that render'd that <hi>method</hi> entirely fruitless. But the Declaration of Gods Goodness in the <hi>Gospel</hi> is <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> more clear and powerful, than the silent reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by the works of Creation and Providence. For although the Patience and general Goodness of God offered some intimations that he is <hi>placable,</hi> yet not a sufficient support for a guilty and jealous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to rely on. The natural notion of Gods Justice is so deeply rooted in the <hi>Humane</hi> Soul, that till He is pleased to proclaim an <hi>Act of Grace</hi> and Pardon, on the conditions of Faith and Repentance, 'tis hardly possible that convinced Sinners should apprehend Him otherwise than an Enemy; and that all the common Benefits they enjoy, are but Provisions allowed in the <hi>interval</hi> between the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd by the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Execution of it at Death. Therefore God to overcome our fears, and to melt us into a compliance, hath given in the <hi>Scripture</hi> the highest assurance of his willingness to receive all <hi>relenting</hi> and <hi>returning</hi> Sinners. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposes the most solemn <hi>Oath</hi> to remove our suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions.<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note> 
               <hi>As I live, saith the Lord, I delight not in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.23.</note> 
               <hi>And have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord God: And not that he should return from his ways and live?</hi> The majesty and ardency of the <hi>Expressions</hi> testifie the truth and vehemency of his desire, so far as the Excellency of his Nature is capable to feel our Affections. And the Reason of it is clear; for the Conversion of a Sinner implies a thorough change in the Will and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42565:113"/>
Affections from Sin to Grace, and that is infinitely pleasing to Gods Holiness, and the giving of Life to the <hi>converted</hi> is most suitable to his Mercy. The <hi>Angels</hi> who are infinitly inferiour to Him in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, rejoyce in the Repentance and Salvation of Men; Much more God doth. There is an eminent difference between his inclinations to exercise Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Justice. He uses expressions of regret when He is constrained to punish.<note place="margin">Psal. 81.13. Hos. 11.8.</note> 
               <hi>O that my People had hearkned to me, and</hi> Israel <hi>had walked in my wayes. And how shall I give thee up,</hi> Ephraim? <hi>how shall I deliver thee,</hi> Israel? <hi>mine heart is turned within me:</hi> As a merciful Judg, that pities the Man when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Malefactor. But He dispenses Acts of Grace with pleasure, <hi>He pardons Iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.18.</note> 
               <hi>and passes by transgressions, because He delights in Mercy.</hi> 'Tis true, when Sinners are finally obdurate, God is pleased in their Ruine, for the honour of his Justice; yet, tis not in such a manner as in their Conversion and Life. He doth not invite Sinners to transgress, that He may condemn them: He is not pleased when they give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for the exercise of his Anger. And above all, we have the clearest and surest discovery of pardoning Mercy in the Death of Christ. For what stronger evidence can there be of God's readiness to pardon, than sending his Son into the World to be a Sacrifice for Sin, that Mercy without prejudice to his other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections might upon our Repentance forgive us? And what more rational argument is there, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the Breast of a Man, to work in him a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grief and hearty detestation of Sin, not only as a cursed thing, but as 'tis contrary to the Divine Will, than the belief that God, in whose Power alone
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42565:114"/>
it is to pardon Sinners, is most desirous to pardon them, if they will return to Obedience? The Prodigal in his extream distress resolved to go to his Father with penitential acknowledgments and submission: and, to use the words of a devout Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, His guilty Conscience as desperate asks him, <hi>Qua spe,</hi> with what hope?

That Parable represents Man in his degenerate forlorn state, and that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodness is the Motive that prevails upon him to return to his duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The transcendent Love that God hath exprest in our Redemption by Christ, should kindle in us a reciprocal affection to him. For what is more natural than that one flame should produce another? <hi>We love him, because he loved us first.</hi> The original of our Love to God is from the evidence of his to us: this alone can strongly and sweetly draw the heart to him. 'Tis true, the divine excellencies as they deserve a superlative esteem, so the highest affection: but the bare contemplation of them is ineffectual to fire the Heart with a zealous Love to God. For Man in his Corrupt state hath a <hi>Diabolical</hi> Seed in him; he is inclined not only to Sensuality, which is an <hi>implicit</hi> hatred of God, (for an eager Appetite to those things which God forbids, and a fixed Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation from what He commands, are the Natural effects of Hatred,) But to malignity and direct ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred against God.<note place="margin">Col. 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>He is an enemy in his mind through
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42565:114"/>
wicked Works:</hi> and this enmity ariseth from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of Gods Justice, and the effects of it. Man cannot Sin and be happy, therefore he wishes there were no God to whom he must be accountable. He is no more wrought on by the Divine perfections and beauties to love the Deity, than a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who resolvedly goes on to break the Laws, can be perswaded to love the Judge, for his excellent knowledg, and his inflexible integrity, who will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly condemn him. Besides, the great and abundant blessings, which God, as Creator, and Preserver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon all, cannot prevail upon guilty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to love him. Indeed the goodness that raised us from a state of nothing, is unspeakably great, and layes an Eternal Obligation upon us. The whole stock of our affections is due to Him, for conferring upon us the humane Nature, that is common to Kings and the meanest Beggar. All the Riches and Dignity of the greatest Prince, whereby he exceeds the poorest Wretch, compared to this benefit which they both share in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have no more proportion than a Farthing to an immense Treasure. The Innumerable Expressions of God's Love to us every Day should infinitely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear Him to us. For who is so inhumane as not to love his Parents, or his Friend, who defended him from his deadly Enemies, or relieved him in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, especially if the vein of his bounty be not dryed up, but alwayes diffuses it self in new favours? If we love the memory of that Emperour, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon one day that past without his bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some benefit, with grief said, <hi>Diem perdidi,</hi> I have lost a day; how much more should we love God who every moment bestows innumerable blessings upon his Creatures. But sinful Man hath contracted such
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42565:115"/>
an unnatural hardness, that he receives no impressions from the renewed Mercies of God. He violates the Principles of Nature, and Reason. For how unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural is it, not to love our Benefactour, when the dull Ox and the stupid Ass serve those that feed them? and how unreasonable, when the Publicans return love for love? Now there is nothing that can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly overcome our hatred, but the consideration of that Love, which hath freed us from Eternal Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for the guilty Creature will be alwayes suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that notwithstanding the ordinary benefits of Providence, God is an enemy to it: and till Man is convinced, that in loving God, he most truly loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he will never sincerely affect him. This was one great design of God in the Way, as well as in the Work of our Redemption, to gain our hearts intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to himself. He saves us in the most endearing, and obliging manner. As <hi>Davids</hi> affection declared its self, <hi>I will not serve the Lord with that which cost me nothing:</hi> So God would not save Man with that which cost him nothing, but with the dearest price hath purchased a Title to our Love. <hi>God was in Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the World to himself,</hi> as well as through Christ reconciling himself to the World. He hath propounded such Arguments for our Love, so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and sublime, that <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocence was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. He sent down his own Bowels to testifie His Affection to us. And that should be the greatest indearment of our Love, which was the greatest evidence of his.</p>
            <p>And if we consider the Person of our Redeemer, what more worthy object of our affection than Christ? And Christ dying with all the circumstances of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and pain, and dying thus for Love, and this
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42565:115"/>
Love terminated on Man. If He had no attractive excellencies in himself, yet his dying for us should make him infinitely precious and dear to our Souls. He is more amiable on the Cross, than in the Throne: For there we see the clearest Testimony, and the most Glorious Triumph of his Love. There he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Anger of Heaven, and the scorn of the Earth. There we might see Joy sadned, Faith fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Salvation suffering, and Life dying.<note place="margin">Quid violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius triumphat de Deo? Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas in Christo laetari tristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, pavere fidem, salutem pati, vitam mori.</note> Blessed Redeemer, what couldst thou have done or Suffered more, to quicken our dead Powers, and inflame our cold Hearts toward thee? How can we remember thy bleeding, dying Love without an Extasy of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? If we are not more insensible than the Rocks, 'tis impossible but we must be toucht and softened by it.</p>
            <p>Suppose an Angel by special delegation had been enabled to have <hi>trod Satan under our feet,</hi> our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him had been inexpressible, and our love might have been intercepted from ascending to our Creator. For Salvation is a greater benefit, than the meer giving to us our natural being. As the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of felicity with the actual misery that is joyned with it, is infinitely worse than the negation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Our Lord pronounced concerning <hi>Judas;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.24.</note> 
               <hi>It had been good for that Man that he had never been born.</hi> Redeeming Goodness exceeds creating. Now the Son of God that he might have our highest Love, alone wrought Salvation for us.</p>
            <p>And what admirable Goodness is it, that he puts a value upon our affection, and accepts such a small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn! our most intense and ardent love bears no more proportion to his, than a spark to the Element of Fire. Besides, His Love to us was pure, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42565:116"/>
without any benefit to himself; but ours to him is profitable to our Souls, for their eternal advantage. Yet with this He is fully satisfied; when we love Him in the quality of a Saviour, we give Him the Glory of that he designs most to be Glorified in, that is, of his Mercy to the miserable. For this reason he instituted the Sacrament of the Supper, the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his Love, to refresh the memory of his Death, and quicken our fainting love to him. Now the Love that our Saviour requires must be.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sincere and Unfeigned. This declares it self by a care to please Him in all things. <hi>If a Man love me, saith our Saviour, he will keep my Commandments.</hi> Obedience is the most natural and necessary product of Love. For Love is the spring of Action, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys all the faculties in the service of the person lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>·</note> The Apostle expresses the force of it by an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical Word, <hi>The Love of Christ constrains us</hi>: it signifies to have one bound, and so much under power that he cannot move without leave. As the inspired Prophets were carried by the Spirit, and intirely acted by his motions.<note place="margin">Act. 18.5.</note> Such an absolute Empire had the Love of Christ over him, ruling all the inclinations of his Heart, and actions of his Life. 'Tis this alone makes Obedience chearful, and constant. For Love is seated in the Will, and the Obedience that proceeds from it, is out of choice, and purely voluntary. <hi>No Commandment is grievous that is performed from Love.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3.</note> And it makes Obedience constant: that which is forced from the impression of fear is unsteadfast; but what is mixt with delight is lasting.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Love to Christ must be supreme, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is given to all inferiour <hi>Objects.</hi> The most elevated and entire Affection is due to Him who
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42565:116"/>
saves us from Torments that are extreme and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and bestows upon us an Inheritance immortal and undefiled. Life it self and all the endearments of it, Relations, Estates are to be disvalued, when set in comparison with Him. Nay if (by an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble supposition) they could be separated, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our should be more dear to us than Salvation. For He declared greater Love in giving Himself for our Ransom, than in giving Heaven to be our Reward. When we love Him in the highest degree we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, we have reason to mourn for the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it. In short, A <hi>Superlative</hi> Love as 'tis due to our Redeemer, so 'tis only accepted by Him. <hi>He that loveth father or mother, son or daughter more than Him, is not worthy of Him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> And He tells us in other places that we must <hi>hate them,</hi> to shew, that this Love should so far exceed the Affection that is due to those persons, that in all occasions where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey divide from Christ, we should demean our selves as if we had only for them an indifference, and even an aversation. Indeed the preferring of any thing before Him, who is altogether desirable in Himself, and infinitely deserves our Love, is <hi>brutishly</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue Him, and in effect not to love Him. For in a Temptation where Christ and the beloved object are set in competition; as a greater weight turns the <hi>Scales,</hi> so the stronger Affection will cause a person to renounce Christ, for the possession of what he loves better. 'Tis the Love of Christ reigning in the Heart, that is the only Principle of Perseverance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What an high Provocation is it to despise Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Mercy, and to defeat that infinite Goodness which hath been at such expence for our Recovery? The Son of God hath emptied all the Treasures of his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42565:117"/>
Love, to purchase Deliverance for guilty and wretched Captives, He hath past through so many pains and thorns to come and offer it to them; He sollicits them to receive Pardon and Liberty, upon the conditions of Acceptance and Amendment, which are <hi>absolutely</hi> necessary to qualifie them for Felicity: Now if they slight the Benefit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Redemption; if they sell themselves again under the Servitude of Sin, and gratifie the Devil with a new conquest over them; what a bloody Cruelty is this to their own Souls, and a vile indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the Lord of Glory? And are there any <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> spirits so charm'd with their misery, and so in love with their chains, who will stoop under their cruel Captivity, to be reserved for eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Who can believe it? But alas Examples are numerous and ordinary: The most by a Folly as prodigious as their Ingratitude, prefer their Sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Saviour, and love that which is the only just object of Hatred, and hate Him who is the most worthy object of Love. 'Tis a most astonishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that Love should persuade Christ to die for Men, and that they should trample upon his Blood, and choose rather to die by themselves, than to live by Him. That God should be so easie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and Man so hard to be forgiven. This is a Sin of that transcendent height, that all the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> are not equal to it. This exasperates Mercy, that dear and tender Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; the only Advocate in God's Bosom for us: This makes the Judge irreconcilable. The rejecting of life upon the gracious terms of the Gospel, makes the condemnation of Men most just, certain, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:42565:117"/>1. Most Just: for when Christ hath performed what was necessary for the expiation of sin, and hath opened the Throne of Grace, which was before shut against us, and by this God hath declared how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he is to save Sinners; if they are wilful to be damned, and frustrate the blessed methods of Grace, 'tis most equal they should inherit their own choice: <hi>They judge themselves unworthy of Eternal Life.</hi> Conscience will justifie the severest doom against them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It makes their condemnation certain, and final. The Sentence of the Law is reversible by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to an Higher Court; but that of the Gospel against the refusers of Mercy will remain in its full force for ever. <hi>He that believes not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>is condemn'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</hi> 'Tis some consolation to a Malefactor, that the Sentence is not pronounced against him: but an unbeliever hath no respite. The Gospel assures the sincere Believer, that <hi>he shall not enter into Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to prevent his fears of an after sentence, but it denounces a present doom, against those who reject it. <hi>The Wrath of God abides on them.</hi> Obstinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity sets beyond all possibility of Pardon: <hi>there is no Sacrifice for that Sin.</hi> Salvation is self cannot save the impenitent Infidel: For he excludes the only means whereby Mercy is conveyed. How despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate then is the case of such a Sinner? To what Sanctuary will he fly? all the other Attributes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, Holiness excites Justice, and Justice awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens Power for his destruction; and if Mercy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not between him and ruin, he must perish ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably. <hi>Who ever loves not the Lord Christ is Anathema Maranatha</hi>; He is under an irrevocable
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42565:118"/>
Curse, which the Redeemer will confirm at his coming.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wilful neglect of Redeeming Mercy aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the Sentence, and brings an extraordinary damnation upon Sinners. Besides the doom of the Law which continues in its vigour against transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, the Gospel adds a more heavy one against the impenitent, <hi>because he beleives not in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> Infidelity is an outrage not to a Man or an Angel,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.18.</note> but to the Eternal Son. For the Redemption of Souls is reckoned as a part of his reward, <hi>He shall see of the travel of his soul and be satisfied.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53.</note> Those therefore that spurn at Salvation, deny him the honour of his sufferings: and are guilty of the defiance of his Love, of the contempt of his Clemency, of the provocation of the most sensible and severe Attribute when 'tis incensed. This is to strike him at the Heart, and to kick against his Bowels.<note place="margin">Ut dènuò ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, recuperata praeda sua, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num gaudeat. <hi>Tertul.</hi> de <hi>Poen</hi>
               </note> This increases the anguish of his sufferings, and imbitters the Cup of his Passion. This renews his Sorrows, and makes his Wounds bleed afresh. Ingrateful Wretches! that refuse to bring Glory to their Redeemer, and blessedness to themselves: that rather chuse that the accuser should triumph in their misery,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.19.</note> then their Saviour rejoyce in their felicity. <hi>This is the great condemnation, that Christ came into the World</hi> to exempt Men from Death, and they refuse the Pardon. 'Tis an aggravation of sin above what the Devils are capable of, for Pardon was never offered to those rebellious spirits. In short, so deadly a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity there is in it, that it poysons the Gospel it self, and turns the sweetest Mercy into the sorest Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Sun of Righteousness who is a reviving
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42565:118"/>
light to the penitent Believer, is a consuming Fire to the obdurate. How much more tolerable had been the condition of such Sinners, if saving Grace had never appeared unto Men, or they had never heard of it? for the Degrees of Wrath shall be in proportion to the riches of neglected goodness. The refusing Life from Christ, makes us guilty of his Death. And when he shall come in his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and be visible to all that Pierced Him, what Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will be the portion of those who despised the Majesty of his Person, the mystery of his Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Sufferings? Those that lived and dyed in the darkness of Heathenism, shall have a cooler Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in Hell, then those who neglect the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> Divine <hi>Justice</hi> concurs with <hi>Mercy</hi> in the work of our <hi>Redemption.</hi> The <hi>Reasons</hi> why we are <hi>Redeemed</hi> by the Satisfaction of <hi>Justice</hi> are specified: to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Gods hatred of Sin, to vindicate the honour of the <hi>Law,</hi> to prevent the secure commission of Sin. These <hi>Ends</hi> are obtained in the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> The reality of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made to Divine <hi>Justice</hi> considered. The <hi>requisites</hi> in order to it. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, who in this <hi>transaction</hi> is to be considered not as a <hi>Judg,</hi> that is Minister of the <hi>Law,</hi> but as Governour. His right of <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> to <hi>relax</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> as to the execution of it. His <hi>Will</hi> declared to accept of the <hi>compensation</hi> made. The <hi>consent</hi> of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> was necessary. He must be perfectly <hi>Holy.</hi> He must be <hi>God</hi> and Man.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe <hi>Deity</hi> in it self is <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Pure,</hi> without mixture or variety: The <hi>Scripture</hi> ascribes Attributes to God for our clearer understanding. And those as <hi>essential</hi> in Him are simply <hi>one:</hi> They are distinguish'd only with respect to the diverse objects on which they are terminated, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>effects</hi> that proceed from them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>two</hi> great Attributes which are exercised to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reasonable Creatures in their <hi>lapsed</hi> state, are Mercy and Justice: these admirably concur in the work of our Redemption. Although God spared guilty Man for the honour of his Mercy, yet He <hi>spared not his own Son,</hi> who became a Surety for the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42565:119"/>
offender, but delivered Him up to a cruel Death, for the glory of his Justice. For the clearer understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this, <hi>three</hi> things are to be considered;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Reasons why we are redeemed by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Justice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Reality of the Satisfaction made by our Redeemer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The compleatness and perfection of it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>first</hi> there are <hi>three</hi> different Opinions, among those who acknowledge the reality of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That 'tis not possible that Sin should be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned without Satisfaction. For Justice being a natural and necessary excellency in God, hath an unchangable respect to the qualities which are in the Creatures: That as the Divine Goodness is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily exercised towards a Creature perfectly holy, so Justice is in punishing the guilty, unless a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction intervene. And if it be not possible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the perfection of the Deity, that Holiness should be unrewarded, far less can it be, that Sin should be unpunisht: since the exercise of Justice, upon which Punishment depends, is more necessary than that of Goodness, which is the cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration. For the Rewards which Bounty dispenses are pure Favours, whereas the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Justice inflicts, are due. In short, Since Justice is a Perfection, 'tis in God in a <hi>supreme</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and being infinite 'tis inflexible. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is asserted by several Divines of eminent Learning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Opinion is, That God by his <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> Dominion and Prerogative, might have releas'd the Sinner from Punishment without any Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42565:120"/>
For as by his Sovereignty He transfer'd the Punishment from the guilty to the innocent; so He might have forgiven Sin, if no Redeemer had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed. From hence it follows, that the Death of Christ for the Expiation of Sin was necessary only with respect to the Divine Decree.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Third</hi> Opinion is, That considering God in this transaction as qualified with the Office of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judg and Governor of the World, who hath given just Laws to direct his Creatures in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and to be the rule of his proceedings with them as to Rewards and Punishments, He hath so far restrain'd the exercise of his Power, that upon the breach of the Law, either it must be executed upon the Sinner, or if extraordinarily dispenst with, it must be upon such terms as may secure the Ends of Government: and those are His own Honour, and publick Order, and the Benefit of those that are governed. And upon these accounts 'twas requisite, supposing the merciful design of God to pardon Sin, that his Righteousness should be declared in the Sufferings of Christ. I will distinctly open this.</p>
            <p>In the Law the Sovereignty and Holiness of God eminently appear: And there are <hi>two</hi> things in all Sins, which expose the Offender justly to Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Contempt of God's Sovereignty, and in that respect there is a kind of equality between them. <hi>He that offends in one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2.10.</note> 
               <hi>is guilty of all,</hi> they being ratified by the same Authority. And from hence 'tis, that Guilt is the natural Passion of Sin, that alwaies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to it. For as God hath a Judicial Power to inflict Punishment upon the Disobedient by vertue of his Soveraignty, so the desert of Punishment
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42565:120"/>
arises from the despising it in the violation of his Commands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In every Sin there is a contrariety to Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. And in this the natural <hi>turpitude</hi> of Sin consists, which is <hi>receptive</hi> of degrees. From hence arises Gods hatred of Sin, which is as <hi>essential</hi> as his Love to Himself: the infinite Purity and Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Nature, infers the most perfect abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of whatever is opposite to it.<note place="margin">Psal. 11.5, 7.</note> 
               <hi>The righteous Lord loves righteousness, but the wicked his soul hates.</hi> Now the Justice of God is founded in his Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and his Holiness, and the reason why 'tis exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised against Sin, is not an arbitrary Constitution, but his Holy Nature, to which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sin is <hi>repugnant.</hi> These things being premised, it follows, That God in the relation of a Governor is Protector of those Sacred Laws, which are to direct the Reasonable Creature. And as 'twas most reasonable that in the first giving the Law, He should lay the strongest restraint upon Man for preventing Sin, by the threatning of Death, the greatest evil in it self, and in the estimation of Mankind; so 'tis most congruous to Reason, when the command was broke by Mans Rebellion, that the <hi>Penalty</hi> should be inflicted either on his Person, according to the immediate intent of the Law, or something <hi>equivalent</hi> should be done, that the Majesty and Purity of God might appear in his Justice, and there might be a visible discovery of the value He puts on Obedience.</p>
            <p>The life of the Law depends upon the execution of it: for impunity extenuates Sin in the account of Men, and incourages to the free commission of it. If Pardon be easily obtained, Sin wil be easily committed. The first temptation was prevalent by this perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42565:121"/>
that no punishment would follow. Besides, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bold violation of the Law no punishment were inflicted, not only the glory of God's Holiness would be obscured, as if He did not love Righteousness and hate Sin, but suffered the contempt of the one, and the commission of the other without controul; but it would either reflect upon His Wisdom, as if He had not upon just reason establisht an alliance between the Offence and the Penalty: or upon His Power, as if He were not able to vindicate the Rights of Heaven. And after His giving a Law, and declaring the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of it, He would dispense Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments, if Sin were unrevenged, it would lessen the sacredness of his Truth in the esteem of Men. So that the Law, and Lawgiver would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to contempt. By all which it appears, that the Honour of God was infinitely concerned in His requiring satisfaction for the breach of his Laws.</p>
            <p>Temporal Magistrates are bound to execute wise and equal Laws, for the preservation of publick order, and civil societies. 'Tis true, there be some cases wherein the Lawgiver may be forced to dispense with the Law, as when the sparing of an offender is more advantage to the State than his punishment: Besides, there is a superior Tribunal to which great Offenders are obnoxious, and good Magistrates, when through weakness they are fain to spare the guilty, refer them to God's Judgment. But 'tis otherwise in the Divine Government: For God is <hi>infinitely</hi> free from any necessity of Compliance. There is no <hi>exigency</hi> of Government that requires, that any Offenders should escape his Severity. Neither is there any Justice above his, which might exact Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of them. Besides, the Majesty of his Laws
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42565:121"/>
is more Sacred than of those which preserve <hi>Earthly</hi> States, and ought to be more inviolable. The sum is, to declare God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s hatred of Sin which is essential to his nature, to preserve the honour of the Law which otherwise would be securely despised, to prevent sin by keeping up in Men an holy fear to offend God, which should be an eternal respect of the rational Creature to Him, 'twas most fit, that the presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous breach of Gods Command should not be unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. Now when the Son of God was made a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sin, and by a bloody Death made expiation of it, the World is convinced, how infinitely hateful Sin is to him, the dignity of the Law is maintained, and Sin is most effectually discouraged. There is the same terror, though not the same rigor, as if all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had been finally condemned. Thus it appears how becoming God it was, to accomplish our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in such a manner, that Justice and Mercy are revealed in their most noble and eminent effects, and operations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reality of the satisfaction made to Divine Justice is next to be proved. This is the center, and heart of the Christian Religion, from whence all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and comforting influences are derived: and for the opening of it, I will first consider the requisites in order to it: which are</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Appointment of God, whose Power and Will are to be considered in this transaction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Power: for 'tis an act of supremacy to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the sufferings of another should be effectual to redeem the offender. God doth not in this affair sustain the Person of a Judge, that is the Minister of the Law, and cannot free the guilty by transferring
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42565:122"/>
the punishment on another, but is to be considered as Governour, who may by pure Jurisdiction dispense in the execution of the Law, upon those consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations which fully answer the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Law is not executed according to the Letter of it, for then no sinner can be saved: but repenting Believers are free from condemnation. Nor is it abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, for then no obligation remains as to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or penalty of it: but Men are still bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it, and impenitent Infidels are still under the Curse: <hi>The Wrath of God abides upon them.</hi> But 'tis relaxt as to the punishment, by the merciful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension of the Lawgiver.</p>
            <p>Some Laws are not capable of relaxation in their own nature: because there is included moral iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the relaxation. As the commands to love God, and obey Conscience, can never lose their binding force. 'Tis an universal rule that suffers no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God cannot deny himself; therefore he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allow sin, that directly opposes the perfections of His Nature. Besides, some Laws cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxt <hi>ex hypothesi,</hi> upon the account of the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree which makes them irrevocable, as that all who die in their impenitency shall be damned. Now there was no express sign annext to the Sanction of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law, to intimate, that it should be unalterable as to the letter of it. The threatning declared the desert of Sin in the Offender, and the right of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing in the Superior; but 'tis so to be understood, as not to frustrate the power of the Law-giver, to relax the punishment upon wise and just reasons.</p>
            <p>The Law did neither propound, nor exclude this
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42565:122"/>
expedient: for judging without passion against the Sinner, it is satisfied with the punishment of the Crime. For 'tis not the evil of the sufferer that is primarily designed by the Law, but the preservation of publick order, for the honour of the Lawgiver, and the benefit of those that are subjects. So that the relaxing the punishment, as to the person of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by compensation, fully answers the intent of the Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As by the right of Jurisdiction God might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax the Law, and appoint a Mediatour to interpose by way of Ransom, so he hath declared his will to accept of Him. The Law in strictness obliged the Sinning person to suffer, so that he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused any other Satisfaction. Therefore the whole Work of our Redemption is referred to His Will as the primary cause.<note place="margin">John 3.17.</note> Our Saviour <hi>was sent into the World</hi> by the order of God: <hi>He was sealed,</hi> that is, authorised for that great Work by commission from Him. He was called to His Office, by the <hi>voice of his Father from heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3.17. Act. 10.38..</note> 
               <hi>Thou art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.</hi> God <hi>anointed him with the Holy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Ghost, and with Power,</hi> which signifies as the enduing of Him with the Graces of the Spirit, so the investing Him in the dignity of Mediator, as Kings, Priests, and Prophets were. And both were necessary: for his Graces without his Office are unprofitable to us, and His Office without His capacity, of no advantage. In short, the Apostle observes this as the peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the New Covenant, and the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our hopes, that the Mediatour was constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a solemn Oath, <hi>The Lord hath sworn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7.21.</note> 
               <hi>and will not repent, thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:42565:123"/>2. The Consent of our Redeemer was necessary, that he might by Sufferings satisfie for us. For being the <hi>Lord from Heaven,</hi> there was no Superiour Authority to command, or Power to compel him. 'Tis true, having become our Surety, 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary He should be accountable to the Law: But the first undertaking was most free. When one hath entred into Bonds to pay the Debt of an insolvent person, he must give satisfaction; but 'tis an act of liberty and choice to make himself liable.<note place="margin">Luk. 24.46.</note> Our Saviour tells us, <hi>It behoved Christ to suffer;</hi> he doth not say that the Son of God should suffer, but that Christ. This Title signifies the same Person in substance, but not in the same respect and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Christ is the <hi>Second</hi> Person cloathed with our Nature. There was no necessity that obliged God to appoint his Son, or the Son to accept the Office of Mediator; But when the Eternal Son had undertook that charge, and was made Christ, that is, assumed our Nature in order to redeem us, 'twas necessary that He should suffer.</p>
            <p>Besides, His Consent was necessary upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account. For the Satisfaction doth not arise meerly from the Dignity of his Person, but from the Law of substitution, whereby He put himself in our stead, and voluntarily obliged Himself to suffer the Punishment due to us. The efficacy of his Death is by vertue of the Contract between the Father and Him, of which there could be no cause but pure Mercy, and His voluntary Condescension.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Scripture</hi> declares the willingness of Christ, particularly at his entrance into the World,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42565:123"/>
and at his Death. Upon His comming into the World, He begins his Life by the <hi>internal</hi> Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Himself to his Father; <hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened:</hi> that is, He entirely resigned himself to be Gods Servant, <hi>Burnt-Offering and Sin-Offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>in the volume of thy book 'tis written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God, yea thy Law is within my heart.</hi> He saw the Divine Decree, and embrac'd it; the Law was in his Heart, and fully possest all his Thoughts and Affections, and had a commanding influence upon his Life. And his Willingness was fully exprest by Him, when He approacht to His last Sufferings. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though He declin'd Death as Man, having natural and innocent desires of Self-Preservation, yet as Mediator he readily submitted to it. <hi>Not my Will, but thine be done,</hi> was his voice in the Garden. And this argued the compleatness and fixedness of his Will, that notwithstanding his aversation from Death <hi>absolutely</hi> considered, yet with an unabated election He still chose it as the means of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No involuntary Constraint was laid upon him, to force him to that submission; But the sole causes of it were his free Compliance with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will, and his tender Compassion towards Men. He saith, <hi>I have power to lay down my life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 10.18.</note> 
               <hi>and power to take it up; this command I received of my Father.</hi> In his Death, Obedience and Sacrifice were united. The <hi>Typical</hi> Sacrifices were led to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but the Lamb of God presented Himself:<note place="margin">Gal. 1.4. Tit. 2.14.</note> 'tis said, <hi>He gave himself for us,</hi> to signifie his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in dying. Now the Freeness of our Redeemer
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42565:124"/>
in dying for us, qualified his Sufferings to be <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note> The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that <hi>By the obedience of one many are made righteous</hi>: that is, By his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Sufferings we are justified: for without his Consent, his Death could not have the respect of a punishment for our Sins. No Man can be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to pay anothers Debt, unless he make himself Surety for it. <hi>Briefly,</hi> The Appointment of God, and the Undertaking of Christ, to redeem us from the Curse of the Law by his suffering it, are the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>New-Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He that interpos'd as Mediator must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Holy, otherwise he had been liable to Justice for his own Sin. And guilty Blood is impure and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, apter to stain by its effusion and sprinkling, than to purge away Sin. The <hi>Apostle</hi> joins these <hi>two</hi> as inseparable,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>He appeared to take away Sin, and in Him is no sin.</hi> The <hi>Priesthood</hi> under the <hi>Law</hi> was imperfect; as for other reasons, so for the sins of the Priests. <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>first</hi> and chief of the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Order, was guilty of gross Idolatry, so that Reconciliation could not be obtained by their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry: For how can one Captive ransom another, or Sin expiate Sin? But our Mediator was absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innocent, without the least tincture of Sin <hi>original,</hi> or <hi>actual.</hi> He was conceived in a miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, infinitely distant from all the impurities of the earth. That which is produced in an ordinary way receives its propriety from <hi>second</hi> Causes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the defilement that cleaves to the whole <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi> Whatever <hi>is born of blood, and the will of the flesh,</hi> that is form'd of the substance of the Flesh, and by the <hi>sensual</hi> Appetite is defiled: but though He
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42565:125"/>
was form'd of the substance of the Virgin, yet by vertue of an Heavenly Principle, according to the words of the Angel to her, <hi>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 1.35.</note> 
               <hi>and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy thing that shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</hi> He came in the appearance <hi>only of sinful flesh.</hi> As the <hi>Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> had the figure,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> and not the poison of the fiery Serpent. He was without <hi>actual</hi> Sin; He foil'd the Tempter in all his <hi>arts</hi> and <hi>methods</hi> wherewith he tried Him. He resisted the Lust of the Flesh, by refusing to make the stones Bread to asswage his Hunger; and the Lust of the Eyes, in despising the Kingdoms of the World with all their Treasures; and the Pride of Life, when he would not throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self down, that by the interposing of Angels for His rescue, there might be a visible proof that He was the Son of God. The Accuser himself confest Him to be the <hi>Holy One of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 1.24.</note> he found no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption within Him, and could draw nothing out of him. <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed him, and <hi>Pilate</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, acknowledged his Innocence. He perfectly fulfill'd the Law, and did alwaies <hi>what pleased his Father.</hi> In the midst of his Sufferings, no irregular motion disturbed his Soul, but He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies exprest the highest Reverence to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Charity to Men. He was compared to a Lamb, (for his Passion and his Patience) that quietly dies at the foot of the Altar.</p>
            <p>Besides, We may consider in our Mediator not only a perfect freedom from Sin, but an impossibility that he should be toucht by it. The <hi>Angelical</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was liable to folly; but the <hi>Humane</hi> Nature by its intimate and unchangeable Union with the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42565:126"/>
Divine is establisht above all possibility of Falling. The Deity is Holiness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> self, and by its personal presence, is a greater preservative from sin, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vision of God in Heaven, or the most perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent habit of Grace. Our Saviour tells us <hi>the Son can do nothing of himself,</hi> but according to <hi>the pattern the Father sets him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 5.19.</note> Now the perfect Holiness of our Redeemer hath a special efficacy in making his Death to be the expiation of Sin, as the Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently declares.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>For such an high Priest became us who is holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners. And he that knew no sin, was made sin for us, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi>

               <hi>and without spot. And by his knowledg shall my righteous Servant justifie many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Twas requisite the Mediator should be God and Man. He must assume the nature of Man, that he might be put in his stead in order to make satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him. He was to be our representative, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such a conjunction between us must be, that God might esteem all his People to suffer in him. By the Law of <hi>Israel</hi> the right of Redemption belonged to him that was next in blood: Now Christ took the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the original element of our nature, that having a right of Propriety in us as God, He might have a right of Propinquity as Man. He was allied to all Men, as Men: that His suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings might be universally beneficial. And He must be God: 'tis not his Innocency onely, or Deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Dignity of His Person that qualifies Him to be an all-sufficient Sacrifice for Sin, so that God may dispense pardon, in a way that is honourable to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42565:126"/>
Justice. For Justice requires a proportion between the Punishment and the Crime: and that receives its quality from the dignity of the person offended. Now since the Majesty of God is infinite against whom sin is committed, the guilt of it can never be expiated but by an infinite Satisfaction. There is no <hi>name under Heaven, nor in Heaven</hi> that could save us, but the Son of God,<note place="margin">Act. 4.12.</note> who being equal to Him in greatness, became Man.</p>
            <p>If there had been such compassion in the Angels as to have inclined them, to interpose between Justice and us, they had not been qualified for that Work: not only upon the account of their different nature, so that by substitution they could not satisfie for us; nor that being immaterial substances, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the dominion of death, which was the punishment denounc'd against the sinner, and to which his Surety must be subjected: but principally that being finite Creatures they are incapable to atone an incensed God. Who among all their glorious Orders durst appear before so consuming a fire? who could have been an Altar whereon to sanctifie a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Divine Justice? no meer Creature how worthy so ever could propitiate the supreme Majesty when justly provoked. Our Redeemer was to be the Lord of Angels. The Apostle tells us that it <hi>pleased the Father that in him all fulness should dwell.</hi> This respects not his original Nature, but his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the reason of it is, <hi>to reconcile by the blood of the Cross, things in Heaven, and in the Earth.</hi> From the greatness of the Work we may infer the quality of the means, and from the quality of the means, the Nature of the Person that is to perform it. Peace with God who was provoked by our Rebellion, could
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42565:127"/>
only be made by an infinite Sacrifice. Now in Christ the Deity it self, not its influences, and the fulness of it, not any particular perfection only, dwelt really and substantially. God was present in the Ark in a shadow, and representation; He is present in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by his sustaining Power, and in his Saints by special favour, and the eminent effects, the Graces and Comforts that proceed from it; but he is present in Christ in a singular and transcendent manner. The Humanity is related to the Word not only as a Creature to the Author of its being, for in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it hath an equal respect to all the persons, but by a peculiar conjunction: for 'tis actuated by the same subsistence as the Divine Essence is in the Son, but with this difference, the one is voluntary, the other necessary; the one is espoused by Love, the other received by Nature.</p>
            <p>Now from this intimate Union, there is a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the special qualities of both natures to the Person of Christ: Man is exalted to be the Son of God, and the Word abased to be the Son of Man. As by reason of the vital Union between the Soul and Body, the essential parts of Man, 'tis truly said that he is rational in respect of his soul, and mortal in respect of his body. This Union derives an infinite merit to the obedience of Christ. For the humane nature having its complement from the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, 'tis not the nature simply considered, but the person that is the fountain of actions. To illustrate this by an instance: the civil Law determines that a tree transplanted from one soile to another, and taking root there, it belongs to the owner of that ground; in regard that receiving nourishment from a new earth, it becomes as it were another tree, though
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42565:127"/>
there be the same individual root, the same body, and the same soul of vegetation as before. Thus the humane nature taken from the common mass of Mankind, and transplanted by personal Union into the Divine, is to be reckoned as intirely belonging to the Divine, and the actions proceeding from it are not meerly humane, but are raised above their natural worth, and become meritorious. One hour of Christs Life glorified God more, than an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duration spent by Angels and Men in the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of him. For the most perfect creatures are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and finite, and their services cannot fully correspond with the Majesty of God; but when the Word was made Flesh, and entered into a new state of subjection, he glorified God in a Divine manner and most worthy of him. He that <hi>comes from above, is above all.</hi> The all sufficiency of his Satisfaction arises from hence, <hi>He that was in the form of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3.31.</note> 
               <hi>and thought it no robbery to be equal with God</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.6.</note> in the truth of the Divine Nature He was equal with the Father, and without sacriledge, or usurpation possest Divine Honour, he became <hi>obedient to the Death of the Cross.</hi> The Lord <hi>of Glory was Crucified.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>We are purchased by the Blood of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> 
               <hi>And the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all Sin.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature gives it an infinite and everlasting effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>And 'tis observable, that the Socinians the declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemies of his Eternity, consentaneously to their first impious error, deny his Satisfaction. For if Jesus Christ were but a titular God, his Sufferings how deep soever, had been insufficient to expiate our offence: in His Death He had been only a Martyr, not a Mediator. For no Satisfaction can
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42565:128"/>
be made to Divine Justice, but by suffering that which is equivalent to the guilt of sin, which as 'tis infinite, such must the Satisfaction be.</p>

and perfect manner. No prejudice to the Freeness and Greatness of <hi>God's</hi> Love, that <hi>Christ</hi> by his <hi>Death</hi> reconciled Him to men.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving premised these things, I shall now prove that the Divine <hi>Justice</hi> is really declar'd and glorified in the obedient Sufferings of Christ. For the <hi>opening</hi> this <hi>point,</hi> 'tis necessary to consider the account the Scripture gives of his Death; which is <hi>threefold:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis represented under the relation of a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment inflicted on him for Sin, and the <hi>effect</hi> of it is Satisfaction to the Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As a Price to redeem us from Hell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Under the notion of a Sacrifice to reconcile God to Sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> As a Punishment inflicted on him for Sin. This will appear by considering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Man by his Rebellion against God was <hi>capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi> guilty: He stood sentenced by the Law to Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Christ with the allowance of the Supreme Judg, interposed as our Surety, and in that relation was made liable to Punishment. Sins are by <hi>resemblance</hi> called Debts. As a Debt obliges the Debtor to payment, so Sin doth the Sinner to Punishment. And as the Creditor hath a right to exact the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Debtor,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi> who with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clearness hath vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> from the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> of <hi>Crelli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e.</hi>
               </note> so God hath a right to inflict Punishment on the guilty. But with this difference, the Creditor by the meer signification of his will may discharge the Debtor, for he hath an absolute power over his estate: whereas publick Justice is concern'd in the Punishment of the guilty. This is evident by many instances. For 'tis not sufficient that a Criminal satisfie his Adversary, unless the Prince, who is the Guardian of the Laws, give him
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42565:129"/>
Pardon. The interest of a private Person, who hath received an injury, is so distinct from that of the State, that sometimes the injured party solicites the Pardon of the offender without success. Which shews that principally 'tis not to satisfie the particular person, that the Crime is punish'd, but to satisfie the Law, and prevent future Disorders.</p>
            <p>Now our Debt was not <hi>pecuniary</hi> but <hi>penal</hi>: And as in <hi>civil</hi> Cases, where one becomes Surety for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, he is obliged to pay the Debt, for in the <hi>estimate</hi> of the Law they are but one person; So the Lord Jesus Christ entring into this relation, He sustained the person of Sinners,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.22.</note> and became judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially one with them, and according to the order of Justice, was liable to their punishment. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God was <hi>primarily</hi> and directly against the Sinner, but the effects of it fell upon Christ, who undertook for him. The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, That <hi>when the Fulness of time came, God sent his Son, made under the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>that he might redeem them that were under the Law.</hi> He took our Nature &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: He was made under the Law <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial.</hi> The <hi>directive</hi> part of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law He fulfilled by the Innocency of his Life; the <hi>penalty</hi> he satisfied as our Surety, being under an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to save us. And he appeared as a Sinner in his subjection to the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> That <hi>Hand-writing was against us</hi>; He therefore enter'd into the Bond that we had forfeited. In his Circumcision He signed it with those drops of Blood, which were an earnest of his shedding the rest on the Cross. <hi>For whosoever was Circumcised, became a Debtor to the whole Law.</hi> And we may observe, 'tis said, That as <hi>Moses</hi> lifted up the brazen Serpent, so the Law
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42565:130"/>
of which <hi>Moses</hi> was a <hi>type</hi> and Minister, lifted up the <hi>Messiah</hi> on the Cross.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Scripture</hi> is very clear and express in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the part that God had in the Sufferings of Christ as Supreme Judg, the impulsive cause that moved Him, their proportion to the punishment of the Law, and the effect of them for our Deliverance. <hi>He was delivered by the determinate counsel and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.23.</note> All the various and vicious actions of men, were over-ruled by his Providence: The falsness of <hi>Judas,</hi> the fearfulness of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the malice of the <hi>Jews</hi> were subservient to Gods eternal design. And as He wills not the Death of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, much less of his Son, but for most weighty Reasons: these are declared by the Prophet, <hi>All we like sheep have gone astray, and turned every one to his own waies:</hi> Our Errours were different, but the issue was the same, that is, Eternal Death:<note place="margin">Isa. 53.6.</note> 
               <hi>And the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all:</hi> that is, the Punishment of our Iniquities. His Sufferings had such a respect to Sin, as included the imputation of it. 'Twas an act of Sovereignty in God to appoint Christ as Man to be our Surety, but an act of Justice to inflict the punishment, when Christ had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for us. 'Tis said, <hi>He hath born our griefs, and carried our sorrows.</hi> The expressions are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of all the Miseries of his Life, especially his last Sufferings.

Those
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42565:131"/>
words are full and pregnant to the same purpose: <hi>He was wounded for our transgressions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53.5.</note> 
               <hi>he was bruised for our Iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was on him, and with his stripes we are healed.</hi> Where the meritorious cause of his Sufferings is set down, as appears by the connexion of the words with the former. The <hi>Jews thought him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted</hi>; that is, justly punisht for Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and usurping Divine Honour. In opposition to this conceit 'tis added, <hi>But he was wounded for our transgressions.</hi> This the Apostle expresly telleth us, when he declares that <hi>Christ died for our Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will appear more fully, by considering what the desert of Sin is. By our Rebellion we made the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Soul &amp; Body to Divine Justice: Death, both the first and the second, was the Sentence of the Law. Now the Sufferings of Christ were answerable to this Punishment. The Death which the Law threatned for Sin, was to be accompanied with Dishonour and Pain. And he suffered the Death of the Cross to which a special Curse was annext. And this was not onely in respect of the Judgment of Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom a Crucified person was made a Spectacle of publick Vengeance for his Crimes, but in respect of Gods declaration concerning it. The Jews were commanded <hi>that none should hang on a Tree longer then the Evening</hi>;<note place="margin">Deut. 21.23.</note> lest the Holy Land should be profaned by that, which was an express mark of Gods Curse. Now the legal Curse was a Typical signification of the real, that should be suffered by our Redeemer. Besides, his Death was attended with exquisite pains: he suffer'd variety of torments, by the scourges, the thorns, the nails, that pierc'd his Hands and Feet, the least vital, but most sensible parts.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42565:131"/>
He refused the Wine mix'd with Myrrh, that was given to stupifie the senses; for the design of his Passion requir'd, that he should have the quickest sense of his Sufferings, which were the Punishment of Sin. And his inward Sorrows were equivalent to the pains of loss and sense that are due to Sinners. 'Tis true, there are circumstances in the Sufferings of the damn'd, as Blaspemy, Rage, Impotent fierceness of mind, which are not appointed by the Law, but are accidental arising from the perversness of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: For the punishment of the Law is a Physical evil, but these are Moral: and that punishment is inflicted by the Judge, but these are onely from the guilty Sufferers: Now to these he was not possibly liable. Besides, the Death that the Sinner ought to Suffer is Eternal, attended with despair, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable anguish of Conscience. Now our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer having no real Guilt, was not liable to the worm of Conscience, and his Temporary Sufferings were equivalent to the Eternal, upon the account of his Divine Person, so that he was not capable of Despair. But he endur'd the unknown ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the second Death, so far as was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the Perfection of his Nature. The anguish of his Soul was not meerly from sympathy with his Body, but immediately from Divine Displeasure. <hi>It pleased the Lord to bruise him:</hi> this principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the Impressions of Wrath made upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man.<note place="margin">Isa. 53.10.</note> Had the Cup he fear'd been onely Death, with the bitter ingredients of dishonour and pain, many have drank it with more appearing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. The Martyrs endured more cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without complaint; nay in their sharpest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts have exprest a triumphant joy. Whereas our
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42565:132"/>
Redeemer was under all the innocent degrees of fear and sorrow at the approach of his Sufferings. From whence was the difference? Had Christ less Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage? He was the Fountain of their Fortitude: the difference was not in the disposition of the Patients, but in the Nature of the Sufferings. He endured that which is infinitely more terrible than all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward torments. The Light of Joy that always shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Soul, a sweet Image of Heaven, was then totally eclips'd. God, the Fountain of Compassion, restrain'd himself; his Father appear'd a severe inexorable Judge, and dealt with him not as his Son, but our Surety. Under all the Cruelties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd by men, the Lamb of God open'd not his mouth, but when the <hi>Father of Mercies,</hi> and <hi>the God of all Consolations</hi> forsook him, then he broke forth into a mournful complaint. Now by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Christs Sufferings from Scripture, 'tis evident, they were truly penal; for they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for Sin, by the Supreme Judg, and were equivalent to the Sentence of the Law. And the benefit we receive upon their account, proves that they are satisfaction to Divine Justice, for we are exempted from Punishment, by his Submission to it. <hi>He freed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3 13. Isa. 53.5.</note> 
               <hi>The Chastisements of our Peace was upon him, by whose stripes we are healed.</hi> So that his Death being the Meritorious Cause of freeing the Guilty, is properly <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed to the second Consideration of Christs Death, I will briefly answer the Objection of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> viz. That 'tis a Violation of Justice to transfer the Punishment from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that the Righteous God could not Punish
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42565:132"/>
his innocent Son for our Sins. Now to show the invalidity of this Pretence we must consider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Justice is not an irregular appetite of Vengeance arising from Hatred that cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied but with the Destruction of the Guilty. It preserves Right with pure Affections, and is content when the Injury is repair'd, from whomsoever satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction comes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though an innocent person can't suffer as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent without Injustice, yet he may voluntarily contract an Obligation, which will expose him to deserved sufferings. The Wisdom and Justice of all Nations agree in punishing one for anothers fault, where consent is preceding, as in the case of Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And although it is Essential to the Nature of Punishment to be inflicted for Sin, yet not on the Person of the Sinner: for <hi>in Conspectu fori,</hi> the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Surety are one.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That exchange is not allowed in Criminal Causes where the Guilty ought to suffer in Person, 'tis not from any Injustice in the Nature of the thing, for then it would not be allowed in Civil; but there are special Reasons why an Innocent Person is not ordinarily admitted to suffer for an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No man hath absolute Power over his own life. 'Tis a <hi>depositum</hi> consigned to him for a time, and must be preserv'd till God, or the Publick good, calls for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Publick would suffer prejudice by the loss of a good Subject. Therefore the Rule of the Law is just, <hi>Non auditur perire volens.</hi> The desire of one that devotes himself to ruine is not to be heard. And the guilty person who is spared might grow
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42565:133"/>
worse by impunity, and cause great disorders by his evil example. But these considerations are of no force in the case of our Saviour: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He had full Power to dispose of his life: <hi>I have power to lay it down,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 10.18.</note> 
               <hi>and I have power to take it again: this Commandment have I received of my Father.</hi> He declares his Power as God, that his life intirely depended on his will, to preserve it, or part with it: and his subjection as Mediator to the order of his Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Saviour could not finally Perish. 'Twas not possible he should be <hi>held under the power of Death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2.24.</note> Otherwise it had been against the Laws of reason, that the precious should for ever suffer for the vile. Better ten thousand Worlds had been lost, than that the <hi>Holy One of God</hi> should perish. He saved us through his Sufferings, though as by fire: and had a glorious reward in the issue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is an infinite good redounds from his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: for Sinners are exempted from Death, and the preservation of the guilty is for the glory of Gods government: for those who are redeemed by his Death, are renewed by his Spirit. He covers their sins, that he may cure them. He is made <hi>Righteousness and Sanctification to his People.</hi> The serious belief that Christ by dying hath rescued us from Hell,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> produces a <hi>superlative</hi> Love to him, an ingenuous and grateful fear lest we should offend Him, an ambition to please Him in all things; <hi>briefly,</hi> Universal Obedience to his Will, as its most natural and necessary effect. So that in laying the punishment on Christ, under which Mankind must have sunk for ever, there is nothing against Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:42565:133"/>2. The Death of Christ is the price which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems us from our woful Captivity. Mankind was fallen under the dominion of Satan and Death, and could not obtain freedom by escape, or meer power. For by the order of Divine Justice we were detained Prisoners; So that till God the Supreme Judg is satisfied, there can be no discharge. Now the Lord Christ hath procured our deliverance by his Death, according to the testimony of the <hi>Apostle, We have Redemption through his Blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1.14.</note> 
               <hi>even the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sins.</hi> His Blood is congruously called <hi>a price,</hi> because in consideration of it our Freedom is purchased. He is our Redeemer by Ransom;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.6.</note> 
               <hi>He gave himself a Ransom for all:</hi> and that signifies the price paid for the freeing of a Captive. The word used by the Apostle <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>and hast redeemed us to God by thy Blood.</hi> This singular and blessed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Christs Death, distinguishes it from the Death of the most Excellent Martyrs.

How can it be said that he was Crucified for us alone?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.13.</note> For the Martyrs Sealed the Truth with their Blood, and left admirable Examples of Love to God, of Zeal for his Glory, of patience under Torments, and of Compassion to their Persecutors: yet it were intolerable Blasphemy to say that they redeem'd us by their Death. And 'tis observable, when the Death of Christ is propounded in Scripture as a Pattern of Patience, 'tis with a special Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that distinguishes it from all others. <hi>Christ suffered for us, leaving us an Example that we should follow his steps:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.19, 24.</note> 
               <hi>who his own self bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree; by whose stripes ye were healed.</hi> The truth is, if the sole end of Christs Death were to induce Men to believe His Promises, and to imitate His Graces, there had been no such necessity of it: for the Miracles he did, had been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to confirm the Gospel, yet Remission of Sins is never attributed to them: and the Miseries he Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered during the course of his Life, had been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to instruct us how to behave our selves under Indignities and Persecutions: and at the last he might have given as full a Testimony to the Truth of his Doctrine by his descent from the Cross as by dying for us. But no lower Price than his Blood could make Compensation to the Law, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42565:134"/>
to God, and to deny this, is to Rob him of the Glory of his Death, and to destroy all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>'Tis objected by those who nullifie the Mystery of the Cross of the Lord Jesus; How could God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Price, since he gave up his Son to that Death which Redeems us? And how can our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, supposing him God, make satisfaction to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? To this I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The infinite Goodness of God in giving our Redeemer, doth not devest him of the Office of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge, nor prejudice his examining of the Cause according to his Sovereign Jurisdiction, and his receiving a Ransom to preserve the Rights of Justice inviolable. There is an eminent instance of this in <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Locrians</hi>; who past a Law that Adulterers should lose both their eyes: and when his Son was convicted of that Crime, the people who respected him for his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Vertues, out of pity to him, interceded for the Offender.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Aelian Var. histor. l. 13. c. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Zaleucus</hi> in a Conflict between Zeal for Justice, and Affection to his Son, took but one Eye from him, and parted with one of his own to satisfie the Law. And thus he paid and received the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: he paid it as a Father, and received it as the Conservator of Publick Justice. Thus when guilty Mankind in its Poverty could not pay the Forfeiture to the Law, God the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies was pleased to give it from the Treasures of his Love; that is, the Blood of his Son for our Ransom. And this he receives from the Hand of Christ, offer'd upon the Cross, as the Supreme Judge, and declares it fully valuable, and the Rights of Justice to be truly performed.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:42565:135"/>2. It is not inconsistent with Reason, that the Son of God cloathed with our Nature, should by his Death make Satisfaction to the Deity, and therefore to himself. In the according of two Parties, a Person that belongs to one of them, may interpose for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, provided that he devests his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and leaves it with the Party from whom he comes. Thus when the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the People were in dissension,<note place="margin">Menenius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa, <hi>Liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </hi> l. 2.</note> one of the Senators trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own Concernment with the Council, of which he was a Member, and mediated between the Parties to reconcile them. Thus when the Father and the Son both possest of the Imperial Power, have been offended by Rebellious Subjects, 'tis not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that the Son interpose as a Mediator, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them to the Favour of the Prince. And by this he reconciles them to himself, and procures them Pardon of an Offence, by which his own Majesty was violated. This he doth as Mediator, not as a a Party concern'd. Now this is a fit Illustration of the Great Work of our Redemption, so far as Humane things can represent Divine. For all the Persons of the Glorious Trinity were equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd by our Sin; and to obtain our Pardon the Son with the consent of the Father deposits his Interest into his Hands, and as a Mediator intervenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and him, who in this Transaction is the Depositary of the Rights of Heaven, and having performed what Justice required, he reconciled the World to God, that is, to the Father, Himself, and the Eternal Spirit. In this Cause his Person is the same, but his Quality is different: he made Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as Mediator, and receiv'd it as God. 'Tis in this sense that the Apostle saith, <hi>We have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42565:135"/>
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.2.</note> Not to exclude the other Persons, but in regard the Father as the <hi>First</hi> Person is the Protector of Justice, our Mediator in appeasing Him appeases the others also.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Death of Christ is represented under the notion of a Sacrifice offer'd up to God. For the more full understanding of this, we must consider that Sacrifices were of <hi>two</hi> kinds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some were <hi>Eucharistical:</hi> They are called Peace-offerings, by which the Sacrificer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Bounty of God, and his own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and rendered Praise for a favour received, and desired the Divine Blessing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Expiatory:</hi> The Sin-offerings for the averting of Gods wrath. The Institution of them was upon a <hi>double</hi> Reason;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Man is a sinner, and therefore obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the just indignation and extreme displeasure of the Holy and Righteous God. 2. That God was to be propitiated, that he might pardon them. These Truths are engraven in the natural Consciences of Men, as appeares by the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> pretended Expiations of sin among the Heathens: But are more clearly reveal'd in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> Under the Law without the <hi>effusion of Blood there was no Remission</hi>; To signifie,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> that God would not forgive Sin without the atonement of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, which required the Death of the Offender; but it being tempered with Mercy, accepted a Sacrifice in his stead. And that there was a Substitution of the Beast in the place of the guilty Offender, appeares by the Law concerning Sacrifices. 1. None were instituted for <hi>Capital</hi> Offences, as Murder, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because the Sinner himself
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42565:136"/>
was to be cut off: But for other <hi>Sins,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in strictness they deserved Death, yet God who was the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> was pleased to remit the Forfeiture, and to accept the life of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the Life of the <hi>Sinner.</hi> 2. The guilty Person was to offer a clean Beast of his own; to signifie the Surrogation of it in his stead. For in the relation of a Possessour he had a dominion over it, to apply it to that use. 3. The Priest, or the person that offer'd,<note place="margin">Exo. 29.10. Lev. 1.4.</note> was to lay his hands on the head of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, thereby Consecrating it to God, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting it in his stead to bear the Punishment. For this reason 'twas called a <hi>Sin,</hi> and a <hi>Curse.</hi> 4. The Confession of Sin by the People,<note place="margin">Lev. 17.11.</note> or the Priest, as in the day of Atonement, signified that the guilt of all met on the Sacrifice for Expiation. 5. The Blood was to be shed wherein the <hi>vital</hi> spirits are, an express representation what the Sinner deserved: and that it was accepted for his Life. 6. <hi>Lastly,</hi> The <hi>deprecating</hi> of God's Anger was joyned with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. As when a Man was slain, and the Murderer was not found; the Elders of the City next to the dead Body, were to kill an Heifer in a Valley, and to pray that innocent Blood might not be laid to their charge: otherwise the Land could not be clensed from the guilt of Blood, but by the Blood of the Murderer.</p>

To God, that his Anger might be appeased; to Sin, that the fault might be expiated; to Man, that the guilty person might obtain Pardon, and Freedom from Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.17. and the Remission of Sins, with the Release of the Sinner followed; <hi>The Priest shall expiate it,</hi> that is declaratively, <hi>and it shall be forgiven him.</hi> Now there was a <hi>double</hi> Guilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by those that were under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Typical,</hi> From the breach of a <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, which had no relation to <hi>Morality.</hi> Such were natural Pollutions, accidental Diseases, the touching of a dead Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were esteemed vicious according to the Law, and the Defiled were excluded from <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Society. Now these Impurities, considered in themselves, deserved no punishment. For involuntary and inevitable Infirmities, and <hi>corporeal</hi> things, which do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the inward man, are the marks of our abject and weak state, but are not in themselves sinfull. Therefore Ceremonial Guilt was expiated by a Ceremonial Offering. For 'tis according to the nature of things, that Obligations should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by the same means, by which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. As therefore those Pollutions were <hi>penal</hi> merely by the <hi>positive</hi> Will of God; So, (the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his Supreme Right being tempered with Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Equity,) he ordained that the guilt should be abolisht by a Sacrifice, and that they should be fully restored to their former Priviledges. Thus the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that the Blood of those Sacrifices <hi>Sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.13.</note> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated a <hi>legal</hi> Purity to the Offerers, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a right to approach the holy Place. Now the reason of these Institutions was, that the <hi>legal</hi> Impurity might represent the true defilements of Sin, and the <hi>Expiatory</hi> Sacrifices prefigure that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42565:137"/>
great and admirable Oblation, which should purge away all Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A real Guilt which respects the Conscience, and was contracted from the breach of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, and subjected the Offender to Death <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>eternal.</hi> This could not be purged away by those Sacrifices. For how is it possible the Blood of a Beast should cleanse the Soul of a Man, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Justice of an offended God? Nay on the contrary they reviv'd the guilt of Sin, and reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the rigour of the Law, and were a publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Misery of Men: For this reason the Law is called <hi>the Ministry of Death.</hi> As the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> contained a declaration of our guilt, and Gods right to punish, so all the parts of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> were either arguments and convictions of Sin, or images of the punishment due for them. But as they had a relation to Christ who was their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so they signified the <hi>expiation</hi> of <hi>moral</hi> guilt by his Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Levit 5. Vid. <hi>Vossium</hi> contra <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperg.</hi> c. 24.</note> and freed the Sinner from that <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Death to which he was liable; as a Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of our freedom from Eternal Death by the Blood of the Cross. This will appear more clearly by considering, 1. That all kinds of <hi>placatory</hi> Sacrifices are referred to Christ in the <hi>New Testament.</hi> 2. That all their Effects are attributed to him in a sublimer and most perfect manner. He is called a Lamb in the notion of a Sacrifice, <hi>The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 13.8. Lev. 5.6. &amp; 14.12. 1 Cor. 5.7. Exo. 12.13.</note> A Lamb was used in the Expiation of <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> Impurities. He is called <hi>our Passover that was sacrificed for us.</hi> The <hi>Paschal</hi> Lamb in its <hi>first</hi> Institution had an <hi>expiatory</hi> efficacy, for God by looking on that Blood, averted the destruction from the <hi>Israelites,</hi> which seized on
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42565:137"/>
the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> This was the reason of the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, that none should go out of the house till the Morning, lest they should be struck by the destroying Angel: Not but that the Angel could distinguish the <hi>Israelites</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> abroa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but 'twas <hi>typical,</hi> to shew their security was in being under the guard of the Lambs Blood, which was shed to spare theirs. Thus the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>We are redeemed by the Blood of the pure and perfect Lamb.</hi> And he was represented by the <hi>red</hi> Heifer,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18.</note> whose ashes were the chief ingredient in the water of Purification. <hi>For if the Blood of Bulls and Goats,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb 9.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>and the ashes of an Heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the Flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How much more shall the Blood of Christ purge the Conscience?</hi> Especially the <hi>Anniversary</hi> Sacrifice, which was the Abridgment and Recapitulation of all the rest, had an eminent respect to Christ: The whole <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is tinctured with this divine Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Effects of Christs Death are <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> more excellent than those that proceeded from <hi>Levitical</hi> Sacrifices.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.1.</note> 
               <hi>The Law had a shadow of good things to come</hi>; But the real Virtue and Efficacy is only found in Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Aversion of Gods Wrath is ascribed to his Death; according to the Words of the Apostle: <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood,</hi>

               </gap> his people. For this Reason he gives the name of the Figure to Christ, for he alone answers the Charge of the Law, and interposes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Justice and our Guilt, and by his own Blood hath reconciled God to us. Now the design of God in this appointment was to <hi>declare his Righteousness,</hi> that is, that Glorious Attribute that inclines him to punish Sinners: For in the Legal Propitiations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the guilt of Men was publickly declared in the Death of the Sacrifices, yet the Justice of God did not fully appear, since he accepted the Life of a Beast in Compensation for the Life of a Man: but in the Death of Christ he hath given the most clear Demonstration of his Justice, a sufficient Example of his Hatred to Sin, Condemning it, and Reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself upon it, in the Person of his beloved Son; that the whole World may acknowledge 'twas not from any Inadvertency, but meerly by the Dispensation of his Wisdom and Goodness that he forbore so long. And by the Death of Christ he hath declared that Glorious Mystery which no created Understanding could ever have conceived, that he is inflexibly just, and will not suffer sin to pass unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, and that he justifies those who are guilty in themselves, if by a purifying Faith they receive Christ for Pardon. The same Apostle tells us, that Christ hath <hi>given himself for us,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> an allusion to the peace-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and sin-offering; for the truth of both is in the death of Christ, which appeases God, and obtains the Blessings that depend on his favour.</note> 
               <hi>an Offering and a Sacrifice</hi> to God <hi>for a sweet smelling savour,</hi> Eph. 5.2. He is qualified as a Priest, whose Office it was to present to God an offering for Appeasing
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42565:138"/>
his Anger; <hi>He gave himself</hi>; the Oblation that is added to his Death, gives the compleat For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of a Sacrifice to it; for 'tis the Priest gives being to the Sacrifice: and the effect of it is, to be a sweet smelling savour to God, that is, to conciliate his Favour to us. The same phrase is applyed to the Sin-Offering under the Law.<note place="margin">Gen. 8.20. Exod. 29. Lev. 1.10.</note> We may observe that upon this account our Reconciliation to God is attributed to the Death of Christ, in distinction from his Glorified Life:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> 
               <hi>For if when we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his Life.</hi> And the same Apostle tells us, that God was in <hi>Christ reconciling the World to himself,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> 
               <hi>not imputing their trespasses unto them; we pray you therefore in Christs stead, be reconciled to God.</hi> A double Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is mentioned, that of God to Men, and of Men to God: the first is the ground of the Apostle's exhortation, the latter the effect of it. The first was obtained by the Death of Christ, who by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation had our guilt transferred upon Him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently our punishment, and in consideration of it, God who is Just and Holy is willing to pardon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Believers. The latter is by the powerful working of the Spirit, who assures Men that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore suspicious and fearful of God's anger, that he is most willing to pardon them upon their repentance, since he hath in such an admirable manner found out the means to satisfie his Justice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The true expiation of sin is the effect of Christs Death. He is called the Lamb of God,<note place="margin">1 John 29.</note> 
               <hi>that takes away the sins of the World.</hi> Now sin may be taken away in two manners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> by removing its guilt, and exempting the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42565:139"/>
Person that committed it from Death; and when this is effected by enduring the punishment that was due to sin, 'tis properly expiation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By healing the corrupt inclinations of the Heart, from whence actual sins proceed. 'Tis true, our Redeemer takes away sin in both these respects: he delivers from the Damnation and Dominion of it: for he is made of God our <hi>Righteousness and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctfication.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> But the first sense is only convenient here: for 'tis evident that the Lamb took away sin, that is, the guilt of it, by dying instead of the sinner, and had no effect for the destroying the malignant habits of sin in those who offered them. It appears further that this Divine Lamb hath taken away the guilt of our sins,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.24.</note> in that <hi>He bore them in his own Body on the Tree.</hi> For the native force of the word signifies, not only to take away,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> but to carry and bear, which applyed to sin is nothing else but to suffer the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. And 'tis to be observed, when Cleansing, Purifying, and Washing are attributed to the Blood of Christ, they have an immediat respect to the guilt of sin, and declare its efficacy to take off the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to punishment. Thus 'tis said that His <hi>Blood cleanseth from all sin</hi>:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.7. Heb. 9.4. Rev. 1.6.</note> and <hi>that it purgeth the Cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience foom dead Works</hi>; and that <hi>we are washt from our sins in His Blood.</hi> The frequent Sprinklings and Purifications with Water under the Law, prefigur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our cleansing from the defilements of sin by the Grace of the Spirit; but the shedding of the Blood of Sacrifices was to purge away sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so far as they made liable to a Curse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our exemption from punishment, and our restoration to Communion with God in Grace and Glory is the fruit of his expiating sin. For this
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42565:139"/>
reason the Blood of the Mediator <hi>speaks better things then that of Abel:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.24.</note> For that cryed for revenge against the Murderer, but his procures remission to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And as the just desert of sin is separation from the presence of God, who is the fountain of felicity; so when the guilt is taken away, the person is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into God's favour, and fellowship. A representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this is set down in the 24 of <hi>Exod.</hi> where we have described the manner of dedicating the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and <hi>Israel</hi> by bloody Sacrifices:<note place="margin">Exod. 24.6, 11.</note> after <hi>Moses</hi> had finisht the Offering, and sprinkled the Blood on the Altar and the People, the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> who were forbid before to approach neer to the Lord, were then invited to come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,<note place="margin">Exod. 24.9, 10, 11. Heb. 13.20. Luk. 22.20.</note> and in token of reconciliation feasted before him. Thus the Eternal Covenant is establisht by the Blood of the Mediator, and all the benefits it contains, as remission of sins, freedom to draw near to the Throne of Grace, and the enjoyment of God in Glory, are the fruits of his reconciling Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>The sum of all is this, That as under the Law God was not appeased without shedding of Blood, nor sin expiated without suffering the punishment, nor the sinner pardoned without the substitution of a sacrifice; so all these are eminently accomplisht in the Death of Christ. He reconciled God to us by his most precious Blood, and expiated sin by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the Curse, and hath procured our pardon by being <hi>made sin for us.</hi> So that 'tis most evident, that the proper and direct end of the Death of Christ was, that God might exercise his Mercy to the guilty sinner in a way that is honourable to his Justice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis objected, that if God from infinite Mercy gave his Son to us, then antecedently to the coming
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42565:140"/>
of Christ he had the highest love for mankind, and consequently there was no need that Christ by his Death should satisfie Justice, to reconcile him to us. But a clear answer may be given to this by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Anger and Love are consistent at the same time, and may in several respects be terminated on the same subject. A Father resents a double affection towards a rebellious Son; he loves him as his Son, is angry with with him as disobedient. Thus in our laps'd state God had compassion on us as his creatures, and was angry with us as sinners. As the injured party he laid aside his anger, but as the preserver of Justice he required satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We must dinstinguish between a love of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and compassion, and a love of complacency. The first is that which moved God to ordain the means, that without prejudice to his other perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he might confer pardon and all spiritual benefits upon us: the other is that whereby he delights in us being reconciled to him, and renewed according to his Image. The first supposes him placable, the latter that he is appeased. There is a visible instance of this in the case of <hi>Job's</hi> Friends. The Lord said to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 42.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>My anger is kindled against thee, and thy two Friends; because ye have not spoken of me the things that are right, as my Servant</hi> Job. Here is a declaration of God's anger, yet with the mixture of Love: for it follows, <hi>therefore take unto you now seven Bullocks, and seven Rams, and go to my Servant</hi> Job, <hi>and offer up for your selves a burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my Servant</hi> Job <hi>shall pray for you, for him will I accept.</hi> He loved them when he directed the way that they might be restored to his Favour; yet
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42565:140"/>
he was not reconciled, for then there had been no need of Sacrifices to atone his anger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tis further objected, that supposing the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Christ to Justice, both the freeness and greatness of God's Love in pardoning sinners, will be much lessen'd. But it will appear that the Divine Mercy is not prejudiced in either of those respects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The freenss of Gods Love is not diminished, for that is the original mover in our Salvation, and hath no cause above it, to excite or draw it forth, but meerly arises from his own will. This Love is so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute that it hath no respect to the sufferings of Christ as Mediator: for God so <hi>loved the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.18.</note> 
               <hi>that he gave his Son to die for us</hi>; and that which is the effect and testimony of his Love, cannot be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive cause of it. This first Love of God to Man is commended to us in Christ, who is the <hi>medium</hi> to bring it honorably about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Grace in Scripture is never opposed to Christs Merits, but to ours. If we had made Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, Justice it self had absolved us. For the Law having two parts, the command of our Duty which consists in a moral good, and the sanction of the punishment that is a physical evil; to do or to suffer is necessary, not both: or, if we had provided a Surety, such as the Judge could not reject, we had been infinitely obliged to him, but not to the favour of the Judg. But 'tis otherwise here. God sent the Reconciler when we were enemies, and the Pardon that is dispenc'd to us upon the account of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is the effect of meer Mercy. <hi>We are justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ.</hi> 'Tis pure Love that appointed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that imputes and applies his Righteousness to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:42565:141"/>And as the Freeness, so the Riches of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is not lessened by the Satisfaction Christ made for us. 'Tis true we have a pattern of God's Justice, never to be parallel'd, in the Death of Christ: but to the severity of Justice towards his only beloved Son, his clemency towards us guilty Rebels is fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensurate. For He pardons us without the expence of one drop of our Blood, though the Soul of Christ was poured forth as an Offering for Sin. Thus in an admirable manner He satisfies Justice, and glorifies Mercy: and this could have been no other way ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: for if He had given His Spirit alone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store us to His Image, His Love had eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, but the honour of his Justice had not been secured. But in our Redemption they are infinitely magnified; His Love could give no more than the Life of His Son, and Justice required no less: for Death <hi>being the Wages of Sin,</hi> there could be no satisfaction without the Death of our Redeemer.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> The <hi>Compleatness</hi> of <hi>Christ's</hi> Satisfaction proved from the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of it. The <hi>Causes</hi> are the Quality of his <hi>Person,</hi> and Degrees of his <hi>Sufferings.</hi> The <hi>Effects</hi> are His Resurrection, Ascension, Intercession at Gods right hand, and his exercising the <hi>Supreme</hi> Power in Heaven and Earth. The excellent Benefits which God <hi>reconciled</hi> bestows on <hi>Men,</hi> are the Effects and Evidences of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> They are <hi>Pardon</hi> of <hi>Sin, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> That <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in order to the partaking of the Benefits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by <hi>Christ's</hi> Death, doth not lessen the Merit of his <hi>Sufferings.</hi> That Afflictions and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath are inflicted on Believers, doth not derogate from their All-sufficiency.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe <hi>Third</hi> thing to be considered is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatness of the Satisfaction that Christ hath made, by which it will appear that Gods Justice as well as Mercy is fully glorified in his Sufferings. For the proof of this I will <hi>first</hi> consider the Causes from whence the compleatness of his Satisfaction arises.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Effects that proceed from it, which are convincing Evidences that God is fully appeas'd. The <hi>Causes</hi> of his compleat Satisfaction are <hi>two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Quality of his Person derives an infinite value to his obedient Sufferings. Our Surety was equally God, and as truely Infinite in His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42565:142"/>
as the Father, who was provoked by our Sins, therefore he was able to make Satisfaction for them. He is the Son of God not meerly in respect of the honour of his Office, or the special Favour of God, for on these accounts that <hi>Title</hi> is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to others: but <hi>his only Son</hi> by Nature. The sole preheminence in Gifts and Dignity would give Him the title of the <hi>first-born,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 82.6. John 3.16. John 8.36. Heb. 1.5.</note> but not deprive them of the quality of <hi>Brethren.</hi> Now the wisdom and justice of all Nations agree, that Punishments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their estimate from the quality of the Persons that suffer. The <hi>Poet</hi> observes that the Death of a vertuous Person is more precious than of Legions. Of what inestimable value then is the death of Christ,<note place="margin">Pluris enim <hi>Decii,</hi> quam qui servantur ab illis. <hi>Juven.</hi>
               </note> and how worthy a Ransom for lost man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? For although the Deity is impassible, yet he that was a Divine Person he suffered. A King suffers more than a private person, although the strokes he endures in his body, cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly reach his honour. And 'tis specially to be observed, that the Efficacy of Christs Blood is ascribed to his Divine Nature: This the Apostle declares,<note place="margin">Col. 1.14.</note> 
               <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his Blood, even the forgiveness of Sins, who is the image of the invisible God:</hi> Not an artificial Image which imperfectly represents the Original; As a Picture that sets forth the Colour and Figure of a Man, but not his Life and Nature: But the essential and exact Image of his Father, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses all his glorious Perfections in their immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and eternity. This is testified expresly in Hebr. 1.3. <hi>The Son of God, the brightness of his Glory, and the express Image of his Person, having purged by himself our sins, is set down on the right hand of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42565:142"/>
on High.</hi> From hence arises the infinite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Sacrifices of the Law, and Christs, in their value and vertue. This with admirable <hi>Emphasis</hi> is set down in Hebr. 9.13, 14. <hi>For if the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the ashes of an Heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purification of the flesh; How much more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit offer'd himself without spot to God, purge your Consciences from dead works to serve the living God?</hi> Wherein the <hi>Apostle</hi> makes a double <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> 1. That the <hi>Legal</hi> Sacrifices were ineffectual to purifie from real guilt. 2. That by their <hi>Typical</hi> Cleansing, they signified the washing away of <hi>moral</hi> guilt by the Blood of Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their insufficiency to expiate Sin appears, if we consider the subject; Sin is to be expiated in the same nature wherein 'twas committed; now the Beasts are of an inferiour rank, and have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Man in his nature: Or, if we consider the object, God was provoked by Sin, and He is a Spirit,<note place="margin">Psal. 50.13.</note> and not to be appeased by gross <hi>material</hi> things: His Wisdom requires that a <hi>rational</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice should expiate the guilt of a <hi>rational</hi> Creature: And Justice is not satisfied without a proportion between the Guilt and the Punishment. This weakness and insufficiency of the <hi>Legal</hi> Sacrifices to expiate Sin, is evident from their variety and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition: For if full Remission had been obtained, <hi>The worshippers once purged should have had no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of sin.</hi> 'Tis the sense of Guilt,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.2.</note> and the fear of Condemnation that required the renewing of the Sacrifice. Now under the <hi>Law,</hi> the Ministry of the Priests never came to a period or perfection. The <hi>Millions</hi> of Sacrifices in all Ages, from the erecting
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42565:143"/>
the Tabernacle to the coming of Christ, had not vertue to expiate one Sin. They were only shadows which could give no refreshment to the inflamed Conscience, but as they depended on Christ, the body and substance of them. But the Son of God, who <hi>offered himself up by the Eternal Spirit to the Father,</hi> is a Sacrifice not only Intelligent and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, but incomparably more precious than the most noble Creatures in Earth or in Heaven it self. He was Priest and Sacrifice in respect of <hi>both</hi> His Natures, His entire Person was the Offerer and Offering: Therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Sacrifice, infers the unity of its Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from thence concludes its Efficacy. <hi>Christ did not by the Blood of Bulls and Goats, but by his own Blood He entred in once to the Holy Place, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal Redemption for us:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note> 
               <hi>and by one Offering He hath for ever perfected them who are sanctified.</hi> Upon this account God promised in the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>That their Sins and Iniquities He would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no more,</hi> having received compleat satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Sufferings of his Son. <hi>'Tis now said that once in the end of the world hath he appeared,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.26, 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed for all men once to die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after Death comes Judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the Sins of many, and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin.</hi> As there is no other natural death to suffer between Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so there is no other <hi>propitiatory</hi> Sacrifice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his all-sufficient Death on the Cross, and the last coming of our Redeemer. There is one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration I shall adde, to shew the great difference between Legal Sacrifices and the Death of Christ as
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:42565:143"/>
to its saving vertue. The <hi>Law</hi> absolutely forbids the eating of Blood, and the peoples tasting of the Sin-offerings; to signifie the imperfection of those Sacrifices. For since they were consumed in their Consecration to Gods Justice, and nothing was left for the nourishment of the Offerers, 'twas a sign they could not appease God. The Offerers had communion with them when they brought them to the Altar, and in a manner derived their guilt to them, but they had no vertue by them in coming from it. The Sinner conveyed death to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but did not receive life from it. But Christ the Lamb of God was not swallowed up in his Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Divine Justice: 'Tis his peculiar Glory that He hath compleatly made Satisfaction. We may feed upon the flesh of this precious <hi>Victim,</hi> and drink his Blood. As He enter'd into communion of Death with us, so we are partakers of Life by Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Compleatness of his Satisfaction is grounded on the degrees of his Sufferings. There was no defect in the payment He made. We owed a debt of Blood to the Law, and his Life was offer'd up as a Sacrifice: otherwise the <hi>Law</hi> had remained in its full vigour, and Justice had been unsatisfied. That a Divine Person hath suffered our Punishment, is properly the reason of our Redemption. As 'tis not the quality of the Surety that releases the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor from Prison, but the payment which he makes in his name. <hi>The Blood of Christ shed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.28. Mar. 14.24.</note> poured forth from his Veins, and offered up to God, in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise consideration ratifies the New <hi>Testament.</hi> The sum is, Our Saviour by his Death suffer'd the <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> of the Law, and his Divine Nature gave a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42565:144"/>
full value to his Sufferings, so that the satisfaction proceeding from them, was not meerly <hi>ex pacto,</hi> as Brass Money is currant by composition; but <hi>ex me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito,</hi> as pure Gold hath an <hi>intrinsick</hi> worth; and God who was infinitly provokt, is infinitely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The effects and evidences of his compleat Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> His Resurrection from the Grave. For if we consider the Lord Christ in the quality of our Surety, He satisfied the Law in his Death: and having made compleat payment of our debt, He received the acquittance in his Resurrection. His Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased God, His Resurrection assures Men. As he rose himself, so in one concurrent action God <hi>is said to raise him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.4. Isa. 53.13.</note> He was releast from the Grave, as <hi>from Prison,</hi> by publick sentence; which is an indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument of the validity and acceptance of the payment made by him in our name. For being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such bonds as the Justice and Power of God, he could never have <hi>loosed the pains of Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2 24.</note> if his Sufferings had not fully been fully Satisfactory and received by him for our discharge. And 'tis observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the raising of Chiist is ascribed to God as reconciled. <hi>Now the God of peace who brought again from the dead the great Shepherd of the Sheep,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.20.</note> 
               <hi>through the Blood of the everlasting Covenant.</hi> The Divine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer was not put forth till God was pacified. Justice incensed exposed him to Death, and Justice appeased freed Him from the dead. And his Resurrection is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his Blood, that being the full price of his and our liberty. In short, when inflexible Justice ceases to punish, there is the strongest proof 'tis satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:42565:144"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> His Ascent into Heaven, and Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us prove the compleatness and alsufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Sacrifice. If He had been excluded from the Divine Presence, there had been just cause to suspect that anger had been still remaining in God's Breast; but His admission into Heaven is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible testimony that God is reconciled. This our Saviour produces as the Argument by which the Holy Ghost will overcome the guilty fears of Men. <hi>He shall convince the World of Righteousnss, because I go to my Father.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16.10.</note> Christ in his Sufferings was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among transgressors. He dyed as a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, not only in respect of the calumnies of Men, but the curse of the Law, and the Wrath of God which then appeared inexorable against sin. But having overcome Death, and broke through the weight of the Law, and retired to his Father, he made apparent the innocency of his righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that a compleat Righteousness is acquired by his Sufferings, sufficient to justifie all that shall truly accept of it.</p>
            <p>This will be more evident, by considering his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into Heaven as the true High Priest, who carried the Blood of the New-Covenant into the Celestial Sanctuary. For the opening this, we are to consider there are two parts of the Priestly Office.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To offer Sacrifice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make intercession for the People by vertue of the Sacrifice. This was performed by the High-Priest in the Feast of Atonement which was celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the month <hi>Tisri.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 16.14, 15.</note> The oblation of the Sacrifices was without, at the Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Intercession was made in the Holy of Holies, into which none might enter but the High-Priest once a year. And first he must
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42565:145"/>
expiate his own sins, and the sins of the people by Sacrifices, before he could remove the Vail, and enter into that sacred and venerable place, where no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had right to appear. Then he was to present the precious Incense, and the Blood of the Sacrifices, to render God favourable to them.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.4.</note> Now these were shadows of what Christ was to perform. The Holy of Holies was the type of the third-Heaven, in its Situation, Quality and Furniture. For it was the most secret part of the Tabernacle, separated by a double Vail, by that which was between it and the first Sanctuary, and by another that distinguisht the first from the outward Court. Thus the Heaven of Heavens is the most distant part of the Universe, and separated from the lower World, by the Starry Heaven, and by the Airy Region, which reaches down to the Earth. Besides, the most Holy part of the Tabernacle was inaccessible to sinners: as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is stiled by the Apostle the place <hi>of inaccessible light.</hi> And it was the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, where he reigned: according to the Language of the Psalmist, <hi>He dwelt between the Cherubims.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 80.1.</note> The figures of the Cherubims represented the Myriads of holy Angels, that adore the incomprehensible Deity, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to execute his commands. The Tables of the Law were a Symbol of that infinite Wisdom and Holiness which ordained them: and the High-Priests entering with the Blood of the Sacrifice, and carrying with him all the <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> upon his Breast, signified that Jesus Christ the true High-Priest after he had really expiated sin by his Divine Sacrifice in the lower World, should enter into the Eternal Sanctuary with his own Blood, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce with him all his People. Of this there was a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42565:145"/>
marvellous sign given, for in the same moment that Christ expired, the Vail of the Temple that sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Oracle from the first part, was rent from the top to the bottom; to signifie that the true High-Priest had Authority and Right to enter into Heaven itself. And the special end of his ascending is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by the Apostle:<note place="margin">Heb 9.24.</note> 
               <hi>For Christ is not entered into the Holy places made with hands, which are the Figures of the true, but into Heaven its self, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</hi> As the High-Priest might not enter into that sacred and terrible place, neither could he <hi>propitiate</hi> God without sprinkling the Blood of the slain Sacrifice; So our Redeemer first performed what was necessary for the Expiation of Sin, and then He past through the visible Heavens, and ascended before the Throne of God to appear as our Advocate. He made an <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Himself on the Earth, before He could make <hi>intercession</hi> for us in Heaven, which is the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Priestly Office. The <hi>first</hi> was a proper Sacrifice, the <hi>second</hi> is a commemoration of it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He is said <hi>To appear before his Father by Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides what hath been discours'd of the order and dependance of these parts of his Priestly Office,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.26.</note> which proves that He had accomplisht the <hi>expiation</hi> of Sin, before He was admitted into Heaven to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us: There are <hi>two</hi> other Considerations which manifest the compleatness of his Satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The manner of his Intercession. 2. Its <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi> Efficacy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The manner of it. He doth not appear in the form of a Suppliant upon his Knees before the Throne, offering up tears and strong cries as in the day of his flesh, but <hi>He sits at Gods right hand mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42565:146"/>
intercession for us.</hi> He sollicits our Salvation, not as a favour to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as the price of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and as due to his <hi>infinite</hi> Merit. His Blood in the same manner pleads for our Pardon, as the blood of righteous <hi>Abel</hi> call'd for vengeance against the Murderer:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.24.</note> Not by an <hi>articulate</hi> voice, but by suing to Justice for a full recompence of it. In short, His Intercession is the continual representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his most worthy Passion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The omnipotent Efficacy of his Intercession proves that God is fully satisfied. He frees us from the greatest Evils, and obtains for us the greatest Good in the quality of Mediator.<note place="margin">1 John 2.2.</note> 
               <hi>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the Righteous; and he is the propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but for the Sins of the whole world.</hi> He disarms the Anger of God, and hinders the effects of his Indignation against repenting Sinners. Now the prevalency of his Mediation is grounded on the perfection of his Sacrifice. The blessedness of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is confer'd on Believers according to his Will. <hi>Father, I will that those whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am to see my glory.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 17.24.</note> His request is effectual, not only because He is Gods Son, and in highest favour with Him, but for his meritorious Sufferings.</p>
            <p>'Tis for this reason that the Office of Mediator is incommunicable to any Creature. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note> 
               <hi>who gave himself a ransom for all.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> makes a <hi>Parallel</hi> between the <hi>unity</hi> of the Mediator, and of the Deity, which is most Sacred and inviolable. For the right of Intercession, as 'tis an <hi>authoritative</hi> act, is founded in Redemption,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42565:146"/>
they cannot be divided. And we may observe by the way, How the <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrine that erects as many Advocates as Angels, or Saints, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are <hi>Canonised,</hi> is guilty of Impiety and Folly: Of Impiety, In taking the Sovereign Crown from the Head of Christ to adorn others with it, as if they had more credit with God, or compassion for Men: And of Folly, In expecting benefits by their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, who have no satisfactory Merit to purchase them. The numerous Advocates that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by superstitious Persons in their Fancies, are like the counterfeit <hi>Suns,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Non totum imitantur, sed imaginemejus, figuramque, caeterum nihil habent ardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, hebetes &amp; languidi.</hi> Sen. Nat. Quaest.</note> that are drawn in the Clouds by Reflexion, as in a Glass: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they shine with a considerable brightness, yet they are only <hi>Suns</hi> in appearance, and derive no quickening Influences to the Earth. The blessed Spirits above, who enjoy a dependant Light from the Sun of Righteousness, yet convey no Benefits to Men by <hi>Meritorious</hi> interceding for them. We obtain Grace &amp; Glory only upon the requests of our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>Briefly,</hi> The acts of his Priest-hood respect the Attributes, which in a special manner are to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in our Salvation. By his Death He made Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Justice, by his Intercession he sollicites Mercy: And they both join together with the same readiness and warmth to dispense the Benefits which He purchased for his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Compleatness of his Satisfaction is fully proved by the glorious issue of his Sufferings. This will be most evident by considering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and dependance which his Glory hath upon his Humiliation: And that is <hi>twofold</hi>:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A dependance of Order. His Abasement and Sufferings were to precede his Majesty and Power:

As in Nature things pass from a lower state to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. This Order was necessary. For being ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally <hi>in the form of God,</hi> it was impossible he should be advanced,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A dependance of efficacy. Glory is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Sufferings. This is expresly declared by the Apostle. <hi>Christ humbled himself, and became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Death of the Cross,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.</note> 
               <hi>wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every name, that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow</hi>; The mark of that homage that all creatures pay to him. This exaltation is correspondent to the degrees of his abasement. His Body was restored to Life and Immortality, and ascended on a bright Cloud, God's Chariot, being attended with Angels, <hi>and the everlasting Gates opened to receive the King of Glory:</hi> He is set down <hi>at the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in Heaven:</hi> this signifies that Divine Dignity to which He is advanced,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> next to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For God being an infinite Spirit hath neither right nor left hand in strict sense. Our Redeemers Honour is the same, and His Empire of the same extent with his Fathers. Thus the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets the words of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> that the <hi>Messiah should sit at the right hand of God, till he made his Enemies his Footstool,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 110.1.</note> 
               <hi>by reigning; for he must reign till he hath put all his Enemies under his feet.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.25.</note>And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Father hath made him Lord and Christ:</hi> That is, by a Soveraign trust hath committed to him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and the World: not devest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42565:147"/>
himself of his essential Dominion, but exercising it by Christ. The height of this Dignity is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically set forth by the Apostle: <hi>The Father hath seated him at his own right hand in the Heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, far above all Principalities, and Powers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>and Might, and Dominion,</hi> (which titles signify the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of Glory, among the Angels) <hi>and every name that is named not only in this World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that which is to come:</hi> that is, hath given him a transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and incommunicable Glory, the use of names being to signify the quality of Persons. In short, he is made the Head of the Church, and Judge of the World: Angels and Men shall stand before his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and receive their Eternal decision from him. Now in this oeconomy of our Mediator, his Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was the cause of his Exaltation upon a double account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the Death of Christ was an expression of such humility, such admirable Obedience to God, such Divine Love to Men, that it was perfectly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to his Father, and his Power being equal to his Love he infinitely rewarded it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Death of Christ was for Satisfaction to Justice, and when he had done that Work, he was to enter into rest. <hi>It behoved Christ to Suffer and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Glory.</hi> 'Tis true,<note place="margin">Luk. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> Divine Honour was due to him upon another title, as the Son of God: but the receiving of it was deferr'd by dispensation for a time. First, He must redeem us, and then Reign. The Scripture is very clear in referring his actual possession of Glory, as the just consequent to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat expiation of sin.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.12.</note> 
               <hi>When by himself He had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our sins, He sat down on the right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty on high. And after he had made one Sacrifice
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42565:148"/>
for sins, for ever sate down on the right hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not only the Will of the Father, but the nature of the thing it self required this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. For Jesus Christ by voluntary susception undertaking to satisfie the Law for us, as he was obliged to suffer what was necessary in order to our Redemption, so 'twas reasonable after Justice was satisfied, that the humane nature should be freed from its infirmities, and the Glory of his Divine be so conspicuous, <hi>that every tongue should confess that</hi> Jesus who was despised on Earth is supreme Lord: The Apostle sums up all together in that triumphant challeng, <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>34, 35.</note> 
               <hi>'Tis God that justifies, who is he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth? 'Tis Christ that died, yea rather is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The excellent benefits which God reconciled bestows upon us, are the effects and evidences of the compleatness of Christs Satisfaction. And these are pardon of Sin, Grace, and Glory. The Apostle tells us that <hi>the Law made nothing perfect</hi>: all its Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Ceremonies could not expiate the guilt,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.19.</note> nor cleanse the stain of sin, nor open Heaven for us: which three are requisit to our perfection. But <hi>Christ by one Offering hath perfected for ever them that are Sanctified.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0.14.</note> By him we obtain full Justification, Renovation and Communion with God: therefore his Sacrifice, the Meritorious cause of procuring them, must be perfect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Justification is the effect of his Death: for the obligation of the Law is made void by it. <hi>God forgives us our Trespasses, blotting out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances that was against us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> and took
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42565:148"/>
it <hi>out of the way, nailing it to his Cross.</hi> The terms are used, that are proper to the cancelling a civil Bond. The killing letter of the Law is abolisht by the Blood of the Cross, the Nails and the Spear have rent it in pieces, to signifie that its condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power is taken away.</p>
            <p>Now the infinite vertue of his Death in taking away the guilt of sin will more fully appear, if we consider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it hath procured Pardon for sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in all ages of the World. Without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of a Sacrifice God would not Pardon, and the most costly that were offered up by sinners, were of no value to make compensation to Justice: but the Blood of Christ was the only propitiation for sins committed before his comming. The Apostle tells us, <hi>He was not obliged to offer himself often,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>as the High-Priest entered into the Holy place every year, with the Blood of others, but now once in the end of the World hath he appeared to put away sin, by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himself.</hi> The direct sense of the Words is, that the virtue of his Sacrifice extended it self to all times: for otherwise in regard Men have always needed propitiation, He must have Suffered often since the Creation of the World. And if it be askt how His Death had a saving influence before He actually Suffered? the answer is clear: We must consider the Death of Christ not as a Natural but Moral cause: 'tis not as a Medicine that heals, but as a Ransom that frees a Captive. Natural Causes operate nothing before their real exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but 'tis not necessary that moral Causes should have an actual being; 'tis sufficient that they shall be, and that the person with whom they are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42565:149"/>
accept the Promise. As a Captive is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>least upon assurance given that he will send his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, though 'tis not actually deposited. Thus the death of Christ was available to purchase pardon for Believers before his coming; for he interposed as their Surety, and God, to whom all things are present, knew the accomplishment of it in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time. He is therefore call'd the <hi>Lamb slain from the foundation of the world</hi>;<note place="margin">Rev. 13.8.</note> not only in respect of God's Decree, but his Efficacy. The salvation we derive from him, was ever in him. He appeared under the Empire of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and dyed under <hi>Tybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> but he was a Redeemer in all ages, otherwise the comparison were not just, that as by <hi>Adam all die,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.22.</note> 
               <hi>so by Christ all are made alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, under the old Testament they had not a clear knowledg of him, yet they enjoyed the benefit of his unvaluable Sufferings. For the medium by which the benefits our Redeemer purchased, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to Men, is not the exact knowledg of what he did and suffered, but sincere Faith in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God. Now the Divine Revelation being the rule and measure of Faith, such a degree was sufficient to Salvation, as answered the general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Grace. Believers depended upon God's goodness to pardon them in such a way as was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to his Justice. They had some general Knowledge that the Messiah should come, and bring Salvation: <hi>Abraham rejoiced to see the day of Christ:</hi> Moses <hi>valued the Afflictions of Christ, more than the Treasures of Aegypt.</hi> And Believers in general are described to be <hi>waiters for the Consolation of Israel.</hi> In short, the Jewish and Christian Church are essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially one; they differ no more than the morning
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42565:149"/>
and Evening Star, which is the same, but is divers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, from its appearance before the Sun-rising, or after its setting. So our Faith respects a Saviour that is past, theirs respected Him as to come.</p>
            <p>Besides, The saving vertue of his Death as it reaches to all former, so to all succeeding Ages. <hi>He is the same, yesterday, to day, and for ever; not only in respect of his Person, but his Office.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note> The vertue of the <hi>Legal</hi> Sacrifices expired with the Offering: upon a new sin they were repeated. Their imperfection is argued from their repetition. But the precious Oblation of Christ hath an everlasting efficacy to obtain full Pardon for Believers. His Blood is as powerful to propitiate God, as if it were this day shed upon the Cross. <hi>He is able to save to perpetuity all that shall address to God by Him: Since He ever lives to make Intercession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The Pardon that He once purchased, shall ever be applied to <hi>contrite</hi> Believers. The Covenant that was sealed with his Blood is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the Mercies contained in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The perfection of his Sacrifice is evident, by its expiating universally the guilt of all transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 'Tis true, Sins in their own nature are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, some have a crimson guilt attending them, and accordingly Conscience should be affected: But the Grace of the Gospel makes no difference. The Apostle tells us, that <hi>the Blood of Christ cleanseth from all sins:</hi> Whatever the kinds, degrees and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances are. As the <hi>Deluge</hi> overflowed the highest Mountains, as well as the least Hill, so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy covers Sins of the first magnitude as well as the smallest. Under the Law, one Sacrifice could expiate but one Offence, though but against a <hi>carnal</hi> Commandment, but this one washes away
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42565:150"/>
the guilt of all Sins against the <hi>Moral</hi> Law. And in that Dispensation no Sacrifices were instituted for Idolatry, Adultery, Murder, and other Crimes; which were certainly punisht with Death. But under the Gospel, Sins of what quality soever, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, are pardoned. The <hi>Apostle</hi> having rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up Idolaters, Adulterers, and many other notorious Sinners that shall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>such were some of them; but they were sanctified, and justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 'Tis true, Those who sin against the Holy Ghost are excepted from Pardon: But the Reason is, Because the Death of Christ was not appointed for the Expiation of it: And there being no Sacrifice, there is no Satisfaction, and consequently no Pardon. The Wisdome and Justice of God requires this Severity against them: <hi>For if he that despised</hi> Moses <hi>Law died without Mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.26.</note> 
               <hi>of how much sorer punishment shall he be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>and hath done despite to the Spirit of Grace?</hi> that is, They renounce their Redeemer as if he were not the Son of God, and virtually consent to the cruel Sentence past against Him, as if he had blasphemed when He declared Himself to be so, and thereby out sin his Sufferings. How reasonable is it they should be for ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Benefits, who obstinately reject the Means that purchased them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Death of Christ hath procured Grace for Men. We made a Forfeiture of our Original Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and were righteously deprived of it. And till Divine Justice was appeased, all influences of Grace
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42565:150"/>
were suspended. Now the Death of Christ opened Heaven, and brought down the Spirit, who is the Principle of Renovation in us. <hi>The world lay in wickedness</hi> as a Carcass in the grave,<note place="margin">1 John 2.19.</note> insensible of its horror and corruption. The Holy Spirit hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired it with a new life, and by a marvellous change hath caused Purity to succeed Pollution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The receiving Believers into Heaven is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof of the all-sufficiency of his Sacrifice. For Justice will not permit that Glory and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, which are the Priviledges of the Righteous, should be given to guilty &amp; defiled Creatures. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour's first and greatest work was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the bar, that excluded us from the place of Felicity. 'Tis more difficult to justifie a Sinner, than to glorifie a Saint. The Goodness of God inclines Him to bestow Happiness on those who are not obnoxious to the Law; but his Justice was to be aton'd by Sufferings. Now what stronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can there be, that God is infinitely pleased with what His Son hath done and suffered for his People, than the taking of them into his Presence to see his Glory? The <hi>Apostle</hi> sets down this order in the work of our Redemption,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note> 
               <hi>That Christ being made perfect by Sufferings,</hi> that is, having consummated that part of his Office which respected the expiation of Sin; <hi>He became the Author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him.</hi> To sum up all, 'tis observable, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> attributes to the Death of Christ not only Satisfaction, whereby we are redeemed from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; but such a redundant Merit, as purchases for us Adoption,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.4, 5.</note> and all the glorious Prerogatives of the Children of God. Upon these accounts his Blood hath a double Efficacy. As the <hi>Blood of the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42565:151"/>
Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.20. Luk. 22.20</note> it procured our peace; as the <hi>Blood of the Testament,</hi> it conveyes to us a Title to Heaven it self; according to that of St. <hi>Paul, we have boldness to enter into the Holiest by his Blood.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I will remove <hi>two</hi> slender prejudices against this Doctrine;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Repentance and Faith are required in order to the partaking of the precious benefits which Christ hath purchased, doth not lessen the Merit of his Death, and the compleatness of the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made to God by it. For we must consider,</p>
            <p>There is a great difference between the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that the Law requires by the Debtor, and the payment of that which was not in the original Obligation by another in his stead. Upon the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the first, actual freedom immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. If a Debtor pays the sum he ows, or a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal endure the punishment of the Law, they are actually discharged, and never liable to be sued or suffer again. But when the same that the Law requires is not paid, but something else, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the release of the guilty is suspended upon those cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tions, which he that freely makes satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Governour who by favour accepts it, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eased to appoint. Now 'tis thus in the transaction of our Redemption: Christ laid down his Life for us, and this was not the very thing in strict sense that the Law required. For according to the threatning, <hi>the Soul that sins shall die</hi>; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent in his own person was to suffer the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and there was no necessity natural or moral that obliged God to admit of his Satisfaction for our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. If the Law had exprest that the sinner or his surety should suffer, there had been no need of a
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42565:151"/>
               <hi>better Covenant.</hi> But in this the Grace of God so illustrously appears, that by his appointment the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the guilty was transfer'd to the Innocent, who voluntarily undertook for them. In this respect God truly pardons sin, though he received intire Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; for he might in right have refused it.</p>
            <p>Now these things being supposed, although the Blood of Christ was a price so precious, that it can only be valued by God that received it, and might worthily have redeemed a thousand Worlds, yet the effects of it are to be dispensed according to the Eternal Covenant between the Father and the Son, and the tenor of it is revealed in the Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi> that Repentance and Faith are the conditions, upon which the obtaining pardon of sin, and all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which are the consequents of it depends: thus Christ who makes Satisfaction, and God that accepts it, declare. The Commission of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles from his own mouth was to preach <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 24.47.</note> 
               <hi>and Remission of sins in his name</hi> to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and he was <hi>exalted by God to be a Prince,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 5.31.</note> 
               <hi>and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The establishing of this order is not a meer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive command, wherein the will of the Law-giver is the sole ground of our duty; but there is a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al congruity and reason in the nature of the thing it self. For Christ hath satisfied Justice, that God may exercise pardoning Mercy in such a manner as is suitable to his other perfections. Now 'tis contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Wisdom to dispense the precious benefits of his Sons Blood to impenitent Unbelievers; to give such rich Pearls, and so dearly bought, to Swine that will trample them under their feet; to bestow
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42565:152"/>
Salvation on those who despise the Saviour. 'Tis contrary to his Holiness to forgive those who will securely abuse his favour, as if his pardon were a priviledge and license to sin against him. Nay, final Impenitency is unpardonable to Mercy it self. For the objects of Justice and Mercy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the same: now an impenitent sinner is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily under the revenging Justice of God. 'Tis no disparagement to his omnipotency that he cannot save such. For although God can do whatsoever he will, yet he can will nothing but what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Nature. Not that there is any Law above God, that obliges him to act, but he is a Law to himself. And the more excellent his perfections are, the less he can contradict them. As 'tis no reflection upon his power that he cannot die, neither is it that he can do nothing unbecoming his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. On the contrary, it implies weakness to be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any such act. Thus supposing the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Holy, it is impossible but he should love it, not that he ows any thing to the Creature, but in regard he is infinitely good: and if impenitent and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in sin, he cannot but hate and punish it; not that he is accountable for his Actions, but because he is infinitely Just. And from hence it appears, that the requiring of Repentance and Faith in order to the actual partaking of the blessings our Redeemer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, doth not diminish the value of his Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they being not the causes of pardon, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary qualifications in the subject that receives it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not lessen the Compleatness of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that Believers are liable to Afflictions and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42565:152"/>
Death. For these are continued according to the agreement between God and our Redeemer, for other ends than satisfaction to Justice, which was fully accomplisht by him. This will appear by several Considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some Afflictions have not the nature of a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but are intended only for the exercise of their Graces; That the <hi>trial of their Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 17. Jam. 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Hope being much more precious than of Gold that perisheth, though it be tried by the fire, might be found unto praise.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.2, 3.</note> Now these Afflictions are the occasion of their Joy, and in order to their Glory. Of this kind are all the Sufferings that Christians endure for the promotion of the Gospel. Thus the <hi>Apostles</hi> esteemed themselves dignified, in suffering what was contumelious and reproachful for the Name of Christ.<note place="margin">Act. 5.41. Phil. 1.29.</note> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> interprets it as a special favour, that God call'd forth the <hi>Philippians</hi> to the Combat. <hi>To you it is given in the behalf of Christ to suffer:</hi> Not only the Graces of Faith and Fortitude, but the Affliction was given: So Believers are declared <hi>Happy,</hi>

               <hi>when they are partakers of Christs Sufferings: for the Spirit of Glory rests on them.</hi> Now it is evident that Afflictions of this nature are no Punishments. For since 'tis essential to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to be inflicted for a Fault, and every Fault hath a <hi>turpitude</hi> in it; It necessarily follows, that Punishment which is the brand of a crime must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies attended with infamy, and the Sufferer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shame. But Christians are honourable by their Sufferings for God, as they conform them to <hi>the Image of his Son,</hi> who was consecrated by Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Afflictions are sent sometimes not with respect
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42565:153"/>
to a Sin committed, but to prevent the commission of it: and this distinguishes them from Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For the <hi>Law</hi> deters from Evil, not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting, but threatning the Penalty. But in the Divine Discipline there is another Reason. God afflicts to restrain from Sin: As St. <hi>Paul</hi> had <hi>a thorn in the flesh</hi> to prevent Pride.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Those Evils that are inflicted on Believers for Sin, do not diminish the power and value of Christ's Passion. For we must distinguish between Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are meerly <hi>castigatory</hi> for the good of the Offender, and that are purely <hi>vindictive</hi> for the just Satisfaction of the Law. Now Believers are liable to the first, but are freed from the other. <hi>For Christ hath redeemed them from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrine of Satisfaction to offended Justice by our suffering <hi>temporal</hi> Evils, is attended with many pernicious Consequences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It robs the Cross of Christ of one part of its Glory, as if something were left to us to make up, in the degrees and vertue of his Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It reflects on Gods Justice, as if He exacted <hi>two</hi> different Satisfactions for Sin: the <hi>one</hi> from Christ our Surety, the other from the Sinner.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It disparages his Mercy, in making Him to punish whom He pardons, and to inflict a Penalty after the Sin is remitted.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis dangerous to Man, by feeding a false Presumption in him, as if by the merit of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he could expiate Sin, and obtain part of that Salvation which we entirely owe to the Death of our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:42565:153"/>The difference between Chastisements, and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>vindictive</hi> Punishments, appears in <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Causes from whence they proceed. The severest Sufferings of the Godly are not the effects of the Divine Vengeance. 'Tis true, they are Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Gods displeasure against them for Sin, but not of Hatred. For being reconciled to them in Christ, He beares an unchangeable Affection to them; and Love cannot hate, though it may be angry. The <hi>motive</hi> that excites God to correct them is Love: according to that testimony of the Apostle, <hi>Whom the Lord loves He chastens.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.6. Isai. 1.5.</note> As som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out of his severest displeasure He forbeares to strike, and condemns obstinate Sinners to Prosperity here, so from the tenderest Mercy he afflicts his own. But purely <hi>vindictive</hi> Judgments proceed from meer wrath.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They differ in their measures. The Evils that Believers suffer are alwaies proportioned to their strength. They are not the sudden eruptions of Anger, but deliberate Dispensations: <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precates Gods Judgment as 'tis opposed to Favour, <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant, O Lord</hi>:<note place="margin">Psal. 143.2.</note> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> desires Gods Judgment, as 'tis oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Fury, <hi>Correct me, Oh Lord, in thy Judgment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 10.24.</note> 
               <hi>not in thy Fury.</hi> 'Tis the gracious Promise of God to <hi>David</hi> with respect to <hi>Solomon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.14.</note> 
               <hi>If he commit Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the childaen of men:</hi> that is, Chastise him moderately: For in the stile of the <hi>Scripture</hi> as things are magnified by the <hi>Epithet</hi> Divine, or of God, <hi>as the Cedars of God,</hi> that is, very tall; And <hi>Nineve</hi> is called <hi>The City of God,</hi> that is, very great: So to signifie things that are in a <hi>mediocrity,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:42565:154"/>
uses the <hi>Epithet humane,</hi> or of Men: And according to the Rule of Opposition, the Rod of God is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Affliction which destroys the Sinner; 'tis such a Punishment as a man can neither inflict, nor endure: But the Rod of Men is a moderate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that doth not exceed the strength of the Patient. But every purely <hi>vindictive</hi> Punishment which the Law pronounces, is in proportion to the nature of the Crime, not the strength of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are distinguisht by the intention and end of God in inflicting them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Chastisements God <hi>primarily</hi> designs the Profit of his People,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.10.</note> 
               <hi>That they may be partakers of his Holiness.</hi> When they are secure and <hi>carnal,</hi> He awakens Conscience by the sharp voice of the Rod; to reflect upon Sin, to make them observant for the future; to render their Affections more indifferent to the World, and stronger towards Heaven. The <hi>Apostle</hi> expresses the nature of Chastisements, <hi>When we are judged,</hi>

               <hi>we are instructed by the Lord:</hi> They are more lively Lessons than those which are by the Word alone, and make a deeper impression upon the heart. <hi>David</hi> acknowledges, <hi>Before he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted he went astray,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 119.67.</note> 
               <hi>but now have I kept thy words.</hi> Corrupt Nature makes Gods Favours pernicious, but his Grace makes our Punishments profitable. <hi>Briefly,</hi> They are not satisfactions for what is past, but admonitions for the time to come. But purely <hi>vindictive</hi> Judgments are not inflicted for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of an Offender, but to preserve the honour of the Sovereign, and Publick Order, and to make compensation for the breach of the Law. If any
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42565:155"/>
advantage accrue to the Offender 'tis accidental, and besides the intention of the Judg.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The end of chastisements upon Believers is to prevent their final destruction.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> 
               <hi>When we are Judged, we are Chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the World.</hi> And this sweetens and allays all their Sufferings. As the <hi>Psalmist</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>Let the Righteous smite me, and it shall be a kindness, let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oile, which shall not break my head.</hi> But the <hi>Vindictive</hi> Punishment of a Malefactor is not to prevent his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; for Death is sometimes the Sentence. In this respect the temporal evils that befal the Wicked and the Godly, though materially the same, yet legally differ. For to the Wicked they are as so many earnests of the compleat payment they shall make to Justice in another World; the beginnings of Eternal Sorrows: but to the Godly they are in order to their Salvation. They are as the Red-Sea, through which the <hi>Israelites</hi> past to the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, but the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were drowned in it. Briefly, their Sufferings differ as much in their issue, as the Kingdoms of Heaven and of Hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Death remains to Believers, doth not les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the perfection of Christs Satisfaction. 'Tis true considered absolutely, 'tis the revenge of the Law for sin, and the greatest temporal evil, so that it may seem strange, that those who are Redeemed by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient ransom, should pay this Tribute to the King of Terrors. But the nature of it is changed: 'tis a Curse to the wicked inflicted for Satisfaction to Justice, but a Priviledge to Believers.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.22.</note> As God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Rainbow to be the Sign of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that he would drown the World no more, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42565:156"/>
the same Waters to be the token of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which were the instrument of his Justice. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are the dead that die in the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 14.13.</note> And the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Psal. 16.19.</note> 
               <hi>that precious in the sight of the Lord is the Death of his Saints:</hi> Christ hath taken away what is truly destructive in it. 'Tis continued for their advantage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Corruption hath so depraved the sensitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, that during our natural state we are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely freed from it: but Death that destroyes the natural frame of the Body, puts an end to sin. And in this respect, there is a great difference between the Death of Christ and of Believers: the end of his was to remove the guilt of sin, of theirs to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the reliques of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a delivery from Temporal evils, and an entrance into Glory. Death and Despair seize on the Wicked at once, <hi>but the Righteous hath hope in his Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Grave shall give up its spoils at the last. It retains the Body for a time, not to destroy but purifie it.<note place="margin">John 11.</note> Our Saviour tells us <hi>that whoever believes on him shall not see death, for he will raise them up at the last day.</hi> He that dies a Man, shall revive an Angel, cloathed with Light and Immortality. I will conclude this argument with the words of St. <hi>Austin: Ablato criminis nexu, relicta est mors. Nunc vero majore &amp; mirabiliore gratia Salvatoris in usus justitiae peccati poena est conversa:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 13. de civit. c. 4.</note> 
               <hi>tum enim dictum est Homini, morieris si peccaveris, nunc dictum est Martyri, morere ne pecces. Et sic per ineffabilem Dei misericordiam &amp; ipsa poena vitiorum transit in arma virtutis,, &amp; fit justi meritum, etiam supplicium peccatoris.</hi> Although the Guilt of Sin is removed, yet death remains. But
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42565:156"/>
by the admirable Grace of the Redeemer, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sin is made an advantage to Holiness. The Law threatned Man with Death if he sinned; the Gospel commands a Martyr to die, that he may not sin. And thus by the unspeakable Mercy of God, the punishment of Vice becomes the security of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and that which was revenged upon the sinner, gives to the Righteous a title to a glorious reward.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> Inferences. In the Death of Christ there is the clearest discovery of the evil of sin. The strictness of divine Justice is most visible in it. The consideration of the ends of Christs Death takes off the scandal of the Cross, and changes the offence into admiration. The Satisfaction of Justice by Christs Sufferings affords the strongest assurance that God is ready to pardon sinners. The absolute necessity of complying with the terms of the Gospel for Justification. There are but two wayes of appearing before the supreme Judge: either in Innocence, or by the Righteousness of Christ: The Causes why men reject Christ are, a legal temper that is natural to them, and the predominant love of sin. The unavoidable misery of all that will not submit to our Saviour.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. FRom hence we may discover most clearly the evil of Sin, which no Sacrifice could expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate but the Blood of the Son of God. 'Tis true, the internal Malignity of Sin, abstracted from its dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects, is most worthy of our hatred. For 'tis in
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42565:157"/>
its own nature direct enmity against God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scures the Glory of all his Attributes. 'Tis the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Majesty, who is the universal Sovereign of Heaven and Earth. A contrariety to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which shines forth in his Law. A despising his Goodness, the atractive to Obedience. The contempt of his Omniscience, which sees every sin when 'tis commited. The slighting of his terrible Justice and Power, as if the Sinner could secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from his Indignation. A denial of his Truth, as if the threatning were a vain terror to scare Men from sin. And all this done voluntarily to please an irregular corrupt Appetite, by a despicable Creature, who absolutely depends upon God for his being and happiness.</p>
            <p>These Considerations seriously pondered, are most proper to discover the extremity of its evil. But sensible demonstrations are most powerful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and affect us: and those are taken from the fearful Punishments that are inflicted for Sin. Now the Torments of Hell which are the just and full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Sin, are not sensible till they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable. And <hi>temporal</hi> Judgments cannot fully declare the infinite Displeasure of God against the wilful contempt of his Authority. But in the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ 'tis exprest to the utmost. If Justice it self had rent the Heavens, and come down in the most visible Terrour to revenge the Rebellions of Men, it could never have made stronger impressions upon us, than the Death of Christ duely considered. The Destruction of the World by Water; the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> by showers of Fire, and all other the most terrible Judgments, do not afford such a sensible instruction of the evil
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42565:157"/>
of Sin. If we regard the Dignity of his Person, and the depth of his Sufferings, He is an unparallel'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Gods Indignation for the breach of his Holy Law. For He that was the Son of God, and the Lord of Glory, was made a Man of Sorrowes. He endured Derision, Scourgings, Stripes, and at last a cruel and cursed Death. The Holy of Holies was crucified between <hi>two</hi> Thieves. By how much the Life of Christ was more precious than the lives of all men, so much in his Death doth the wrath of God appear more fully against Sin, than it would in the destruction of the whole world of Sinners. And His <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sufferings infinitely exceeded all His <hi>Corporeal.</hi> The Impressions of Wrath that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by Gods immediate Hand upon his Soul, forced from him those strong Cries, that moved all the powers of Heaven and Earth with Compassion. If the curtain were drawn aside, and we should look into the Chambers of Death, where Sinners <hi>lie down in Sorrow</hi> for ever; and hear the woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and deep Complaints of the Damned, with what horrour and distraction they speak of their torments, we could not have a fuller testimony of God's Infinite displeasure against sin, than in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and Agonies of our Redeemer. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever His Sufferings were in kind, yet in their degree and measure they were equally terrible with those that condemned Sinners endure. Now how is it possible that Rational Agents should freely, in the open light, for perishing vanities dare to commit sin? Can they avoid or endure the Wrath of an Incensed God? If God spared not his Son when he came in the similitude of sinful flesh, how shall Sinners who are deeply and universally defiled escape? Can they
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42565:158"/>
fortifie themselves against the Supreme Judge? Can they encounter with the fury of the Almighty, the apprehensions of which made the <hi>Soul of Christ hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy unto Death</hi>? Have they patience to bear that for ever, which was to Christ, who had the strength of the Deity to support him, intolerable for a few hours? If it were so with the green Tree, what will become of the dry, when exposed to the fiery Tryal? If he that was Holy and Innocent suffered so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, what must they expect, who add impenitency to their guilt, and live in the bold commission of Sin, without reflection and remorse? What prodigious Madness is it <hi>to drink iniquity like water,</hi> as a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less thing, when 'tis a poison so deadly, that the least drop of it brings certain ruine? What despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Folly, to have slight apprehensions of that, which is attended with the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> Death? Nothing but unreasonable Infidelity and Inconsideration can make men venturous to provoke <hi>the living God,</hi> who is infinitely sensible of their Sins, and who both can and will punish them by Torments extreme and eternal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The strictness of Divine Justice appears, that required Satisfaction equivalent to the desert of sin. The natural Notion of the Deity, as the Governour of the World, instructed the Heathens, That the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of his Laws <hi>was worthy of Death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.31.</note> This proves that the obligation to punishment, doth not arise from the mere will of God, which is only discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Revelation, but is founded in the nature of things, and by its own light is manifested to reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures. From hence they inferred, That it was not becoming the Divine nature, as qualified with the relation of Supreme Ruler, to pardon Sin without
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42565:158"/>
Satisfaction. This appears by the Sacrifices and Ceremonies, the Religions and Expiations which were performed by the most ignorant Nations. And although they infinitely abused themselves in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit they had of their pretended efficacy and vertue, yet the universal consent of Mankind in the belief that Satisfaction was necessary, declares it to be true. This, as other natural Doctrines, is more fully revealed by <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> Under the Law <hi>without shedding of blood there was no remission,</hi> not that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Blood could make Satisfaction for Sin, but God commanded there should be a visible mark of its necessity, in the Worship offer'd to him, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration that it should be accomplisht by a Sacrifice eternally efficacious.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of our Salvation clearly proves, that to preserve the honour of Gods Government, Sin must be punisht, that Sinners might be pardoned. For nothing was more repugnant to the Will of God absolutely considered, than the Death of his Beloved Son, and the natural Will of Christ was averse from it. What then moved that Infinite Wisdome, which wills nothing but what is perfectly reasonable, to ordain that event? Why should it take so great a circuit, if the way was so short, that by pure Favour, without Satisfaction, Sin might have been pardoned? Our Saviour declares the necessity of his suffering Death, supposing the merciful Will of his Father to save us, when He saith, <hi>That as</hi> Moses <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believes in him should not perish.</hi> 'Tis true, Since God had foretold and prefigured his Death by the oracles and actions under the Law, it necessarily came to pass. But
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42565:159"/>
to consider things exactly, the unchangeable truth of Types and Prophesies is not the <hi>primitive</hi> and main reason of the necessity of things, but only a sign of the certainty of the event. In strictness, things do not arrive because of their prediction, but are foretold because they shall arrive. It is apparent there was a Divine Decree before the Prophesies; and that in the Light of God's Infinite Knowledg things are, before they were foretold. So 'tis not said a Man must be of a ruddy complexion, because his Picture is so, but on the contrary, because he is ruddy, his Picture must be so. That Christ by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Cross should Redeem Man, was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the Serpent of brass was erected on a pole to heal the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and not on the contrary. Briefly, the Apostle supposes this necessity of Satisfaction, as an evident principle, when he proves wilful Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states to be incapable of Salvation: <hi>Because there remains no more Sacrifice for sin.</hi> For the consequence were of no force, if sin might be pardoned without Sacrifice, that is, without Satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This account of Christs Death takes off the scandal of the Cross, and changes the offence into admiration. 'Twas foretold of Christ, <hi>that he should be a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence</hi>; not a just cause,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.34.</note> but an occasion of offence to the corrupt hearts of Men, and principally for his Sufferings. The <hi>Jews</hi> were pleased with the titles of honour given to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that he should be a King, Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Glorious. But that poverty, disgrace and the suffering Death should be his character, they could not endure: therefore they endeavoured to prevert the sense of the Prophets. His Disciples who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him in his mean state, expected those sad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearances
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42565:159"/>
would terminate in visible Glory and Greatness: but when they saw him arrested by his Enemies, Condemned and Crucified, this was so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to their expectation, that they fainted under the disappointment. And when Christ Crucified was Preacht to the Gentile World, they rejected him with scorn. His Death seemed so contrary to the Dignity of his Person, and the design of his Office, that they could not relish the Doctrine of the Gospel. They judged it absurd, to expect Life from one that was subjected to Death, and Blessedness from him, who was made a Curse.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De cruce Christi nobis insultant Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientes hujus mundi, et di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt, quale cor habitis, qui Deum Colitis Crucifixum.</hi> Aug. Serm. <hi>de verb.</hi> Apost.</note> To those who look on the Death of Christ with the eyes of carnal wisdom, and according to the Laws of corrupt reason, it appears folly and weakness, and most unworthy of God; but if we consider it in its principles and ends, all the prejudices vanish, and we clearly discover it to be the most noble and eminent effect of the Wisdom, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Goodness and Justice of God. To the eye of sense 'twas a spectacle of horrour, that a perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent should be cruelly tormented; but to the eye of Faith, under that sad and ignominious appearance, there was a Divine Mystery, able to raise our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ravish our affections. For he that was naked, and nailed to the Cross, was really the Son of God, and the Saviour of Men: And his Death with all the penal circumstances of dishonour and pain, is the only Expiation of sin, and Satisfaction to Justice. He by offering up his <hi>Blood</hi> appea'sd the wrath of God, quencht the flaming Sword that made Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise inaccessible to us; he took away sin, the true dishonour of our natures, and purchased for us the Graces of the Spirit, the richest ornaments of the reasonable Creature. The Doctrine of the Cross
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42565:160"/>
is the only foundation of the Gospel, that unites all its parts, and supports the whole building. 'Tis the cause of our Righteousness and Peace, of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Reconciliation. How blessed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change have the Merits of his Sufferings made with those of our Sins? Life instead of Death, Glory for Shame, and Happiness for Misery. For this reason the Apostle with vehemence declares, that, to be the sole ground of his boasting and triumph, which others esteemed a cause of blushing. <hi>God forbid that I should Glory save in the Cross of Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> He rejects with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme detestation the mention of any other thing, as the cause of his Happiness, and matter of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Cross was a tree of Death to Christ, and of Life to us. The supreme Wisdom is justified of its Children.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Satisfaction of Divine Justice by the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ, affords the strongest assurance to Man, who is a guilty and suspicious creature, that God is most ready to pardon sin. There is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conscience when opened by a piercing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of sin, such a quick sense of Guilt, and Gods Justice, that it can never have an intire confidence in his Mercy, till Justice be atoned. From hence the convinced Sinner is restlesly inquisitive, how to find out the way of reconciliation with a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God. Thus he is represented inquiring by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Mic. 6.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow my self before the most High God? shall I come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with Burnt-Offerings, with Calves of a year old? will the Lord be pleased with thousands of Rams, or with ten thousand rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my Body for the sin of my Soul?</hi> The Scripture tells us that some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd

their Children to render their Idols favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them. But all these means were ineffectual: their most costly Sacrifices were only food for the fire. Nay, instead of expiating their old, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted new sins, and were so far from appeasing, that they inflamed the Wrath of God, by their cruel oblations. But in the Gospel there is the most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and easy way propounded, for the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God and the Justification of Man. <hi>The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thy heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.6, 7, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Who shall ascend into Heaven? (that is to bring down Christ from above) Or who shall descend into the deep? (that is to bring up Christ again from the dead) But if thou wilt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</hi> The Apostle sets forth the anxiety of an awakened Sinner, he is at a loss to find out a way to escape Judgment: for things that are on the surface of the Earth, or floating on the Waters, are within our view, and may be obtain'd: but those that are above our Understanding to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, or Power to obtain, are proverbially said to to be in the Heavens above, or in the Deeps. And 'tis applied here to the different wayes of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the Law and the Gospel. The Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds Life, upon an impossible condition: but the Gospel clearly reveals to us, that Christ hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what is necessary for our Justification, and that by a lively and <hi>practical</hi> Faith we shall have an Interest in it. The Lord Jesus being ascended, hath given us a convincing proof, that the <hi>Propitiation</hi> for our Sins is perfect: For otherwise He had not been received into Gods Sanctuary. Therefore to be under perplexities how we may be justified, is to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42565:161"/>
deny the value of his Righteousness, and the truth of his Ascension. <hi>And say not who shall descend into the deep,</hi> to bear the Torments of Hell, and expiate Sin, this is to deny the vertue of his Death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he appeased God, and redeemed us from the wrath to come. In the Law the condemning Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God is made visible, in the Gospel his justifying Righteousness is revealed, <hi>from Faith to Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.17.</note> And this is an infallible proof of its <hi>divine</hi> descent. For whereas all other Religions either stupifie Conscience, and harden it in <hi>carnal</hi> Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or terrifie it by continual Alarms of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the Gospel alone hath discovered how God may shew Mercy to repenting Sinners without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to his Justice. The Heathens robb'd one Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to enrich another: either they conceived God to be indulgent to their Sins, and easie to pardon, to the prejudice of his Justice; or cruel and reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to the dishonour of his Goodness: But <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are instructed how these are wonderfully recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled and magnified in our Redemption. From hence there is a <hi>divine</hi> calm in the Conscience, <hi>and that Peace which passeth Understanding.</hi> The Soul is not only freed from the Fear of Gods anger, but hath a lively Hope of his Favour and Love. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by the Apostle, when he reckons among the Priviledges of Believers, <hi>That they are come to God the Judg of all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.23,</note> 
               <hi>and to Jesus the Mediator of the New-Covenant, and to the Blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than the blood of</hi> Abel. The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of God as the Judg of the world, strikes the guilty with fear and terrour; but as He is sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Mediator, we may approach to Him with confidence. For what Sins are there which
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42565:161"/>
so entire a Satisfaction doth not expiate? What Torments can they deserve, which his wounds and stripes have not removed? God is Just as well as Merciful in justifying those who believe in <hi>Jesus.</hi> 'Tis not the quality of Sins, but of Sinners that excepts them from Pardon. Christ is the <hi>golden Altar in Heaven</hi> for <hi>penitent</hi> Believers to flie to, from whence God will never pluck any one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From hence we may learn, how absolute a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity there is for our coming to Christ for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>There are but <hi>two</hi> waies of appearing before the Righteous and Supreme Judg.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Innocence and sinless Obedience; or by the Righteousness of Christ: The one is by the Law, the other by Grace. And these <hi>two</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be compounded, for he that pleads Innocence, in that disclaims Favour; and he that sues for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, acknowledges Guilt. Now the <hi>first</hi> cannot be performed by us. For entire Obedience to the Law supposes the integrity of our natures, there being a <hi>Moral</hi> impossibility that the Faculties once cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted should act regularly: But Man is stain'd with <hi>Original</hi> Sin from his Conception. And the form of the Law runs universally, <hi>Cursed is every one that obeys not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> In these Scales <hi>one</hi> evil work preponderates a <hi>thousand</hi> good. If a Man were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but of <hi>one</hi> single Error, his entire Obedience after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards could not save him; for that being alwaies due to the Law, the payment of it cannot discount for the former Debt. So that we cannot in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree be justified by the Law, for there is no middle
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42565:162"/>
between transgressing, and not transgressing it. He that breaks one Article in a Covenant, cuts off his claim to any benefit by it.</p>
            <p>Briefly, the Law Justifies only the Perfect, and condemns without distinction all that are Guilty. So that to pretend Justification by the works of it, is as unreasonable, as for a man to produce in Court the Bond which obliges him to his Creditor, in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he ows him nothing. Whoever presumes to appear before God's Judgment-Seat in his own righteousness, shall be covered with confusion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the Righteousness of Christ. This alone ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves from the Guilt of sin, saves from Hell, and can endure the trial of God's Tribunal. This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle prized as his unvaluable treasure, in comparison of which, <hi>all other things are but dross and dung: that I may be found in him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>not having mine own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith.</hi> That which he ordained, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in the Person of our Redeemer, he cannot but accept. Now this Righteousness is meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously imputed only to Believers. For depending sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Will of God as to its being and effects, it cannot possibly be reckoned to any for their benefit and advantage, but in that way which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. The Lord Christ who made Satisfaction, tells us, that the benefit of it is communicated only through our Believing. <hi>God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>that whosoever believes on him should not perish.</hi> As all sins are mortal in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their guilt, but death is not actually inflicted for them, upon the account of the Grace of the New Covenant: so all sins are venial in respect of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42565:162"/>
made by Christ, but they are not actually pardoned, till the performing of the condition to which pardon is annext. Faith transfers the guilt from the Sinner to the Sacrifice. And this is not an act restrained to the understanding, but principally respects the will, by which we accept or refuse Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The nature of it is best exprest by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-phrase, <hi>the receiving Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.12.</note> which respects the terms, upon which God offers him in the Gospel, <hi>to be our Prince and Saviour.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 5.31.</note> The state of favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins upon our consent to the New Covenant. And how reasonable is the condition it requires? how impossible is it to be otherwise? God is reconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Death of Christ, so that he may exercise Mercy without injury to his Justice and Holiness: He is willing and desirous to be upon terms of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Men, but cannot be actually reconciled till they accept of them: for reconcilement is between two. Though God upon the account of Christ is made placable to the humane nature, which he is not to the Angelical in its lapsed state, and hath condescended so far as to offer conditions of peace to Men, yet they are reconciled at once. That Christ becomes an effectual Mediator, there must be the consent of both parties. As God hath declared his by laying the punishment of our sins on Christ; so Man gives his, by submitting to the Law of Faith. And the great end of Preaching the Gospel is, to overcome the obstinacy of Men, and reconcile them to God, and their happiness: <hi>We are Ambassadours for Christ; and pray you in Christs stead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20.</note> 
               <hi>to be reconciled to God.</hi> With this difference, Christ furnisht the means, they only bring the message of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now Men are with difficulty wrought on, to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42565:163"/>
comply with the conditions of Pardon by Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon the account of a legal Temper that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally inclines them to seek for <hi>Justification</hi> by their own Works. This is most suitable to the Law, &amp; light of nature; for the tenour of the first Covenant was, Do and live. So that the way of Gospel-Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as 'tis supernatural in its discovery, so in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to Mans Principles. Besides, as Pride at first aspir'd to make Man as God, so it tempts him to usurp the honour of Christ to be his own Saviour. He is unwilling to stoop, that he may drink of the Waters of Life. Till the Heart by the weight of its guilt is broken in pieces, and looses its former fashion and figure it will not humbly comply with the offer of Salvation for the Merits of another. And 'tis very remarkable, that upon the first opening of the Gospel, no Evangelical Doctrine was more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relisht by the Jews, than Justification by imputed Righteousness. The Apostle gives this account of their opposition, <hi>that being ignorant of God's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and going about to establish their own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they submitted not to the Righteousness of God.</hi> They were prepossest with this Principle, that Life was to be obtained by their works: because the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press condition of the Law was so. And mistaking the end of its Institution by <hi>Moses,</hi> they set the Law against the Promises. For since the Fall, the Law was given, not absolutely to be a Covenant of Life, but with a design to prepare Men for the Gospel: that upon the sight of their Guilt, and the Curse, they might have recourse to the Redeemer, and by Faith embrace that Satisfaction he hath made for them. <hi>Christ is the end of the Law, for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> 
               <hi>to every one that believeth.</hi> From the example
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:42565:163"/>
of the Jews we may see how Men are naturally affected. And 'tis worthy of observation, that the reformation of Religion took its rise by the same controversie with the Papists, by which the Gospel was first introduced into the World. For besides innumerable abuses crept into the Church, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were perswaded that by purchasing Indulgences, they should be saved from the Wrath of God. And when this darkness covered the face of the Earth, the zeal of the <hi>first</hi> Reformers broke forth; who, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the world, clearly demonstrated from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that Justification is alone obtained by a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and purifying Faith in the Blood of Christ. A strong proof that the same Gospel which was first revealed by the Apostles, was revived by those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Men; and the same Church which was first built by the Apostles, was raised out of its ruines by them.</p>
            <p>Now the Gospel, to eradicate this disposition which is so natural and strong in faln Man, is in nothing more clear and express, than in declaring that <hi>by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified in Gods sight.</hi> The Apostle asserts without distinction,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>that by the Works of the Law Justification cannot be obtained:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.11.</note> whether they proceed from the power of Nature, or the Grace of the Spirit. For he argues against the merit of Works to Justification, not against the principle from whence they proceed. And where he most affectionately declares his esteem of Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.27.</note> and his Righteousness, as the sole meritorious cause of his Justification, he expresly rejects <hi>his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which is of the Law.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.9.</note> By his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, he comprehends all the works of the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as natural state, for they are performed
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42565:164"/>
by Man, and are acts of Obedience to the Law, which commands perfect Love to God. These are withering leaves that cannot conceal our shame, when we appear before God in Judgment. Not but that good works are most pleasing to him, but not for this end, to expiate Sin. We must distinguish between their substance, and the quality that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour giveth them. The opinion of merit changes their nature, and turns Gold into Dross. And if our real Righteousness, how exact soever, cannot absolve us from the least guilt, much less can the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of some external actions, though specious in appearance, yet not commanded by God, and that have no <hi>moral</hi> value. All the Disciplines and Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, whereby men think to make Satisfaction to the Law, are like a Crown of Straw, that dishonours the Head instead of adorning it. But that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which was acquired by the Meritorious Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, and is embraced by Faith, is alsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for our Justification. This is as pure as Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, to all the effects of Pardon and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this alone secures us from the charge of the Law, and the chalenge of Justice. Being clothed with this, we may enter Heaven, and converse with the pure society of Angels without blushing. The Saints who now reign in Glory, were not Men who lived in the perfection of Holiness here below, but Repenting, Believing Sinners, who are washed white in the Blood of the Lamb.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The most universal hinderance of Mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the conditions of Pardon by Christ, is, the predominant love of some Lust. Although Men would entertain him as a Saviour to redeem them from Hell, yet they reject him as their Lord.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42565:164"/>
Those in the <hi>Parable</hi> who said,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.14.</note> 
               <hi>We will not have this. Man to reign over us,</hi> exprest the inward sense and silent thoughts of all <hi>carnal</hi> Men. Many would depend on his Sacrifice, yet will not submit to his Scepter; they would have Christ to pacifie their Consciences, and the world to please their Affections. Thus they divide between the Offices of Christ, his Priestly and his Regal. They would have Christ to die for them, but not to live in them. They divide the <hi>acts</hi> of the same Office: they lean on his Cross to support them from falling to Hell, but Crucifie not one Lust on it. They are desirous he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to God by his Sacrifice, but not to bless them, <hi>in turning them from their Iniquities.</hi> And thus in effect they absolutely refuse him,<note place="margin">Act. 3.26.</note> and render his Death unavailable. For the receiving of Christ as Mediator in all his Offices, is the Condition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably requisite to partake of the Benefits of his Sufferings. The Resigning up of our selves to him as our Prince, is as necessary an act of justifying Faith, as the Apprehending the Crucified Saviour. So that in every real <hi>Christian,</hi> Faith is the Principle of Obedience and Peace, and is as inseparable from Holiness as from Salvation.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Argument: From hence we may see, How desperate the state is of <hi>impenitent</hi> Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. They are cut off from any claim to the Benefits of Christs Death. The Law of Faith, like that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> is unalterable. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life.</hi> Christ died not to expiate final Infidelity. This is the <hi>mortal</hi> Sin, that <hi>actually</hi> damns. It charges all their guilt upon Sinners: It renders the Sufferings of Christ fruitless and ineffectual to them. For 'tis
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42565:165"/>
not the Preparation of a Sovereign Remedy that cures the Disease, but the applying it. As our Sins were imputed to him, upon the account of his Union with us in nature, and his consent to be our Surety; so his Righteousness is <hi>meritoriously</hi> imputed to us, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Union with him by a lively Faith. The man that lookt on the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> when he was ready to be drown'd, what relief was it to him; that God had promised not to drown the world, when he must perish in the waters? So though Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased Pardon for repenting Believers,<note place="margin">Rev. 4.3.</note> and <hi>a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow encompasses the Throne of God,</hi> the sign of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, what advantage is this to the Unbeliever, who dies in his Sins and drops into the Lake of Fire? 'Tis not from any defect of Mercy in God, or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in Christ, but for the obstinate refusal of it, that men certainly perish. This inhances their Guilt and Misery. All the rich expence of Grace for their Redemption shall be charged upon them. The Blood of Christ shall not be imputed for their Ransom, but for their deeper Damnation: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of speaking better things than the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> shall call louder for Vengeance against them than that innocent blood which reacht Heaven with its voice against the Murderer. <hi>Briefly,</hi> whom so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Sacrifice doth not redeem, they are reserved entire <hi>victims,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 9.49.</note> whole burnt Offerings to Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. Every impenitent Unbeliever shall be <hi>salted with fire.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p> Of all the Divine Perfections <hi>Holiness</hi> is peculiarly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable. The honour of it is secured in our <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In the bitter Sufferings of <hi>Christ</hi> God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Himself unappeasable to Sin, though appease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Sinners. The Priviledges purchased by Christ, are conveighed upon <hi>terms</hi> honourable to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. Pardon of <hi>Sin, Adoption,</hi> the Inheritance of <hi>Glory</hi> are annexed to special Qualifications in those who receive them. The <hi>Redeemer</hi> is made a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Principle to inspire us with new Life. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our <hi>Sanctification</hi> He hath given us the most perfect <hi>Rule</hi> of Holiness, He exhibited a compleat Pattern of it, He purchas'd and conveyes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Holiness to us. He presents the strongest <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> to perswade us to be holy. The perfect Laws of Christ are considered, as they enjoin an absolute sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from all Evil, and command the practice of all substantial Goodness. Some particular Precepts, which the <hi>Gospel</hi> especially enforces, with the <hi>Reasons</hi> of them are considered.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>OF all the Perfections of the <hi>Deity,</hi> none is more worthy of his Nature, and so peculiarly admirable as his Infinite Purity. 'Tis the most shining <hi>Attribute</hi> that derives a lustre to all the rest: <hi>He is glorious in Holiness.</hi> Wisdom degenerates into Craft, Power into Tyranny,<note place="margin">Exod. 15.15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>I
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42565:166"/>
will not lie unto</hi> David. 'Tis the most <hi>venerable</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, in the Praise whereof the Harmony of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven agrees. The Angels and Saints above are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, expressing their <hi>extasy</hi> and ravishment at the beauty of Holiness.<note place="margin">Isa. 6.3. Rev. 4.8. Psal. 147.10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</hi> This He only loves and values in the Creature, being the Impression of his most Divine and amiable Perfection. Inferiour Creatures have a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of other Divine Attributes: The Winds and Thunder set forth God's Power, the firmness of the Rocks, and the incorruptibility of the Heavens are an obscure representation of his Unchangeableness; but Holiness, that is the most Orient-Pearl in the Crown of Heaven, only shines in the reasonable Creature. Upon this account Man only is said to be formed after his Image. And in Men there are some appearances of the Deity, that do not entitle to his special Love. In Princes there is a shadow of his Sovereignty, yet they may be the objects of his displeasure; but a likeness to God in Holiness atracts his Eye and Heart, and infinitely endears the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to him. Now this Attribute is in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner provokt by Mans sin, and we are restored to the favour and friendship of God, in such a manner, as may preserve the Honour of it intire and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>This will fully appear by considering what our Redeemer suffered for the purchasing our Pardon, and the terms upon which the precious Benefits of his Death are conveied to us, and what he hath done to restore our lost Holiness, that we may be qualified for the enjoyment of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's Infinite Purity is declared in his Justice,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42565:166"/>
in that He would not pardon Sin but upon such terms as might fully demonstrate how odious 'twas to him. What inflam'd the Wrath of God against his Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, whom by a voice from Heaven he declared to be the object of his delight? What made Him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable to his Prayers and Tears, when He solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Divine Power and Love, the Attributes that relieve the miserable, crying, <hi>Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee, let this Cup pass from me?</hi> What made him suspend all comforting Influences, and by a dreadful Desertion afflict him when he was environ'd with Sorrows? 'Tis Sin only that caused this fierce displeasure, not <hi>inherent, (for the</hi> Messiah <hi>was cut off but not for himself,</hi>) but <hi>imputed</hi> by his voluntary undertaking for us. <hi>God so loved the World,</hi> and so hated Sin, that He gave his Son to purchase our Pardon by Sufferings. When his Compassions to Man were at the highest, yet then his <hi>antipathy</hi> against Sin was so strong, that no less Sacrifice could reconcile Him to us. Thus God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself to be unappeasable to Sin, though not to Sinners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Priviledges that are purchased by our Redeemers Sufferings, are dispenst upon those terms which are honourable to Gods Holiness. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the <hi>three</hi> great Benefits of the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Covenant. The Pardon of Sin, Adoption into God's Family, and the Inheritance of Glory. All which are conditional, and annext to special Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in the persons who have a title to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Death of Christ is beneficial to Pardon and Life, only to those who repent and believe. The Holy God will by no means spare the guilty, that is, declare the guilty innocent, or forgive an

All the Promises of Grace and Mercy are with respect to Repentance from dead works, and to a lively Faith. <hi>The Son of God is made a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance and Remission of Sins.</hi> And the Apostle tells us, <hi>That being justified by Faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> includes a <hi>cordial</hi> grief for Sins past, and sincere effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions to forsake them; and hath a necessary conjunction with Pardon, as by vertue of the Divine Command, so from a <hi>condecency</hi> and fitness with respect to God the giver of Pardon, and to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Blessing it self. The other Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Faith, to which Justification is in a special manner attributed, not in respect of Efficiency or Merit, for the Mercy of God upon the account of Christs Satisfaction is the sole Cause of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; but as a <hi>moral</hi> instrument, that is the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which God absolves Man from his guilt. And this Grace of Faith as it respects entire Christ in all his Offices, so it contains the Seed and <hi>first</hi> Life of <hi>Evangelical</hi> Obedience. It crucifies our Lusts, overcomes the World, works by Love, as well as justifies the person by relying on the Merits of Christ for Salvation.</p>

'Tis equally impossible for the Creature to be happy without the favour of the Holy God, and for God to communicate His favour to the sinful Creature.

            <p n="3">3. Man in his corrupt state is deprived of Spiritual Life, so that till he is revived by special Grace, he can neither obey nor enjoy God. Now the Redeemer is made a quickning Principle to inspire us with new life.</p>
            <p>In order to our Sanctification he hath done four things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He hath given to us the most perfect Laws as the Rule of Holiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He exhibited the most compleat Patern of Holiness in his Life upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He purchas'd and conveyes the Spirit of Holiness, to renew, and to enable us for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our Duties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He hath presented the strongest induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and motives to perswade us to be Holy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He hath given to Men the most perfect Laws as the rule of Holiness. The principal parts of the Holy Life, <hi>are ceasing from evil, and the doing well.</hi> Now the Commands of Christ refer to the purifying of us from sin,<note place="margin">Isa. 1.16, 17.</note> and the adorning us with all Graces
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42565:168"/>
for the discharge of our universal Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They enjoyn a real and absolute separation, <hi>from all filthiness of the Flesh and Spirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> The outward and inward Man must be cleansed not only from Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a deeper dy, but from all Carnality and Hypocrisie. <hi>The Grace of God that brings Salvation hath appeared to all Men,</hi>

The Gospel is most clear, full, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, for the true and inward Mortification of the whole body of corruption, of every particular darling sin. It commands us <hi>to pluck out the right eye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and to cut off the right hand:</hi> That is, to part with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grateful and gainful lust.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.2, 11.</note> It obliges us to <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Flesh, with the affections and lusts.</hi> Humane Laws regard External actions as prejudicial to Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties: but thoughts and resolutions that break not forth into act, are not within the Jurisdiction of the Magistrate. But the Law of Christ reforms the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of the Soul, and all the most secret and inward motions that depend upon them. It forbids the first irregular desires of the carnal appetite. We must hate sin in all its degrees, strangle it in the birth, destroy it in the conception. We are enjoyned to fly the appearances and accesses of evil; what ever is of a suspitious nature, and not fully consistent with the purity of the Gospel, and what ever invites to sin and exposes us to the power of it, becomes vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and must be avoided. That glorious purity, that shall adorn the Church when our Redeemer presents it <hi>without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The Precepts of Christ contain all solid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial goodness, that is essentially necessary in order to our supreme Happiness, and prepares us for the Life of Heaven. In his Sermon on the Mount, He commends to us Humility, Meekness, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Peaceableness and Patience, and doing good for evil, which are so many beams of Gods Image, the reflections of his Goodness upon intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And that comprehensive precept of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle describes the Duties of all Christians: <hi>whatsoever things are true</hi>;<note place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note> Truth is the principal character of our profession, and is to be exprest in our Words and Actions: <hi>whatsoever things are honest,</hi> or venerable, that is answer the dignity of our High-calling, and agree with the gravity and comeliness of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profession: <hi>whatsoever things are just</hi> according to Divine and Humane Laws: <hi>whatsoever things are pure,</hi> we must preserve the Heart, the Hand, the Tongue, the Eye from impurity; <hi>whatsoever things are lovely and of good report,</hi> some Graces are amiable and attractive in the view of Men, as easiness to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, a readiness to oblige, compassion to the afflicted, liberality to the necessitous, sweetness of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without gall and bitterness: these are of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal esteem with mankind, and soften the most savage tempers. <hi>If there be any Vertue, and if there be any Praise think on these things.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> excites Believers, to joyn to their Faith, by which the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christ is embrac't, Intellectual and Moral vertues, without which 'tis but a vain picture of

            <p>I will take a more distinct view of the Precepts of Christ as they are set down in that excellent abridgement of them by the Apostle. <hi>The Grace of</hi> God <hi>that bringeth Salvation hath appeared to all Men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11, 12</note> 
               <hi>teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live Soberly, Righteously, and Godly in this present world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a distribution of our duties with respect to their several Objects, our selves, others, and God. The first are regulated by Temperance, the second by Justice, the third by Godliness. And from the accomplishment of these is formed that Holiness without which no man shall see God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In respect to our selves; we must live sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Temperance governs the sensual appetites and affections by sanctified reason. The Gospel allows the sober and chast use of pleasures, but absolutely and severely forbids all excess in those that are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and abstinence from all that are unlawful, that stain &amp; vilify the Soul, and alienate it from converse with God, and mortifie its lust to spiritual delights. By sensual complacency Man first lost his Innocence and Happiness, and till the flesh is subdued to the spirit, he can never recover them. <hi>The carnal mind is
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42565:170"/>
enmity against God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>Fleshly lusts war against the Soul.</hi> Therefore we are urged with the most affectionate earnestness, <hi>to abstain from them,</hi> by withdrawing their incentives, and crucifying our corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In short, the Law of Christ obliges us, as to deal with the body as an enemy, (that is disposed to revolt against the Spirit) by watching over all our senses, lest they should betray us to temptations, so to preserve it as a thing consecrated to God, from all impurity, that will render it unworthy the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being the Temple of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are commanded to live Righteously, in our relation to others. Justice is the supreme Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of humane Life, that renders to every one what is due. The Gospel gives rules for Men in every state and place, to do what Reason requires. As no condition is excluded from its Blessedness, so eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is obliged by its Precepts. Subjects are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to obey all the lawful commands of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1, 2.</note> and <hi>not resist</hi>; and that upon the strongest motive <hi>not onely for Wrath, but for Conscience.</hi> They must obey Man for Gods sake,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13. Act. 5.29.</note> but never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey God for Mans sake. <hi>And Princes are obliged to be an encouragement to good Works, and a terror to the evil;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> 
               <hi>that those who are under them may lead a quiet and a peaceable life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.2.</note> 
               <hi>in all Godliness and Honesty.</hi> It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes all the respective duties of Husbands, and Wives,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> Parents, and Children, Masters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.

                     </gap>s ille Religiosior qui justior,</hi> Minut.</note> accordingly in the esteem of Christians, he is more religious who is more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous than others. Briefly, Christian righteousness is not to be measured by the rigor of Laws, but by that rule of universal Equity delivered by our Saviour,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42565:170"/>
               <hi>Whatsoever ye would have others do to you, do it to them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.12.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We are instructed by the Law of Christ to live Godly. This part of our duty respects our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, affections and demeanour to God, which must be sutable to his Glorious perfections. The Gospel hath revealed them clearly to us, <hi>viz.</hi> the Unity, Simplicity, Eternity and Purity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, that it subsists in three Persons, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit, and his Wisdom Power and Goodness in the Work of our Redemption. It requires that we pay the special Honour that is due to God, in the esteem and veneration of our Minds, in the subjection of our Wills, in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of our Affections to him as their proper object. That we have an intire Faith in his Word, a firm Hope in his Promises, a Holy Jealousie for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a Religious care in his Service. And that we express our reverence, love, and dependance on him in our Prayers and Praises. That our Worshp of Him be in such a manner, as becomes God who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it, and Man that presents it. God is a pure Spirit, and Man is a reasonable Creature, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e must worship him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> And since Man in his fallen State cannot approach the Holy and Just God without a Mediator, he is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gospel to address himself to the <hi>Throne of Grace, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> who alone can reconcile our Persons, and render our Services acceptable with his Father.</p>
            <p>Besides the immediate service of the Deity, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness includes the propension and tendency of the Soul to him in the whole conversation, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Obedience proceeds from love to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42565:171"/>
God as its vital Principle. This must warm and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the external action: this alone makes Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as delightful to us, so pleasing to God. <hi>He shews Mercy to those who love him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 20.6.</note> 
               <hi>Faith works by Love,</hi> and enclines the Soul to obey with the same Affection, that God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins the Precept.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all our Conversation be regulated by his Will as the Rule. He is our Father and Sovereign, and the respect to his Law gives to every action the formality of Obedience. We must choose our Duty because he commands it. <hi>Whatsoever ye do in word, or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,</hi> that is, for his command, and by his assistance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Glory of God be the supreme End of all our Actions. This Qualification must adhere not only to necessary Duties, but to our natural and civil Actions. <hi>Our light must so shine before men, that they may see our good works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.16. 1 Cor. 10.31</note> 
               <hi>and glorifie our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven. Whether we eat or drink, or whatsoever we do, all must be done in a regular, and due proportion to the Glory of God.</hi> A general Designation of this is absolutely requisite,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.11.</note> and the renewing of our intentions <hi>actually</hi> in matters of moment. For He being the <hi>sole</hi> Author of our Lives and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.19, 20.</note> we cannot without extream ingratitude and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, neglect to <hi>glorifie Him in our Bodies and Spirits which are his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Religious tendency of the Soul to God, as the Supreme Lord and our utmost End, sanctifies our Actions, and gives an excellency to them above what is inherent in their own nature. Thus <hi>moral</hi> Duties towards Men,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.16.</note> when they are directed to God, become <hi>Divine.</hi> Acts of Charity are so many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42565:171"/>
Oblations to the Deity. Men are but the Altars upon which we lay our Presents, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them, as if immediatly offer'd to his Majesty, and consumed to his Honour. Such was the charity of the <hi>Philippians</hi> towards the relief of the Apostle, which he calls <hi>An odour of a sweet smell, a Saerifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4.18.</note> The same Bounty was an act of Compassion to Man, and Devotion to God. This changes the nature of the meanest and most troublesome things. What was more vile and harsh than the employment of a Slave, yet a respect to God makes it a Religious Service, that is the most noble &amp; voluntary of all <hi>humane</hi> Actions. For the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever addressing <hi>his service to Christ,</hi> and the Infidel only to his Master,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.5.</note> he doth chearfully what the other doth by constraint,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.10.</note> and <hi>adorns the Gospel of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> as truly, as if he were in a higher condition.</p>
            <p>All Vertues are of the same descent and family, though in respect of the matter about which they are conversant, and their exercise they are different, Some are <hi>heroical,</hi> some are humble, and the lowest being conducted by Love to God in the meanest offices, shall have an eternal Reward. In short, Piety is the principle and chief ingredient of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Charity to Men. For since God is the Author of our common Nature, and the relations whereby we are united one to another, 'tis necessary that a regard to him should be the <hi>first,</hi> and have an influence upon all other Duties.</p>
            <p>I shall further consider some particular Precepts, which the Gospel doth especially enforce upon us, and the Reasons of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That concerning <hi>Humility,</hi> the peculiar Grace of Christians, so becoming our state as Creatures
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42565:172"/>
and Sinners, the parent and nurse of other Graces, that preserves in us the light of Faith, and the heat of Love; that procures Modesty in Prosperity, and Patience in Adversity; that is the root of Gratitude and Obedience, and is so lovely in God's eyes, that <hi>He gives Grace to the Humble:</hi> This our Saviour makes a necessary qualification in all those who shall enter into his Kingdom; <hi>Except ye be converted and become as little children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18.3.</note> 
               <hi>ye shall not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> As by Humility he purchas'd our Salvation, so by that Grace we possess it. And since Pride arises out of Ignorance, the Gospel to cause in us a just and lowly sense of our unworthiness, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the nakedness and misery of the <hi>humane</hi> Nature, devested of its <hi>primitive</hi> Righteousness. It reveals the <hi>transmission</hi> of Original Sin, from the <hi>first</hi> Man to all his Posterity, wherewith they are infected and debased; a Mystery so far from our knowledg, that the participation of it seems impossible, and unjust to <hi>carnal</hi> Reason.<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> 
               <hi>We are dead in Sins and Trespasses,</hi> without any Spiritual strength to perform our Duty. The Gospel ascribes all that is good in Man to the free and powerful Grace of God. <hi>He works in us to will and to do of his good pleasure.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.12.</note> He gives Grace to some because He he is Good, denies it to others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause He is Just, but doth injury to none, because all being guilty, He owes it to none. Grace in its being and activity entirely depends upon Him. As the drowsie Sap is drawn forth into flourishing and fruitfulness by the approaches of the Sun; so <hi>habitual</hi> Grace is drawn forth into <hi>act</hi> by the presence and influences of the Sun of Righteousness. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 15.</note> our Saviour tells his Disciples, <hi>ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I have laboured more abundantly than they all,</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:42565:172"/>
saith the Apostle, <hi>yet not I,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.10</note> 
               <hi>but the Grace of</hi> God <hi>in me.</hi> The operations of Grace are ours, but the Power that enables us is from God. Our preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from Evil, and perseverance in Good, is a most free unmerited Favour, the effect of his renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Grace in the course of our Lives. Without his special assistance, we should every hour forsake Him, and provoke Him to forsake us. As the Iron can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ascend or hang in the Air longer than the virtue of the Loadstone draws it; So our Affections can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ascend to those glorious things that are above, without the continually attracting Power of Grace. 'Tis by humble Prayer wherein we acknowledg our wants and unworthiness, and declare our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Divine Mercy and Power, that we obtain Grace. Now from these Reasons the Gospel commands Humility, in our demeanor towards God and Men. And if we seriously consider them, how can any <hi>crevise</hi> be opened in the heart for the least breath of Pride to enter? How can a poor diseased wretch that hath neither Money, nor can by any industry procure nourishment, or Physick for his deadly Diseases, and receives from a merciful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son not only Food, but Soveraign Medicines brought from another World (for such is the Divine Grace sent to us from Heaven) without his desert, or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of <hi>retribution,</hi> be proud towards his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor? How can he that only lives upon Alms, boast that he is rich? How can a Creature be proud of the Gifts of God, which it cannot possess without Humility, and without acknowledging that they are derived from Mercy? If we had continued in our Integrity, the praise of all had been entirely due to God; For our Faculties and the excellent disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:42565:173"/>
that fitted them for action, were bestowed upon us freely by Him, and depended upon his Grace in their exercise. But there is now greater reason to attribute the Glory of all our goodness solely to him: for He revives our dead Souls by the infusion of Grace, without which we are <hi>to every good work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</hi> Since all our Spiritual Abilities are Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the more we have received the more we are obliged, and therefore should be more humble and thankful to the Author of them. And in comparing our selves with others, the Gospel forbids all proud reflections upon our selves as dignified above them, <hi>For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou that thou didst not receive? And if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</hi> If God discern one from another by special gifts, the Man hath nothing of his own that makes him excellent. Although inherent Graces command a respect from others to the Person in whom they shine, yet he that possesses them ought rather to consider himself in those qualities that are natural, and make him like the worst, than in those that are divine, proceeding from the <hi>sole</hi> Favour of God, and that exalt him above them.</p>
            <p>Add further, that God hath ordained in the Gospel Repentance, and Faith, which are humbling Graces, to be the conditions of our obtaining Pardon. By Repentance we acknowledge that if we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, 'tis just severity, and if we are Saved 'tis rich Mercy.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.27. Rom. 4.</note> And Faith absolutely excludes boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For it supposes the Creature guilty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Pardon from the Sovereign Grace of God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of our Crucified Redeemer. The benefit, and the manner of our receiving it was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42565:173"/>
in the miraculous cure of the Israelites by looking up to the Brasen Serpent. For the act of seeing is performed by receiving the Images which are derived from the objects: 'tis rather a Passion then an Action; that it might appear that the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue was meerly from the Power of God, and the Honor of it intirely his. In short, God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the lowliness of this Grace, in appointing it to be the qualification of a Justified person: for the most firm reliance on Gods Mercy, is alwayes joyned with the strongest renouncing of our own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Briefly, to excite humility in us, the Gospel tells us, that the Glorious reward is from rich bounty and liberality.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> 
               <hi>The gift of God is Eternal Life through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our Lord.</hi> As the Election of us to Glory, so the actual possession of it proceeds from pure Favour. There is no more proportion between all our Services and that High and Eternal felicity; than between the running a few steps, and the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Imperial Crown. Indeed not only Heaven, but all the Graces that are necessary to purify and prepare us for it, we receive from undeserved Mercy. So that God crowns in us not our proper Works, but his own proper Gifts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Gospel strictly commands Self-denial, when the Honor of God and Religion is concern'd. Jesus tells his Disciples, <hi>If any Man will come after me, let him deny himself,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.24.</note> 
               <hi>and take up his Cross and follow me.</hi> Life and all the endearments of it, Estates, Honours, Relations, Pleasures must be put under our feet, to take the first step with our Redeemer. This is absolutely necessary to the being of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. In the preparation of his mind and the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his will, he must live a Martyr, and whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42565:174"/>
his duty requires, he must break all the <hi>Retina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula Vitae,</hi> the voluntary bands that fasten us to the World, and die a Martyr, rather than suffer a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce to be made between his Heart and Christ. Whatsoever is most esteem'd and lov'd in the world, must be parted with as a snare, if it tempts us from our Obedience; or offered up as a Sacrifice, when the Glory of God calls for it. And this command that appears so hard to sense, is most just and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For God hath by so many titles a right to us, that we ought to make an intire Dedication of our selves and our most valuable interests to him. Our Redeemer infinitely denied himself to save us, and 'tis most just we should in gratitude deny our selves to serve him. Besides, an infinite advantage redounds to us: for our Saviour assures us, that <hi>whosoever will save his life when 'tis inconsistent with the performance of his duty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.25.</note> 
               <hi>shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for his sake, shall find it.</hi> Now what is more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than of two evils that are propounded to choose the least? that is, Temporal Death, rather than Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and of two goods that are offered to our choice, to prefer the greater, a Life in Heaven, before that on the Earth. Especially if we consider that we must shortly yeeld the present life to the infirmities of Nature, and 'tis the richest traffick to exchange that which is frail and mortal, for that which remains in its perfection for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Gospel enjoyns Universal Love among Men.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note> This is <hi>that fire which Christ came to kindle upon the Earth</hi>; 'tis the abridgment of all Christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, the fulfilling of the Divine Law, for all the particular Precepts are in substance, Love. He that loves his Neighbor will have a tender regard to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42565:174"/>
his Life, Honour and Estate, which is the sum of the second Table. The extent of our Love must be to all that partake of the same common nature. The universal consanguinity between Men should make us regard them as our allies. Every Man that wants our help is our Neighbour. <hi>Do good to all,</hi> is the command of the Apostle.<note place="margin">Luk. 10.36. Gal. 6.10. 1 Pet. 1.22. Rom. 12.9.</note> For the quality of our Love it <hi>must be unfeigned without dissimulation.</hi> The Image of it in Words without real Effects, provokes the Divine displeasure: for as all falshood is odious to the God of Truth, so especially the counterfeiting of Charity, that is the impression of his Spirit, and the seal of his Kingdom. A sincere pure affection, that rejoyces at the good, and resents the evils of others as our own, and expresses it self in all real Offices, not for our private respects, but their benefit, is required of us. And as to the degree of our Love,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.8.</note> we are commanded <hi>above all things to have fervent Charity among our selves.</hi> This princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally respects Christians,<note place="margin">

Christian Charity hath a more noble Principle than the affections of nature, for it proceeds from the Love of God shed abroad in Believers, to make them one Heart and one Soul, and a more Divine pattern, which is the Example of Christ; Who hath by his Sufferings restored us to the Favour of God, that we should Love one another, as He hath Loved us. This Duty is most stricty injoyn'd, for without Love, Angelical Eloquence is but an empty noise,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> and all other Virtues have but a false lustre; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, Faith, Knowledge, Miracles, the highest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42565:175"/>
Acts of Charity or Self-denial, the giving our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states to the Poor, or Bodies to Martyrdom, are neither pleasing to God, nor profitable to him that does them.</p>
            <p>Besides, That special branch of Love, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of Injuries, is the peculiar Precept of our Saviour. For the whole World consents to the returning evil for evil. The vicious Love of our selves makes us very sensible, and according to our preverse judgments to revenge an injury, seems as just as to requite a benefit. From hence revenge is the most Rebellious and Obstinate Passion. An Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence remains as a thorn in the mind, that inflames and torments it, till 'tis appeased by a vindication. 'Tis more difficult to <hi>overcome the Spirit then to gain a Battel.</hi> We are apt to revolve in our thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries that have been done to us, and after a long distance of time the memory represents them as fresh as at the first. Now the Gospel commands a hearty and intire forgiveness of injuries, though repeated never so often <hi>to seventy seven times.</hi> We must not only quench the Fire of Anger, but kindle the Fire of Love towards our greatest Enemies. <hi>I say unto you, Love your Enemies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.44.</note> 
               <hi>Bless them that Curse you, do good to them that hate you, Pray for them which despitefully use you, and Persecute you.</hi> This is urged from the consideration <hi>of God's forgiving us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3.13.</note> who being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely provoked, yet pardons innumerable faults to us, moved only by his Mercy. And how reasonable is it that we should at his command remit a few faults to our Brethren? To extinguish the strong inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in corrupt Nature to revenge, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath suspended the Promise of Pardon to us upon our pardoning others. <hi>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42565:175"/>
you. But if ye forgive not their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</hi> He that is cruel to another cannot expect Mercy, but in every Prayer to God indites himself, and virtually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces his own Condemnation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Gospel enjoins Contentment in every state, which is our great Duty and Felicity, mainly influential upon our whole life, to prevent both Sin and Misery. <hi>Be content with such things as you have, for he hath said, I will never leave thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>nor forsake thee.</hi> It forbids all Murmurings against Providence, which is the seed of Rebellion, and all anxious thoughts concerning things future. <hi>Take no thought for to morrow,</hi> we should not anticipate evils,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.31.</note> by our apprehensions and fears, they come fast enough; <hi>Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</hi> Our corrupt Desires are vast and restless as the Sea, and when contradicted they betray us to Discontent and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. The <hi>Gospel</hi> therefore retrenches all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Affections, and vehemently condemns Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, as a Vice not to be <hi>named among Saints</hi> but with abhorrency. It discovers to us most clearly, that temporal things are not the materials of our Happiness. For the Son of God voluntarily denied himself the enjoyment of them. And as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Stars are so much distant from an <hi>Eclipse,</hi> as they are above the Shadow of the Earth; so the Soul that in its esteem and desires is above the world, its brightness and joy cannot be darkened or eclipsed by any accidents there. The Gospel forbids all vain Sorrows, as well as vain Pleasures; and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes real Godliness from an appearance, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment as its inseparable Character. <hi>Godliness with Content is great gain.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.6.</note> When we are in the saddest
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42565:176"/>
circumstances, our Saviour commands us <hi>to possess our Souls in Patience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 29.19.</note> to preserve a calm Constitution of Spirit, which no storms from without can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose. For this end he assures us that nothing comes to pass without the Knowledge and Efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or at least, Permission of God. <hi>That the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irs of our Head are numbred, and not one falls to the Earth without his License.</hi> Now the serious belief of a Wise, Just and Powerful Providence that governs all things, hath a mighty efficacy to maintain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant tranquillity and equal temper in the Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the confusions of the World. <hi>God works all things according to the counsel of his own will:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 1.11.</note> and if we could discover the immediate reasons of every Providence, we cannot have more satisfaction then from this General Principle, that is applicable to all, as light to every colour, That what God doth is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways best. This resolves all the doubts of the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled minds, and rectifies our false judgments. From hence a Believer hath as true content in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with God's Will, as if God had complyed with his, and is reconciled to every condition. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Gospel assures us, <hi>that all things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the good of those that love</hi> God. For their Spiritual good at present;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> by weakening their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: for affliction is a kind of manage, by which the sensual part is exercised and made pliable to the motions of the Spirit: and by increasing their Graces, the unvaluable Treasures of Heaven. If the dearest Objects of our Affections, the most worthy of our Love and Grief are taken away, 'tis for this reason, that God may have our Love himself, in its most full and inflamed degree. And Afflictions are in order to their Everlasting good. Now the certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42565:176"/>
of a blessed issue out of all troubles, is to the Heart of a Christian as the putting a Rudder to a Ship, which without it is exposed to the fury of the winds, and in continual dangers, but by its guidance makes use of every Wind to convey it to its Port. Hope produces not only acquiescence,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.12.</note> but joy in the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest Tribulations. For every true Christian being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to a Glorious and Supernatural Blessedness hereafter; all things that befal them here below, as means, are regulated and transformed into the nature of the End to which they carry them. Thus temporal evils are turned into good. <hi>Our light Afflictions which are but for a moment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4</note> 
               <hi>work for us a far more exceeding weight of Glory.</hi> To consider this Life as the passage to another, that is as durable as Eternity, and as blessed as the Enjoyment of God can make it; that the present miseries have a final respect to future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, will change our opinion about them, and render them not only tolerable, but so far eligible as they are instrumental and preparatory for it. If the Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as well as the Milky way leads to God's Throne, a Christian willingly walks in it.</p>
            <p>In short, A lively Hope, accompanies a Christian to his last expiring breath, till it is consummated in Celestial fruition. So that Death it self, the universal terror of Mankind, is made desirable, as an entrance into Immortality, and the first day of our Triumph. Thus I have considered some particular Precepts of Christ, which are of greatest use for the government of our Hearts and Lives; and the reasons upon which they are grounded, to make them effectual. Now to discover more fully the compleatness of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Rule, I will consider it with respect to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Philosophy of the Heathens.</p>

            <p>THe Perfection of the Laws of Christ will further appear, by comparing them with the Precepts of <hi>Moses,</hi> and with the Rules which the highest Masters of Morality in the School of Nature have prescribed for the directing our lives.

            <p n="1">1. In ordaining a Service that is Pure, Spiritual, and Divine, consisting in the Contemplation, Love and Praises of God, such as the holy Angels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form above. The Temple-Service was managed with Pomp and external Magnificence, suitable to the disposition of that People, and the dispensation of the Law. The Church was then <hi>in its Infant-state,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it; and that Age is more wrought on by Sense than Reason: For such is the subordination of our Faculties, that the <hi>vegetative</hi> first acts, then the <hi>sensitive,</hi> then the <hi>rational,</hi> as the <hi>organs</hi> appointed for its use, acquire perfection. The knowledg of the <hi>Jews</hi> was obscure and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the <hi>external</hi> part of their Religion was ordered in such a manner, that the senses were much affected. Their Lights, Perfumes, Musick and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were the proper entertainment of their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Faculties. Besides, being encompast with Nations whose Service to their Idols was full of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, to render the temptation ineffectual, and take off from the efficacy of those allurements which might seduce them to the imitation of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, God ordain'd his Service to be performed with
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42565:178"/>
great splendour. Add further, The Dispensation of the Law was <hi>typical</hi> and <hi>mysterious,</hi> representing by visible <hi>material</hi> objects, and their power to ravish the Senses, Spiritual things, and their efficacy to work upon the Soul. But our Redeemer hath rent the Vail, and brought forth Heavenly things into a full Day, and the clearest Evidence. Whereas <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was very exact in describing the numerous Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion, the quality of their Sacrifices, the Place, the Persons by whom they must be prepared and presented to the Lord: We are now commanded to draw near to God with <hi>cleansed hands and purified hearts, and that Men Pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Every place is a Temple, and every Christian a Priest, to offer up Spiritual Incense to God. The most of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies and Ornaments are excluded from the <hi>Christian</hi> Service, not only as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, but inconsistent with its Spiritualness: As Paint, they corrupt the native beauty of Religion. The Apostle tells us, that <hi>humane</hi> Eloquence was not used in the first preaching of the Gospel, lest it should render the truth of it uncertain, and rob the Cross of Christ of its Glory in converting the World: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Besides, upon another account outward Pomp in Religion is apter

to quench than en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ame Devotion: For we are so compounded of Flesh and Spirit, that when the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> Faculties are vehemently affected with their <hi>objects,</hi> 'tis very hard for the Spiritual to act with equal vigour; there being such commerce between the fancy and the outward Senses, that they are never exercised in the reception of their objects, but the Imagination is drawn that way, and cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the mind distinctly and with the calmness that is requisit, those things on which our thoughts should be fixt. But when those diverting objects are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Soul directly ascends to God, and looks on him as the Searcher and Judge of the Heart; and worships him proportionally to his perfections. That this was the design of Christ, appears particularly in the Institution of the Sacraments, which he ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a merciful condescension to our present state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there is a natural desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they are few in number, on Baptism and the Lords Supper, simple in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and easy in their signification, most fit to relieve our infirmity, and to raise our Souls to Heavenly things.

But the Gospel frees us from the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable yoke of the legal abstinencies, observations, and disciplines, the amusements of low and servile Spirits, wherewith they would compensate their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in real Holiness, and exchange the substance of Religion for the shadow and colours of it.

The indulgence of Polygamy and Divorce that was granted to the Jews, is taken away by Christ, and Marriage restored to the purity of its first Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. The permission of these was by a political Law, and the effect was temporal Impunity. For God is to be considered not only in the relation of a
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:42565:179"/>
Creator and universal Governour, that gave Laws to regulate Conscience, but in a special relation to the Jews as their King. And as in a Civil State a prudent Governour permits a less evil, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a greater, without an approbation of it; So God was pleased in his Wisdom to tolerate those things, in condescension to their carnal and perverse humors, <hi>for the hardness of their Hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 2.14, 15.

               <note place="margin">Mat. 19.4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>and they twain shall be one flesh. What therefore God hath joyned together, let no Man put asunder.</hi> From the unity of the Person, that one Male was made and one Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, it follows that the super-inducing of another into the Marriage-bed is against the first Institution. And the Union that is between them not being only civil in a consent of wills, but natural by the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two bodies, something natural must inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene to dissolve it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Adultery of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Our Redeemer hath improved the obligations of the moral Law, by a clearer discovery of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and extent of its precepts, and by peculiar and powerful Enforcements. In his Sermon on the Mount he clears it from the darkning glosses of the <hi>Phaisees,</hi> who observed the letter of the Law, but not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of the Lawgiver. He declares that not only the gross act, but all things of the same alliance are forbidden; not only Murder, but rash Anger, and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42565:180"/>
words, which wound the Reputation. Not only actual pollution, but the impurity of the Eye, and the staining of the Soul with unclean thoughts, are all comprised in the prohibition. He informs them that every Man in calamity is their Neighbour, and to be relieved, and commands them to love their deadliest enemies. Briefly, He tells the multitude, <hi>that unless their Righteousness exceed the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Scribes and Pharisees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> that is, the utmost that they thought themselves obliged to, <hi>they should not enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Besides, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath superadded special Enforcements to his Precepts. The Arguments to perswade Christians to be universally Holy, from Christs Redeeming them for that great end, was not known either in the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Nature, or the Law: For before our lapsed state there was no need of a Redeemer, and he was not revealed during the Legal Dispensation. His Death was only shadowed forth in Types, and foretold in such a manner, as was obscure to the Jews. The Gospel urges new reasons to increase our aversion from sin, which neither <hi>Adam</hi> nor <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> were acquainted with. So the Apostle dehorts Christians from uncleanness, because their bodies are <hi>Members of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>and Temples of the Holy-Ghost,</hi> and therefore should be inviolably consecrated to purity. If the Utensils of the Temple were so sacred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the employing them to a common use, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged in a miraculous manner; How much sorer punishment shall be inflicted on those who defile themselves, after they were <hi>sanctified by the Blood of the Covenant</hi>? The Gospel also recommends to us Love to one another,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.19.</note> in imitation of that admirable Love which Christ exprest to us, and commands the highest
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42565:180"/>
Obedience, even unto death when God requires it, in conformity to our Redeemers Sufferings. These and many other Motives are derived from a pure vein of Christianity, and exalt the <hi>Moral</hi> Law to a higher pitch, as to its Obligation upon men, than in its first delivery by <hi>Moses.</hi>

               <hi>Epicureans</hi> totally denied his governing Providence, and made Him an idle Spectator of things below.

               </note> Others subjected Him to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Destiny, that He could not do what He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired. Thus the wisest of the Heathens dishonoured the Deity by their false imaginations, and instead of representing him with his proper Attributes, drew a picture of themselves. Besides, their impious fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies had a pernicious influence upon the lives of Men: especially the denial of his Providence; for that took away the strongest restraint of corrupt nature, the fear of future Judgment. For humane Laws do not punish secret crimes that are innumerable, nor all open, as those of persons in power, which are most hurtful: Therefore they are a weak instrument to preserve Innocence and Virtue. Only the respect of God to whom every heart is manifest, every action a Testimony, and every great Person a Subject, is of equal force to give check to sin in all, in the dakrness of the night, and the light of the day, in the works of the hand, and the thoughts of the heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Philosophy is very defective as to Piety, in not injoyning the Love of God. The first and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Law of Nature, (the order of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts being according to their dignity) is, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord with all thy Heart, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Strength.</hi> 'Tis most reasonable that our Love should first ascend to
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42565:182"/>
Him, and in its full vigor: For our Obligations to him are infinite, and all inferior objects are incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beneath him. Yet Philosophers speak little or nothing of this, which is the principal part of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion. <hi>Aristotle</hi> who was so clear-sighted in other things, when he discourses of God, is not only affectedly obscure, to conceal his ignorance, as the Fish which troubles the Water for fear of being catcht; but 'tis on the occasion of speculative Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as in his <hi>Phisicks,</hi> when he considers him as the first cause of all the motions in the World; or in his <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> as the supreme Being, the knowledg of whom he saith is most noble in it self, but of no use to Men. But in his <hi>Morals,</hi> where he had reason to consider the Deity as an object most worthy of our Love, Respect, and Obedience in an infinite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he totally omits such a representation of him, although the Love of God is that alone which gives price to all moral Virtues. And from hence it is that Philosophy is so defective as to Rules for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Men for an intimate and delightful Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, which is the effect of Holy and Perfect Love, and the supreme Happiness of the reasonable Nature. If in the <hi>Platonical</hi> Philosophy there are some things directing to it, yet they are but frigidly exprest, and so obscurely, that like Inscriptions in ancient Medals or Marbles which are defac't, they are hardly legible. This is the singular Character of the Gospel, that distinguishes it from all humane Institutions; it represents the infinite amiableness of God, and his goodness to us, to excite our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him in a <hi>Superlative</hi> manner: it commands us to <hi>follow him as dear Children,</hi> and presses us to seek for those Dispositions which may qualifie

us for the enjoyment of him in a way of Friendship and Love.</p>

And his practice was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. For he frequented the Temples, assisted at their Sacrifices, which he declares before his Judges, to purge himself from the Crime of which he was accused. <hi>Seneca</hi> speaking of the Heathen worship, acknowledges 'twas unreasonable, and only the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of fools rendered it excusable, yet he would have a Philosopher to conform to those customs in Obedience to the Law, not as pleasing to the God's. Thus they made Religion a dependance on the State. They performed the Rites of heathenish Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that were either filthy, phantastical, or cruel, such as the Devil the master of those Ceremonies or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd.

They acknowledged that the natural Life, that Riches, Honours, and other inferiour things, common to the worst, were the gifts of God; but asserted that Wisdom and Vertue, the special perfection of the Humane Nature, were the effects of their own industry. Impious folly! to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we owe the greatest benefits to our selves, and the lesser only to God. Thus they robb'd him of the Honour of his most precious Gifts.

And as they boasted of vertue, so of happiness as intirely depending upon themselves. They ascribe to their Wise-man an absolute Empire over all things, they raise him above the Clouds; what ever may disquiet, or disorder, they exempt him from all Passions, and make him ever equal to himself, that he is never sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised with accidents, that 'tis not in the power of pains or troubles to draw a sigh or tear from him, that he despises all that the World can give or take, and is contented with pure and naked Vertue; in short they put the Crown upon his Head, by attributing all to the power of his own Spirit. Thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted the Rites of Heaven. Their impiety was so bold that they put no difference between God and their wise person,<note place="margin">

            <p n="5">5. Philosophy is very defective, in not propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Glory of God, as the end to which all our actions should finally refer. This should have the first and chief place in that Practical Science: For every Action receiving its specification and value from its End, that which is the Supreme and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Actions, must be fixt before we come to the particular and subordinate; and that is the Glory of God. Now the design of Philosophers in their Precepts, was either.</p>

They were swell'd with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, having little merit, and a great deal of vanity. Now this respect to the Opinion of others, corrupts the intention, and vitiates the action. 'Tis not sincere Vertue, but a superficial appearance that is regarded.

               </note> and its charming Aspect, as the most worthy Motive to draw the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Now supposing that some of the Heathens, (although very few) by discovering the internal beauty of Vertue, had a love to it, and perform'd some things without any private respect, but for the rectitude of the action, and the inward satisfaction that springs from it, yet they were still defective. For Vertue is but a ray of the Deity, and our duty is not compleat, unless it be referred to his Glory, who is the principle and patern of it. In short, the great Creator made Man for himself, and 'tis most just that as his Favour is our sovereign happiness, so his Glory should be our supreme end, without which nothing is regular, and truly beautiful. By these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral instances it appears how insufficient Philosophy is to direct us in our principal duty, that respects God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:42565:185"/>2. Philosophy was defective in its directions about moral duties that respect our selves or others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Philosophers were not sensible of the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to sin. They allow the disorder of the sensitive appetite as innocent, till it passes to the supreme part of the Soul, and induces it to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or resolve upon moral actions. For they were ignorant of that Original and intimate pollution that cleaves to the humane nature; and because our faculties are natural, they thought the first motions to forbidden objects, that are universal in the best as well as worst, to be the necessity of Nature rather then the effect of Corruption. Accordingly all their Precepts reach no farther than the Counsels of the Heart: But the desires and motions of the lower fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, though very culpable, are left by them indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. So that 'tis evident that many defilements and stains are in their purgative vertues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> not being able to reconcile the passions with reason, wholly renounced them. Their Philosophy is like the River in <hi>Thrace,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Quod potum saxea reddit<note place="margin">Ovid. Met.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Viscera, quod tactis inducit marmora rebus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For by a fiction of fancy they turn their vertuous Person into a Statue, that feels neither the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Love, nor aversions of hatred; that is not toucht with Joy or Sorrow; that is exempt from Fears and Hopes. The tender and melting affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nature towards the misery of others, they intirely extinguish as unbecoming perfect Vertue. They attribute Wisdom to none, but whom they rob of Humanity. Now as 'tis the ordinary effect of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42565:186"/>
to run into one extreme by avoiding another, so 'tis most visibly here. For the Affections are not like poisonous plants to be eradicated; but as wild, to be cultivated. They were at first set in the fresh soil of Mans nature by the hand of God. And the Scripture describes the Divine perfections, and the actions proceeding from them, by terms borrowed from humane affections, which proves them to be innocent in their own nature. <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes when <hi>Lycurgus</hi> commanded to cut up all the Vines in <hi>Sparta,</hi> to prevent Drunkenness, he should rather have made Fountains by them, to allay the heat of the Wines, and make them bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial: So true Wisdom prescribes how to moderate and temper the affections, not to destroy them. 'Tis true they are now sinfully inclin'd, yet being removed from Carnal to Spiritual objects, they are excellently serviceable. As Reason is to guide the Affections, so they are to excite Reason, whose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations would be languid without them. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are purely spiritual, as the Angels, have an understanding so clear, as suddenly to discover in objects their qualiteis, and to feel their efficacy; but Man is compounded of two natures, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his body obscures the light of his mind, that he cannot make such a full discovery of good or evil at the first view, as may be requisite to quicken his pursuit of the one, and flight from the other: Now the Affections awaken the vigour of the Mind, to make an earnest application to its object. They are as the Winds which although sometimes tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet are necessary to convey the Ship to the Port. So that 'tis contumelious to the Creator, and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the humane nature, to take them away as
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:42565:186"/>
absolutely vicious. The Lord Jesus who was pure and perfect, exprest all humane affections according to the quality of the objects presented to him. And his Law requires us not to mortifie, but to purify, consecrate, and employ them for spiritual and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable uses.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Philosophy is ineffectual by all its Rules to form the Soul to true Patience and Contentment under sufferings. Now considering the variety and greatness of the changes, and calamitys to which the present life is obnoxious, there is no Vertue more necessary. And if we look into the World before Christianity had reform'd the thoughts and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Men, we shall discover their miserable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours upon the account of the seeming confusion in humane affairs, the unequal distribution of temporal good and evils here below. If the Heathens saw Injustice triumph over Innocence; and crimes worthy of the severest punishment, crown'd with Prosperity; if a young man dyed who in their esteem deserved to live for ever, and a vicious person lived an age, who was unworthy to be born, they complained that the World was not governed according to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: but rash fortune or blind fate ruled all. As the <hi>Pharisee</hi> in the Gospel, seeing the Woman that had been a notorious sinner so kindly received by Christ, said within himself, <hi>If this Man were a Prophet, he would know who it is that touches him.</hi> So they concluded, if there were a Providence, that did see and take care of sublunary things, that did not only permit, but dispose of all affairs, it would make a visible distinction between the Vertuous and the Wicked.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, God did not to leave the Gentiles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42565:187"/>
               <hi>a witness of himself</hi>; for sometimes the reasons of his Providence in the great changes of the World were so conspicuous, that they might discover an eye in the Scepter, that his Government was managed with infinite Wisdom. Other Providences were vail'd and mysterious, and the sight of those that were clear should have induc'd them to believe the Justice and Wisdom of those they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. As <hi>Socrates</hi> having read a Book of <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> a great Philosopher,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Diog. Laert.</note> but studiously obscure, and his Judgment being demanded concerning it, reply'd, that what he understood was very rational, and he thought what he did not understand was so. But they did not wisely consider things. The present sense of troubles tempted them, either to deny Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, or accuse it. Every day some unhappy wretch or other reproacht their Gods for the disasters he suffered.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tully</hi> himself was guilty of this impiery: <hi>Quando neque Dii quos tu castissime colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isti, neque ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines quos eg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> Now the end of Philosophy was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress these evils, to make an afflicted to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented state. The Philosophers speak much of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of their Precepts to establish the Soul in the insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of worldly things, to put it into an impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortress, by its situation above the most terrible accidents. They boasted in a Poetical bravery, of their Victories over Fortune, that they despised its flattery in a calm, and its fury in a storm, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place erect Trophies to Vertue triumphing over it. These are great words, and sound high, but are empty of substance and reality. Upon tryal we shall find that all their Armour though polish't and shining, yet is not of proof against sharp Afflictions. The Arguments they used for comfort are taken,</p>

               </note> But this kind of consolation is vicious in its cause, proceeding from secret envy and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness. There is little difference between him that regards anothers misery to lessen his own, and those who take pleasure in other afflictions. And it administers no real comfort; If a thousand drink of the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> they are not less bitter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others sought for ease under sufferings by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering the pleasures that were formerly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this inflames rather than allays the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For as things are more clearly known, so more sensibly felt by comparison; He that is tormented with the Gout, cannot relieve his misery, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the pleasant Wine he drank before his fit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> Universal Cure of afflictions was, to change their opinion of them, and esteem them not real evils. Thus <hi>Posidonius</hi> (so much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Tully</hi>) who for many years was under tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Diseases and survived a contiunal Death; being visited by <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he entertained him with a Philosophical Discourse, and when his pains were most acute, he said, <hi>Nihil agis dolor, quanquam sis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestus, nunquam te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

thou assault me pain; though thou art troublesome, thou shalt never force me to confess thou art evil. But the folly of this boasting is visible: for though he might appear with a chearful countenance in the Paroxism of his Disease to commend his Philosophy, like a Mountebank that swallows poison to put off his Druggs, yet the reality of his grief was evident: his Sense was overcome, though his Tongue remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Stoick. If words could charm the Sense not to feel pains, or compose the mind not to resent afflictions, 'twere material to give molifying Titles to them. But since 'tis not Fancy that makes them stinging, but their contrariety to Nature, 'tis no relief to represent them otherwise than they are.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Others compos'd themselves by considering the benefit of patience. Discontent puts an edge on troubles;<note place="margin">

But this is not properly a consolation; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a calm and quiet submission prevents those new degrees of trouble, which by fretting and vexing we bring upon our selves, yet it doth not remove the evil, which may be very afflicting and grievous in its own nature; so that without other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to support the mind, it will sink under it. And as these, so many other Arguments they used to fortifie the Spirit against Sufferings, are like a hedg which at a distance seems to be a safe retreat from Gunshot, but those who retire to it, find it a weak Defence. This appears by the carriage of the best instructed Heathens, in their calamities, <hi>Professing themselves to be wise</hi> in their Speculations, <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came fools</hi> in practice, and were confounded with all their Philosophy, when they should have made use

of it. Some kill'd themselves for the apprehension of sufferings; their death was not the effect of courage but cowardise; the remedy of their fear.

               <hi>Socrates</hi> who dyed with a seeming indifference, gave this account of it; That he did not know whether death was good or evil. But this is not fortitude, but folly: as <hi>Aristotle</hi> observes, That a readiness to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter dangers arising from ignorance, is not true valour but a brutish boldness. What madness is it then for one that enters upon an eternal state, not knowing whether it shall be Happy or Miserable, to be uneffected with that dreadful uncertainty?</p>
            <p>But now the Gospel furnishes us with real reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies against all the evils of our present state. 'Tis the true Paradise wherein the Tree of Life is planted, whose <hi>Leaves are for the healing of the Nations.</hi> We are assured that God disposes all things with the Wisdom and Love of a Father, and that his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is most admirable, and worthy of praise in those things, wherein they who are only led by sence, doubt whether it be at all. For as 'tis the first point of prudence to keep off evils, so the second and more excellent is, to make them beneficial. Christians <hi>are more then Conquerours through Christ that loves them.</hi> They are always in an ascendent State; <hi>and believing, rejoyce with an unspeakable and glorified Joy.</hi> Death it self is not only disarmed, but made subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to their everlasting good. Briefly, Christian Patience endures all things, as well as Charity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it expects a blessed issue. It draws from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent miseries the assurance of future Happinss. A Believer while he possesses nothing but the Cross, sees by Faith the Crown of the Eternal Kingdom hanging over his head; and the <hi>lively hope</hi> of it makes him not only patient, but thankful and joyful. This sweetens the loss of all temporal goods and the

            <argument>
               <p> Examples have a special Efficacy above Precepts to form us to Holiness. The Example of Christ is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that end, being absolutely perfect, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to our present state. Some Vertues are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to our condition as Creatures, or to our condition in the world, of which the Deity is uncapable; and these eminently appear in the Life of Christ. They are Humility, Obedience, and Love in suffering for us. His Life contains all our Duties, or Motives to perform them. Jesus Christ purchased the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Holiness by his sufferings, and confers it since his Exaltation. The Sanctifying Spirit is the only Concomitant of Evangelical Mercy. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was not accompanied with the renewing Efficacy of the Spirit, nor the natural Discovery of the Divine Goodness in the Works of Creation &amp; Providence. The lower Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit were only in the Heathens. The Philosophical change differs from the Spiritual and Divine. <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> consider'd. Our Saviour presents the strongest Inducements to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us to be holy. They are proper to work upon Fear, Hope, and Love. The greatness of those Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and their Truth are clearly manifested in the Gospel.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Second Means by which our Redeemer restores us to Holiness, is by exhibiting a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Pattern of it in his Life upon Earth. For the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:42565:192"/>
discovery how influential this is upon us, we must consider, That in all the most noble works, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cause is an exact Idea in the mind of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; and Examples are the same. He that desires to excel in Painting, or Sculpture, must view the most accomplisht Pieces of those Arts. Thus in Morality, the consideration of Eminent Actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by others, is of admirable efficacy to raise us to perfection. That Examples have a peculiar Power above the naked Precept to dispose us to the practice of Holiness, appears by considering;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they most clearly express to us the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Duties in their Subjects and sensible Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. General Precepts form abstract Idea's of Vertue, but in Examples Vertues are made visible in all their Circumstances.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Contumacia redargui non potest sine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emple. Nam habere non possunt quae doceas firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, nisi ea prior feceris. Quia natura hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivis in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, videri vult non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do cum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, sed eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am cum rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one peccare.</hi> Lact. de ver. Sap.</note>2. Precepts instruct us what things are our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Examples assure us that they are possible. They resemble a clear Stream wherein we may not only discover our Spots, but wash them off. When we see Men like our selves, who are united to frail flesh, and in the same condition with us, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Passions, to overcome the most glorious and glittering Temptations, we are incouraged in our Spiritual Warfare.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Examples by a secret and lively incentive urge us to imitation. The Romans kept in their houses the Pictures of their Progenitours to heighten their Spirits, and provoke them to follow the Presidents set before them. We are toucht in another manner by the visible practice of Saints, which reproaches our defects and obliges us to the same Care and Zeal, than by Laws though holy and good. Now the Example of Christ is most proper to form us to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:42565:192"/>
it being absolutely perfect, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to our present state.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis absolutely perfect. There is no example of a meer man, that is to be followed without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>Be ye followers of me as I am of Christ,</hi> saith the great Apostle. Nay, if we would unite the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of all good Men into one, yet we might not securely follow him in all things: for his remaining defects might be so disguised by the Vertues to which they are joyned, that we should err in our imitation. But the Life of Christ was as the purest Gold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any allay of baser metal. His conversation was a living Law. <hi>He did no sin, neither was any guile found in his mouth. He was holy, harmless, undefiled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7.26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from sinners.</hi> He united the efficacy of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the direction of Precepts; his actions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways answered his words. Christianity, the purest Institution in the World, is only a conformity to his pattern. The universal command of the Gospel, that comprises all our duties is, <hi>to walk as Christ walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His Example is most accommodate to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State. There must be some proportion between the model and copy that is to be drawn by it. Now the Divine Nature is the Supreme Rule of Moral Perfections. We are commanded to be Holy, <hi>as God is Holy.</hi> But such is the obscurity of our Minds, and the weakness of our Natures, that the Pattern was too high and Glorious to be exprest by us. We had not strength to Ascend to Him, but He had goodness to Descend to us: and in this present state to set before us a Pattern more fitted to our capacity. Although Light is the proper object of Sight; yet that immense Light which the Sun hath in the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42565:193"/>
is invisible to our sight; we more easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the reflexion of it in some opacous Body: So the Divine Attributes are sweeten'd in the Son of God Incarnate, and being united with the Graces proper for the Humane Nature, are more perceptible to our minds, and more imitable by us. This was one great design of his coming into the World, to set before us in doing and suffering, not a meer Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle for our wonder,<note place="margin">John 13.15. 1 Pet. 2.21.</note> but a Copy to be transcribed in our Hearts and Lives. He therefore chose such a tenor of life as every one might imitate. His Supreme Vertue exprest it self in such a temperate course of actions, that as <hi>Abimelech</hi> said to his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, <hi>Look on me and do likewise:</hi> So our true <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 9.48.</note> our Father, and Soveraign, calls upon us to imitate him. The first effect of Predestination is to conform us to the Image of the Son, who <hi>was for this end made the first-born among many Brethren.</hi> He assumed the Humane Nature that we might partake of the Divine, not only by His Merit but by His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>This will appear more fully by considering, There are some Vertues necessary to our condition as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or with respect to our state of trial here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which the Deity is not capable of, and those most eminently appear in the Life of Christ. I will instance in three which are the Elements of Christian Perfection. His Humility in despising all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World, His Obedience in Sacrificing His Will intirely to God's, and His Charity in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Salvation of Men by his Sufferings: and in all these He denied to his Humane Nature the priviledge due to it by its union with the Eternal Word.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:42565:193"/>1. Humility in strictness hath no place in God: He requires the Tribute of Glory from all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And the Son of God had a right to Divine Honour upon his first Appearance here below. Yet He was born in a Stable, and made subject to our common imperfections. Although He was ordain'd to convert the World by his Doctrine and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, yet for the tenth part of his time he lived concealed and silent, being subject to his Mother and reputed Father,<note place="margin">Mar. 6.3.</note> in the servile work of a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And after his solemn investiture into his Office by a Voice from Heaven, yet he was despised and contemned; He refused to be a King, and stoopt so low <hi>as to wash his Disciples feet.</hi> All this he did to instruct us <hi>to be meek and lowly,</hi> to correct our Pride,<note place="margin">John 13. Mat. 11.29.</note> the most intimate and radicated corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For as those Diseases are most incurable, which draw nourishment from that food which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the support of Life; so Pride that turns ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions which are the matter of praise into its nourishment, is most difficultly overcome. But the Example of the Son of God, in whom there is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Divine and Humane Perfections, debaseing himself to the form of a Servant, is sufficient, if duly considered, to make us walk humbly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obedience is a Vertue that becomes an inferior either a Servant or Subject, who are justly under the power of others, and must be complying with their Will: So that 'tis very distant from God, who hath none superior to him in Dominion or Wisdome, but his Will is the Rule of Goodness to his own and others Actions. Now the Son of God became Man and was Universally Obedient to the Law of his Father. And his Obedience had all the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:42565:194"/>
that might commend it to our imitation. The value of Obedience arises upon three accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Dignity of the Person that obeys: it is more Meritorious in an Honourable than in a mean Person.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the difficulty of the Command; it being no great Victory over the appetite in Obedience, <hi>ubi diligitur quod debetur,</hi> where the instance is agreeable to our affections.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the intireness of the will in obeying. For to perform a commanded Action against our consent, is only to be subject in the meaner part of Man, the Body, and to resist in the superior, which is the Mind. Now in all these respects the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ was Perfect. In the Dignity of the Person Obeying, it exceeded the Obedience of all the Angels, as much as the Divine Person exceeded all created. The difficulty of the Command is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ever was put upon Servant or Subject: <hi>He was Obedient to the Death of the Cross,</hi> that is, Death with dishonour and torment, the evils that are most contrary to the Humane Nature and Appetite. And the compleatness of his Will in obeying is most evident. For if Christ had desired deliverance from his Persecutors, he had certainly obtained it. He tells his Disciples, that upon his request, his Father would send twelve Legions of Angels for his rescue. But he resigned the whole Power of his Will to his Fathers; <hi>not my will, but thy will be done,</hi> was his Voice at his privat Passion in the Garden. He submitted the act and exercise of his will; <hi>not what I will, but what thou wilt,</hi> he saith in another <hi>Evangelist:</hi> he yielded not only the faculty, and exercise of his will to do what God enjoyned,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:42565:194"/>
but in that manner which was pleasing to Him, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> he expresses in the words of a <hi>third.</hi> Now what is there in Heaven or Earth that can move our Wills to entire Obedience, if this marvellous Pattern doth not affect us? <hi>Let the same Mind be in you that was in Christ,</hi> saith the Apostle. How glorious is it to do what he did, and what a reproach to decline what he suffer'd, who had the Holiness of God to give excellency to the Action, and the infirmity of Man to endure the sharpness of the Passion!</p>
            <p n="3">3. Love to Mankind is exprest by our Saviour in a peculiar manner. For although God is Infinitely Good to us, yet he doth not prefer the happiness of Man before his own Blessedness. The Salvation of the whole World were not to be purchas'd with the least diminution of the Divine Felicity. But the Son of God suffer'd the extremest Evil, to procure the most sovereign Good for us, who were in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against his Laws and Empire. Briefly, The Life of Christ contains all our Duties towards God and Man, exprest in the most perfect manner, or Motives to perform them. We may clearly see in his deportment innocent Wisdom, prudent Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, compassionate Zeal, perfect Patience, the courage of Faith, the joy of Hope, the tenderness and care of Love, incomparable Meekness, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, Humility and Purity. He spent the night in Communion with God, and the day in Charity to Men. He perfectly hated Sin, and equally loved Souls. The nearest and readiest way to Perfection, is a serious regard to his <hi>Precedent:</hi> For the causes of all Sin are either the desire of what he despised, or the fear of what He suffer'd. He voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:42565:195"/>
himself to Riches,<note place="margin">

He ascended Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> to his Cross; before he ascended from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to his Throne; He was naked before He was cloathed with Light, and crowned with thorns before with Glory: And thus he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully teaches us to follow his steps <hi>who suffered for us.</hi> If a <hi>Physician</hi> of great esteem, in a Disease takes a bitter Potion, it would perswade those who are in the same danger, to use the same Remedy. Since the Son of God to purchase our Happiness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied himself the enjoyment of worldly delights, and endured the worst of <hi>temporal</hi> Evils, nothing can be more effectual to convince us, that the Pleasures of the world are not considerable as to our last end, and that present Afflictions are so far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with our supreme Blessedness, that they prepare us for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In short,</hi> His excellent Example not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens our Minds to discover our Duty, but inables and excites to perform it. As the Eye in beholding visible objects receives their Image, so by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the Graces that are conspicuous in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, we derive a <hi>similitude</hi> from them. <hi>We all,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>with open face beholding as in a glass the Glory of the Lord,</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> that is, gradually fashioned in Grace according to his likeness.</p>
            <p>And what can more powerfully move and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:42565:195"/>
us to Holiness, than to consider the President that Christ hath set before us. For how honourable is it to be like the Son of God? By conformity to Christ, we partake of the Divine Perfections. The King of Heaven will acknowledge us for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when we bear the resemblance of our elder Brother. Besides the motive of Honour, Love doth strongly incline to follow Holiness in imitation of our Redeemer. This is one difference between Knowledge and Love, the understanding draws the object to it self and transforms it into its own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Thus material objects have an immaterial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence in the mind when it contemplates them. But Love goes forth to the object loved; the Soul is more where it loves than where it lives; that is, there is more of its intellectual presence, its thoughts and desires, and it always affects a resemblance to it. Thus Love humbled God, and made him like to us in Nature; and Love exalts Man, by making him like to God in Holiness; for it excites us to imitate and express in our actions the <hi>Vertues of him who hath called us to his Kingdom and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In order to the restoring of Holiness to <hi>lapsed</hi> Man, the Lord Christ purchas'd and conveys the Spirit to them. A state of Sin includes a total pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Holiness, and an active contrariety against it. The Sinner is dead as to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Life, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>nable to revive himself, as a <hi>carcase</hi> is to break the gates of Death and return to the light of the world: but he lives to the <hi>Sensual</hi> Life; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses a constant opposition to the Law of God. He is without strength as to his Duty, not able to conceive an holy thought, or to excite a sincere and ardent desire towards Divine things; but hath strong
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:42565:196"/>
inclinations of Will, and great Power for that which is evil. Now to restore Spiritual Life to the dead Soul, and to conquer the living enmity that is in it against Holiness, no less than the Divine Power was requisite. And the effecting this is peculiarly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Spirit. Our Saviour tells <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>Except a man be born of water, and of the Holy Ghost, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</hi> And the Apostle saith, <hi>That according to his Mercy He saves us, by the washing of Regeneration, and by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> As in the Creation, where all the Persons concurr'd, 'twas the motion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that conveyed the Life of Nature; So in the Renovation of the World, where they all cooperate, 'tis the powerful working of the Spirit that produces the Life of Grace. He visits us in the grave, and inspires the breath and flame of Heaven to animate and warm our dead hearts. 'Twas requisite not only that the Word should take Flesh, but that Flesh should receive the Spirit, to quicken and enable it to perform the acts of the Divine Life. 'Tis for this reason the <hi>third</hi> Person is frequently stiled in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> That <hi>Title</hi> hath not an immediate respect to his Nature, but to the Operations which are assign'd to Him, in the admirable <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of our Redemption. 'Tis not upon the account of his essential and eternal Purity, which is common to all the Persons, but in regard of his Office, to infuse Holiness into the depraved Soul, and renew the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image, that he is so call'd. Now Jesus Christ purchased the Spirit by his Humiliation and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and conveys Him to us in his Exaltation and Glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He purchas'd the Spirit by his Sufferings. For
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42565:196"/>
since Man fell from his <hi>original</hi> Innocence, he is justly depriv'd of special Grace, that is necessary to heal and recover him. And till by a perfect Sacrifice Divine Justice was appeased, (that had shut the Treasury of Heaven,) and the Forfeiture taken off, he could not obtain the eternal Riches. God must be reconciled before He will bestow the Holy Spirit; a Gift so great and so precious, the earnest of his peculiar Love and special Favour to us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour tells his Disciples, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely afflicted for his departure from them, <hi>That it was expedient he should go away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 16.7.</note> 
               <hi>for otherwise the Spirit would not come</hi>; whose Office was to convince and convert the World. The departure of Christ implied his Death and Ascension; both which were requisite in order to the sending of Him. If the Blood of Christ had not been shed on the Cross, the Spirit had not been poured forth from Heaven. The effusion of the one, was the cause of the effusion of the other. The Rock that refreshed the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Desert, did not powre forth its miraculous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, till it was struck by the Rod of <hi>Moses</hi>; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct us, That Christ our <hi>Spiritual</hi> Rock must be struck with the Curse of the Law, the <hi>mystical</hi> Rod of <hi>Moses,</hi> to communicate the Waters of Life to us, that is, the Spirit, who is represented in <hi>Scripture</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that element.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Redeemer confers the Spirit after his glorious Exaltation, <hi>When he ascended on high,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>he led Captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. After his triumph over Principalities and Powers,</hi> He dispenc'd his Bounty in this rich <hi>Donative.</hi> For the Holy Spirit was first given to Christ as the reward of his excellent Obedience in dying, that was infinitely
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42565:197"/>
pleasing to God, to be communicated from him to Men. And he received the Spirit in the quality of Mediator upon his entrance into Heaven. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> declares this Prophetically.<note place="margin">Psal. 68.18.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended on high, thou hast led captivity captive, thou hast received gifts for Men, yea for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them.</hi> He acquired a right to those Treasures by dying, but he takes possession of them after his Ascension. Now He is Crown'd, He holds forth the Scepter of his Royalty. Therefore 'tis said that when Christ was upon the Earth, <hi>the Holy Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not Glorified.</hi> If it be objected, that Believers before the Ascension of Christ, were partakers of the Spirit; the answer is clear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was upon Christ's interposing in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as Mediator, and with respect to his future Death and Ascension, that the Spirit was given to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The degrees of communicating the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the Ascension of Christ are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; whether we consider <hi>the gifts of the Spirit,</hi> those extraordinary abilities with which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were endued;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> or the <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Graces that are bestowed on Believers,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> the measure of them far exceeds what-ever was conveyed before. The Spirit Descended as in a dew upon the Jewish Nation, but 'tis now powred forth in showers <hi>upon all flesh.</hi> Now in the stile of Scripture things are said to be, when apparently and eminently they discover their being. So that comparatively to the Power and Virtue of the Spirit discovered in the Church since the Glorification of Christ, he was not given before. All the former manifestations are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:42565:197"/>
by the excess and excellency of the later. And not only the Decree of God which is sufficient to connect those things that have no natural depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but there are special reasons for the order of this Dispensation: for the great end of the Spirit's coming was to reveal fully to the World the way of Salvation; to discover the unsearchable riches of Grace; to assure Men of happiness after this Life, that they might be reduced from a state of Rebellion to Obedience, and their affections be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and purified from all Earthliness and made Angelical and Heavenly. Now the Principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations which he used to perswade Men of these things, are the Death and Resurrection of Christ, without which these Mysteries had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cloud. That the Instruction therefore of the Spirit might be clear and effectual, it was necessary Christ should Suffer and enter into Heaven, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish those things he was to teach.</p>
            <p>And from hence we may observe that the Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace of the Spirit is only the concomitant of the Evangelical Mercy. The Gospel and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are the Wings by which <hi>the Sun of Righteousness brings healing and life to the World.</hi> The declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was Divine, but not accompanied with the efficacy of Grace: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis called the <hi>ministration of Death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.7.</note> It convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Spiritual strength as delivered by the hands of <hi>Moses,</hi> considering him precisely in the quality of the legal Mediator, but threatned a Curse to the breakers of it. All the promises of Mercy scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> belong to the Covenant of Grace. The Gospel is called <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life, and the Ministration of the Spirit</hi>; that is,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:42565:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Spirit of Holiness and Comfort from whom true and Eternal Life proceeds, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is solely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by it. The discovery of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Works of Creation and Providence, is natural, and without the renewing power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: There is a correspondence between the external Revelation of Mercy, and the internal Grace of the Spirit in their Original: as the one is supernatural, so is the other. Not but that the Heathens had some fainter beams of the Sun of <hi>Righteousness, for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens every man that comes into the World,</hi> and some lower operations of the Spirit, whereby they were reduced from Intemperance, Incontinency and other gross Vices; to the practice of several Vertues that respect the Civil Life. And of this we have an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent instance recorded by <hi>Diogenes Laertius.</hi> That <hi>Polemo</hi> half-drunk, crown'd with Roses, and in the dress of a Harlot rather than of a Man, coming into the School of the severe <hi>Zenocrates,</hi> hearing him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Temperance, as by a Charm was so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly changed, that casting away the Garland from his Head, and the lascivious Ornaments that were about him, and which was more considerable, his vicious Habits from his Soul; he that entered in a Reveller come forth a Philosopher, so corrected and composed in his manners, that he was called the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> tone, which of all others was the most solemn and majestical in the Musick of those times. Now this alteration was wrought by the force of natural Reason, which prevailed on him to renounce those sensual and base lusts, that were inconsistent with the Honour and Peace of a Man in this present Life. But still he was exceedingly distant from the Purity of a true Saint, who partakes <hi>of the Divine Nature,</hi>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:42565:198"/>
and is inclin'd in all his motions to God. All the Precepts of <hi>Morality,</hi> to use the Similtude of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> are like strong Perfumes that sometimes revive those that are in a <hi>Swoon</hi> by the <hi>Falling-Sickness,</hi> but never heal them: So they may recover those that are debaucht from the outward practice of those ignoble Vices which violate Natural Conscience, but they cannot rectifie and cure the corrupt Nature. The highest <hi>Philosophical</hi> Change was onely from those Vices which were scandalous in the view of men; but consisted with those which were, though more subtile, yet not less sinfull, and discernable by the pure Eye of God. 'Twas from one kind of Sin to another,<note place="margin">

And although the same good Works, as to the external substance, were performed by the <hi>Heathens,</hi> as by <hi>Christians,</hi> yet they vastly differ in their Principle and End. A <hi>Brute</hi> performs all the acts of <hi>Sense</hi> that a Man doth, but 'tis meerly from the <hi>sensitive</hi> Soul, that is of a lower order than that which animates a Man. So in the <hi>Heathen</hi> 'twas only the <hi>humane</hi> Spirit excited by <hi>Secular</hi> Interests, Self-love, servile Fear, that performed <hi>Moral</hi> Actions. But the Holy Spirit (who infuses Grace, that is as it were a <hi>second</hi> Soul, to elevate that which before quickened the Body) is the true Principle of <hi>Christian</hi> Vertues. This sanctifying Spirit, who transforms us into the Divine Nature, and makes an entire and thorow Change in the Heart and Conversation, they did not receive in the way of Nature.

The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it is not delivered with so much Pomp, but with infinite more efficacy than the most eloquent Instructions of <hi>Philosophers:</hi> One plain <hi>Sermon</hi> that represents Christ as Crucified before our eyes, to obtain Pardon of Sin for us; inflames the Soul with a more ardent Love to God, and vehement hatred of Sin, than all their <hi>elegant</hi> and sublime Discourses. There is the same difference between their <hi>Morals</hi> and the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Institution, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>two</hi> Nurses; The one is adorned, and looks lovely to the eye, but wants Milk to nourish the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in her Arms; the other is not so amiable in appearance, but hath a living spring of Milk to nourish her Child. <hi>Philosophy</hi> hath the advantage of <hi>artificial</hi> beauty, but cannot supply the nourishment that is necessary to maintain the <hi>spiritual</hi> Life. But the Gospel affords the <hi>sincere rational milk to the Soul, that it may grow thereby.</hi> 'Tis therefore call'd the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> a <hi>title</hi> that distinguishes it from the Law, and all <hi>humane</hi> Institutions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Jesus Christ hath presented the strongest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements and motives to perswade us to Holiness. The way which he takes to save us, is not by a meer act of Power to raise us above our selves, but he deals with us conveniently to our frame, in making use of our Affections to bring us to himself. And whereas there are <hi>three</hi> Affections that have a mighty power over the reasonable Nature, and are the inward
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42565:201"/>
springs of humane actions, <hi>viz.</hi> Fear, Hope, and Love; He hath propounded such Objects to them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duely considered, are infinitely more efficacious than any thing that may divert us from our duty. The great temptations to sin are from the terrors or delights of Sense, and to overcome these, he hath brought to our assistance <hi>the Powers of the World to come:</hi> that is, hath revealed the dreadful preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Punishment of the Wicked, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Rewards that attend the Godly in their future State.</p>
            <p>Now to discover the efficacy of those Objects for the perswading Men to be Holy I will consider, 1. Their Greatness, as 'tis described in the Gospel. 2. Their Truth and Reality, of which our Saviour hath given us convincing evidence and assurance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To excite our Fear, he threatens Torments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and eternal. These are set forth by such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, as may impress the quickest sense of them upon Men. For the Imagination depends on sensible experience, and is strongly affected with those things that are terrible to our outward facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hell is described by <hi>a Worm</hi> gnawing the most tender parts,<note place="margin">Mar. 9.44.</note> that are most capable of pain; to signify the furious reflections of the guilty Soul, the sting of the inraged Conscience, the torment of those perfect Passions that continually vex the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And 'tis set forth by <hi>Fire and Brimstone,</hi> that is most fierce to sense, the serious consideration of which is enough to cause terror and amazement in all that are liable to it. And if the sole apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be intolerable, how much more will the <hi>dwelling with devouring Fire, and everlasting burning</hi>? 'Tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>blackness of darkness,</hi> to signifie the compleat
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42565:201"/>
horrour of that state. The Fire hath only force to burn, not to give any light to mitigate the obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 'Tis called the <hi>second Death,</hi> in comparison of which that of the body is but the shadow of Death.<note place="margin">Rev. 20.14. <hi>mortui vitae, &amp; morti sic fine victuri.</hi> Aug.</note> Nothing of Life remains but the sense of Misery, and that will be as strong for ever, as at the first entrance into it. This infinitely increases the Torment, that it shall never end. The suffering Soul knows it shall be Eternal, and as such it is felt and afflicts. The Fire that devours shall never say 'tis enough, that sad Night shall never have a Morning, that <hi>horrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest</hi> never any Calm. The Damned have no breathing of Rest in their extreme pains, no shadow of Hope to refresh them in their intolerable heat,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.10.</note> 
               <hi>but are under torment day and night, for ever and ever.</hi> Now what can be more powerful to restrain Men from sin than the terrours of the Lord? if the desires of carnal and momenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y pleasures are impetuous and urgent, what can be more effectual to give check to them, than the consideration that they are attended with a painful Eternity, that within a little while nothing will remain of the most pleasant lusts but the <hi>Worm</hi> and the <hi>Fire</hi>? Thus one extreme is cured by another. Or, if the fear of Men who can inflict but outward evils, and Death on the Body, at any time resists the performance of our Duty, what is more proper to lessen the impression, than to remember how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing it is to fall into the revenging <hi>hands of the living God,</hi> who lives for ever, and can punish for ever? Thus our Saviour fortified his Disciples against Persecution, <hi>I say unto you, my Friends,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more they can do; but I will forwarn you whom you shall fear: fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42565:202"/>
Hell; yea I say unto you, fear him.</hi> Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is infinitely more fearful than Temporal Death. As the Rod of <hi>Moses</hi> devoured the Rods of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> So the fear of Hell overcomes the fear of Death, and all the Torments which end with this Life.</p>
            <p>I shall add further, to shew how fit an Argument this is to work on mankind; That usually the Fear of evil more deeply affects than the Hope of good. When the Imagination is violently struck with an object, it hath a mighty force to turn the Mind and Will it self. Therefore Laws are secured by Punishments, not by Rewards. Indeed the fear of Hell at first disposes us for the love of Heaven: to escape the one we fly to the other. As the virtue of the Loadstone is increast by arming it with Iron, which although it hath no attractive power in it self; yet by conjunction, it makes the others more forcible: So the promise of Heaven makes a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger impression upon us by the threatning of Hell to all that despise it. Were it not for the Torments of Hell (which are more easily conceived by us whilst we are cloathed with flesh, than Celestial Joys, and therefore more strongly affect us) Heaven would be neglected, and be as empty of Saints as 'tis full of Glory. To awaken us out of the deep Lethargy of sensual Lusts, the most pleasant Musick is inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, nothing less is requisite than cutting and sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying.</p>
            <p>And not only those that begin, and first enter in the ways of Godliness, but those who are advanc'd in Christianity have need of this Bridle. For there are some temptations wherein the Flesh assaults the Spirit with that violence, that Love it self is obliged
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:42565:202"/>
to call in Fear to its assistance, as being more proper to repress its <hi>inordinate</hi> motions. 'Tis only in Heaven that perfect <hi>Love</hi> will consume all concupiscence, and cast out fear of Judgment: but whilst we are encompast with temptations, we must not think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of a more raised Spirituality, that the fear of Hell is either unbecoming or unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 'Tis not unworthy a Child of God to employ all the Motives of the Gospel. We are commanded to <hi>work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the opening of Hell to our view is not sufficient alone to make us Holy. For the strongest terrors although they restrain from the outward forbidden act, yet they do not change the Heart. According to that of St. <hi>Austin, Inaniter se victorem putat esse peccati, qui poenae timore non peccat; quia etsi non im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletur foris negotium malae cupiditatis, ipsa tamen cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditas intus est hostis;</hi> That is, the fear of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can never make us truly victorious over sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause although we do not actually accomplish the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the corrupt Will, yet the corrupt Will is still an enemy that lives within, and is only destroyed by the love of Holiness, which allures us by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Reward that is promised to it. Besides, Fear is a violent Passion to which Nature is repugnant, so that although its power is great, yet not constant: how strong soever the force is by which a stone is thrown upwards, yet 'tis weakned by degrees, and overcome by the natural weight of the Stone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it falls to the Centre. So the Humane Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists Fear, and lessens its impetuousness so far, that frequently it returns to sensual Lusts. Therefore, that the Law of the Spirit may be perfect and stable, it must be confirmed by the hopes of Heaven. As the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:42565:203"/>
Natural, so the Spiritual Life must be nourisht by grateful food, 'tis not preserv'd with Aloes or Worm-wood. For this reason our Saviour,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To encourage and raise our Hopes, offers to us a Reward infinitely valuable: for as God is Infinite such is the Happiness he bestows on his favourites. 'Tis described to us in Scripture under the most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amouring representations; as a state of Peace and Love, of Joy and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Prince of Peace reigns in the Holy Jerusalem that is above,</hi> and preserves an everlasting serenity and calmness. The mutinous Spirits that rebell'd, were presently chased from thence, into this lower Region, where they brought trouble and disorder. <hi>He maketh Peace in his high Places.</hi> The Peace of Heaven is <hi>like the Chrystal Sea before the Throne of the Lamb,</hi> which no unquiet agitation ever troubles or disturbs.</p>
            <p>An inviolable Love unites all his Subjects, no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision or jealousie discomposes their Concord. They enjoy without envy: for infinite Blessedness is not diminished by the number of the possessours. <hi>The Inheritance in light is communicated to all.</hi> Although the Angels are distinguish'd by their several Orders and Ministrations, as <hi>Seraphims,</hi> and <hi>Cherubims,</hi> Thrones and Powers, yet a Chain of Holy Love binds all their affections together. And the Saints although they shine with different degrees of Glory, yet as in a <hi>Chorus</hi> of Musick; although the voices are different, they make but one intire harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: So Love that ever continues, unites their wills in a delightful harmonious Agreement. Although there are millions of the Celestial Inhabitants, yet they all make but one Society, Love mixing in one
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:42565:203"/>
mass of Light, and Glory, all their understandings and wills.</p>
            <p>And since all true Joy and Sweetness springs from Love, 'tis impossible but they must feel unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able complacency, in the reciprocal exercise of so Holy and Pure an Affection. But principally, their Joy arises from the possession of God himself; by the clearest Knowledg and purest Love of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. <hi>They see him as he is.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.2.</note> Sight is the most Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and noble Sense, that gives the most distinct and evident discovery of its objects. The Soul in its exalted state, <hi>sees the King in his Beauty,</hi> all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of that infinitely Glorious and Blessed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in their brightness and purity. And this Sight causes the most ardent Love, by which there is an intimate and vital union between the soul and its happiness; and from hence springs perfect delight: <hi>In thy presence is fulness of Joy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 16.11.</note> It expels all evil that would imbitter and lessen our felicity. And this is an admirable priviledge for the Humane Nature, that is so sensible of trouble. All complaints and cries, all sighings and sorrows are for ever banisht from Heaven. If the Light of the Sun be so pleasant,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.4.</note> that every morning revives the World, and renders it new to us, which was buried in the darkness of the night; how infinitely pleasant will the Light of Glory be, that discovers the absolute and universal Excellency of the Deity, the beauty of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the perfection of his Wisdom, the greatness of his Power, and the riches of his Mercy? How inexpressibly great is the Happiness that proceeds from the illumination of a purified Soul, when such is the amiableness of God, that his infinite and eternal Felicity arises from the fruition of himself?
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42565:204"/>
The Joy of Heaven is so full, and satisfying, that <hi>a thousand years there are but as one day.</hi> Inferiour earthly goods presently lose the flower of <hi>novelty,</hi> and languish in our enjoyment of them: Variety is necessary to put an edge upon our appetites, and quicken our delights; because they are imperfect, and fall short of our expectation. But the <hi>object</hi> of our Blessedness is infinitely great, and produces the same pure and perfect Joy for ever. After the longest fruition it never cloys or satiates, but is as fresh and new as the first moment.</p>
            <p>And that which is the peculiar Pleasure of the Redeemed is,<note place="margin">Job. 17.24.</note> that <hi>they shall be with Christ, and see his Glory</hi>; What a marvellous joy will fill our hearts, to see our Blessed Saviour, who suffer'd so much for us on Earth, to reign in Heaven? Here He was in his enemies hands, there he hath them under his feet. Here He was in the <hi>form of a Servant,</hi> there He appears in <hi>the form of God,</hi> adorn'd with all the marks of Majesty. Here He was under the cloud of his Fathers displeasure, there He appears as the <hi>Brightness of his Glory.</hi> Here He was ignominiously Crucified, there He is crown'd with Immortal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Now considering the ardent Affections which the Saints have to their Redeemer, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of him in this glorious state, must <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> ravish their hearts. Especially, if we consider that the exaltation of Christ is theirs. The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers triumph when the Head is crown'd. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Glory reflects a lustre upon them, and by the sight of it, they are chang'd into his Likeness. If the imperfect and dim sight of his Divine Vertues in the Gospel, hath a power to change Believers into his <hi>Image from glory to glory,</hi> how much more the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:42565:204"/>
of his unveiled Face? Our Graces here are but as the rude draught and first colours of the Divine Image, that shall then be in its perfection. <hi>We know that when he appears we shall be like him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>for we shall see him as he is.</hi> The similitude between the Saints above and Christ is so exact, that if one should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven, and were not directed by the Light of that place, he would be apt to think every glorified Saint he meets to be more than a creature. St. <hi>John</hi> the beloved of Christ, and as clear-sighted as any of the Apostles, mistook an Angel for God; and would have adored him, although he did not appear in his full glory. The Kingdoms of the world with all their splendour are no more in compare to it, than a dead spark to the Sun in its brightness. The very Bodies of the Saints shall be raised from the Grave, and beautified with eternal Ornaments: They shall be Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the Angels, and conformed to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body of Christ. <hi>Briefly,</hi> In the present state we are not capable to receive the full knowledg of Heaven: What we understand is infinitely desirable, but the most glorious part is still undiscovered. The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it enter'd into the heart of man to conceive what God hath prepared for those that love him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor, 2.9.</note> All that is beautiful or sweet here, is but a shadow of that Glory, a drop of that vast Ocean of delights.

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42565:205"/>
any representations made of him by the shadows of our earthly Imaginations. There is a greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between the condition of a Saint on Earth and in Heaven, than between the Life of an Infant in the Womb, and of the same person when advanc'd to the Throne, and attended with the Nobility of a Nation.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> St. <hi>John</hi> declares, <hi>Now we are the Sons of God, but it doth not appear what we shall be.</hi> Who knows the full signification of <hi>being heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ,</hi> of partaking in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reward which is given to him for his great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the Crown of Heaven? Who can tell the weight, the number and measure of that Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? <hi>To him that overcomes,</hi> saith our Redeemer, <hi>will I grant to sit with me in my Throne, even as I also overcame,</hi>

            <p>Besides, the Reward as in excellency 'tis Divine, so in duration 'tis perpetual.

            <p>Now can there be a more powerful motive to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience than Infinite and Eternal Blessedness? what can pretend to our Affections in competition with it?

concerning the greatness of the recompences hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; we may understand how powerful they are to deter Men from Sin, and to allure them to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That these objects may be effectual, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath clearly revealed them, and given us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidence, and assurance of their reality. The Heathens had only some glimmerings, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of a future state: They were under doubts concerning the Nature of the Soul, whether mortal, or incorruptible, wavering between the assent and denial; and inclining to this, or that part, as Sense perswaded them to believe themselves only as Bruits, or Reason to acknowledge themselves Men.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> before his Judges speaks as one that desired Immortality; and in his last Discourses to his Friends he endeavours to perswade them, but could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his own doubts, nor assure himself.

               </note> Besides, the Hell which they fancyed, was made up of such ridiculous and senseless terrours, that could only affect Children, who were not arrived to the perfect use of Reason. And their apprehensions of Happiness in the next Life, were so extravagant, that what the Philosopher said in general of Hope, that 'tis the Dream of waking Men, is more justly applicable to the Hope of the Heathens, in respect of the future reward. For as the illusions of a Dream have many times a real Subject, but environ'd with so many fantastick Imaginations, as spoils all the proportions of it; so their Opinion had a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Truth, but was mixt with many Errours inconsistent with perfect felicity. And as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a Dream is slight and vanishing, so the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42565:206"/>
expectation of felicity did but lightly touch their Spirits. Briefly, they had no true Knowledge, nor firm Belief of Eternal Blessedness in the Vision of God, nor of the endless Torments in Hell; and wanting those great Principles from whence the Rules and Power to live in a holy manner are derived, they fell short of that Purity which is a necessary qualification to prepare Men for Heaven. They were in a confused labyrinth, without true Light, or Guide, intangled with miserable Errours, and stumbled every step whilst they sought after Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But the Lord Christ hath instructed the World concerning those invisible future Recompences. He hath expresly threaten'd what-ever is to be feared by Man, as a rational or sensible Creature, <hi>the Worm that never dies, and the Fire that shall never be quencht,</hi> in case of Disobedience; and he hath promised what-ever is to be hoped for, in case of Obedience. <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of Men.</hi> And our Saviour hath brought <hi>Light and Immortality to light.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> He hath declared the nature and quality of Eternal Life: that it consists in the most perfect acts of our raised and most receptive Faculties, upon the most excellent objects. That it contains per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holiness and pure Felicity, being for ever distant from the infirmities and defilements of our <hi>mortal</hi> state. He hath revealed as the quality, so the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, relating to the Body as well as the Soul. Whereas the Philosophers of all sorts, the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks, Stoicks, Peripateticks, Epicureans,</hi> labouring with all the force of their understanding, formed a Felicity according to their Fancies, which was either wholly <hi>Sensual,</hi> or else but for half of man: For
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:42565:207"/>
of the Resurrection, and consequently the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Body, not the least notice for many Ages ever arrived to them; Our Saviour who alone had <hi>the words of eternal life,</hi> hath promised a Happiness that respects entire man: The Soul and the Body which are his <hi>essential</hi> parts shall be united and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with all the glorious qualities becoming the Sons of God. And of all this he hath given to the world the highest assurance: For he verified his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by his own Example; rising from the Grave, and appearing to his <hi>Apostles</hi> crown'd with Immortality, and visibly ascending before them to Heaven. Since there is no greater <hi>Paradox</hi> to Reason than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, which seem'd utterly incredible to men, and not to be the object of a <hi>rational</hi> desire; God by raising him from the Grave, hath given the most convincing Argument that our Redeemer was sent from him, to acquaint the World with the <hi>future</hi> state. Thus the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks to the <hi>Athenians, The times of ignorance God winked at,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17.30.</note> 
               <hi>but now commandeth all men eve ry where to repent; because he hath appointed a day, wherein he will judg the World in righteousness, by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all Men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</hi> Jesus Christ who was attested from Heaven to be the Son of God by that great and powerful Act, declared the Recompences that shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Men after Death; Therefore a full and perfect assent is due to his Testimony. Hell with all its Dread and Terror is not a Picture drawn by fancy to affright the World, but is reveal'd by him, <hi>whose Words shall remain when Heaven and Earth shall pass away.</hi> The Heavenly Glories are not the Visions of a contemplative person that have no existence, but
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42565:207"/>
are great Realities, promised by him who as he died to purchase, so he rose to witness the Truth of them. And to bring these Great Things, that are separate and distant from this present state, nearer to us; He sometimes causes <hi>Hell to rise up from beneath</hi> and flash in the face of secure sinners, that they may break off their Sins by Repentance: and sometimes he opens Heaven from above, the Paradise of true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and sends down <hi>of the precious fruits of the Sun, of the precious things of the lasting Hills,</hi> that by the sight of their Beauty, and the taste of their sweetness, we may for ever abhor the pleasures of Sin. By the frequent and sensible experience of the truth of the Gospel in its Threatnings and Promises, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable persons have been converted from Sin to Holiness, from Earth to Heaven, from Vanity to Eternity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Love is a prevalent affection, stronger than Death; and Kindness is the greatest endearment of Love. Now the Lord Jesus exprest such admirable Love to us, that being duly considered, it cannot but inspire us with Love to him again, and with a grateful desire to please him in all things. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from Heaven to Earth, and delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a shameful Death, that He might <hi>redeem us from all Iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>and purifie unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> And what Argument is more powerful to cause in us a serious hatred of Sin, than the Consideration of what Christ hath suffer'd to free us from the punishment and power of it? If a Man for his Crimes were condemned to the Gallyes, and a Friend of his who had been extremely injur'd by him, should ransom him by a great sum; when the guilty person is restor'd to liberty, will he
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:42565:208"/>
not blush for shame at the memory of what he hath done? But how much more if his Friend would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for him the pains and infamy of his slavery, if any spark of Humanity remain in him, can he ever delight himself in those Actions, which made such a benefit necessary to him? And is it possible for a Christian to live in those Sins for which Christ died? Will not Love cause an humble Fear, lest he should frustrate the great Design, and make void the most blessed effect of his terrible Sufferings? why did he Redeem us with so excellent a price, from our cruel Bondage,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.74.</note> but to restore us to his free service? why did he vindicate us from the power of the Usurper to whom we were captives, but to make us Subjects to our Natural Prince? Why did he purifie us with his most precious Blood from our deadly Defilements,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ergo te dignum gere tali pretio, ne veniat Christus qui te mundavit, qui te redemit, &amp; si te in peccato invenerit, dicat tibi; quae utilitas in sanguine meo? quid profeci tibi dum descendo in corruptionem</hi>? Amb. de Virginit. p. 3.</note> but that we might be intirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to his Glory, and be fervent in good works? What can work upon an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Person more than sense of Kindness? What can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige more strongly to duty than Gratieude? What more powerful attractive to Obedinnce than Love? This pure Love confirms the Glorified Saints for ever in Holiness. For they are not Holy to obtain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, because they are possest of it; nor to preserve their Blessedness, because, they are past all hazard of losing it; but from the most lively and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent sense of their Obligations: because they have obtained that incomparable Felicity, by a Gift never to be reverst, and by a Mercy transcendently great. And the same Love to God that is in the Saints above
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42565:208"/>
in the highest degree of perfection, and makes them for ever to Glorifie him, will proportionably to our state in this life cause us to observe his Commands with delight and constancy. A true Christian is moved by Fear, more by Hope, most by Love.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> The Compleatness of our Recovery by Jesus Cist. He frees us from the Power as well as Guilt of Sin. Sin is the Disease and Wound of the Soul: the meer Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of it cannot make us happy. Sanctification equals if not excels Justification. It qualifies us for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God. Saving Grace doth not encourage the Practice of sin. The Promise of Pardon and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are conditional. To abuse the Mercy of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is dishonourable to God, and pernicious to Man. The excellency of the Christian Religion discovered from its design and effect. The design is to purge Men from Sin, and conform them to God's Holiness ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their capacity. This gives it the most visible preheminence above other Religions. The admirable effect of the Gospel in the primitive Christians. An earnest Exhortation to live according to the purity of the Gospel, and the great Obligations our Saviour hath laid on us.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. FRom hence we may discover the Perfection and Compleatness of the Redemption, that our Saviour purchased for us. He fully repairs what was ruin'd by the Fall. He was called <hi>Jesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause He should save his People from their Sins.</hi> He
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42565:209"/>
reconciles them to God, and <hi>redeems them from their vain conversation.</hi> He <hi>came by Water and Blood,</hi> to signifie the accomplishment of what was represented by the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Purification, and the Blood of the Sacrifices; Satisfaction and Sanctification are found in Him. And this was not a needless Compassion, but absolutely requisite ingorder to our Felicity. Man in his guilty, corrupt state may be compar'd to a condemn'd Malefactor, infected with noisom and painful wounds and diseases, and wants the Grace of the Prince to pardon him, and Sovereign Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to heal him. Supposing the Sentence were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verst, yet he cannot enjoy his Life, till he is restor'd to health. Thus the Sinner is under the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Law, and under many spiritual, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Distempers, that make him truly miserable. His irregular Passions are so many sorts of Diseases, not only contrary to Health but to one another, that continually torment him. He feels all the effects of Sickness. He is inflam'd by his Lusts, and made restless, being without power to accomplish or to restrain them. All his Faculties are disabled for the Spiritual Life, that is only worthy of his Nature, and whose operations are mixt with sincere and lasting Pleasure. Sin as 'tis the Disease, so 'tis the Wound of the Soul, and attended with all the evils of those that are most terrible. <hi>The whole head is sick, the whole heart is faint, from the sole of the foot, even to the head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay. 1.</note> 
               <hi>there is no soundess in it, but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores.</hi> Now our Redeemer as he hath obtain'd a full Remission of our Sins, so he restores Holiness to us, the true health and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Soul. He hath made a Plaister of his living Flesh, mixt with his Tears and Blood, those
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42565:209"/>
divine and powerful Ingredients to heal our Wounds. By the Holy Spirit 'tis applied to us, that we may partake of its vertue and influence. His Grace that pardons us, doth also purifie the Conscience <hi>from dead works,</hi> that we may serve the Living God. Without this the bare exemption from Punishment, were not sufficient to make us happy: For although the guilty Conscience were secure from Wrath to come, yet those fierce unruly Passions, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers that lodg in the breast of the Sinner, would cause a real Hell. Till these are mortified there can be no ease nor rest. Besides, Sin is the true dishonour of Mans Nature, that degrades him from his excellency, and changes him into a Beast or a Devil. So that to have a licence <hi>to wallow in the mire,</hi> to live in the practice of Sin, that defiles and debases him, were a miserable Priviledg. The <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> therefore represents the curing of our corrupt Inclinations, and the cleansing of us from our Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, to be the eminent effect and blessed work of Saving Mercy. Accordingly St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3.26.</note> 
               <hi>in turning away every one of you from his Iniquities:</hi> that is, Christ in his glorified state gives the Spirit of Holiness to work a sincere thorough Change in men, from all presumptuous reigning Sins to universal Holiness. An unvaluable benefit, that equals if not excels our Justification. For as the evil of Sin is in its own nature worse than the evil of Punishment, so the freeing us from its dominion is a greater Blessing than meer impunity. The Son of God for a time was made subject to our Miseries, not to our Sins. He devested himself of his Glory, not of Holiness. And the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the extasie of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:42565:210"/>
his affection desired to be made unhappy for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not to be unholy. Besides, the <hi>end</hi> is more noble than the <hi>means:</hi> Now Jesus Christ purchased our Pardon, that we might be restored to our forfeited Holiness. He ransomed us by his Death, that he might bless us by his Resurrection. <hi>He gave himself for us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>that he might redeem us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and to purifie to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> Sanctification is the last <hi>end</hi> of all he did and suffered for us.</p>
            <p>Holiness is the chiefest excellency of Man, his highest advantage above inferiour Beings. 'Tis the Supream Beauty of the Soul, the resemblance of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the Image of God Himself. In this the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the reasonable Nature truly consists, and Glory naturally results from it. As a <hi>Diamond,</hi> when its earthy and colourless parts are taken away, shines forth in its lustre; so when the Soul is freed from its Impurities, and all <hi>terrene</hi> Affections, it will appear with a Divine Brightness. <hi>The Church shall then be glorious, when cleansed from every spot,</hi> and made compleat in Holiness. To this I will only add, that <hi>without Holiness we cannot see God,</hi> that is, delightfully enjoy Him. Suppose the Law were dispenst with, that forbids any unclean person to enter into the <hi>Holy Jerusalem,</hi> the place cannot make him happy. For Happiness consists in the Fruition of an object that is suitable &amp; satisfying to our desires. The Holy God cannot be our Felicity, without our partaking of his Nature. Imputed Righteousness frees us from Hell, inherent makes us fit for Heaven. The sum is, Jesus Christ that he might be a perfect Saviour, sanctifies all whom He justifies; for otherwise we could not be totally
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42565:210"/>
exempted from suffering evil, nor capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the supreme Good, we could not be happy here nor hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence it appears, that Saving Grace gives no encouragement to the practice of Sin. For the principal aim of our Redeemers Love in dying for us, was <hi>to sanctifie and cleanse us, by the washing of water and the Word.</hi> And accordingly all the Promises of Pardon and Salvation are conditional. The holy Mercy of the Gospel offers Forgiveness only to Penitent Believers, that return from Sin to Obedience: <hi>We are commanded to repent and be converted, that our sins may be blotted out,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>in the time of refreshment, from the presence of the Lord.</hi> And Heaven is the reward of persevering Obedience: <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well-doing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.7.</note> 
               <hi>seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life.</hi> There cannot be the least ground of a rational just Hope in any person without Holiness. <hi>Whoever hath this hope in him, purifies himself even as he is pure.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 3.3.</note> By which it appears, that the genuine and proper use we are to make of the exceeding great, and <hi>precious Promises</hi> is, <hi>That by them we may be partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>and escape the pollution that is in the world through lust.</hi> Yet the corrupt hearts of men are so strongly enclined to their lusts, that they <hi>turn the Grace of God into wantonness,</hi> and make an advantage of Mercy to assist their Security; presuming to sin with less fear and more licence, upon the account of the glorious Revelation of it by our Redeemer. The most live as if they might be saved without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saints, and enjoy the Paradise of the Flesh here, and not be excluded from that of the Spirit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But Grace doth not in the least degree au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:42565:211"/>
and favour their Lusts, nor relax the Sinews of Obedience; 'tis perfectly innocent of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural abuse of it. The Poison is not in the Flower, but the Spider. Therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> propounds it with indignation, <hi>Shall we sin that Grace may abound? God forbid.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.1, 2.</note> He uses this form of Speech, to express an extreme abhorrency of a thing that is either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and dishonourable to God, or pernicious and destructive to Men. As when he puts the question, Is God unjust who taketh vengeance? God forbid. And is there iniquity in God?<note place="margin">Rom. 3.5, 6.</note> God forbid. He rejects the mention of it with infinite aversation.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.14.</note> Indeed what greater disparagement can there be of the Divine Purity, than to indulge our selves in Sin upon confidence of an easie Forgiveness? As if the Son of God had been consecrated by such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Sufferings, to purchase and prepare a Pardon for those who sin securely? What an unexpressible indignity is it to make a monstrous alliance between Christ and <hi>Belial?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this abuse of Grace is pernicious to men: if the <hi>Antidote</hi> be turn'd into Poison, and the Remedy cherish the Disease, the cause is desperate. The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> tells us, <hi>Those that do evil that good may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, their damnation is just.</hi> Suppose a presuming Sinner were assured, that after he had gratified his <hi>carnal</hi> vile desires, he should repent and be pardon'd, yet 'twere an unreasonable <hi>defect</hi> of Self-love to do so: What <hi>Israelite</hi> was so fool-hardy as to provoke a fiery <hi>Serpent</hi> to bite him, though he knew he should be healed by the brazen <hi>Serpent</hi>? But 'tis a degree beyond madness, for Men to live in a course of Sin upon the hopes of Salvation, making the Mercy of God to be his bondage, as if he could not be happy
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:42565:211"/>
without them. An unrenewed Sinner may be the object of Gods Compassion, but while he remains so, he is uncapable of Communion with him here, much less hereafter. Under the Law the Lepers were excluded the Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God was in a special manner; much more shall those who are cover'd with <hi>moral</hi> Pollutions, be kept out from the habitation of his Holiness. 'Tis a mortal Delusion for any to pretend that <hi>elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Mercy will bring them to Glory, or that the all-sufficient Sacrifice of Christ will atone God's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure towards them, although they indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a course of Sin. The Book of Life is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, only <hi>the Lamb</hi> with whose Blood the names of the Elect are written there, <hi>can open the seals of it.</hi> But the <hi>Gospel</hi> that is a lower Book of Life, tells us the qualifications of those who are vessels of Mercy, they are by Grace prepar'd for Glory, and that there can be no benefit by the Death of Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conformity to his Life. Those who abuse Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy now, shall have Justice for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From hence we may discover the peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Christian Religion, above all other Institutions; and that in respect of its Design and effect. The whole Design of the Gospel is exprest in the words of Christ from Heaven to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he sent him to the <hi>Gentiles, To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 26.18.</note> 
               <hi>and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified by Faith in Christ.</hi> One great End of it is to take away all the filthiness and malignity wherewith Sin hath infected the world, and to cause in men a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Gods Holiness, according to their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:42565:212"/>
As the Reward it promises is not an earthly Happiness, such as we enjoy here, but Celestial; so the Holiness it requires, is not an ordinary natural Perfection, which Men honour with the title of Vertue, but an <hi>Angelical</hi> Divine quality that <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us throughout in Spirit, Soul and Body,</hi> that cleanses the Thoughts and Affections, and expresses itself in a course of universal Obedience to Gods Will. Indeed there are other things that commend the Gospel to any, that with judgment compares it with other Religions. The heigth of its Mysteries which are so sacred and venerable, that upon the discovery,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fit totum Fabula Coelum.</hi> Martial.</note> they affect with reverence and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas the Religion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was built on Follies and Fables. Their most solemn Mysteries to which they were admitted after so long a circuit of Ceremonies and great preparations, contain'd nothing but a prodigious mixture of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Impiety, worthy to be conceal'd in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting darkness. Besides, the confirmation of the Gospel by Miracles doth authorize it above all <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Institutions. And the glorious eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it infinitely exceeds whatever is propounded by them. But that which gives it the most visible preheminence,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.3.</note> is, <hi>That it is a Doctrine according to godliness.</hi> The End is the <hi>character</hi> of its nature. The whole contexture and harmony of its Doctrines, Precepts, Promises, Threatnings is for the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Godliness. The objects of Faith revealed are not meerly <hi>speculative,</hi> to be conceived and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved only as true, or to be gaz'd on in an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie of Wonder, but <hi>are Mysteries of Godliness,</hi> that have a powerful influence upon practice. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of God in the publication of them, is not only to enlighten the Mind, but to warm the Heart, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:42565:212"/>
purifie the Affections. God discovers his Nature that we may imitate Him, and his Works that we may glorifie Him. All the Precepts of the Gospel are to embrace Christ by a lively Faith, to seek for Righteousness and Holiness in Him; to live Godly, Righteously, and Soberly in this present world. When our Saviour was on the Earth, the End of his Sermons, as appears in the Gospel, was to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the lives of Men, to correct their vicious Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rather than to explicate the greatest Mysteries. Other Religions oblige their Disciples either to some <hi>external</hi> actions, that have no <hi>moral</hi> worth in them, so that 'tis impossible for any one that is guided by Reason to be taken with such vanities. Or they require things <hi>incommodious</hi> and burthensome. The Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> cut themselves. And among the <hi>Chineses,</hi> though in great reputation for wisdome, their <hi>Penitents</hi> expose themselves half naked to the injuries of the sharpest Weather, with a double cruelty &amp; pleasure of the Devil, who makes them freez here, and expects they should burn for ever. 'Tis not the most strict observance of serious Trifles, nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to rigorous Austerities that ennobles the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> nature, and commends us to God. The most zealous performers of things indifferent, and that chastise themselves with a bloody Discipline, labour for nothing, and may pass to Hell through <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi> But the Religion of Christ reforms the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Will, and all the actions depending on them. It chases away Errour, and Vice, and Hatred, and sheds abroad Light and Love, Purity and Peace; and forms on Earth a lively representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that pure Society that is in Heaven. The End of it is to render men <hi>like the Angels</hi> in Holiness,<note place="margin">

that they may be so in Blessedness. This will render it <hi>amiable</hi> to all that consider it without Passion. And 'tis worthy of observation, that although many Heathens and Hereticks have contradicted other parts of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion; yet none have dar'd openly to condemn the <hi>Moral</hi> part of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Effect</hi> of the Gospel hath been answerable to the <hi>Design.</hi> One main difference between the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new</hi> Law, is, that the <hi>old</hi> gave the knowledg of Rules without power to observe them; the <hi>new</hi> that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Grace of Christ enables us by a holy Love to perform that, which the other made men only to understand. Of this we have the most sensible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, that was produc'd by the <hi>first</hi> beams of the Sun of Righteousness, &amp; had received the first fruits of the Spirit. What is more wonderful and worthy of God, than that perfect Love, which made all the first Believers to have one Heart and one Soul? What greater contempt of the World can be imagined, than the voluntary parting with all their Goods in consecrating them to God for the relief of the Poor? And the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> while the Blood of Christ was warm, and His Actions fresh in the memories of men, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary in Holiness. <hi>They were as Stars shining in a perverse generation.</hi> There was such a brightness in their Conversations, that it pierc'd through the darkness of <hi>Paganisme,</hi> and made a visible difference between them and all others. Their words and actions were so full of zeal for the Glory of God, of Chastity, Temperance, Justice, Charity, that the Heathens from the Holiness of their lives concluded the Holiness of their Law, and that the Doctrine that produc'd such fruits could not be evil. The
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:42565:213"/>
first light that discovered the Truth of the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith to many, was from the Graces and Vertues that appear'd in the Faithful. The Purity of their Lives, their Courage in Death, were as powerful to convert the World, as their Sermons,<note place="margin">

               </gap>d their persons from the good qualities that were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in them, when they hated the <hi>Christian</hi> name for the conceal'd evil they unreasonably suspected to be under it. This <hi>Tertullian</hi> excellently represents in his <hi>Apology.</hi> The most part are so prejudic'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Name, and are possest with such a blind hatred to it, that they make it a matter of reproach even to those whom they otherwise esteem'd. <hi>Caius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bonus Vir</hi> Caius Sejus, <hi>nisi</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus.</note> they say, is a good man, he hath no fault, but that he is a <hi>Christian.</hi> Thus the excellent Holiness of the Professors of the Gospel forc'd a <hi>veneration</hi> from their Enemies.</p>
            <p>But we are fallen from Heaven, and mixt with the dust. Our conversation hath nothing singular in Holiness to distinguish us from the World. The same corrupt Passions reign in Professors of Christianity, as in those who are strangers from the Sacred Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. If we compare our selves with the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, we must confess our unworthiness to be call'd their successors. Sixteen hundred years are run out since the Son of God came down to sanctifie and save the World, which are so many degrees, whereby we are descended from the first Perfection. We are more distant from them in Holiness than in Time. So universal and great is the Corruption, that
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:42565:214"/>
'tis almost as difficult to revive the dying Faith of Christians, and to reform their Lives according to the purity of their Profession, as the Conversion of the World was from <hi>Heathenism</hi> to <hi>Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, In every Age there are some Examples of the Vertue of the Gospel, that reflect an honour upon it. And this last Age, which we may call the Winter of the World, in which the Holy Spirit hath foretold, <hi>That the love of many shall grow cold,</hi> by a marvellous <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> hath inflam'd the hearts of some excellent Saints towards God and Religion. But the great number of the wicked, and the progress of Sin in their Lives, there is no measure of Tears sufficient to lament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I shall press Christians to <hi>walk as becomes the Gospel of Christ,</hi> answerably to the Holiness and Purity of that Divine Institution, and to those great and strict Obligations it laies upon us. The Gospel requires an entire Holiness in all our Faculties, an equal respect to all our Duties: We are commanded to <hi>cleanse our selves from all pollutions of flesh and spirit, to be holy in all manner of conversation.</hi> We are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd, <hi>To be perfecting Holiness in the fear of God. To be holy, as He that hath called us is Holy.</hi> A certain measure of Faith, and Love, and Obedience, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity in Vertue, we must not content our selves with. 'Tis not a counsel of Perfection given only to some <hi>Christians</hi> of a peculiar order and elevation; But the command of a Law that without exception binds all, <hi>Be perfect as your Heavenly Father is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> The Gospel gives no Dispensation to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor in any Duty. The Doctrine that asserts there are some excellent works to which the lower sort of Christians is not obliged, is equally perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42565:214"/>
both to those who do them by Presumption, as if they were not due, and were therefore <hi>meritorious</hi>; and to those who neglect them, by a blind Security, as if they might be saved, without striving to reach the highest degrees of Obedience. 'Tis a weak pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that because the consummate measure of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification can only be attained in the next life, therefore we should not endeavour after it here. For by sincere and constant endeavours we make nearer approaches to it, and according to the degrees of our progress, such are those of our joy. As Nature hath prescribed to all heavy Bodies their going to the Centre, and although none comes to it, and many are at a great distance from it, yet the ordination of Nature is not in vain: Because by virtue of it, every heavy Body is alwaies tending thither in <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>inclination.</hi> So although we cannot reach to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Holiness in this imperfect state, yet 'tis not in vain that the Gospel prescribes it, and infuses into <hi>Christians</hi> those dispositions whereby they are <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually</hi> carried to the full accomplishment of it. Not to arrive to Perfection is the weakness of the Flesh, not to aspire after it is the fault of the Spirit. To excite us, it will be of moment to consider the great Obligations that the Gospel laies upon <hi>Christians</hi> to be holy. By that Covenant the Holy God is pleased to take them into the Relation of his Children;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.1.</note> and as the nature of Sanctification, so the motives of it are contained in that Title. For so near an Alliance obliges them to a faithful observation of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to imitate him with the greatest care, that the Vein of his Spirit, and the Marks of his Blood may appear in all their actions. <hi>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin</hi>:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note> The allowed practice
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42565:215"/>
of it is inconsistent with the quality of a Son of God, 'tis contrary to the Grace of his Divine Birth. Nay, the omission of Good, as well as the commission of Evil is inconsistent with that Relation. 'Tis for this reason, that Holiness is so much the <hi>character</hi> of a true Christian, that to be a Christian and a Saint are the same thing in the Writings of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> That venerable Title obliges him to a higher practice of Vertue, than ever the <hi>Pagans</hi> imagined. He is far behind them, if he do not surpass them, and if he is surpassed by them, he will be cloathed with shame. Besides, our Redeemer who hath a right to us by so many titles, by his Divine and Humane Nature, by his Life and Death, by his Glory and Sufferings; as He strictly commands us to be holy, so he hath joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Example to his Authority, <hi>That we may walk as he walk'd,</hi> and be <hi>as he was in the world.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes use of this consideration, to restrain the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ from all Sin, and to perswade them to universal Holiness. After he had mentioned the disorders of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4.20.</note> to deter the <hi>Ephesians</hi> from the like; he tells them, <hi>But ye have not so learned Christ,</hi> that is, his rule and practice instructed them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. And when he commands the <hi>Romans, To walk honestly as in the day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying</hi>; he opposes to all these vices, the pattern that Christ set before us, <hi>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> The expression intimates the Duty, that as the Garment is commensurate to the Body, so we are to imitate all the parts of his Holy Conversation.</p>
            <p>'Tis no wonder that the Heathens gratified the inclinations of Lust or Rage, when their Gods were represented acting in such a manner, as to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42565:215"/>
their Vices. <hi>Semina pene omnium scelerum, à Diis suis peccantium turba collegit,</hi> as <hi>Julius Firmicius</hi> justly reproaches them. There was no Villany, how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious soever, but had some Deity for its Protector. They found in Heaven a Justification of all their crimes, and became vicious by imitation.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deorum cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores boni esse non possint; ab ipsis enim diis erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untur ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justitiam.</hi> Lactan.</note> For 'tis very congruous for men to follow those whom they esteem to be perfect, and to whom they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves accountable. If they attribute to their Supreme God, the Judg of the World, Vices as Vertues, What Vertues will there be to reward, or Vices to punish in Men? But for <hi>those that name the Name of Christ to continue in iniquity,</hi> is the most unbecoming thing in the world. For they live in the perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of their Profession. An unholy Christian is a real Apostate from Christ, that retracts by his wickedness the Dedication that was made of him in his Baptism. Although he doth not abjure our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in words, <hi>he denies him in his works.</hi> A proud person renounces his Humility, the revengful his Mercy, the luke-warm his Zeal, the unclean his Purity, the covetous his Bounty and Compassion, the hypocrite his Sincerity. And can there be any thing more indecent and absurd, than to pretend the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and respect of Disciples to such an holy Master, and yet by Disobedience to deny him? When the bloody Spectacles of the <hi>Gladiators</hi> were first brought to <hi>Athens,</hi> a Wise man cried out to the Masters of the Prizes, That they should remove the Statue and Altar of <hi>Mercy</hi> out of the City, there being such an incongruity between the Goddess they pretended to worship, and that cruel Sacrifice of Men for the sport of the People. It were more suitable for those who are not afraid to violate the most Holy Laws, and to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:42565:216"/>
contradict the Pattern of Christ, to leave their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and to take some other more complying with their Lusts. 'Tis not the Title of a Christian that sanctifies those who pollute and defame it. 'Tis not wearing the Livery of Christ that can honour those who stain it by their filthiness; but 'tis an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their guilt. 'Tis an unconceivable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity to our Saviour, and revives the old calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Heathens,<note place="margin">

Such Wretches may deceive themselves with a pretence they believe in Christ, and that visibly they declare their dependence on him; but this pretence will be as unprofitable as 'tis vain.

               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.21.</note> The naked name of a Christian cannot protect them from the wrath of God. <hi>Tertullian</hi> smartly upbraids some in his time who were careless of the Dignity &amp; Purity of the <hi>Christian</hi> Profession in their Lives,<note place="margin">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s is the same thing as to violate the Fidelity of Marriage,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42565:216"/>
without the wounding of Chastity, or to poison a Parent without failing in the duty that is owing to them. And to express his indignation, he tells them, <hi>Sic ergo &amp; ipsi salva venia in Gehennam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truduntur, dum salvo metu peccant.</hi> Let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God will cast them into Hell, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to their Pardon, as they pretend to Sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to the respect they bear him.</p>
            <p>To sum up all; Jesus Christ as by his Doctrine and Life he clearly discover'd our Duty, so he offers to us the Aid of his Spirit for our assistance, by which the Commands of the Gospel are not only possible but easy: And to enforce our obligations he hath threatned such Vengeance to the rebellious, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised such a Reward to those that obey the Gospel, that it is impossible we should not be deeply affected with them, if we seriously believe them, and He hath given such evidence of their truth, that 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we should not believe them, unless <hi>the God of this world hath blinded our minds.</hi> 'Tis matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of just astonishment, that Christians should not express the efficacy of the Gospel in their actions. How can a reasonable Creature believe that eternal Damnation shall be the Punishment of Sin, and yet live in the wilful practice of it? The <hi>Historian</hi> speaking of <hi>Mushroms</hi> that somtimes prov'd deadly to whole Families, asks with wonder,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Familias nuper intter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imere, &amp; tota Convivia, quae voluptas tanta tam ancipitis cibi?</hi>
               </note> What plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure could allure them to eat such doubtful Meat? Yet they may be so corrected as to become innocent. But when 'tis certain that the Pleasures of Sin are <hi>mortal,</hi> Can any one be tempted by those <hi>attractives</hi> to venture on that, which will undoubtedly bring Death to the Soul? Let Sense itself be Judg, and make the comparison between whatsoever the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:42565:217"/>
Life can afford for delight in Sin, and what the future Death will bring to torment it: Let the Flesh see into what torments all its delights shall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and with what other fire than of impure Lust it shall burn for ever.</p>
            <p>Besides, We are encouraged to our Duty with the assurance of a Happiness so excellent, that not only the enjoyment of it in the next World, but the just expectation of it here makes us truly blessed. If the Reward were small, or the Promise uncertain, there might be some pretence for our not performing the Conditions to obtain it: but when the one is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great, and the other as true as the God of truth, what more powerful motive can be conceiv'd to make us holy. 'Tis the Apostles chosen Argument, that <hi>We should walk worthy of him who hath call'd us to his Kingdom and Glory.</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> were in a great measure strangers to the Secrets of another World; they had but a shadow of probability, we have the Light of Truth brought down from Heaven by the Son of God, that reveals to us a Blessedness, that deserves our most ardent <hi>active</hi> Affections. But if Men are not wrought on by natural Reason, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, if neither the Terrours of the Lord, nor the blessed Hope can perswade them from Sin to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, their condition is irrecoverable. In this the Rules of Natural and Spiritual Healing agree.<note place="margin">Hippocrat. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoris. <hi>ult.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p> The Divine Power is admirably glorified in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, in respect of the greatness of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the manner of its production. Tis as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in our Redemption. The Principal Effects of it are considered. The Incarnation of the Son of God is a work fully responsible to Omnipotence. Our Redeemers Supernatural Conception by the Holy Ghost. The Divine Power was eminently declared in the Miracles Jesus Christ wrought in the course of his Ministry. His Miracles were the evidence of His Celestial Calling, they were necessary for the conviction of the World: their Nature considered. The Divine Power was Glorified in making the Death of Christ Victorious over all our Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The Resurrection of Christ the effect of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Power. The Reasons of it from the quality of his Person, and the nature of his Office, that he might dispense the Blessings he had purchased for Believers. His Resurrection is the foundation of Faith. It hath a threefold reference, to his Person as the Son of God, to his Death as an Alsufficient Sacrifice, to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of raising Believers at the last day.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Divine Power is admirably glorified in the Creation of the World; not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the greatness of the Effect, that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Heavens and Earth, and all things in them: but in regard of the marvelous way of its Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for He made the great Universe, without the

                  </gap>l. 96.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>for all the gods of the Nations are Idols, but the Lord made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> And as He began the Creation by proceeding from nothing to real existence, so in forming the other parts, He drew them from infirm and indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed matter, as from a <hi>second</hi> nothing; that all his Creatures might bear the real testimonies of Infinite Power. Thus He commanded Light to arise out of Darkness, and sensible Creatures from an insensible Element. He created Man, the accomplishment of all his Works, from the lowest and grossest Element the Earth. Now although at the first view we might conceive that the visible World is the greatest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that ever God performed, yet upon serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection we shall discover, that the works of Grace are as wonderful as the works of Nature, and that the Power of God is as evidently exprest in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, as in the Creation. For the fuller un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of this, I will consider some of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Effects of the Divine Power in order to our blessed Recovery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Incarnation of the Son of God, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing whereof such Power was exercis'd, as no limited Understanding is able to comprehend. <hi>The Word was made Flesh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.14.</note> This signifies the real Union between the <hi>Humane</hi> Nature and the <hi>Divine</hi> in our Redeemer. Before his <hi>Incarnation</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in an <hi>humane</hi> form to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and in the <hi>flaming</hi> Bush to <hi>Moses,</hi> but 'tis never said with respect to those Apparitions, that the Word was
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:42565:219"/>
made Flame, or Man. But when He came into the World to save us, He assum'd the compleat Nature of Man into an <hi>Hypostatical</hi> Union with himself. That admirable Person possesses the Titles, Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Natures of God and Man. In that ineffable Union, each of the Natures preserves its proper form, with all the necessary consequents proceeding from it. The <hi>Humane</hi> Nature is joyn'd to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word, but not chang'd into its Divinity; 'tis not infinite and impassible. The <hi>Deity</hi> is united to Flesh, but not transformed into its Nature, 'tis not finite and passible. But although there is a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet no separation: Although there are <hi>two</hi> Natures, yet but one sole <hi>Jesus.</hi> In the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence the Creator and the Creature are miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously allied. Now this is a work fully responsible to Omnipotence, and expresses whatever is signified by that Title. The Apostle mentions it with an Attribute of excellency, <hi>Without controversie great is the Mystery of Godliness, God manifest in the Flesh.</hi> 'Tis as sublime,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> as holy. In this the Divine Power appears in its Magnificence, and in some respect more gloriously than in the Creation: For there is incomparably a greater disparity between the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, Greatness and Infiniteness of God, and the Meanness of Man, than between the whole World and Nothing. The degrees of disparity between the World and Nothing are not actually infinite, but between the most excellent creature and the Glorious Creator they are absolutely infinite. From hence it is, that <hi>that</hi> which in other things resolves our doubts, here increases the wonder, and in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance makes it more incredible. <hi>Ye do erre,</hi> saith Christ to the <hi>Sadduces</hi> (who denied the Resurrection) <hi>not
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:42565:220"/>
knowing the Power of God.</hi> But the more raised thoughts we have of his immense Power, the more unlikely his conjunction with a nature so far beneath him will seem to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Divine Power was magnified in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers Supernatural Conception. 'Twas requisite his Body should be miraculously form'd of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Woman, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, not only in respect of its singular Dignity, and that he might be the pattern of our Regeneration, that is performed by the Efficacy of the Spirit not of the Flesh, but in respect of his Office: For he was the Heavenly <hi>Adam</hi> and therefore allied to us; and absolutely pure from the stain of Sin. Heaven and Earth concurr'd to form that Divine Man the King of both, the Earth furnishing matter, and Heaven the principle of his conception. Accordingly the Angel told <hi>Mary,</hi> who questioned how she could be a Mother, not having known a Man, <hi>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, therefore also that Holy thing that shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</hi> This was foretold many Ages as an admirable Effect of God's Power. When <hi>Judah</hi> was opprest by two potent Kings, &amp; despair'd of an escape, to raise their drooping Spirits, the Prophet tells them, <hi>the Lord himself would give them a sign of their future Deliverance. Behold, a Virgin shall conceive and bear a</hi> Son,<note place="margin">Isa. 7.14.</note> 
               <hi>and shall call his Name</hi> Immanuel. The Argument is from the greater to the less: for 'tis apparently more difficult that a Virgin, without injury or blemish to her purity and integrity, should conceive and bring forth <hi>Immanuel,</hi> than the defeating humane forces how great soever. If God will accomplish that Stupendious, unheard
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:42565:221"/>
of wonder, much more would he rescue his People from the fury of their adversaries.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Divine Power was eminently declar'd in the Miracles our Saviour wrought during the time of his publick Ministry, to verifie his Divine Mission, that He was the great Prophet sent from God to instruct Men in the way of Life. In discoursing of this, I will briefly shew, that Miracles were a convincing proof of his Celestial Calling, and that the performance of them was necessary in order to the conviction of the World, and consider particularly those He wrought.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Miracle is an extraordinary Operation of God in Nature, either in stopping its course, or in producing some effects that are above its Laws and Power: So that when He is pleased to work any, they are his Seal to authorise the Person and Doctrine to which they are annext. By them Faith is made visible: The Unbeliever is convinc'd by his Senses, the only witnesses above reproach in his account. From hence <hi>Nicodemus</hi> addresses himself to Christ, <hi>Master,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>we know that thou art a Teacher come from God; for no man can do those Miracles that thou dost, except God be with him</hi>: That is, No inferiour Agent can perform them, without the special assistance of the Divine Power. And 'tis not to be supposed, that God will lend his Omnipotency to the Devil to work a real Miracle, to confirm a falsity; and thereby, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily induce Men into errour in a matter of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite moment: f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r such is the Doctrine of Salvation that Christ Preach'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The working of Miracles was necessary to convince the World, that Jesus Christ was sent from God, whether we consider the Jews or the Gentiles.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42565:221"/>
To convince the Jews, upon a double account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the performance of them was one of the characters of the promised Messiah. For this reason when two of <hi>Johns</hi> Disciples came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether he were the expected Prophet, he returns this answer to the question,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Go and shew</hi> John <hi>those things which ye do hear and see, the Blind receive their Sight, and the Lame walk, the Lepers are cleansed, and the Deaf hear, the Dead are raised up, and the poor have the Gospel preach'd to them.</hi> Thus he described his Office, and verified the Commission he had from God, by representing his Miracles in the Words of the Prophecy.<note place="margin">Esa. 35.5, 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Saviour came to alter the Religion of the Jews that had been confirmed by many illustrious Miracles, therefore to assure them that he was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoris'd from Heaven, he wrought such and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that for their greatness, clearness and number exceeded all that were done before his coming. Our Saviour tells the Jews, <hi>If I had not done among them the Works which none other man did,</hi> they had not had sin: that is, in rejecting him. For if he had exercised only a Power like unto that of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, in his Miraculous Actions, they had been obliged to have honoured him as one of their rank, but not to have attributed an incomparable Dignity to him. But he did those which neither <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> nor the Prophets had performed, and in those that had been done, Christ excell'd them in the manner of doing them. This the Jews could not contradict, and from hence their infidelity was made culpable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Miracles were necessary to convince the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 1. For the Gospel forbids the various Religions among them, and commands all to worship
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:42565:222"/>
God alone in Jesus Christ, so that without a sensible demonstration, that <hi>that</hi> was the way wherein He would be served, their prejudices had been invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. 2. The Gospel propounds Threatnings and Promises that regard a future state, where no living Eye can see their effects, so that without an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary confirmation, it was not likely that men should yield a firm assent to them. If it be said, Our Saviour did his Miracles only in <hi>Judea,</hi> where very few of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> saw his Person or Works. I answer, His Miracles were primarily design'd for the conviction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in a secondary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to disarm Infidelity among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Therefore the Testimony of them was conveyed by those who were Eye-witnesses, and most worthy of credit, and who did many great wonders in the Name of Christ, to verifie the report of his famous Miracles, and declare his Power and Divinity. Of this more afterwards.</p>
            <p>Now I will briefly consider the Miracles wrought by Christ, that were the certain Signs of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of him, and made his Commission <hi>authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> Before his coming the hand of the Synagogue was dried up, and impotent to produce Miracles. The Holy Spirit was withdrawn, and for the space of <hi>four hundred</hi> years, no Prophet nor Worker of Wonders appeared. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> though <hi>the Angel</hi> deputed to signifie the coming of Christ, yet did no Miracles. But our Saviour was invested with Power from above, and performed many. Their quality and number is considerable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were not mere. Signs, as the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Moses</hi> Rod into a Serpent; nor destructive and punishing, as the Wonders in <hi>Egypt</hi>; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:42565:222"/>
and beneficial to men, the equal demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of his Mercy and Power. He cured Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that were absolutely desperate, by the mere signification of his Will; As the Son of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was sick at <hi>Capernaum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 4.46.</note> when Himself was at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee:</hi> or by such visible means, that the Spectators might be fully convinced, that it was not the <hi>external</hi> application, but his sole Vertue &amp; Divine Power that produced the effect; Thus by anointing with Clay and Spittle the Eyes of him that was born blind, who never had any natural possibility of seeing, he wrought an unparalleld Cure. <hi>It was never yet heard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 9.</note> 
               <hi>that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</hi> Therefore he that was healed, inferr'd from that, as a most pregnant proof, that our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was from God.</hi> He rais'd the dead. This effect exceeds the power not only of Men, but of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. 'Tis true, That one Angel destroy'd in a night an <hi>hundred fourscore</hi> and <hi>five thousand</hi> of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Army; but 'tis as true, that all the Angels together cannot raise from the dead one Man. 'Tis wholly the work of the Lord of Nature, who holds the Keys of Life and Death in his hands. 'Tis only his Light can dispel the darkness, his Voice can break the silence of the Grave. And 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that our Saviour who sometimes conceal'd his miraculous works, and forbid the publishing of them, yet perform'd this kind before many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that they might publish and verifie it, as being most conclusive of his <hi>mission</hi> from God.<note place="margin">Mar. 5.42.</note> He raised to life the Rulers Daughter, to the astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that were present to attend her Funeral. The Widows Son of <hi>Naim</hi> was carried without the Gates of the City to his Grave, <hi>Jesus</hi> stops the sad
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42565:223"/>
train, and restores life to the young Man, and to his Mother something more dear than her life. And the more signally to triumph over Death,<note place="margin">Luk. 7.15.</note> he pursued it to its fort, the obscurity of the Grave. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was buried four dayes, his Carcase was corrupted, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus calls him from the bottom of his Tomb with that powerful voice that created the World; The Dead answers and comes forth to the amazement of all that saw the Glory of God so clearly manifested.<note place="margin">Joh. 11.44.</note> The Evangelist reports that the People afterward were as desirous to see <hi>Lazarus</hi> as Jesus. Add to these his casting out of Devils. Before the Fall, the unclean Spirit was incorporated with the Serpent, but now with Man himself. He seizes on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Organs and Internal Faculties, and rules him at his pleasure. In the time of Christ great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were possest: for the Devil perceiving the ruine of his Kingdom approaching, he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the limits of it here, and by the perfect pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing of sinners, begin their torment, which is one act of his principality. The case of those persons was most compassionable. For in that close fight the soul was disarmed of its defensive weapons, being hindered in a great measure of the free use of its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Whereas in other Temptations he works by outward object at a distance, here he makes a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent assault on both parts. 'Tis the true anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hell, for the possest person is not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Suffering, the priviledge of Death, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys the free power of doing, the effect of Life. Now the ejecting of this Enemy was above the force of any humane means; no material applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had power over immaterial Spirits. But our Saviour by a Word commanded them forth of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:42565:223"/>
their Garrisons. And the Evangelists observe that the sight of it affected the People in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner above what his other Miracles did. 'Tis said, <hi>they were all amazed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 1.27.29, 33.</note> 
               <hi>insomuch that they question'd among themselves saying, what thing is this, what new Doctrine is this? For with Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth he even the unclean Spirits, and they obey him.</hi> His Empire over evil Spirits was more admired than over Diseases, or Death it self. Those who were insensible of his former Miracles, received impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from this:<note place="margin">Luk. 9.43. Mat. 9.33.</note> 
               <hi>They were astonish'd at the mighty Power of God, confessing that it was never so seen in Israel.</hi> And another time they said, <hi>is not this the Son of David</hi>? i. e. the Messiah. The Pharisees his obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate enemies were more troubled about this, than any other action; and to elude the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that He came from God, ascribed it to a secret compact with <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> as if there were a collusion between the evil Spirits, a lesser Devil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd that the Prince might reign. But so great was the Evidence of the Spirit of God in that act of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the Devils, that our Saviour charges them with unpardonable Guilt for their wilful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it.</p>
            <p>The number of his Miracles was so great, that St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>If all were written, the world could not contain the Books.</hi> We may in part conjecture how numerous they were, by taking notice how many he perform'd in one day.<note place="margin">Mat. 9.10, 18, 20, 25, 29, 33.</note> He dined with <hi>Matthew</hi> at <hi>Capernaum</hi>; whiles He was there, <hi>Jairus</hi> entreats Him to go to his Daughter newly dead; as He went the Woman with the bloody Issue toucht the hem of his garment and was healed; He raised the dead Maid; in his returning He cured <hi>two</hi> blind men, and
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:42565:224"/>
immediately after cast out the Devil from one that was dumb. And in all these miraculous Operations the glory of Gods Power was clearly manifested.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Divine Power admirably appeared in making the Death of Christ victorious over all our Spiritual Enemies. Now to shew what an eminent degree of Power was exercised in the effecting this, we must consider, that after Satan was cast out of Heaven for his Rebellion, he set up a throne on the Earth, and usurpt an absolute Empire over Mankind. His Power was great, and his Malice was equal to his Power. The <hi>Apostle</hi> represents him with his black Army under the titles of <hi>Principalities and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 6.12.</note> 
               <hi>the rulers of the darkness of this world, spiritual wickednesses in heavenly places;</hi> as in respect of the Order among them, so in respect of their Dominion they exercise in the World. His Principality hath <hi>two</hi> parts; To tempt Men powerfully to sin, and to execute the wrath of God upon them. <hi>He works effectually in the Children of Disobedience.</hi> He fires their Lusts, and by the thick ascending smoak dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens their Minds, and hurries them to do the vilest Actions. <hi>And he hath the power of death,</hi> to torment Sinners; God justly permitting him to exercise his Cruelty upon those who comply with his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now in the time of Christ seeing, many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd out of his hands, and translated into the Kingdom of God, he grew jealous of his state, and by his instruments brought Him to a cruel and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death. He then in appearance obtain'd a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Conquest, but in truth was absolutely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. And from hence the glorious Power of Christ is most clearly manifested. As he that will take the height of a Mountain, must descend to the lowest part
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42565:224"/>
of the Valley, where fixing his Instrument, he may discover the distance from the foot to the top of it: So we must descend to the lowest degree of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours abasement, to understand the height of his exaltation.<note place="margin">Heb. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>By Death he overcame him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil.</hi> For his cruel Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was founded in Mans Sin; his greatness was built on our Ruins. All the <hi>penal</hi> Evils he brings on Mankind are upon the account of our Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and his mighty power in Temptations, is from our inward Corruption. Otherwise he might surround, but could not surprise us. Now the Lord Christ by his Death hath taken away the Guilt and Power of Sin: The Guilt in enduring the Curse of the Law, and thereby satisfying Eternal Justice, which all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth could not do: and the Power of it,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> 
               <hi>By crucifying our old man with him, that the body of sin might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> 
               <hi>By the Cross of Christ the world is crucified to us, and we are crucified to the world.</hi> By it we are vindicated from the power of Satan, <hi>into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God.</hi> For this reason our Saviour, a little before his Passion, said, <hi>Now shall the Prince of this world be cast out.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Col. 15.</note> 
               <hi>By the Cross he spoil'd Principalities and Powers, and made a shew of them openly, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over them in it,</hi> to their extreme confusion, in the view of Heaven and Earth. Although the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and Ascension of Christ are the proper acts of his Triumph, yet his Death is the sole cause and original of it. The Nails and Spear that pierced his Body, were his <hi>omnipotent</hi> Arms, and the Cross the instrument of his Sufferings, was the <hi>Trophee</hi> of his Victory. All our <hi>triumphant</hi> Palms are gathered
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:42565:225"/>
from that tree. 'Tis there our Saviour bruised the head of the old Serpent, and renewed his antient Victory over him.</p>
            <p>And from hence it was, that upon the <hi>first</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ crucified, Oracles were struck dumb, and put to eternal silence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Powers were forc'd to do him visible honour.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

Affect.</hi> Lib. 12.</note> As the Rising Sun causes the Night-birds to retire, so his Name chas'd the rout of false Deities into darkness. They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be our enemies, but not our lords. Now where did the Divine Power ever appear more glorious than in our crucified Saviour? He hath done greater things suffering as Man, than acting as God. The Works of Creation and Providence are not equal to the effects of his Death. In the Creation a corruptible World was produced from Nothing, which as it had no disposition, so no contrariety to receive the form the Creator gave it: But the new World of Grace that is immortal, was form'd out of rebellious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The most eminent work of Providence was the drowning the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the <hi>Red</hi>-Sea: But the spiritual <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his Hosts were drowned in his Blood. In short, the Cross hath opened Heaven to us, and wrought a miraculous change on the Earth. But this I shall more particularly consider under another Head of Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Divine Power was eminently mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in Christs Resurrection from the Grave. This was foretold concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi> by the Prophet
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42565:225"/>
               <hi>David</hi> speaking in the type, <hi>My flesh shall rest in hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 16.10.</note> 
               <hi>for thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.</hi> As it was ordain'd by Gods Counsel, so 'twas executed by his Power. This is <hi>decisive,</hi> that He is the <hi>Messiah.</hi> His other Miracles were performed by the Prophets, but this was singular and only done by the God of the Prophets. The Reasons of it prove, that 'twas equally necessary for his Glory and our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Quality of his Person required it. For He was a Heavenly Man without Guilt, therefore <hi>immortal</hi> by the original Constitution of his Nature. Death that is the wages of Sin had no power over him. He was subject to it not by the Law of his Conception, but the Dispensation of his Love, not to satisfie Nature, but purchase our Salvation. Therefore the Eternal Law that annexes Immortality to Innocence, would not suffer that He should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the state of Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Nature of his Office made it necessary. As the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of our Redemption required, that He should descend from Heaven the Seat of his Glory, that by dying He might expiate our Sins, so after his lying in the Grave so long as to attest the reality of his Death; 'twas necessary he should rise again in order to his dispensing the glorious Benefits He had purchas'd. The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, If Christ be not risen, then our preaching is in vain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.14</note> 
               <hi>and your faith is also in vain.</hi> For the Faith of Christians hath a <hi>threefold</hi> reference. 1. To the Person of Christ, that he is the Son of God. 2. To his Death, that 'tis an all-sufficient Sacrifice for Sin. 3. To his Promise, that He will raise Believers at the last <hi>Day.</hi>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:42565:226"/>
Now the Resurrection of Christ is the Foundation of Faith in respect of all these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was declar'd <hi>to be the Son of God with Power, according to the Spirit of Holiness, by the Resurrection from the dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> He was the Son of God from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the Word, and from the first moment of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation as God-Man; But the honour of this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was much eclips'd in his poor Life, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Death. And although his darkest night was inlightened with some discoveries of his Deity, yet they were transient and soon vanish'd. But in his Resurrection God did publickly own him in the face of the World, therefore he is represented, testifyi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g from Heaven, <hi>thou art my Son, this day have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13.33.</note> According to the Phrase of Scripture; then things are said to be, when they conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously appear. All the Miraculous proofs by which God acknowledged him for his Son during his Life, had been ineffectual without this. If he had remain'd in the Grave it had been reasonable to believe him an ordinary person, and that his Death had been the punishment of his presumption; but his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the most illustrious and convincing evidence, that he was what he declar'd himself to be. For it is not conceiveable that God should put forth an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power to raise him, and thereby au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>horise his usurpation, if by robbery he had assumed that Glorious Title. He is therefore <hi>said to be justified by the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tim. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>which raised him,</hi> from all the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Enemies, who charg'd him with Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for making himself equal with God: Upon the evidence of it, <hi>Thomas</hi> ador'd him <hi>as his Lord and God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His Resurrection is the most pregnant proof
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:42565:226"/>
of the All suffitiency of his Satisfaction. This was special in the death of Christ, that the Curse of the Law accompanied it, and seemed like an Infinite weight to lie on his Grave. But in rising again, the Value and Vertue of His Sufferings was fully declared. Therefore the Apostle tells us, <hi>that he was delivered for our Offences,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.25.</note> 
               <hi>and was raised again for our Justification.</hi> Although his Death was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Merit our Pardon, yet since Believers alone actually partake of the benefit, and none could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if he had not rose from the Grave; 'tis clear His Death had been ineffectual without it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Faith in His Promises to give Life and Glory to his Servants, is built on his Resurrection: for how could we believe him to be the Authour of Life, who remained under the power of Death? How could he quicken and Glorifie us, who finally perisht? If he had been confined to the Grave, all our hopes had been buried with him.

            <argument>
               <p> The Divine Power was glorified in the Conversion of the World to <hi>Christianity.</hi> Notwithstanding the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Infirmity in <hi>Christ</hi> Crucified, yet to the <hi>Called</hi> He was the <hi>Power</hi> of God. The numerous and great difficulties that obstructed the receiving the <hi>Gospel.</hi> What the state of the World was at the first Preaching it. <hi>Ignorance</hi> was <hi>universal. Idolatry</hi> and the depravation of Manners were the consequents of it. <hi>Idolatry</hi> was fortified by Custome, Antiquity and external Pomp. The depravation of Manners was extreme: The principal account of it from their disbelieving a Future state, and their attributing to their gods those Passions and Vices that were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the Flesh. The aversion of the vulgar Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens was strengthened by those in veneration among them. The <hi>Philosophers</hi> Priests and Princes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently opposed the <hi>Gospel;</hi> An account of their enmity against it. The consideration of the <hi>Means</hi> by which the <hi>Gospel</hi> was conveyed, discovers that <hi>Omnipotency</hi> alone made it successful. The persons employed were a few Fishermen without Authority and Power to force Men to Obedience, and without Art or Eloquence to insinuate the belief of their Doctrine. The great, sudden and lasting change in the World by the Preaching of <hi>Gospel</hi> is a certain Argument of the Divine Power, that animated those weak appearances. <hi>Idolatry</hi> was abolisht. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous change followed in the Lives of Men. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> gave a divorce to all the sinful delights of <hi>Sense,</hi> and embrac'd for the honour of Christ those
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:42565:227"/>
things that Nature most abhors. A short view of the Sufferings and Courage of the <hi>Martyrs.</hi> Their Patience was inspired from Heaven. <hi>Christianity</hi> was victorious over all opposition. The <hi>Divine</hi> Power will be gloriously manifested in the compleat Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Church</hi> at the <hi>last</hi> Day. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> shall then finish his <hi>Mediatory</hi> Office. <hi>Death</hi> the last Enemy shall be destroyed.

            </argument>
            <p n="6">6. THe Divine Power was glorified in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the World to Christianity. The Apostle tells us, <hi>That Christ crucified was to the</hi> Jews <hi>a stumbling block, and to the</hi> Gentiles <hi>foolishness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.23.</note> The <hi>Jews</hi> expected the <hi>Messiah</hi> to deliver them from <hi>temporal</hi> Servitude, and establish an universal Empire either by the force of Arms, or by the terrour of Signs and Prodigies, as <hi>Moses</hi> did against the <hi>Egiptians.</hi> But when instead of Power they saw nothing but Weakness, and instead of a glorious Triumph, a disgraceful Punishment, they despised his Person, and rejected his Doctrine. But notwithstanding this imaginary infirmity in Christ crucified,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 24.</note> 
               <hi>Yet to those that are called according to the Divine purpose, He was the most excellent Power of God.</hi> It being more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to subdue the World to the Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of a crucified Person, than if He had appear'd with all the Powers of Heaven, and Princes of the Earth as his Attendants.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> For this reason the <hi>Apostle</hi> declares, <hi>He was not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, it being the Power of God to Salvation to all that believe, to the</hi> Jew <hi>first, and also to the</hi> Greek. And he prays for the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rist in the Heathens. And if we duly consider things, it will appear, that the terms of the <hi>Apostle</hi> are not too strong and <hi>hyperbolical,</hi> but just and equal to the degree of power requisite for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that great work. For the understanding of this, I will consider <hi>three</hi> things. 1. The numerous and great difficulties that obstructed the receiving of the Gospel. 2. The quality of the means by which 'twas conveyed and became successful. 3. The eminent, sudden, universal and lasting change made by it in the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The numerous and great difficulties that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed the receiving of the Gospel: This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by representing the state and disposition of the World at that time when it was first Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi>; Ignorance was Universal; a deep thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness cover'd the face of the Earth. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of that gross palpable Ignorance, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable Idolatry and the most notorious deprevation of manners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Execrable Idolatry: for as in the night <hi>Spectres</hi> walk, So in the times of Ignorance, the Prince of darkness made his progress in the Earth. He reign'd in the hearts of Men, and in the places of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. The whole World was fill'd with Idols of
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:42565:228"/>
several Forms and Mysteries, some aimiable, others terrible according to the humour of Superstition. For many Ages Satan had kept peaceable possession of his Empire: For the Ignorant World did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand its Misery, but willingly paid that honour to the cruel Usurper, that was only due to the Lawful Sovereign. They were confirm'd in their Idolatry by several things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were trained up in it from their Infant state. Now the first perswasions of the mind though grosly false, and ill habits do strangly captivate, and are with difficulty removed: because the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of those faculties is requisite; which are under the Power of Errour and Vice. No Tyrant is so exactly obey'd as custome, especially in things esteem'd Sacred: for the conceit that the service is pleasing to the Deity, renders men incapable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing, that contradicts it. 'Twas as hard to make the Gentiles forsake the Religion they received from their Birth, and to loose the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made in their tender Age, as to make the <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> change their Skin, and become fair, and the <hi>Furop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans</hi> to turn black: for the tincture which the Religion practised in each Country conveys to the Souls of Men, is as deep and lasting, as that which the Sun impresses upon their bodies, according to the diversity of its Aspects.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion was derived through a long succession from their Progenitors.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Sym.</hi> in relat. ad <hi>Imperat. Majorum excipere dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinam, Religiones traditas colere,</hi> Coecil. <hi>Tantum Sanctit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>s attribuere consuevit, quantum astruxerit vetustatis.</hi> M. Foel. <hi>Hoc sanctum ab aevo est, Hoc ab Atavis traditum.</hi> Prudent.</note> Antiquity brings I know not what respect to things, but 'tis specially
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:42565:229"/>
venerable in matters of Religion. Therefore the Heathens accused the Christian Religion of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and urged nothing more plausibly than the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>immemorial</hi> Prescription for their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. They would not consider whether it were just and reasonable, but with a blind deference yielded up themselves to the Authority of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. They resolv'd not to condemn their Parents and Friends, that had gone before them in the Road of Damnation, but chose to dye in their Idolatry. So hard is it to resist the current of the World, and to rescue our selves from the Bondage of <hi>popular</hi> Errours.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Pomp of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Worship was very pleasing to the flesh. The Magnificence of their Temples adorn'd with the Trophies of Superstition, their Mysterious Ceremonies, their Musick, their Processions, their Images and Altars, their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and purifications, and the rest of the Equipage of a carnal Religion, drew their respects and strongly affected their Minds through their Senses: Whereas the Religion of the Gospel is Spiritual and serious, holy and pure, and hath nothing to move the Carnal part. Now how difficult was it to overcome <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme</hi> when fortified by Custom, Antiquity, and so agreeable to Sense.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The depravation of Manners was such in the Heathen World, that if the unclean Spirits had been incarnate, and taken their residence among Men, they could not have acted worse Villanies. The whole Earth was covered with Abominations, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> with the Frogs that poisoned the whole Climate. We may see a picture of their conversation in the <hi>first</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And it could not be otherwise;
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:42565:229"/>
For as the Apostle saith, <hi>Those who are drunk are drunk in the night.</hi> So when the Mind is darkened with Ignorance and Errour, the Affections are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and Men give up themselves to the <hi>unfruitful works of darkness.</hi> Unnatural Crimes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted even among the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> with that liberty, as if no spark of common Reason had remained in them. The most filthy Lusts had lost the fear and shame that naturally attends them. They esteem'd those things to be the means to obtain Happiness, that were causes of the contrary. They plac'd their Sovereign Good in extreme Evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pleasures.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apud eos to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta impuritas vocatur ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banitas.</hi> M. Fael.</note> They were encouraged to <hi>work all uncleanness with gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>llity of the State, and not only by the multitude of Examples, so that Vices by their commonness had lost their names, and were stiled Vertues, nay 'twas a Crime to appear innocent among the guilty, but principally because they thought themselves secure as to a future state: For either they wholly disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, and 'tis congruous that those who think to die like Beasts, should live like Beasts;<note place="margin">

Met. l.</hi> 9. <hi>Fab.</hi> 7.</note> or els by attributing to their Deities those Passions and Vices that so powerfully reigned in themselves, they were strongly perswaded no Punishment would be inflicted. For how could the gods made them Sacrifices to their Justice, who were companions with them in their Crimes? Or revenge the imitation of their own actions? This was to cast down the banks, and to let the torrent of corrupt Nature break forth in all its fury. As St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes of <hi>Homer,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Poetical</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:42565:230"/>
Murders, Thefts and Adulteries of their gods, he made those Sins divine Properties, and effectually commended them to the Heathens: <hi>Quisquis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>non homines perditos sed coelestes Deos videbatur imitatus.</hi> And he gives an instance of this from a <hi>Comedy</hi> of <hi>Terence,</hi> Where a vicious young Man is introduced, reporting how he animated himself to satisfie his <hi>brutish</hi> lust, as having no less a Deity than <hi>Jupiter</hi> for his Master and Model. In short, the <hi>Theology</hi> of the <hi>Pagans</hi> inflam'd them to the bold commission of every pleasant Sin. The History of their gods was so intersperst with the most infamous Impurities, that at the first reading, <hi>Verterunt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillas Virgines in Meretrices,</hi> They lost the Virginity of their Eyes, then of their Souls, and then of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Now the Gospel is a holy Discipline that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all excesses, that enjoins universal Purity and Chastity; So that when it was first preach'd to the Heathens, they thought it impossible to be obeyed, unless Men were Angels without Bodies, or Statues without Souls.</p>
            <p>I shall adde further, That the aversion of the Heathens from Christianity was much strengthened by those who were in Veneration among them, and vehemently opposed it. And they were the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers greatly esteem'd for Wisdome, their Priests that had dominion over their Consciences, and their Princes that had power over their states and lives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Philosophers vehemently opposed the receiving of the Gospel. At the first view it may be just mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wonder that they should be enemies to it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we consider the objects of Faith, or the rules of Life laid down in it. The objects of Faith were
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:42565:230"/>
new and noble, of infinite beauty and profit, and most worthy of a rational Contemplation to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised upon: Now that the <hi>Philosophers</hi> who were so diligent to improve their minds who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with complacency truths of a lower descent, and of infinitely less importance, should reject <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> Truths, sublime in their Nature, saving in their Efficacy, and reveal'd from Heaven, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given of it? <hi>Tertullian</hi> reproaches them with reason, That the Christian Faith was the only thing, which Curiosity did not tempt them to search into. <hi>Hic solum curiositas humana torpescit.</hi>

                  <hi>Apol.</hi> c. 1.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, whereas the Gospel is a plain and perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution for the government of Life, wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about the Souls of men, and assures a Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness infinitely more excellent than was ever thought of by them, it might have been expected that those who in regard of <hi>Morality</hi> seem'd most to approach to it, and whose profest design was to search after Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, should have readily entertain'd, and used their best endeavours to have drawn others to embrace it. But if we consider things aright, our wonder will vanish: for their Knowledg and <hi>Morality</hi> which in themselves were Preparatives, yet accidentally hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their submission to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and caused the most potent prejudices against it, and that upon a double account.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Of Pride. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of Satisfaction in their own way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Pride was their Universal Disease, they had a liberal esteem of themselves, as raised above the common rank of Men. And because Philosophy had instructed them in some truths, they believed the false as well as the true, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all things impossible that did not concur with
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42565:231"/>
their old tenets: they admitted no higher Principle than natural Reason, and utterly rejected Divine Revelation: which was as unreasonable as if one that never saw but the light of a Candle, should contend there was no other light in the World. Now a Person that doth not believe Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is wholy unqualified to judge of supernatural Mysteries. For till the Authority of the Revealer is submitted to, he cannot truly consider their Cause and their End. Besides, they lookt on it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that any secret should be revealed to others and not to them. It seem'd to darken their Glory that any School should be more knowing than theirs. Therefore they chose to be instructors of Error, rather than Disciples to the Truth. Add further, they thought their honour concern'd to defend the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they had once espoused. From hence a rose the great contestations between themselves, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Invectives and <hi>Satyrs,</hi> being very jealous for their Opinions, and passionate for the interest of their Sects. Now the Gospel was in some things contrary to all of them, so that being toucht in their tenderest part, no wonder they were so violent against it. Our Saviour asks the Jews, <hi>how can ye believe, which receive honour one from another, and seek not the Honour which comes from God only</hi>? He propounds it as an impossible thing. The Gospel would strip them of all their pretended excellencies; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as its first Article, they should humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign their understandings to Divine Revelation; this they lookt on as a submission unworthy their refined strong Spirits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They had satisfaction in their own imperfect Vertues. Because they did some things to recover the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:42565:231"/>
Humane Nature from its degenerate state, they were more confirmed in their Infidelity, than the grossest Idolaters and the most vicious Persons. For the more probable Arguments they had to obtain happiness in their own way, the more obstinately they refused any other. They thought there was no need of a Saviour to intercede for them, or of the Spirit of Grace to assist them, but they had self-Sufficiency for the acquiring of Felicity. Like foolish <hi>Chymists</hi> that have melted away a great part of their Estates in vain, yet in expectation of the great <hi>Elixir,</hi> create in their fancies treasures of Gold, and inrich themselves. So the Philosophers who wasted their time and Spirits in searching after Happiness to little purpose, although the best of their Principles and the height of their Vertue were insufficient to support them under any pressing Affliction, yet they had vain hopes of obtaining perfect Tranquillity and Content by them. Now the Gospel command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an intire renounceing of our selves, to embrace the sole Goodness and Will of God, it was hard for those who were so full of pride and vanity, to relish a Doctrine so contrary to them. In truth, whatever the Philosophers pretended concerning the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that the Son of God should suffer death, yet it was not so much the Cross to which Christ was nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his Enemies, that made them reject the Gospel,<note place="margin">

A Discipline that condemns the vanity and glory of their Wisdom &amp; Vertue, that mortifies sensual pleasures, which many of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers indulged themselves in, notwithstanding all their discourses of the <hi>purgative</hi> and <hi>illuminative</hi> life.
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:42565:232"/>
And that this was the real cause of their rejecting Christ crucified,<note place="margin">

Fael.</note> is evident; for they knew, it was not unusual, for Persons of extraordinary Wisdom and Vertue, to suffer in the World. Their presents and example upbraids the Vitious, and Wounds their Spirits: as a great light sore and distempered eyes. And some of them acknowledged the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Providence; in permitting this for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent end, that Vertue, tried by the fire, might be the more resplendent. <hi>Socrates</hi> himself so admir'd by them, was so disguised by the malice of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that he was condemned to die by Poison: Yet this was so far from obscuring his Reputation, that his suffering Death was esteem'd the most noble effect of his courage, and the most excellent Proof of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Why then should they make a contrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Redeemers Sufferings; whose Innocenee was perfect, and whose Patience was so Holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; that in the midst of His torments he Prayed for his Murderers? No reason can be justly alledged; but some darling lust spiritual or fleshly which they were resolved to cherish. The light that comes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove illuminates the humble, and dazles the proud. The presumption of their own knowledg, was the cause of their Prodigious stupidity. Simple ignorance is not so dangerous as errour, which hath a false light that deceives and leads to <hi>precipies.</hi> We find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that none were fiercer enemies to the Gospel then the <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sacred story tells us, that when the <hi>Apostle</hi> Preacht at <hi>Athens,</hi> that was as much the seat of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition as of Sciences, the <hi>Epcureans</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> though most opposite in their Principles, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd to encounter him; they entertained him

And in the progress of the <hi>Gospel</hi> they persisted in their opposition.

            <p n="2">2. The Heathen Priests vehemently obstructed the reception of the Gospel; for their Interest was spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concern'd upon the account of their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gain. With great Art they had kept the People in Ignorance for a long time: They perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them that their Idolatrous Ceremonies made the gods favourable, and were the supreme Causes of their Prosperity. From this Fountain all Superstition was deriv'd. Now if the Doctrine of Christ (that strictly forbids the Worship of Idols) were received, who would attend to their old Lies? Who would purchase their deceitful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises? Who would maintain them with prodigal <hi>Donatives</hi>? Who would esteem them divine Men? They must lose their honour and support, and for their Fables be the scorn of the Multitude.

            <p n="3">3. Princes who were ador'd by the People, thought themselves obliged to prevent the introduction of a new Religion,<note place="margin">

And 'tis observable that there never
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:42565:233"/>
was a less favourable constitution of time, than when the Gospel was first preacht. For <hi>Tiberius</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly cruel, and extreamly jealous of all novelty that might disturb his repose.<note place="margin">

            <p>Besides, the Doctrine of Christ, was not only new and strange, but severe; for it gives no dispensation for Persons of the highest rank from universal duty. 'Tis the Law of God, to whom all are equally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and must be equally obedient. It gives rules without exception, to the Court, as well as the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; to those cloth'd in Purple and those in Sack-cloth: it condemns the greatest for Delinquents, and guilty of Eternal Death, if they do not abandon those pleasures to which corrupt Nature and many strong Temptations violently incline them. Now the Heathen Princes who were prosperous and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, could not relish a Doctrine that retrencht their exorbitant desires, &amp; strictly forbade their unconfin'd enjoyment of sensual delights, which <hi>they</hi> esteem'd the Prerogative annext to their supream dignity. From what hath been discours'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may judge how great resistance the Gospel met with in its first publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For all things that can make an enterpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se impossible, were united together against it. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, the pleasures of Sin and zeal for Religion, the understandings and wills of Men, the Learned and Ignorant, Magistrates and People, Men and Devils, joyn'd to suppress it. Hell was in a Commotion, and the Prince of Darkness in Arms, not to suffer the Crowns of so many Kingdoms to fall from his Head, which for so many ages he had kept: He was enrag'd to lose the Homage and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:42565:234"/>
especially of the more knowing Nations, as the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>; who, by how much the more capable of truth, with so much the more art to the dishonour of God, for a long time had been kept under his Deceit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we consider the means by which the Gospel was conveyed, it will be more evident that Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence alone made it succesful. When Christ came from Heaven to convert the World, it had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of reason more suitable to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to have been born at <hi>Rome</hi> the seat of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> wherein the confluence of all Nations met, than in an obscure corner. So when the Apostles were first sent forth to propagate the Gospel, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prudence would judge, that they should have been assisted either with Authority and Power, or with Learning and eloquence, to compel, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to a submission to it. But if there had been any proportion between the quality of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the effects produced, the Gospel had been esteem'd a Doctrine purely Humane. The immediate Agents had been intituled to all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the suffrage of the senses; and their proper sufficiency would have obscur'd the Vertue of Christ that wrought in them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore God chose the weak things of the World, to confound the mighty; and base things of the World, and things which are despised hath God chosen: Yea and things that are not, to bring to nought things that are, that his Glorious Power may be fully manifested.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The persons employed were a few <hi>fishermen,</hi> with a Publican and a Tent-maker, without Authority and Power to force <hi>Men</hi> to obedience, and without
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:42565:234"/>
the charms of Eloquence to insinuate the belief of the Doctrines they deliver'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were without Authority and Power. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religions were established in several Nations, by persons of the greatest Eminency and credit among them. That of the <hi>Persians</hi> by <hi>Zoroastres,</hi> that of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by <hi>Hermes,</hi> that of the <hi>Grecians</hi> by <hi>Orpheus,</hi> that of the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Numa,</hi> all Kings or of great Reputation for their Wisdom and Vertue; and they were received without contradiction. For being correspondent to the corrupt inclinations of <hi>Men,</hi> it was not strange that the Princes had either capacity to invent them, or power to plant them. And in later times <hi>Mahomet</hi> opened a way for his Religion by his sword, and advanced it by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. Now 'tis no wonder that a Religion so pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the lower appetites that gives licence to all corrupt affections in the present Life, and promises a sensual <hi>Paradise</hi> suitable to beasts in the future, should be embrac'd by those who were subject to his arms. But the <hi>Apostles</hi> were meanly born and educated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out credit and reputation, destitute of all humane strength, and had only a Crucified Person for their leader. Christianity was exposed naked in the day of its birth, without any shelter from secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They had not the advantage of Art and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to commend their Religion. There is a kind of charm in Rhetorick that makes things appear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than they are: the best cause it ruins, the worst it confirms. Truth, though in its self invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, yet by it seems to be overcome; and Errour obtains a false triumph. We have a visible proof of this in the Writings of <hi>Celsus, Symmachus, Caecilius</hi>
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:42565:235"/>
and others for Paganism against Christianity. What a vast difference is there between the lyes and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the one, and the Truth and Sanctity of the other? Yet with what admirable address did they manage that Infamous Subject? Although it seem'd incapable of any defence, yet they gave such colours to it, by the beauty of their expressions, and their apparent reasons, that it seem'd plausible; and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity notwithstanding its brightness and purity was made odious to the people. But the Apostles were most of them wholly unlearned. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself acknowledges that he <hi>was weak in presence, and his Speech was not with the enticing words of Mans Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.4.</note> A crucified Christ was all their Rhetorick. Now these impotent despicable Persons, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to subdue the World to the Cross of Christ; and in that season, when the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> was at its height, when the most rigorous Severities were used against all Innovations, when Philosophy and Eloquence were in their flower and Vigour, so that Truth unless adorn'd with the dress and artifice of falshood was despis'd, and a Message from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, unless eloquently convey'd, had no force to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade. Therefore the Apostles debased themselves in the sense of their own weakness, <hi>We have this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in earthen vessels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.7.</note> 
               <hi>That the excellency of the power may be of God, &amp; not of us.</hi> 'Twas from distrust of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, their true confidence in God proceeded. They were onely so far powerful as he enabled them: like in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ruments in which there is not Vertue sufficient for the carving of a Statute, if they do not receive it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest from the Artificer that uses them. Briefly, as God the Author of Wonders uses that which is weak in Nature, to conquer the most rebellious parts of it:
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:42565:235"/>
He makes the weak sand a more powerful bridle to the impetuous Element of Waters, than the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est banks rais'd by the industry of <hi>Men,</hi> and compos'd of the most solid materials: so he was pleased by a few artless impotent persons to confound the wisdom and overcome the power of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great sudden and lasting Change that was made in the World by the Preaching of the Gospel, is a certain Argument of the Divine Power that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated those mean appearances, and that no instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is weak in Gods hands.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greatness of the Change is such, that it was only possible to Divine Power. 'Tis a great Miracle to render sight to the Blind, but 'tis more miraculous to inlighten the Dark mind, to see the truth and beauty of Supernatural Mysteries, when they are disguis'd under reproach &amp; sad representations, and effectually to believe them; especially when the inferiour appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is so contrary to Faith, 'Tis a prodigy to raise the Dead, but 'tis more admirable to sanctify an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated sinner. For in comparing the quality of those Miracles, that is the greatest in the performing whereof God is discover'd to be the absolute Lord of the greater Nature: Now the intellectual Nature is superiour to the corporeal. Besides, there is no contradiction from a Dead body against the Divine Power in raising it; on the contrary, if any sense were remaining, it would ardently desire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd to the full enjoyment of Life: but corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is most opposite to renewing Grace. Now these marvelous effects were produced by the Revelation of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to the <hi>Heathens.</hi> The glorious light of Truth scattered the thick and terrible darkness of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:42565:236"/>
Ignorance and errour that was so universal. The Gospel in its power and the quality of its effects, was like those words, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> which the Eternal Word pronounced upon the confused <hi>Chaos,</hi> and infused a Soul and Life into the World. The clear knowledge of God in his Nature, and Glorious Works of Creation and Redemption, of the duty of Man, of the future state, was communicated to the meanest understandings. And in proportion to the Light of Faith, such was the measure of Piety, and Holiness. Idolatry that had Number, Antiquity, Authority of its side, was intirely abolisht. The false Deities were cast out of the Temple: and the Cross of Christ was planted in the Hearts of Men. Accordingly the Apostle tells the <hi>Thessalonians; For they themselves shew of us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 1, 9.</note> 
               <hi>what manner of entring in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from Idols, to serve the Living and true God, and to wait for his Son from Heaven, whom he raised from the Dead, even Jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable from secret <hi>Atheism</hi> &amp; publick <hi>Gentilism</hi> were converted to acknowledg and accept of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for their Lord. What could produce such a marvelous change in the World but an Almighty power? How seemingly impossible was it to bring so many, who were proud in their natures, perverse in their customs, and indubitably assenting to their false Religions, from such a distance as the Worship of innumerable Deities, to adore a Crucified God? 'Twas admirable that <hi>Alexander</hi> broke the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire with an Army of Thirty Thousand: but what is there comparable in that Conquest, to the Acts of the Apostles? How much less difficult is it for some Nations to change their Kings, than for all
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:42565:236"/>
to change their Gods? How far more easie is it to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the bodies of Men, than subdue their Souls? Upon the most exact inquiry, there will never be found in humane nature any cause capable to produce such an effect, nor in the Records of all Ages any example like it.</p>
            <p>Add to this the excellent Reformation in the hearts and lives of Men. As their understandings, so their wills and affections the sources of action were mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously alter'd. What the Sages of the World could not effect in a few select Persons, The Gospel hath done in great numbers, nay rais'd them above all their feigned <hi>Ideas,</hi> above the higest pitch of their Proud <hi>Philosophy.</hi> Those strong and furious passions which Natural Reason was as unable to restrain, as a threed of silk is to govern a fierce beast, the Gospel hath tamed and brought into order: It hath execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what <hi>Philosophy</hi> durst never enterprise, despairing of Success. The Gospel hath made the Wise Men of the World resign their Reason to Faith; it hath perswaded Carnal Men to mortify the Flesh, the Ambitious to despise secular Honours, the Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to renounce their Pleasures, the Covetous to distribute their Goods to the Poor, the Injur'd and Incensed to forgive their Enemies, and all this for Love to God, an affection unknown to all other Laws and Institutions. Where-ever it came, it miraculously transform'd <hi>Pagans</hi> into Christians, which was as truly Wonderful, as for the <hi>Basilisk</hi> to part with its Poison, for a <hi>Wolfe</hi> to be chang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Alteration was so visible, that the lives of the first Christians were an Apologie for their Faith. And 'tis strongly urged by <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Lactantius</hi> and others, as a convinceing proof of the Divinity of the Christian Doctrine, that it made the Professours of it Divine in their conversations. The Creation of Grace was like the Creation of Nature, when trees sprang up in an instant laden with fruits; so in the converted, all the blessed fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance abounded.</hi> This testimony even a <hi>Pagan</hi> Persecutor gives the common sort of Christians,<note place="margin">Plin. <hi>Lib.</hi> 10 <hi>Epist.</hi> 7.</note> that they assembled to sing Hymns to Christ, that they obliged themselves solemnly to injure no Person, to deceive none, to preserve faithfully what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, to be alwayes true. And as in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Gospel, they gave a divorce to all the sinful delights of sense; so, which was incomparably more difficult, they embrac't those things which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth most abhor: no Religion in the World e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exposed its followers to such Sufferings, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd them with such resolution to sustain them.
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42565:237"/>
All other Religions were productions of the flesh, and being allyed together, if any time jealousy caused a discord between them, yet an open Persecution was unusual. But when Christianity first appear'd, they all turn'd their Hatred and Violence against it, as a foreigner of a different extraction. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny living <hi>Martyrs</hi> were Exiles for the Faith, and depriv'd of all humane consolation? yet they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd themselves more blessed in their Miseries than others in their Pleasures. How many thousands were put to Death for the honour of our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? yet the least thing is the number, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the manner of their Sufferings. If they had suffer'd a mild <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> an easie &amp; sudden Death, wherein the Combat and Victory had been finisht at a Blow, their Love and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage had not been so admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:<note place="margin">Ulpian <hi>wrote seven books, to describe the Variety of Torments the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans suffered.</hi> Timebit forsitan ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro gladium gravem, &amp; crucem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsam, &amp; rabiem Bestiarum, &amp; summam ignium poenam, &amp; omne Carnificis ingenium in Tormentis. <hi>Tert. ad Martyr.</hi>

in their cruel Service; But I never saw the <hi>Martyrs</hi> weary of Sufferings, nor heard them desire a Truce, much less Deliverance from them. If the Judges were softened with their Blood, and by the force of Nature were compell'd to be compassionate, so as to offer them a release if they would but feign to deny Christ; They were fill'd with indignation, esteeming it the worst injury, that their Persecutors expected, they would be guilty of but the shadow of Infidelity to their dear Saviour. They were ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of the longest and most terrible Sufferings for His sake, to be <hi>Martyrs</hi> in every member. They sang the Praises of Christ (their Tongues being <hi>harmonious</hi> with the affections of their Hearts) in the Flames, they preach'd Him from the Crosses, they rejoiced in him as their only Good, in the midst of devouring Beasts. <hi>Briefly,</hi> They preserved an inviolable Faith to Him, notwithstanding the most furious Batteries against them: The barbarous Enemy might tear their Hearts from their Breasts, but never Christ from their Hearts, to whom they were inseparably united by Love, stronger than the most cruel Death.</p>
            <p>Now what less then the Divine Power could sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them under those Torments, which 'tis almost incredible a Body made of flesh could endure?

But the Noble Army of <hi>Martyrs</hi> who overcame in the most bloody battels, was numerous beyond account; and compos'd of all sorts of Persons, of the aged and infirm, of tender Youths, of delicate Women, of the Honourable and obscure; Yet in that difference of Ages, and Sexes, and States, there appear'd such an equality of Vertue,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Latriones &amp; robusti Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris viri e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusmodi La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerationes perferre ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queunt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus edunt, quia deest il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis inspirata patientia.

            <p>If it be said that some have died for a false Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so that the extraordinary assistance of Heaven was not necessary to encourage the Christian <hi>Martyrs.</hi> The Answer is clear. There is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the number of the Sufferers, and manner of their Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some few moved by Vanity and Melancholy, or compell'd, have suffered for a false Religion, that was authorised by the Custom of their Country for many Ages. But innumerable <hi>Christians</hi> animated by the example of their Crucified King, freely sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed themselves for the testimony of the Gospel upon the first Revelation of it, before any <hi>humane</hi> respects gave colour to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In those who suffer'd for a false Religion were visible either Fear or Vain-glory, Stubbornness or Rage; But the <hi>Christians</hi> in their greatest Sufferings exprest Magnanimity without Pride, Constancy without Fierceness, Patience without Stupidity, and such an admirable Compassion to their Enemies, as
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:42565:239"/>
persuaded some of their Tormentors to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with them in Martyrdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The suddainness and universality of the change effected by the Gospel, is a signal Evidence of the Divine Power that attended it. The <hi>Apostle</hi> declares the admirable progress of it <hi>in all the world,</hi> during his time.<note place="margin">Col. 1.6.</note> In a few years with incredible swiftness it past through <hi>Judea, Samaria, Syria, Greece,</hi> and all the parts of the known habitable World. <hi>Tacitus</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that in the <hi>eleventh</hi> year of <hi>Nero,</hi> great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Christians</hi> were at <hi>Rome,</hi> at a great distance from the place where the <hi>Gospel</hi> was first preach'd. It appears from the Writings of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that in the Second <hi>Century</hi> after the Death of Christ, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was fill'd with <hi>Christian</hi> Churches. The World was peopled with a new Generation. Now what Secret Power produced that suddain and universal Change? How came it to pass that the <hi>Gospel,</hi> contrary to the order of new Things, should be so readily receiv'd, and in those places where the most insuperable obstacles oppos'd it? In <hi>Corinth</hi> the Seat of Luxury and Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; in <hi>Ephesus</hi> where Idolatry had its Throne; in <hi>Rome</hi> it self where Honours, Riches, Pleasures were ador'd. <hi>Moses</hi> with all his great Miracles never conquer'd one Nation to the true God. <hi>The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees compast Sea and Land to make a Proselyte:</hi>

               </note>3. The lasting Change made by the Gospel is the Effect of Infinite Power. <hi>Philosophy</hi> though main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the successive force of the greatest Wits, yet declin'd and came to nothing. But Christianity attended only by its own Authority, establisht its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and rais'd an Eternal Empire of Truth and Holiness in the World. The Reason of Man cannot inspire into its Productions a Principle of Life, only that Power which conveys to Man an immortal Soul, can derive to its Institutions a Spirit to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and preserve them. And this Victorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Efficacy of the Gospel is more admirable,<note place="margin">Dioclesian.

               </note> in regard it prevail'd without the assistance, and against the opposition of all. The more it was opprest the more it prosper'd. It gain'd credit and Disciples by Contradiction and Persecution; it was multiplied by the Deaths of its followers. <hi>The Cloud of Witnesses</hi> dissolving in a shower of Blood, made the Church Fruitful. Although some Persecutors have boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their utter abolishing the Christian Name in all parts of the Empire; yet those inscriptions are the Proud Monuments of their Vanity, not Victory. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are perisht, but Truth remains for ever. By which 'tis evident, that as the Gospel had a higher Principle than what is from below, so it was assisted with more than Humane Power. To sum up in short what hath been amplified; how Gloriously was the Arm of the Lord revealed in raising the World that
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:42565:240"/>
for four thousand years lay in Wickednesse? What less than a Divine Power could soften such an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hardnesse as long custome in Sin brings? What could pluck up errours that had taken such deep root in the Spirits of Men, and were Naturaliz'd to them, and plant a Discipline so austere and thorny to sense? Who but the Almighty could cast out the Devil from his Empire, and withdraw his Subjects that were captivated by the terrour of Laws, and by the delights of the flesh? What invisible Power made innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable of the tender sex who were not by temper couragious, nor by obstinacy inflexible, nay, who were so fearful that they could not see a drawn sword without affrightment, yet so resolute, as to despise all the instruments of Cruelty? What is more asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing than to see a flock of sheep encounter and overcome an Army of Lyons? This was the Lords doing, and ought to be marvelous in our Eyes. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the making a Crucified Person to Reign in the midst of his Enemies, and to give Laws to the whole Earth, is a Victory worthy the Lord of Hosts. The Conversion of the World to Christianity was the effect of infinite Mercy, and equal Power.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Divine Power shall be Gloriously manifested in the compleat Salvation of the Church at the end of the World. Jesus Christ as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is invested with Sovereign <hi>Power in Heaven and Earth:</hi> and in that quality he shall exercise it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.25.</note> till our Salvation is finisht. <hi>For he must reign till he hath put all Enemies under his feet.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Heb.</note> 
               <hi>But we see not yet all things put under him.</hi> Although those Persons and things that never degenerated from their Original, are intirely subject to him; the Angels obey his Will, Universal Nature is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd

               </gap> from them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver resist the Direction of his hand; yet there are others that fell from their Integrity, and some things consequent to Mans Rebellion, which either oppose the Power of Christ, or are not yet actually sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: and they are the Enemies of our Salvation, Satan, Sin, and Death. Now the perfect Freedom of the Church from all these, will be the last Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Act of Christs Regal Office. And 'tis observe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the Day of Judgment is call'd the Day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, with respect to the final accomplishment of our Felicity, that was purchas'd by the infinite Price of his Sufferings. The day of Christs Death was the Day of Redemption, as to our Right and Title; for then our Ransom was fully paid, and 'tis by the Immortal efficacy of his Blood that we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Glorious Liberty of the Sons of God: but the Actual enjoyment of it shall be at the last day. Therefore the perfection of all our Spiritual Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges is refer'd to that time, when <hi>Death our L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st Enemy</hi> shall be overcome.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> The Apostle saith, <hi>and not only they but our selves also, which have the first Fruits of the Spirit, even we our selves, groan within our selves, waiting for the Adoption; to wit, the Redemption of our Bodies.</hi> During the present Life, we are taken into Gods Family, in the quality of his Children; but the most Solemn Act of our Adoption shall be at the last Day. In this there is a similitude between Christ and his Members: for although he was the Son of God by his marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conception, and own'd by him while he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his Ministry upon the Earth; yet all the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of Gods Favour to him, were not compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:42565:241"/>
to the Declaration of it, in raising him from the Grave: Then in the face of Heaven and Earth, He said, <hi>Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee.</hi> So in this Life God acknowledges and treats us as his Children, he cloaths us with the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of his Son, feeds us with his Word, defends us from our Spiritual Enemies; but the most Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration of his favour shall be in the next Life, when all the <hi>Children of the Resurrection</hi> shall be born in a Day. Add further; although the Souls of Believers immediately upon their Separation are receiv'd into Heaven, and during the sleep of Death enjoy admirable Visions of Glory, yet their Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness is imperfect, in comparison of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent degree which shall be enjoyed at the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As the <hi>Roman Generals</hi> after a compleat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, first enter'd the City privately, and after having obtain'd License of the Senate, made their Triumphant entry with all the magnificence &amp; splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour becoming the Greatness of their Victories: So after a Faithful Christian hath <hi>fought the good fight,</hi> and is come off, <hi>more than a Conquerour,</hi> he enters privately into the Coelestial City, but when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is rais'd to Immortality, he shall then in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and with the acclamations of the Holy Angels, have a Glorious entry into it. I will briefly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why the Bodies of the Saints shall be rais'd, and how the Divine Power will be manifested in that last Act.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The General reason is from Gods Justice. As the Oeconomy of Divine Providence requires, there must be a Future State, when God shall sit upon a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Throne to weigh the Actions of all Men, and render to every one according to their quality; so 'tis
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:42565:242"/>
as necessary that the Person be Judged, and not one Part alone. The Law Commands the entire Man compos'd of his Essential Parts the Soul and Body: And 'tis obeyed or violated by both of them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Guilt or Moral Goodness of Actions is chiefly Attributed to the Soul, because 'tis the Principle of them, yet the Actions are imputed to the whole Man. The Soul is the Guide, the Body the Instrument:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Animi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris servitio magis uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi> Sal.</note> 'tis reasonable therefore that both should receive their recompence. We see the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this in Humane Justice, which is a copy of the Divine. The whole Man is punisht or rewarded. The Soul is punisht with Disgrace and Infamy, the Body with Pains: the Soul is rewarded with Esteem and Honour, the Body with External marks of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Thus the Divine Justice will render to every <hi>one according to things done in the Body, whether Good or Evill.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The special reason of the Saints Resurrection is their Union with Christ: for he is not only our Redeemer and Prince, but our second <hi>Adam,</hi> the same in Grace as the first was in Nature. Now as from the first the Soul was destroyed by Sin, and the Body by Death, so the second restores them both to their Primitive state; the one by Grace, the other by a Glorious Resurrection. Accordingly the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.21.</note> 
               <hi>that by Man came Death, and by Man came the Resurrection from the Dead.</hi> Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Moral and Natural impossibility of our Glorious Resurrection: the Moral, by the infinite merit of his Death, whereby Divine Justice is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that otherwise would not permit the Guilty to be restor'd to Eternal Life: and the Natural, by his rising from the Grave to a Glorious Imortality.
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:42565:242"/>
For his Infinite Power can do the same in all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. 'Tis observable, the Apostle infers the Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believers from that of Christ, not only as the Cause, but the Original Example. For the Members must be conform'd to the Head, the Children to their Father, the younger to the elder Brother. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is call'd, the first-fruits of them that sleep:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and the first begotten of the Dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1</note> In Christ's Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ours is so fully assur'd, that the event is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Now no less than Infinite Power is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to raise the Bodies of the Saints from the dust, and to transform them into the similitude of Christs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To raise them. Nothing is more astonishing to Nature than that the Bodies which after so many Ages in the perpetual circulation of the Elements have past into a thousand different Forms,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Imperfectae in homine na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turae, praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua solatia, ne Deum qui dem posse om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia; nam nec sibi potest mortem Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scisere, nec mortales aeter nitate dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, nec revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care defunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.</hi> Pli. lib. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> one part of them being resolved into Water, another evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Air, another turn'd into Dust, should be restor'd to their first State. What Wisdom is requisite to separate the Parts so mixt and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? what Power to recompose them? what Vertue to reinspire them with new Life? It may seem more difficult than to revive a Dead Body whose Organs and matter is not chang'd, of which we have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Scripture. When the Spirit of the Lord plac't <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the midst of a Valley cover'd with bones, and caused him to consider attentively their Number which was very great, and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream dryness, he askt him, <hi>whether these bones could live</hi>?<note place="margin">Ezek. 37.4, 5, 6.</note> upon which as one divided and ballanc't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the seeming Impossibility of the thing in it self, and the consideration of the Divine Power to which nothing is impossible, he answered, <hi>Lord thou knowest.</hi> Upon this God commanded him, <hi>to Prophesie
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:42565:243"/>
upon those bones, and speak to them,</hi> as if they had been endued with Sense and Understanding. <hi>O ye dry Bones, hear the Word of the Lord: Thus saith the Lord God unto these Bones, Behold I will cause breath to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into you, and ye shall live. And I will lay sinews up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and will bring in flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put Breath in you, and ye shall live, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</hi> And immediately there was a general commotion among them, they joyn'd together, the sinews and flesh came upon them, and the skin cover'd them. And upon a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Prophesy they were all inspir'd with the Breath of Life, and stood up an exceeding great Army. Now whether this was really represented to his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward senses, or only by the efficacy of the Spirit to his imagination, no doubt so strange a Spectacle vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently affected him; as with Joy in hope of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Restoration of <hi>Israel,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. No less than Infinite Power is able to change the raised Bodies into the likenesse of Christs. The Apostle speaks with an exaggeration of it: For <hi>our Conversation is in Heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour the Lord Jesus, Christ, who shall change our Vile Bodies, that it may be fashioned like unto his Glorious Body, according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.</hi> This resemblance <hi>will be only in the Person of Believers.</hi> All Men shall
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:42565:243"/>
rise to be judged, but not all to be transform'd. There is a Resurrection to Death as well as to Life. Unhappy Resurrection! Which only serves to make the Body the Food of Eternal Death. But the Saints who endeavoured to be like to Christ in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, shall then have a perfect conformity to him in Glory and Immortality. How Glorious the Body of Christ is, we may conjecture in part by what the Apostle relates to <hi>Agrippa: At mid-day, O King,</hi>

            <argument>
               <p> The extraordinary working of the Divine Power is a convincing proof of the Verity of the <hi>Christian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The internal Excellencies of it are clear marks of its Divinity, to the purified Mind. The external Operations of God's power were requisite to convince men in their corrupt state, that the Doctrine the <hi>Gospel</hi> came from God. The miraculous owning of <hi>Christ</hi> by the whole Divinity from Heaven. The Resurrection of <hi>Christ</hi> the most important <hi>Article</hi> of of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the demonstration of all the rest. How valuable the Testimony of the <hi>Apostles</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. That 'twas impossible they should deceive, or be deceived. The quality of the Witnesses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. There cannot be the least reasonable suspicion of them. 'Tis utterly incredible that any humane temporal respects mov'd them to feign the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> The nature of the Testimony consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. It was of a matter of fact, and verified to all their Senses. The <hi>Uniformity</hi> of it secures us there was no corruption in the Witnesses, and that it was no illusion. They seal'd the truth of it with their Blood. The <hi>Miracles</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> did in the Name of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a strong demonstration that he was rais'd to a glorious life. That Power was continued in the <hi>Church</hi> for a time. The <hi>Conclusion,</hi> how reasonable it is to give an entire <hi>Assent</hi> to the truth of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> 'Tis desperate Infidelity not to believe it; and the highest Madness to pretend to believe it, and to live in disobedience to it.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:42565:245"/>1 FRom what hath been discours'd concerning the extraordinary working of the Divine Power, we have a most convincing proof of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. For since God hath by so many miraculous Effects, the infallible indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of His Favour to the Person of Jesus Christ, justified his Doctrine, no reasonable doubt can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main concerning it. Indeed the internal excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of it which are visible to the purged Eye of the Soul, are clear marks of its Divinity. The Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Redemption is made up of various parts,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> excellent account of <hi>The Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness of Christianity.</hi>
               </note> in the Union of which such an evident Wisdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the <hi>rational</hi> Mind, unless enslaved by prejudice, must be ravisht into a compliance. Even that which most offends Sense, the Meanness of our Saviours condition in the world, and the miseries to which He was expos'd, do so perfectly correspond with his great design to make Men holy and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it appears to be the effect of most wise Counsel. And such a Beauty of Holiness shines in the <hi>Moral</hi> part, as clearly proves God to be its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. It denounces war against all Vices, and commands every Vertue. All that is excellent in <hi>humane</hi> Institutions it delivers with infinite more authority and efficacy: And what natural reason did not reach to, it fully describes in order to the Glory of God and the Happiness of Man. Now as God, the Authour of Nature, hath by Tasts, and Smells, and other sensible qualities, distinguish'd things whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som from noxious, even to the lowest living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: So He hath much more distinguish'd objects that are saving from deadly, that is, the true Religion from the false, by undoubted evidences to any who
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:42565:245"/>
will exercise their Spiritual Senses, and sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know and obey it. And that all the wise and holy embraced it in the face of the greatest discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, is an unanswerable Argument that 'tis pleasing to God. For how is it possible that the Good God should suffer those to fall into <hi>mortal</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who from an ardent Affection to Him despis'd whatever is amiable or terrible in the world? How is it possible He should deny the Knowledg of Himself to those to whom He gave such a pure Love to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</p>
            <p>But the <hi>humane</hi> Nature in its corrupted state is contrary both to the Doctrine of the Gospel, that propounds Supernatural Verities hard to believe, and to the commands of it, that enjoin things hard to do: For this reason 'twas necessary that God by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Operations, the undeniable effects of His Power, should discover to the World his approbation of it.</p>
            <p>Now that Christ is the Son of God, and Redeemer of the World, was miraculously declared from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the whole Divinity, <hi>There are</hi> Three <hi>that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, and the Word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>and the Holy Ghost, and these three are One.</hi> The Father testified by a Voice as loud as Thunder at his Baptism, and Transfiguration, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note> The Son by his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appariton to <hi>Paul,</hi> when He struck him to the earth with these words, <hi>Why persecutest thou me?</hi> The Light was so <hi>radiant,</hi> the Voice so strong,<note place="margin">Act. 9.4.</note> the impression it made so deep and sensible, that he knew it came from God. And He manifested Himself to St. <hi>John</hi> with that brightness, <hi>That he fell at his feet as dead,</hi> till in compassion He reviv'd him, and said,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:42565:246"/>
               <hi>I am He that liveth and was dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1.17.</note> 
               <hi>and behold I am alive for evermore.</hi> And the Holy Spirit by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous descent in the shape of a Dove upon Him, and in fiery Tongues upon the <hi>Apostles,</hi> gave a visible testimony that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was sent from God to save the World. I will particularly consider one Effect of the Divine Power, the Resurrection of Christ, this being the most important Article of the Gospel, and the demonstration of all the rest. For 'tis not conceivable that God would by his Almighty Power have rais'd Him from the Grave to a glorious Life, (and it is impossible He should be otherwise) if He had taken the Name of the Son of God in vain, and arrogated to himself Divine Honour, and only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he was sent from Him. <hi>By the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection He was declar'd to be the Son of God with Power.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> For that being the proof of his <hi>Mission,</hi> justifies the truth of his Doctrine, and particularly of the quality of God's Son, which He alwaies attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Himself. Now if Infidelity object, that we who live in the present Age have no sensible testimony that Christ is risen, and what assurance is there, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> who reported it were not Deceivers or deceived? In Answer to this, I will briefly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> how valuable the Testimony of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles is, and worthy of all acceptation; and that 'twas equally impossible they should be deceived, or intend to deceive. His Death is attested by his Enemies. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

sent to convert the World, were to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay this down as the foundation of their Preaching, that Jesus Christ was rais'd from the dead, that all might yield Faith and Obedience to Him.

For this reason St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was extraordinarily admitted into their Order, had a miraculous Sight of Christ from Heaven <hi>(Last of all He was seen of me)</hi> to testifie it to the World. Now for our full conviction,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.8.</note> 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to consider the quality of the Witnesses, and the nature of their Testimony.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Witnesses were such of whom there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the least reasonable Suspicion.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In testimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is dignitas, fides, mores, gravitas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminanda est.</hi>
               </note> In <hi>Civil</hi> Causes of the greatest moment, the Testimony of the Honourable and the Rich are accounted valuable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not easily corrupted: one of a low degree may from baseness of Spirit, through Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize and Fear be tempted to deny the Truth: one in a poor condition may be so dazled with the lustre of Gold, when he considers the price of Perjury, as to be induced to assert a falshood. But who is more incorruptible, the Noble that from a sense of Honour abhor a Lie,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> or those who by their Divine Birth and Qualities did so detest it, that they would not tell a Lie for the Glory of God? Who is more worthy of Credit, the Rich whose Riches sometimes excites their desires after more, or those who by a generous
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:42565:247"/>
disdain despised all things. Besides, Persons of known Integrity whom the different images of hopes and fears cannot probably encline to evil, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to decide the weightiest Causes: Now the Apostles were so innocent, sober, honest and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in the whole tenour of their Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that their most malignant Adversaries could never fasten an accusation upon them. Indeed if their carnal Interests had been concern'd, there might have been some colourable Objections against their Testimony: But if we duely consider things, it will appear utterly incredible that any deceit could be in it. For as all the actions of reasonable Men proceed from Reason solid or apparent, so particularly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture and Fiction are never without some Motive and Design: For being contrary to Nature, there must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntervene a forreign Consideration for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance. Now the universal Motives to invent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are Honour, Riches, or Pleasure. But none of these could possibly move the Apostles to feign the Resurrection of Christ. Not to insist on the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Extraction and Education, who had only seen Boats and Nets, and convers'd with Lakes and Fishes, whereas Ambition usually springs up in Persons of high birth and breeding; 'tis evident that no respect to <hi>humane</hi> Praise excited them, since they attributed the Doctrine of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that should give them reputation in the World, to the Holy Spirit, and ascribed the Glory of their miraculous Actions entirely to the Divine Power. When the People of <hi>Lystra</hi> would have given Divine Honour to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3.12, 13</note> he disclaim'd it with abhorrency:<note place="margin">&amp; 4.10.</note> And presently after, those who would have ador'd him as a God, stoned him as a Malefactor; he chose rather to be their
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:42565:247"/>
Sacrifice than their Idol. Besides, how could they expect to be great or rich by declaring that One who came to such a <hi>Tragical</hi> End in the face of the world, was rais'd to Life, when the hands of the <hi>Jews</hi> were still bloody with the Wounds of their Master, and their hearts so enraged against all that honoured his Name, as to excommunicate them for execrable Persons. It had been as extravagant to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed the acquiring of Reputation or Riches by their Preaching, as for one to throw himself into a flaming Furnace to be cool'd and refresh'd: And that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure could not be their Aim is manifest: For they met with nothing but Poverty and Persecution, with Derision and Disgrace, with Hardships and all the effects of Fury, which they willingly endured rather than cease from Preaching, or deny what they had Preach'd. Their unheard of Resolution to forsake their Native Countey, and travel to all the known parts of the Earth, to convey the Doctrine of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is a strong Demonstration that they believed it to be true, and of infinite moment, most worthy of all the dangers to which they voluntarily exposed themselves. Never did Ambition or Avarice, the most <hi>active</hi> Passions, cause men to be more diligent, than they were to communicate the Knowledg of our Saviour to all Nations. Now what greater assurance can we possibly receive that they were sincere in their Report.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The nature of the Testimony makes it very credible.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was of a matter of Fact. If it had been some high Speculation of universal Things abstracted from Matter, and above the cognizance of the Senses, there might be some pretence to object, That the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:42565:248"/>
Disciples, unexercised in <hi>Sciences,</hi> were deceived by the Subtlety of ther Master: But 'tis a singular Thing of which the Senses are the most faithful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and competent Judges.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was an ocular Testimony, which as it makes the strongest impression upon the Spectator, so upon the belief of others. Thus St. <hi>John, That which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on declare we unto you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.1.</note> And that they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived we have great certainty; For <hi>Jesus</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd a long time with them before his Death, and their Respect and Love to Him, and after their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion had deeply engraved the lineaments of his Visage in their memories, and He presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not many years, but <hi>three</hi> daies after his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, so that it was impossible they should have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his Countenance. He appear'd to them not <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice,</hi> but many times, and not suddenly as a flash of Lightning that presently vanisheth, but converst with them familiarly for <hi>forty</hi> daies. And 'tis observable, the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves were not easily wrought on to believe this Truth. When the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Angels assur'd them that He was risen, yet they were suspended between Hopes and Fears. And at his <hi>first</hi> Appearance they were vehemently surpriz'd; They saw Him die on the Cross <hi>three</hi> daies before, and their Memories were still fill'd with the frightful images of his Sufferings, so that they were ballanc'd between the present testimony of Sense,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.37, 39, 43.</note> and the fresh remembrance of what they had seen. Therefore He justified the truth of his Resurrection to all their Senses. He discours'd with them, made them feel his Wounds, eat and drank with them,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.1.</note> so that 'twas impossible they should be
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:42565:248"/>
deceived, unless willingly. Thus by the wise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of God, their doubting hath confirmed our Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Uniformity of the testimony makes it valuable upon a <hi>double</hi> account. <hi>First,</hi> As it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us, there was no corruption in the Witnesses. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it was no Illusion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there was no Corruption in the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. The most prudent way to discover the falsity of a testimony, is to interrogate the Witnesses severally, to see if there be any contradiction between them. But if they concur not only as to the Substance, but Circumstances, their Deposition is very credible. Now the Apostles exactly agreed in their testimony, as appears by the several Gospels, in which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wrote in divers times and places, yet there is an admirable <hi>Harmony</hi> not only as to the Fact it self, but the least particularities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Agreement of so many proves it was no Illusion. If He had only appear'd to some persons separately, <hi>carnal</hi> Reason, which is ingenious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive itself, might object that it was only the effect of a distemper'd fancy, and no real object of Sence. But after He had shewn Himself to some of the Disciples apart, and that holy Company was met together, uniting the several sparks, to encourage their hopes of his Resurrection, He came to them altogether; and for many daies conversed with them. Now who can believe that so many should be obstructed with <hi>Melancholy</hi> for so long time, so as constantly to remain under the power of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion? Besides, He afterwards appear'd to <hi>five hundred</hi> at once: Now how could such a number of
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:42565:249"/>
different Ages, Sexes, Temperaments be at the same time struck with the same Imagination?</p>
            <p>Add further, If a strong Imagination had deceiv'd them by <hi>Melancholy,</hi> there would have been some discoveries of that Humour in their Actions. For 'tis impossible that the Mind so indisposed, should for a long time act regularly. But in the whole course of their Lives not the least extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy appears. Their Zeal was temper'd with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, their Innocence was without Folly, their Conversation was becoming their great Office. And of this we have unquestionable Evidence: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise so many Persons of excellent Wisdom had never been perswaded by them to embrace <hi>Christianity</hi>; neither had their Enemies so furiously persecuted them: For 'tis beyond belief that they had so far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd the Sentiments of Humanity, as to treat the <hi>Apostles</hi> as the most guilty Criminals, whom they knew to be distracted, and therefore worthy of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion rather than Hatred.</p>
            <p>But if it be objected, that it might be a <hi>Phantasm,</hi> or solid Body form'd according to the Likeness of <hi>Christ,</hi> that abus'd the Apostles, and after some time withdrew itself. The vanity of the Objection is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apparent: For such an effect could not be without the operation of a Spiritual Cause. Now the good Angels cannot be guilty of falshood, of which they had been in that representation: for He that appear'd, declar'd himself to be <hi>Jesus</hi> that suffer'd: neither would the evil use such an Artifice: The old Serpent was too wise to promote the belief of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, which is the Foundation of Christianity. An Institution most holy, that would destroy his Altars, discredit his Oracles, bring Glory to God,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:42565:249"/>
and Happiness to Man, to both which he is eternally opposite. By all which it appears there was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in the subject nor object.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They seal'd it with their Blood. This last proof confirms all the other. If a person of clear fame assert a thing, which he is ready to maintain with the loss of his Life, there is no reason to doubt of the truth of his Deposition. 'Tis no wonder that <hi>Philostratus,</hi> a bold <hi>Grecian,</hi> to shew his Art, painted <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> as a Demi-god, exempted from death, and cloathed with immortality. But if he had been drawn from his Study, where he drest that Idol of Iniquity, to appear before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, to give an account of the truth of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he certainly would have renounc'd his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Hero,</hi> rather than have given his Life for a Lie. Now the <hi>Apostles</hi> endur'd the most cruel Deaths to confirm the Truth of their Testimony. And what could possibly induce them to it, if they had not been certain of his Resurrection? Could love to their dead Master animate them to suffer for the honour of his Name? This is inconceiveable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd that He would rise the <hi>third</hi> Day, and ascend to Heaven, and make them partakers of his Glory: So that if He had lain in the rot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enness of the Grave, What charm, what stupidity was able to make them preserve so high a Ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ration for a Deceiver? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could remain in them but the memory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of his Imposture. Now if it be the <hi>dictate</hi> of natural Reason, that the concurrent Testimony of <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> credible Persons, not weaken'd by any exception, is sufficient to decide any Cause of the greatest moment, that respects Life, Honour and Estate, how much more should the attestation of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:42565:250"/>
the <hi>Apostles</hi> put this great Truth beyond all doubt, since they parted with their Lives, the most precious possession in this World, for it; and which is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more, if Deceivers, they would certainly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Eternal Life in the next. In short, Since the Creation never was a Testimony so clear and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,</hi> the Divine Providence so ordering the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that the Evidence should be above all Suspicion. Neither did it ever happen, that any thing affirm'd by so many and such worthy Persons, was ever suspected, much less found, to be false. 'Tis the most unreasonable stifness not to yeeld an intire Assent to it. For there would be no secure Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of determining innumerable weighty Cases, if we should doubt of things reported by the most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible circumspect Persons, since we can be certified by our own Senses but of a few Objects.</p>
            <p>I shall only add, That the <hi>Apostles</hi> did many and great Miracles in the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> which was the strongest demonstration that He was rais'd to a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Life. They were invested by the Spirit with the <hi>habits</hi> of various Tongues. This kind of Miracle was necessary for the universal Preaching of the Gospel: For how difficult and obstructive had it been to their Work, if they must have return'd to their Infant-state, to learn the Signification of forrein Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, to pronounce the words in their original Sound, and the <hi>Accents</hi> proper to their Countrey? Therefore the Holy Spirit, according to the promise of Christ, descended upon them, and became their Master, and in a moment imprest on their Memories the forms of discoursing, and on their Tongues the manner of expressing them. Where-ever the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jesus was preach'd, <hi>God bare them witness

both with Signes and Wonders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>and with divers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.</hi> When St. <hi>Peter</hi> pass'd through the streets, fill'd with persons diseased and half dead, he caused an universal resurrection by touching them with his reviving shadow. They tamed Serpents, and quencht the malignity of their Poison; they commanded Death to leave its prey, and Life to return to its mansion that was not habitable for it. And that miraculous Power continued in their Successours so long as was requisite for the conviction of the World. <hi>Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian,</hi> mention divers Miracles perform'd by Christians in those times. <hi>Tertullian</hi> offers to the Emperour, to whom he addrest his admirable <hi>Apology,</hi> to compel the Devils that possest <hi>Humane</hi> Bodies to confess themselves to be evil Spirits, to constrain the Prince of darkness to enlighten his own Slaves. And <hi>Cyprian</hi> assures the Governour of <hi>Africa,</hi> that he would force the Devils to come out of the Bodies they tormented, lamenting their ejection. Now we cannot imagine they would so far discredit their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Reputation, as to pretend to such a Power without they had it. In short, To deny the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians, were as great rashness, as to deny that <hi>Caesar</hi> conquer'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> or that <hi>Titus</hi> succeeded <hi>Vespasian.</hi> For we have the concurrent Testimony of the gravest and best Men, of Understanding and Conscience, who were Eye-witnesses, and which was not contradicted by those of the same Age. Briefly, There are such clear <hi>characters</hi> of the Divine Hand to render the <hi>Gospel</hi> authentick, that to deny it to be true, is to make <hi>God a liar.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="478" facs="tcp:42565:251"/>The <hi>Conclusion</hi> is this, We see how reasonable it is to give an entire assent to the truth of <hi>Christianity.</hi> The Nature of the Doctrine that is perfecty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, declares its Original. 'Tis confirmed by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Testimonies. The Doctrine distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes the Miracles from all false wonders, the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Satan, and the Miracles confirm the Doctrine. What doubt can there be after the full deposition of the Spirit in raising Christ from the Grave; in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who were rude and ignorant, with Knowledg, Zeal, Courage, Charity, and all Graces requisite for their great enterprise, and in converting the World by their Ministry and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles? If we believe not so clear a Revelation, our Infidelity is desperate. When our Saviour was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, the Meanness and Poverty of his appearance lessen'd their Crime, who did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and honour him in the disguise of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: Therefore they were capable of favour. Many of his bloody Persecutors were converted and saved by the Preaching of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> But since the Holy Ghost hath convinc'd the World by so strong a Light, of Sin, Righteousness and Judgment; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Jesus</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> most unworthily Crucified was the Son of God, that in dying He purchased the Pardon of Sin; since He is risen and received to Glory, <hi>That all power in Heaven and Earth is given to Him,</hi> the effect of which is most visible: For spiritual Wickednesses trembled at his Name, were expelled from their Dominions, and sent to their old Prison to suffer the Chains and Flames due to them: To refuse his Testimony, is a degree of Obstinacy not far distant from Malice of of the Devils, and puts Men without the reserves of
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:42565:251"/>
pardoning Mercy. And 'tis not a slight, superficial Belief of this great Truth that is sufficient, but that which is powerful in making us universally obedient to our Glorified Redeemer, who will distribute Crowns to all his faithful Servants. We cannot truly believe his Resurrection, without believing his Doctrine, nor believe his Doctrine without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Desires after the eternal Felicity it promises, nor desire that Felicity without a sincere compliance to his Commands in order to the obtaining it. <hi>In short,</hi> 'Tis Infidelity approaching Madness, not to believe the Truth of the Gospel, but 'tis Madness of an higher kind and more prodigious, to pretend to believe it, and yet to live in disobedience to its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, in contempt of its Promises and Threatnings, as if it were a meer Fable.</p>

            <argument>
               <p> The Honour of God's Truth with respect to the <hi>Legal</hi> Threatning, was preserv'd in the Death of Christ. The Divine Truth with respect to the Promises and Types of Christ under the <hi>Law,</hi> was justified in his Coming, and the accomplishment of our Redemption by him. Some special <hi>Predictions</hi> consider'd that respect the time of his <hi>Coming.</hi> The particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances that respect the <hi>Messiah</hi> are verified in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> The <hi>Consequents</hi> of the <hi>Messia's</hi> Coming, foretold by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> are all come to pass. The Types of the <hi>Law</hi> are compleated in Christ. A particular Consideration of <hi>Manna,</hi> the <hi>Rock,</hi> and the brazen <hi>Serpent,</hi> as they referr'd to him. The <hi>Paschal</hi> Lamb considered. A short <hi>Parallel</hi> between <hi>Melchisedec</hi> and <hi>Christ.</hi> The <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> proved, by comparing the antient <hi>Figures</hi> with the present <hi>Truth,</hi> and Predictions with the Events. The Happiness of <hi>Christians</hi> above the <hi>Jews</hi> in the clear revelation of our <hi>Saviour</hi> to them. From the accomplishment of Prophecies concerning the <hi>first</hi> Coming of Christ, our Faith should be confirmed in the Promises of his <hi>second.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Original Law given to Man in <hi>Paradise</hi> had a severe Penalty annext, that upon the <hi>first</hi> breach of it he should die. The end of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was to preserve in him a constant reverence of the Command. After his Disobedience, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Divine Truth was concern'd as to the inflicting the punishment. For although the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:42565:252"/>
Lawgiver hath power over the Law to relax the Punishment as to particular persons; yet having declar'd that according to that Rule He would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in judgment with Man, the Perfection of his Truth required, that Sin should be punish'd in such a manner, that his Righteousness and Holiness might eminently appear, and the reasonable Creature for ever fear to offend Him. Now the God of Truth hath by the Death of his only Son so compleatly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Ends of the <hi>legal</hi> Threatning, that the glory of that Attribute is broke forth like the Sun through all the Clouds that seem'd to obscure it. <hi>Mercy and Truth meet together, Righteousness and Peace kiss each other.</hi> Of this I have so largely treated before, that I shall add nothing more concerning it. There is a <hi>Secondary</hi> respect wherein the truth of God is concern'd, as to the accomplishing our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Jesus Christ, which I will briefly explicate. God having decreed the sending of his Son in the quality of Mediator to purchase our Salvation, was pleased by several Promises to declare his merciful purpose, and by various Types to shew the design of that glorious Work, before the exhibition of it. This was the effect of his Supreme Wisdom and Goodness: <hi>First,</hi> To comply with the weakness of the Church, when 'twas newly separated from the World. For as a sudden strong Light overpowers the Eye that hath been long in the dark, so that full bright Revelation of the Gospel had been above the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Church when 'twas first freed from a state of Ignorance: Light mixt with Shadows was proportionable to their Sight. Therefore he was pleased by several Representations and Predictions to exercise the Faith, entertain the Hope, and excite
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:42565:253"/>
the Desires of his People before the accomplishment of our Salvation by his Son: <hi>Secondly,</hi> To render the belief of it easie and certain afterwards. Now for the honour of his Truth he was engaged to make good his word: For although pure Love and Mercy is the Original of all God's Promises to Man, yet his Truth and Fidelity are the reasons of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling them. Not that God is under the obligation of a Law, but his own righteous Nature is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Rule of his actions. Accordingly the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> laies it as the foundation of our Hopes; That <hi>God who cannot lie hath promised eternal Life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1.2.</note> The Divine Decree alone concerning our Salvation by Christ, is a sure Foundation: For God is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in his Will as his Nature. <hi>In Him there is no variableness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note> 
               <hi>nor shadow of turning.</hi> But the Promise determines the Will of God to perform it upon another account: For 'tis not single Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy but Falshood, not to perform what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, from both which He is infinitely distant. St. <hi>Paul</hi> alledges this for the reason why the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is unchangeable and of everlasting Efficacy, in that the counsel of God was by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and Oath confirmed,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lye, we might have strong consolation.</hi> For the Promise gives a rightful claim to the Creature, and the fulfilling of it is the justification of God's Fidelity. In this Sense 'tis said, <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.17.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> the Grace of the Gospel is the substantial and compleat accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Types and Promises under the Law. I will not enter into the discussion of all the Prophecies concerning the <hi>Messiah</hi> in the Old <hi>Testament,</hi> to shew
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:42565:253"/>
how they are verified in Jesus Christ; But briefly consider some special Predictions that concern the time of the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s Coming, his Person and Offices.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Prophecy of dying <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49.1.</note> 
               <hi>The Scepter shall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Lawgiver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his feet, till</hi> Shiloh <hi>come.</hi> By the Scepter and Lawgiver are meant divers Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the first being the mark of Regal Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other title respects those whose Power succeeded that of their Kings, in the person of <hi>Zerobabel</hi> and his Successors. <hi>Jacob</hi> prophetically declares <hi>two</hi> things; their establishment in <hi>Judah,</hi> and their continuance till the coming of <hi>Shiloh.</hi> This Oracle doth not precisely respect the person of <hi>Judah,</hi> for he never ascended the Throne, nor possest the Empire over his Brethren; nor solely his Posterity as a Tribe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisht from the rest, although it had special ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from that time:<note place="margin">Numb. 2.3.</note> For the Banner of <hi>Judah</hi> led the Camp in their march through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: That Tribe had the first possession of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; these were the beginnings of its future Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And from <hi>David</hi> to the Captivity, that Tribe possest the Kingdom; But the glory of his Scepter was lost in the person of <hi>Zedekiah:</hi> Therefore the full meaning of the Prophecy regards the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> in the relation they had to the Tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> For that Tribe alone returned entire from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity with some reliques of <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> so that the Nation from that time was distinguisht by the title of the <hi>Jews</hi> in relation to it; and the Right to dispose of the Scepter was alwaies in the Tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> For the <hi>Levites</hi> that ruled after the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity received their Power from them. <hi>'Till</hi> Shiloh <hi>come,</hi> that is, the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase, and the antient <hi>Jewish</hi> Interpreters expound; So that
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:42565:254"/>
the intent of the Oracle is, that after the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supreme Power in the Family of <hi>Judah,</hi> it should not pass into the hands of Strangers but as a certain <hi>Presage,</hi> and immediate Fore-runner of of the coming of <hi>Shiloh.</hi> And this was fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish't. For in the Captivity there was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption rather than extinction of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Their Return was promised at the time they were carried Captives to <hi>Babylon.</hi> But at the coming of Christ, <hi>Judea</hi> was a Province of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>Herod</hi> an <hi>Edomite</hi> sate on the Throne; and as the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> in general, so the Family of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in particular was in such a low state, that <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> that were descended from him, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to lodg in a stable at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> And since the blessed Peace-maker hath appear'd on the Earth, the <hi>Jews</hi> have lost all Authority; their Civil and Ecclesiastical State is utterly ruin'd, and they bear the visible marks of infamous Servitude.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Second</hi> famous Prediction is by an Angel to <hi>Daniel,</hi>

            <p n="3">3. The time of the manifestation of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is evidently set down in the <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>I will shake all Nations, and the desire of all Nations shall come, and I will fill this house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts.

            <p>The second Temple was much inferiour to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> as in Magnificence and external Ornaments, so especially because defective in those Excellencies that were peculiar to the first. They were the Ark of the Covenant, and the appearance of Glory between the Cherubims, the fire from Heaven to consume the Sacrifices, the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and the Holy Ghost who inspir'd the Prophets. <hi>But when the Lord came to his Temple,</hi> and perform'd many of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:42565:255"/>
there, this brought a Glory to it infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that of the former. For what comparison is there between the shadowy presence of God between the Cherubims, and his real presence in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Christ, in whom the fulness of the God-head dwelt bodily. How much inferiour were the Priests and Prophets to him, who came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and had the Spirit without measure, to reveal the Counsel of God for the Salvation of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The particular Circumstances foretold concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Messiah</hi> are, all verified in Jesus Christ.

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="487" facs="tcp:42565:255"/>3. The consequents of his Coming are foretold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Jews</hi> should reject him because of the meanness of his appearance. They neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Greatness and Majesty,<note place="margin">Isai. 53.</note> nor the Abasement of the <hi>Messiah</hi> described in their Prophesies: not his Greatness, that the Son of David was his Lord, that he was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> who rejoyced to his Day: for they did not believe the Eternity of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, They did not understand his humiliation to Death: Therefore 'twas objected by them that the Messiah remains for ever, and this Person saith he shall dy. They fancied a carnal Messiah shining with Worldly pomp, accompanied with thundring legions, to deliver them from Temporal Servitude, so that when <hi>they saw him without form and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and that no Beauty was in him to make him desireable, they hid their Faces from him, they despised and esteemed him not.</hi> Thus by their obstinate refusal of the Messiah, they really and visibly fulfil'd the Prophecies concerning him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Levitical Ceremonies and Sacrifices should cease upon the Death of the Messiah,<note place="margin">Daniel 26.27. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Although the legal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was establisht with great solemnity, yet there was alwayes a sufficient indication that it should not be perpetual. <hi>Moses</hi> who delivered the Law told them that God would <hi>raise another Prophet whom they must hear.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 110.3.</note> And <hi>David</hi> compos'd a Psalm to be sung in the Temple, containing the establishment of a Priest, not according to the order of Levi but Melchisedec, who should bring in a Worship Spiritual and Divine. And we see this accomplisht, all the Ceremonies were buried in his grave &amp; the Sacrifices for above sixteen hundred years are ceast. Besides the destruction of the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:42565:256"/>
Holy City and Sanctuary, the Jews are scatter'd in all parts, and in their dreadful dispersion suffer the just punishment of their Infidelity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was Prophesied that in the time of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah Idols should be ruin'd,<note place="margin">Zeph. 2.11. Mal. 1.15.

            <p>I will now make some short reflections upon the Types of the Law to show how they are compleated in Christ. The Mosaic Dispensation was so contriv'd as to bear a resemblance of the <hi>Messiah</hi> in all its parts. <hi>The Law had a shadow of good things to come: Christ was the end of the Law:</hi>

            <p>The main design of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is to shew, that in the antient Tabernacle there were models of the Heavenly things reveal'd in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The great number of Types declares the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Divine Wisdom, and the admirable fulness of Christ in whom they are verified. <hi>Three</hi> sorts were instituted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some were things without Life, whose quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and effects shadowed forth his Vertues and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. 2. Things endued with Life and Sence. 3. Reasonable Persons that either in their offices, actions, or the memorable accidents that befel them, represented the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Of the first sort I will briefly consider the <hi>Manna</hi> that miraculously fell from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the <hi>Rock</hi> that by its stream refresht the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Manna</hi> was an eminent Type of him. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Apostle declares of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> they <hi>did all eat the same Spiritual meat,</hi> not in respect of its Material but Symbolical Nature.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Manna</hi> was a delicious food: the Taste of it is described to be like wafers mixt with honey that have a pure chast sweetness: this typified the Love of Christ shed abroad in the hearts of Believers. Such an exalted ravishing pleasure proceeds from it, that the Psalmist breaks forth in an extasy, <hi>Taste and see how Good the Lord is.</hi>

For <hi>Manna</hi> could only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Natural Life for a time. As our Saviour tells the <hi>Jews, your Fathers eat Manna in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and are dead.</hi> But Jesus Christ is the living

            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Apostle</hi> testifies that the <hi>Israelites drank of that Spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</hi> That the Miracle was mysterious is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the circumstances related of it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4.</note> When the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in great distress for water, <hi>The Lord said to</hi> Moses, <hi>I will stand before thee there upon the Rock in</hi> Horeb, <hi>and thou shalt smite the Rock,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 17.6.</note> 
               <hi>and there shall come water out of it, that the People may drink.</hi> If there had been no other design but the relieving their necessity, that might have been sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by rain from Heaven; or if only to give a visible effect of the Divine Power, that had been discovered in causing new Springs to rise from the Earth, or the Command of God had been sufficient to strike the Rock; But he went to it to signifie the respect it had to himself. He was the Son of God that spake to <hi>Moses,</hi> and conducted the People: For this reason He is stiled the Angel of Gods presence, not with respect to his Nature, but Offices.</p>
            <p>I will briefly observe the <hi>parallel</hi> between the Rock and Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Rock is the ordinary Title of God in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to represent his unchangeable Nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power, whereby He upholds the World. And in a special manner it resembles the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 4.42. Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:42565:258"/>
the Church is built, and secur'd against the violence of Hell.</hi> Now <hi>Israel</hi> was not supplied from the Clouds or the Valleys, but the Rock; to shew that the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> Rock, the Son of God, can only refresh the Spiritual <hi>Israel</hi> with living Water.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The quality of the Rock hath a proper Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: For although it had in its Veins a rich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Waters, yet to appearance nothing was more dry and hard. In this it was a <hi>Figure</hi> of the Spiritual Rock: The effects have discovered in him unfathomable depths of Righteousness, Grace and Salvation; yet at the first view we had no hopes. For if we consider Him as God, He is infinitely Holy and Just, encompast with everlasting flames against Sin, and how can we expect any cooling streams from Him?</p>
            <p>If we consider him as Man, he <hi>is resembled to a root out of a dry ground</hi>; the Justice of the Divine and the infirmity of the Humane Nature did not promise any comfort to us.<note place="margin">Isai. 53.</note> But what cannot infinite Love, united to infinite Power, perform? Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodness hath chang'd the Laws of Nature in our favour, and by an admirable act open'd the Rock to refresh us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Rock was struck with the Rod of <hi>Moses</hi> a Type of the Law, before it sent forth its streams: thus our Spiritual Rock <hi>was wounded for our Transgressions,</hi> bruised for our Iniquities, <hi>&amp; then opened all his treasures to us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53.</note> 
               <hi>Being consecrated by Sufferings, he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Eternal Salvation.</hi> In this respect the Gospel propounds him <hi>for the object of</hi> saving Faith. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ and him Crucified.</hi> The Sacraments, the Seals of the New Covenant, have a special reference to his Death the Foundation of it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:42565:258"/>4. The Miraculous Waters followed the <hi>Israelites</hi> in their Journey, without which they had perisht in the Wilderness. This represents that Indeficiency of the Grace of Christ. A Soveraign stream flows from him to satisfy all Believers. He tells us, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever drinketh of the Water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the Water that I shall give him, shall be in him a Well of Water springing up unto Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. The Brasen <hi>Serpent</hi> sensibly exprest the manner of his Death and the benefits derived from it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jesus</hi> being the Minister of the Circumcision chose this Figure for the Instruction of the <hi>Jews.</hi> As <hi>Moses lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up: that whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves in him should not perish, but have Eternal Life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. Num. 21.</note> The Sacred Story relates, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> by their rebellious murmuring provoked God to send Serpents among them, whose Poison was so fiery and mortal, that it brought the most Painful Death. In this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction they addrest themselves to the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, who World by their Repentance, Commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to make a Serpent of Brass, and erect it on a Pole in the view of the whole Camp, that whosoever lookt on it should be healed. By this account from Scripture we may clearly understand something of greatest consequence was represented by it: For the only Wise God ordains nothing without just reason. Why must a Serpent of Brass be elevated on a Pole? could not the Divine Power recover them without it? Why must they look towards it? could not a healing vertue be conveyed to their wounds but through their eyes? All this had a direct reference to the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ. For the biting of the <hi>Israelites</hi> by the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:42565:259"/>
fiery Serpents, doth naturaly represent the effects of Sin, that torments the Conscience, and inflames the Soul with the apprehensions of Future Judgment. And the erecting a Brasen Serpent upon a Pole, that had the Figure not the Poison of those Serpents, doth in a lively manner set forth the lifting up of Jesus Christ on the Cross, who only had the similitude <hi>of sinful flesh.</hi> The looking towards the Brasen Serpent is a fit resemblance of Believing in Christ Crucified for Salvation. The Sight of the eye was the only means to derive vertue from it, and the Faith of the heart is the means by which the Sovereign efficacy of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is conveyed. <hi>This is the will of him that sent me, saith our Saviour, that every one which seeth the Son and believeth on him, may have Eternal Life.</hi> As in the camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> whoever lookt towards the Brasen Serpent, whatever his wounds were or the weakness of his sight, had a present remedy: so how numerous and grievous soever our Sins be, how infirm our Faith, yet if we sincerely regard the Son of God suffering, he will preserve us from Death. For this end he is presented in the Gospel as crucified before the eyes of all Persons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Things endued with Life and Sense prefigur'd the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[I] Shall particularly consider the Paschal Lamb, an illustrious Type of him. <hi>Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us.</hi> The whole scene, as it is laid down in the 12th of <hi>Exodus,</hi> shows an admirable agreement tween them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Lamb in respect of its natural innocency and meekness, that suffers without resistance, waas fit emblem of our Saviour, <hi>whose voice was not heard in the street, who did not break the Bruised Reed, nor quench
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:42565:259"/>
the smoking Flax. He was oppressed and he was afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he open'd not his Mouth. He is brought as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lamb was to be without Spot, to signify his absolute perfection. <hi>We are Redeemed with the precious Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish, and without Spot.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.17, 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lamb was to be separated from the Flock four days: the Lord Jesus was separated from Men, and consecrated to be the Sacrifice for the World, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three or four years spent in his Ministerial office, preparing himself for that great Work.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Paschal Lamb was sacrificed and substituted in the place of the first-Born. The Levitical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood not being instituted at their going forth from <hi>Egypt,</hi> every Master of a Family had a right to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it in his own House. Our Redeemer suffer'd in our stead, to propitiate Gods Justice towards us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Blood was to be sprinkled upon the Posts of the door, that Death might not enter into their Houses. That sacred Ceremony was typical: for the sign it self had no resemblance of sparing, and certainly the Angel could distinguish between the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> without the bloody mark of Gods Favour: but it had a final respect to Christ. We are secur'd from destruction <hi>by the blood of sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> They were to eat the whole Flesh of the Lamb, to signify our intire taking of Christ upon the terms of the Gospel to be our Prince and Saviour.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The effects attributed to the Paschal Lamb, <hi>viz.</hi> Redemption from Death and Bondage, clearly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Glorious Benefits we enjoy by Jesus Christ.
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:42565:260"/>
The destroying Angel past over their houses, and caus'd the <hi>Egiptians</hi> to restore them to full liberty. That which all the dreadful signs wrought by <hi>Moses</hi> could not do, was effected by the Passover; that overcame the stubbornness of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and inspir'd the <hi>Israelites</hi> with courage to undertake their journey to the promised Land. Thus we pass from Death to Life, and from bondage to the Glorious liberty of the Sons of God, by vertue of Christs Blood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Reasonable Persons represented our Saviour either in their Offices, actions, or the memorable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that befel them. <hi>Joseph</hi> the beloved of his Father, sent by him to visit his Brethren, by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily sold to strangers, and thereby rais'd to be their Lord and Saviour, was a lively type of him. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach</hi> three dayes and nights in the Whales belly, and miraculously restor'd, was a type of his lying in the Grave and Resurrection. <hi>Moses</hi> in his Prophetical, <hi>David</hi> in his Kingly Office, praefigur'd him. The Priestly Office being the Foundation of the other two, and that upon which our Salvation principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, was illustrated by two Glorious types. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> The one the high Priest in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the other the Priest of God by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry designation. I will briefly touch upon the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between him and Christ. Although Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were offer'd from the Beginning; yet he is the first to whom that Title is given, as called to that office in a special manner. The Divinity of Christs Person, the Eternity of his Office, and the Infinite Value of his Oblation were shadowed forth by him. <hi>Melchisedec</hi> is introduc'd into the Sacred story as one descending from Heaven and ascending thither, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any account of his Birth or Death. The silence
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:42565:260"/>
of the Scripture is Mysterious: for the Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted Holy Men in their Writings. The Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Priests descended by Natural Generation from their predecessours, and had successours in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was annext to the race of <hi>Levi.</hi> But <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec</hi> is represented <hi>without Father and Mother, without Beginning and End of Days,</hi> whose Priesthood was permanent in himself. For things and Persons have a double being, real in themselves, and notion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as they exist in the mind; so that no mention being made of his coming into the World or leaving it, the silence of the Scripture is equivalent to his continual duration. Now in this was an adumbration of Christ who was the Eternal Son of God, and really came from Heaven to execute his office, and ascended thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And although his oblation was finisht on the Earth, and his intercession shall cease in Heaven; yet the effects of it shall be Eternal in his People, and the Glory of it in himself. The Apostle observes an other resemblance between the Supreme Quality of <hi>Melchisedec</hi> King of <hi>Salem</hi> and Jesus Christ: He was King of Righteousness and Peace, He Govern'd his Subjects in Righteousness, and never stain'd those hands with humane Blood that were employed in the Sacred office of the Priesthood. And by those Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Titles are signified the benefits our Saviour conveys to his People. He is the true King of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: By which is not intended the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that justifies before God, in which respect he is call'd the <hi>Lord our Righteousness,</hi> and is said, to <hi>have brought in Eternal Righteousness,</hi> for that respects his Priestly office: in that quality he acquir'd it. But that Title signifies his giving most Righteous Laws for the Government of the Church, and his dispensing
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:42565:261"/>
Righteous Rewards and Punishments, Eternal Life and Death, by which he preserves the Majesty of his Laws, and secures the obedience of his Subjects. And he is <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> by which we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his temper and disposition, nor our <hi>peace with God,</hi> for reconciliation is grounded on his Sacrifice; nor peace with Conscience the effect of the other, but that which depends on his Royalty. As the King of Peace he keeps his Subjects in a calm and quiet Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; all their Thoughts and Passions are regulated by his Will. The Laws of secular Kings are only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the eyes, or proclaimed to the ears of their Subjects, but His are engraven in their hearts. By the inward and Almighty efficacy of his Spirit he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them to their Universal Duty; and will bring them to Eternal Peace in his Glorious Kingdom.</p>

And if we compare the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the Events, 'tis most clear that only the Divine Knowledg could reveal them. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise how was it possible, that the Prophets, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages before the Coming of Christ should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict those things concerning Him, that exceeded the foresight of all the Angels of Light? What Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence could there be between <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Isaiah,</hi> that lived such a distance of time from one another, to deliver such things as meet in him as their

Centre? And these Prophecies are conveyed to us by the <hi>Jews,</hi> the most obstinate Enemies of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, who although they reverence the Letter, yet abhor the accomplishment of them; So that there can be no possible suspicion that they are feigned, and of a later Date than their titles declare. Their successive fulfilling is a perpetual Miracle to justifie the truth of our Religion. Our Saviour used this Method for the instruction of his Disciples.<note place="margin">Luk. 24.44.</note> 
               <hi>These are the words which I spake unto you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>and in the Prophets,</hi>

Whose Doctrine perfectly accords with the most antient, venerable and Divine Writings?

Certainly without offering the greatest violence to our rational Faculties, none can disbelieve it. He degrades himself from the dignity of being a Man, that refuses to be a <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence we may understand the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Happiness of <hi>Christians,</hi> not only above the
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:42565:262"/>
Heathens, who by Divine Desertion were wholly <hi>Strangers to the Covenants of Mercy,</hi> but above God's peculiar People. The <hi>Messiah</hi> was the expectation and desire of Heaven and Earth. Before his coming the Saints had some glimmerings of Light, which made them inwardly languish after the blessed Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of it: But that was reserved for Believers in the last Ages of the World. That antient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise (the Morning Blush of the Gospel-Day) <hi>That the Seed of the Woman should break the head of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the Serpent bruise his heel,</hi> signified the bloody Victory the <hi>Messiah</hi> should obtain over Satan, but how little of it was understood? One may as well from the sight of the Root foretel the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a Tree, the colour, figure, and taste of its Fruits, as from that Prediction have discover'd all the parts of our Mediator's Office, and the excellent benefits resulting from it. The Incarnation, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ are in the Types and Prophecies of the <hi>Old</hi> Testament, as <hi>Corporeal</hi> beings are in the darkness of the Night; they have a real existence, but no Eye is so clear as to enlighten the obscurity.

               </gap>et the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Proselyte, who certainly was a proficient in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion, understood not of whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> spake. We see what they were ignorant of, not that our sight is stronger, but our light is more clear. The full dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of these Mysteries was reserved as an honour to our Saviours Coming. He is the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and the Light that He hath shed abroad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels that of all the Prophets in brightness, as well as his Person transcends theirs in dignity. And how should the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Light warm our hearts with thankfulness to God for this admirable Priviledg? The dim foresight of the <hi>Messiah, two thousand</hi> years before his Coming, put <hi>Abraham</hi> in an extasie of Joy, how should the full Revelation of Him affect us? Many holy Prophets and Kings desired to see the things that we see. <hi>They embraced the Promises,</hi> we have the blessed effects; They had the Shadows, we have the Light. They only saw the veiled face of <hi>Moses, We all with open face as in a glass see the Glory of the Lord</hi>? Now what is our Duty becoming this Priviledg, <hi>But to be transform'd into the same Image from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord</hi>? The Life of every <hi>Christian</hi> should be a shining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the Graces and Vertues of Christ that are so visible in the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Their Holiness and Heavenliness, their Hopes and Joy should as much exceed the Graces and Comforts of Believers under the <hi>Legal</hi> Dispensation, as their Knowledg is incomparably more clear and perfect.</p>
            <p>To conclude; From the accomplishment of the ancient Prophecies in the <hi>first</hi> Coming of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> we may confirm our Faith in those glorious Promises

that are to be fulfill'd at his <hi>second.</hi> For 'tis the same Divine Goodness, the same Fidelity, the same Power still, upon which we are to build our Hopes. And the Consideration, that the Perfection of our Happiness is reserved till that time, should enflame our desires after it.</p>
            <p>'Twas the <hi>character</hi> of Believers of the <hi>Old</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>They waited for the consolation of</hi> Israel: 'Tis the description of the Saints in the <hi>New,</hi> they love the Appearance of Christ. If they long'd for his Coming in the Flesh, though it was attended with all the circumstances of Meanness and Dishonour, the effects of our Sins; with what ardent and impatient Desires should we hasten <hi>His Coming in Glory, when He shall appear the</hi> Second <hi>time to them that look for him,</hi>

               <hi>without Sin, unto Salvation</hi>? Then He will put an end to all the disorders of the World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the glorious State, wherein Holiness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness shall be crown'd, and reign for ever.

As when the melting fire burneth, the Fire causeth the waters to boile: to make thy Name known to thine adversaries, that the Nations may tremble at thy Presence.</hi> Although the Beauty and Frame of this visible World shall be destroyed, yet that dreadful Day shall be joyful to the Saints: <hi>For then all the Preparations of Infinite Wisdom and Goodness; The things that Eye hath not seen,</hi>
