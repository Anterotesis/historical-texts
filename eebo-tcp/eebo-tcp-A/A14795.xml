         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

MEditation is the

Action the midwife
of our Meditations. A
good and perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
if it want
strength for the birth,
perisheth in the wombe

may be said to bee borne,
it must be said to be still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne:
a bad and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
conception, if it hath
the happinesse of a birth,
yet the minde is but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
of a burthen of
imperfections, in the

perfection of deformity,
which may beg with the

through its imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
If I meditate
what's good to be done,
and doe not the good I
have meditated, I loose
my labour, and make
curst my knowledge. If
I doe the thing that is
good, and intend not
that good that I doe, it
is a good action, but not
well done. Others may
injoy some benefit, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

Resolution without

Action without reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

necessary for a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
to bring him to
the end of his journey:
a knowledge of his way,
a perseverance in his
walke. If hee walke
in a wrong way, the
faster he goes the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is from home:
if he sit still in a right
way, he may know his home,
but ne're come
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2849:39"/>
to it: Discreet stayes
make speedie journeyes.
I will first then know
my way, ere I begin
my walke: the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of my way is a
good part of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Hee that faints
in the execution looseth
the glory of the action.
I will therefore not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know my way, but
also goe on in my way:
I had rather my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
should want a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
then come to
an untimely end. If
heaven bee my home,
and CHRIST my
way, I will learne to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2849:39"/>
know my way, ere I
haste to travell to my
home. Hee that runs
hastily in a way hee
knowes not, may come
speedily to an home he
loves not. If CHRIST
be my way, and heaven
my home, I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indure my painefull

perfect rest. I more
esteeme my home then
my journey; my actions
shall bee led by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
my knowledge

AS faith is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

seene are the perfecting

Beleefe may somtime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

Thus whiles faith doth

CHRIST effectually,
sense must assure me that
I taste bread really. For

not those things that I

beleeve those things that

THe men of most
credit in our time,
are the usurers. For
they credit most men:
And though their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

yet is it usually their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be fullest of <hi>care.</hi>
Time is pretious to
them: For they thinke
a day broke to them,
is worth a broke-age
from their creditor.
Yet this they finde by
use, that as they have
much profit by putting
out, so must they have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2849:76"/>
much care to get it in.
For debtors are of
<hi>Themistocles</hi> his minde,
and take not so much
care how to repay all, as
how they may not pay at
all, their creditors, and
make this their first
resolution, how they
may make no resolution
at all. I envy not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Usurers gaines,
but considering they (as
Marchant-adventurers)
send abroad their estates
in uncertaine vessels,
sometime into the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
rivers of prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and unthriftinesse,
sometimes into the seas
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2849:77"/>
of casualities, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
that many
times their principall
comes short home, I
thinke, with my selfe,
Let them gaine much
by the adventure, that
adventure so much to
gaine. I will make this
use of those uses, as to
claime no interest in
their gaines, <hi>nor to owe
any thing to any man
but love.</hi> If I lend

THE same water

the horse himselfe when
it is hard frozen. I
muse not then that those
precepts and threats of
GODS judgements
enter not into the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

men, frozen by the
practice of sinne, which
pierce and penetrate
deepe into the tender

in some to <hi>divide
the joyntes and marrow,</hi>
in others glaunceth
or reboundeth without
dint or wound, from
their cristall frozen and
adamantine hearts. I
cannot promise my selfe
to bee free from sinne,
I were then no man:
but I will purpose in

I may fall, but I

I Saw once a Ierfalcon
let fly at an Heron,
and observed with
what clamour the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
entertain'd the sight
and approach of the
Hawke, and with what
winding shifts hee strave
to get above her, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
even by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting
his enemies fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to make her flagg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winged
and so escape:
but when at last they
must needs come to a
necessitated encounter,
resuming courage out
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2849:97"/>
of necessity hee turned
face against her, and
striking the Hawke
thorough the gorge
with his bill fell downe
dead together with his
dead enemie. This
sight seemed to mee
the event of a great
sute in Law, where one
trusting to his cases po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
more then his
causes equity, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to disinherit his
stubborne neighbour by
colourable titles to his
land. Heere may you

and see the many

turnings and winding
<hi>Meanders</hi> in the Law
sought out to get above
his adversary. And
lastly when the issue
must come to tryall,
oftentimes in the grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
they both sinke to
beggery by the Law
whiles lawfully they
seeke to get above each
other. Hence warned

I will alway pray,
