            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>1 TIM. II. 5.</bibl>
               <q>For there is one God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Particle <hi>for</hi> leads us to
the consideration of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
and Occasion of these
words, which in short is
this. The design of this
<hi>Epistle</hi> is to direct <hi>Timothy,</hi> to
whom <hi>St. Paul</hi> had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Government of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
how he ought to demean himself in that great
and weighty Charge. And at the beginning of
this <hi>Chapter</hi> he gives direction concerning <hi>Publick
Prayers</hi> in the Church; that <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
be made for all men,</hi> and for all Ranks and
Orders of men; especially for <hi>Kings and all that
are in Authority, that under them</hi> Christians <hi>might
lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95347:3"/>
And this he tells us was very suitable to the
<hi>Christian</hi> Religion, by which God designed the
Salvation of Mankind; and therefore it must
needs be very acceptable to him that we should
offer up <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> to him in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of <hi>all men: For this,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle, is good
and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will
have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge
of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then it follows in the next words, <hi>For
there is one God, and one Mediator between God and
men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
for all:</hi> As if he had said, this universal
Charity of <hi>Christians,</hi> in <hi>praying for all men,</hi> must
needs be very acceptable to <hi>Him</hi> to whom we
put up our Prayers, <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> who sent
his <hi>Son</hi> for the Salvation of <hi>all men:</hi> And to <hi>Him</hi>
likewise by whom we offer up our Prayers to
God, and is among us <hi>Christians</hi> the only <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
between God and Men,</hi> in virtue of that Price and
Ransome which he paid for the Redemption of
all Mankind: I say, for this reason it must needs
be very acceptable to Him that we should pray
for all men, because he dyed for all men, and
now that He is in Heaven at the right hand of
God intercedes with him for the Salvation of
those for whom he dyed: <hi>There is One God, and
one Mediator between God and Men, the Man
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95347:3"/>
Christ Jesus, who gave himself a Ransome for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words, though they be brought in to
prove more immediately that it is <hi>acceptable to
God our Saviour,</hi> that we should put up Prayers to
Him <hi>for all men,</hi> because he desires the Salvation
of all men, and hath sent his <hi>Son</hi> to purchase the
Salvation of all men, by the Sacrifice of himself;
and in virtue of that Sacrifice to be the only
<hi>Mediator</hi> between God and us: I say, though
this be the immediate scope and design of these
words, yet they are likewise a direction to us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom we ought to address our Prayers,
namely, to <hi>God;</hi> and by whose <hi>mediation</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
we ought to put up our Prayers to God
the <hi>Father,</hi> namely, by his <hi>Son Jesus Christ,</hi> who
is constituted the only <hi>Mediator between God and
Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are several <hi>Propositions</hi> contained in this
and the following <hi>verse;</hi> but I shall at present
confine my self to the <hi>first,</hi> namely, That <hi>there
is One God,</hi> that is, <hi>but One,</hi> as <hi>St. Paul</hi> elsewhere
expresseth it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 4.</note> 
               <hi>There is none other God but One.</hi> And
<hi>Moses</hi> lays this as the Foundation of the <hi>Natural</hi>
Law,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 35.</note> as well as of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion, <hi>The Lord
he is One God, and there is none besides him,</hi> that is,
besides <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whom the People of <hi>Israel</hi> did
worship as the only true God. And this the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> perpetually declares in opposition
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95347:4"/>
to the <hi>Polytheism</hi> and variety of Gods among the
<hi>Heathen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 44. 6.</note> 
               <hi>I am the first, and I am the last, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
me there is no God.</hi> And again, <hi>Is there any
God besides me?</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 8.</note> 
               <hi>there is no God, I know not any:</hi> He,
who hath an infinite knowledge and knows all
things, knows no other God. And our <hi>B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
makes this the <hi>Fundamental Article</hi> of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the knowledge of it necessary to
every man's Salvation, <hi>This,</hi> says <hi>He, is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
to know thee the only true God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is a <hi>Notion</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the greatest and the wisest part of Mankind
did always agree, and therefore may reasonably
be presumed to be either <hi>natural,</hi> or to have
sprung from some <hi>Original Tradition</hi> delivered
down to us from the <hi>first Parents</hi> of Mankind: I
mean, that there is <hi>One Supreme Being,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi>
and <hi>Cause</hi> of all things, whom the most ancient
of the <hi>Heathen Poets</hi> commonly called <hi>the Father
of Gods and men.</hi> And thus <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks</hi>
defines God, <hi>the eternal and most excellent,</hi> or
<hi>best of all Living Beings.</hi> And this <hi>Notion,</hi> of <hi>One
Supreme Being,</hi> agrees very well with that exact
Harmony which appears in the Frame and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World, in which we see all
things conspiring to one End, and continuing in
one uniform Order and Course; which cannot
reasonably be ascribed to any other but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95347:4"/>
and uniform Cause; and which to a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
man does plainly shew that all things are
made and governed by that <hi>One</hi> powerful <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
and great and wise <hi>Mind</hi> which we call
<hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although the generality of Mankind had
a <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>One Supreme God,</hi> yet the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of
the <hi>Heathen</hi> plainly shews that this <hi>Notion,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Time, was greatly degenerated, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
into an apprehension of a <hi>Plurality</hi> of
<hi>Gods;</hi> though in Reason it is evident enough,
that there can be no more Gods than <hi>One;</hi> and
that <hi>One,</hi> who is of infinite Perfection, is as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to all purposes whatsoever, as ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Deities, if they were possible, could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be; as I shall shew in the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse.</p>
            <p>Now this multitude of <hi>Deities,</hi> which the
fond Superstition and vain Imagination of Men
had formed to themselves, were by the <hi>Wiser</hi>
sort, who being forced to comply with the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the People endeavoured to make the best
of them, supposed to be either <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>
which the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us,
thought to be the same with <hi>God;</hi> but then the
more considerable Parts of the <hi>Universe</hi> they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
out into several <hi>Deities;</hi> and as the <hi>Ocean</hi>
hath several <hi>Names,</hi> according to the several <hi>Coasts</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95347:5"/>
and <hi>Countries</hi> by which it passeth; so they gave
several <hi>Names</hi> to this <hi>One Deity</hi> according to the
several Parts of the World which several Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made the Objects of their Worship.</p>
            <p>Or else, they adored the several Perfections
and Powers of the <hi>One Supreme God</hi> under several
<hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> with regard to the various
<hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> which they thought they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from them.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Indian</hi> Philosophers, the <hi>Brachmans,</hi>
are said to have worshipped the <hi>Sun</hi> as the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Deity;</hi> and he certainly is the most <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful</hi>
of all sensible Beings, and bids fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
for a <hi>Deity;</hi> especially if he was, as they
supposed, animated by a <hi>Spirit</hi> endued with
knowledg and understanding. And if a man,
who had been bred in a dark Cave, should all
on the sudden be brought out at Noon-day to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this visible World; after he had viewed and
consider'd it awhile, he would in all probability
pitch upon the <hi>Sun</hi> as the most likely, of all the
things he had seen, to be a <hi>Deity.</hi> For if such a
man had any Notion of <hi>a God,</hi> and were to
chuse one upon sight, he would without dispute
fix upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> and fall down before Him and
worship Him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Macrobius</hi> manageth this as his main <hi>Plea</hi>
for the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Heathen;</hi> that under all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95347:5"/>
the several <hi>Names</hi> of their <hi>Gods</hi> they Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the <hi>Sun:</hi> And this diversity of <hi>Names</hi> was
but a more distinct conception and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the many Blessings and advantages
which Mankind received from Him, and a more
particular and express Adoration of the several
<hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> which were in <hi>Him.</hi> And
this was the very best defence, and all the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
sense which the <hi>Wisest</hi> among the <hi>Heathen</hi>
could make of the <hi>multitude</hi> of their <hi>Deities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet whilst they generally owned <hi>One Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Being</hi> that was the <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of
all things, they worshipped several <hi>subordinate
Deities</hi> as really distinct from one another. Some
of these they fancied to be <hi>superior</hi> to the rest and
to have their residence in <hi>Heaven;</hi> by which
<hi>Marsilius Ficinus</hi> supposes <hi>Plato</hi> to mean no more
but the <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Angels.</hi> These were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Dij Superi</hi> and <hi>Dij Caelestes, superior</hi> and
<hi>heavenly Gods:</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> terms them <hi>the Host
of Heaven,</hi> meaning the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and Stars,
which they supposed to be animated, or at least
to be inhabited by <hi>Angels,</hi> or glorious Spirits,
whom they called <hi>Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other of their <hi>Deities</hi> were accounted much
<hi>inferior</hi> to these, being supposed to be the <hi>Souls</hi>
of their deceased <hi>Heroes;</hi> who for their great
and worthy Deeds, when they lived upon Earth,

were supposed after Death to be translated into
the number of their <hi>Gods.</hi> And these were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Semidei</hi> and <hi>Deastri,</hi> that is, <hi>half Gods</hi> and
<hi>a sort of Gods:</hi> And as the other were <hi>Celestial,</hi>
so these were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a kind of <hi>Terrestrial</hi>
Spirits that were <hi>Presidents</hi> and <hi>Procurators</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

<hi>Divine Powers</hi> that were <hi>Mediators</hi> and <hi>Agents</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> and did carry the Prayers
and Supplications of Men to God, and bring
down the Commands and Blessings of God
to Men.</p>
            <p>But in the midst of all this <hi>Crowd</hi> and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Deities,</hi> and the various <hi>Superstitions</hi> about
them, the Wiser <hi>Heathen,</hi> as <hi>Thales, Pythagoras,
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Tully, Plutarch</hi> and others,
preserved a true Notion of <hi>One Supreme God,</hi>
whom they defined an <hi>infinite Spirit, pure from all
Matter and free from all imperfection:</hi> And all the
variety of their <hi>Worship</hi> was, as they pretended
in excuse of it, but a more particular owning
of the various representations of the <hi>Divine</hi>
Power and Excellencies which manifested them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the World, and of the several commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
of Blessings and Favours by <hi>them</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to <hi>Men:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Adversus Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, l. 1. c. 10.</note> Nay, <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, that even
when <hi>Idolatry</hi> had very much obscured the Glory
of the <hi>Sovereign Deity,</hi> yet the greater part of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95347:6"/>
Mankind did still in their common <hi>Forms</hi> of
<hi>Speech</hi> appropriate the Name of <hi>God</hi> in a more
especial and peculiar manner to <hi>One,</hi> saying, <hi>If
God grant, If God please,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>So that there is sufficient ground to believe
that the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>One Supreme God,</hi> Creator and Governor
of the World, was the Primitive and general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of Mankind: And that <hi>Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
were a corruption and degeneracy from the
<hi>Original Notion</hi> which Mankind had concerning
<hi>God;</hi> as the <hi>Scripture-History</hi> doth declare and
testify.</p>
            <p>And this account which I have given of the
<hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> doth by no means excuse it. For
whatever may be said by way of extenuation in
behalf of the wiser and more devout among them,
the generality were grossly guilty both of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>more Gods,</hi> and of worshipping <hi>false
Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this must needs be a very great Crime,
since the <hi>Scripture</hi> every where declares God to
be particularly <hi>jealous</hi> in this Case, and that <hi>he
will not give his glory to another, nor his praise to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Images.</hi> Nay, we may not so much as make
use of sensible Images to put us in mind of God,
lest devout Ignorance, seeing the Worship which
Wise men paid towards an <hi>Idol,</hi> should be drawn
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95347:7"/>
to terminate their Worship there, as being the
very <hi>Deity</hi> itself; which was certainly the Case
of the greatest part of the <hi>Heathen</hi> World.</p>
            <p>And surely those <hi>Christians</hi> are in no less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> who pay a Veneration to <hi>Images</hi>
by <hi>kneeling down</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> before them; and in
this they are much more inexcusable, because
they offend against a much clearer Light; and
yet when they go about to justify this Practice
are able to bring no other nor better <hi>Pleas</hi> for
themselves than the <hi>Heathen</hi> did for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
of <hi>Images,</hi> and for praying to their <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Deities,</hi> whom they looked upon as <hi>Mediators</hi>
between the <hi>Gods</hi> in Heaven and <hi>Men</hi> upon Earth.</p>
            <p>There is but one <hi>Objection,</hi> that I know of,
against the general Consent of Mankind concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Unity of God;</hi> and it is this, That there was
an ancient Doctrine of some of the most ancient
Nations, that there were <hi>two First Causes</hi> or <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of all things; the <hi>one</hi> the Cause of all <hi>Good,</hi>
and the <hi>other</hi> of all the <hi>Evil</hi> that is in the World:
The reason whereof seems to have been, that
they could not apprehend how things of so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
a nature, as <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> could proceed
from <hi>one</hi> and the same <hi>Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these <hi>two Principles</hi> in several Nations
were called by several Names. <hi>Plutarch</hi> says that
among the <hi>Greeks</hi> the <hi>Good Principle</hi> was called
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95347:7"/>
               <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Evil Principle</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or the <hi>Devil.</hi>
In conformity to which ancient <hi>Tradition</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,</hi>
a <hi>Sect</hi> which called themselves <hi>Christians,</hi>
did advance <hi>two Principles,</hi> the <hi>one</hi> infinitely <hi>Good,</hi>
which they supposed to be the <hi>Original Cause</hi> of
all the <hi>good</hi> which is in the World; the <hi>other</hi> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<hi>Evil,</hi> to which they ascribed all the <hi>evils</hi>
that are in the World.</p>
            <p>But all this is very plainly a corruption of a
much more ancient <hi>Tradition</hi> concerning that <hi>old
Serpent</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> the Head of the <hi>fallen Angels,</hi>
who by tempting our <hi>First Parents</hi> to transgress a
positive and express Law of God brought <hi>Sin</hi>
first into the World and all the <hi>Evils</hi> consequent
upon it; of which the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives us a most
express and particular account.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Being infinitely Evil,</hi>
into which this <hi>Tradition</hi> was corrupted, after <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
had prevailed in the World, besides that it is
a Contradiction, it would likewise be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to assert <hi>two</hi> opposite <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>infinite,</hi> that
is of <hi>equal</hi> force and Power, for <hi>two Infinites</hi> must of
necessity be equal to one another; because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more or greater than infinite, and
therefore if <hi>two</hi> infinite Beings were possible they
would certainly be equal, and could not be
otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95347:8"/>
Now that the Notion of a <hi>Principle infinitely
Evil</hi> is a Contradiction will be very plain, if we
consider that what is <hi>infinitely Evil</hi> must in strict
Reasoning, and by necessary consequence, be
infinitely imperfect; and therefore infinitely
weak, and for that reason, though never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
and mischievous, yet being infinitely
weak and foolish, could never be in a capacity
either to contrive mischief or to execute it.</p>
            <p>But if it should be admitted that a Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
mischievous could be infinitely knowing
and powerful, yet it could effect no Evil; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the opposite <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>infinite Goodness,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also infinitely Wife and Powerful, they
would tye up one anothers hands. So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this supposition the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Deity</hi> must sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
just nothing, because by virtue of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
opposition and equal conflict of these <hi>two
Principles</hi> they would keep one another at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<hi>Baye;</hi> and being just an equal Match to
one another, the <hi>one</hi> having as much mind and
power to do <hi>good</hi> as the <hi>other</hi> to do <hi>evil,</hi> instead of
being <hi>two Deities</hi> they would be but <hi>two Idols,</hi> able
to do neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having, I hope, now sufficiently cleared
this <hi>Objection,</hi> I shall proceed to shew how agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
this <hi>Principle,</hi> that <hi>there is but one God,</hi> is to
the common Reason of Mankind, and to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95347:8"/>
clearest and most essential Notions which we
have of God: And this will appear these <hi>two</hi>
ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> by considering the most essential <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the repugnancy and impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
the great absurdity and inconvenience of
supposing more Gods than One.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> by considering the most essential <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
of the Divine Nature. <hi>Absolute Perfection</hi>
which we ascribe to God, as the most essential
Notion which Mankind hath always had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Him, does necessarily suppose <hi>Unity;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is <hi>essential</hi> to the Notion of a Being
that is <hi>absolutely perfect,</hi> that all Perfection meets
and is united in such a Being: But to imagine
more Gods, and some Perfections to be in one
and some in another, does destroy the most <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
Notion which men have of God, namely,
that <hi>He</hi> is a <hi>Being absolutely perfect,</hi> that is, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as is possible: Now to suppose some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in one God which are not in another, is
to suppose some possible Perfection to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in God, which is a Contradiction to the most
natural and the most easie Notion which all men
have of God, that He is a Being in whom all
Perfections do meet and are united: But if we
suppose more Gods, each of which hath all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95347:9"/>
united in Him, then all but One would
be superfluous and needless; and therefore by
just and necessary consequence not only <hi>may,</hi> but
of necessity <hi>must</hi> be supposed not to be; since
<hi>necessary existence</hi> is <hi>essential</hi> to the <hi>Deity;</hi> and
therefore if <hi>but One God</hi> be necessary, there can
be no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the <hi>repugnancy</hi> and <hi>impossibility,</hi>
the great <hi>absurdity</hi> and <hi>inconvenience</hi> of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For suppose there were more <hi>Gods, two</hi> for
example; and if there may be <hi>two</hi> there may be
a <hi>Million,</hi> for we can stop no where: I say, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>two Gods;</hi> either these <hi>two</hi> would be in all
Perfections equal and alike, or unequal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
If equal and alike in all things then, as I
said before, one of them would be needless and
superfluous, and if <hi>one</hi> why not as well the <hi>other?</hi>
they being supposed to be in all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
alike; and then there would be no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
at all of the being of a God; and yet it
is granted on all hands that <hi>necessary existence</hi> is
essential to the Notion of a <hi>God:</hi> But if they be
unequal, that is, <hi>one</hi> of them inferior to and less
perfect than the <hi>other,</hi> that which is inferior and
less perfect could not be God, because he would
not have all perfection. So that which way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we turn the thing and look upon it, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of more Gods than One is by its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95347:9"/>
and self-contradiction destructive of it
self.</p>
            <p>Before I come to apply this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
the <hi>Unity of God,</hi> I must not pass by a very
considerable <hi>Difficulty,</hi> which will most certainly
arise in every mans mind; without taking parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
notice of it, and endeavouring to remove
it, if I can. And it is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>B. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
or of <hi>three</hi> real <hi>Differences</hi> or <hi>distinct Persons</hi> in
<hi>One</hi> and the same <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though this be not a <hi>Difficulty</hi> peculiar on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, as by the generality
of those who urge this <hi>Objection</hi> against <hi>Christians</hi>
hath been inconsiderately thought; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that long before <hi>Christianity</hi> appeared in the
world, there was a very ancient <hi>Tradition,</hi> both
among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen,</hi> concerning <hi>three</hi> real
<hi>Differences</hi> or <hi>Distinctions</hi> in the Divine Nature,
very nearly resembling the <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine of
the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as I shall have occasion more fully
to shew by and by: Yet it cannot be denied, but
that this <hi>Difficulty</hi> doth in a more especial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
affect the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion; the generality of
<hi>Christians,</hi> who do most firmly believe the <hi>Trinity,</hi>
believing likewise at the same time, more sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
if it be possible, <hi>that there is but One God.
To us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 6.</note> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, <hi>to us Christians, there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95347:10"/>
is but One God.</hi> But how can this possibly consist
with the common <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Trinity,</hi> God the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghost,</hi>
to each of whom they Attribute, as they verily
believe the <hi>Scripture</hi> does, the most incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
And what is this less in effect than to say,
<hi>That there are three Gods?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the clearing of this <hi>Difficulty</hi> I shall, with
all the brevity I can, offer these following <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations;</hi>
which I hope, to an impartial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
Judgment, will be sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
it, or at least to break the main force and
strength of it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. I desire it may be well considered, that
there is a wide difference between the nice <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
of the <hi>Schools,</hi> beyond what is revealed in
<hi>Scripture,</hi> concerning the Doctrine of the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and what the <hi>Scripture only</hi> teaches and asserts
concerning this <hi>Mystery.</hi> For it is not to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but that the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> who abounded in wit
and leisure, though very few among them had
either exact skill in the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> or in <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Antiquity</hi> and the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>ancient
Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church: I say, it cannot
be denied but that these <hi>Speculative</hi> and very
acute men, who wrought a great part of their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95347:10"/>
               <hi>Divinity</hi> out of their own Brains as <hi>Spiders</hi> do
<hi>Cobwebs</hi> out of their own bowels, have started a
thousand <hi>subtleties</hi> about this <hi>Mystery,</hi> such as no
<hi>Christian</hi> is bound to trouble his head withal;
much less is it necessary for him to understand
those <hi>niceties</hi> which we may reasonably presume
that they who talk of them did themselves never
thoroughly understand; and least of all is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to believe them. The modesty of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
is contented in <hi>Divine Mysteries</hi> to know
what God hath thought fit to reveal concerning
them, and hath no curiosity to be <hi>wise above that
which is written.</hi> It is enough to believe what
God says concerning these matters; and if any
man will venture to say more, every other man
surely is at his liberty to believe as he sees reason.</p>
            <p>II. I desire it may in the next place be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> even as it
is asserted in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is acknowledged by us to
be still a great <hi>Mystery,</hi> and so imperfectly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as to be in a great measure incomprehensible
by Human Reason. And therefore though some
learned and judicious Men may have very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably
attempted a more particular explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this great <hi>Mystery</hi> by the strength of
<hi>Reason,</hi> yet I dare not pretend to that, knowing
both the difficulty and danger of such an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95347:11"/>
and mine own insufficiency for it.</p>
            <p>All that I ever designed upon this Argument
was to make out the credibility of the thing
from the Authority of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> without
descending to a more particular explication of it
than the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath given us; lest by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to lay the <hi>Difficulties</hi> which are already
started about it new ones should be raised, and
such as may perhaps be much harder to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
than those which we have now to grapple
withal. And this I hope I have in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
done in one of the former <hi>Discourses.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Serm. II.</note> Nor
indeed do I see that it is any ways necessary to do
more; it being sufficient that God hath declared
what he thought fit in this matter, and that we
do firmly believe what he says concerning it to
be true, though we do not perfectly comprehend
the meaning of all that he hath said about it.</p>
            <p>For in this and the like Cases I take an <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Faith</hi> to be very commendable, that is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
whatever we are sufficiently assured God
hath revealed, though we do not fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his meaning in such a Revelation. And
thus every man who believes the <hi>H. Scriptures</hi>
to be a truly <hi>Divine</hi> Revelation does <hi>implicitely</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a great part of the <hi>Prophetical</hi> Books of
<hi>Scripture</hi> and several obscure expressions in those
Books, though he do not particularly understand
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95347:11"/>
the meaning of all the Predictions and expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
contained in them. In like manner, there
are certainly a great many very good <hi>Christians</hi>
who do not believe and comprehend the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Faith nicely enough to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a <hi>Scholastical</hi> and Magisterial <hi>Judge</hi> of
<hi>Controversies,</hi> who yet if they do heartily embrace
the <hi>Doctrines</hi> which are clearly revealed in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
and live up to the plain <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Religion, will I doubt not be very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the Great and Just, and by the <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
Infallible Judge of the World.</p>
            <p>III. Let it be further considered, That though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
neither the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> nor perhaps <hi>Person,</hi> in
the sense in which it is used by <hi>Divines</hi> when they
treat of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> be any where to be met
with in <hi>Scripture;</hi> yet it cannot be denied but
that <hi>Three</hi> are there spoken of by the Names of
<hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghost,</hi> in whose Name every
<hi>Christian</hi> is baptized, and to each of whom the
highest <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are in <hi>Scripture</hi>
attributed: And these <hi>Three</hi> are spoken of with
as much distinction from one another as we use
to speak of <hi>three</hi> several Persons.</p>
            <p>So that though the word Trinity be not found
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> yet these <hi>Three</hi> are there expresly
and frequently mentioned; and <hi>Trinity</hi> is nothing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95347:12"/>
but <hi>three</hi> of any thing. And so likewise though
the word <hi>Person</hi> be not there expresly applied
to <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghost;</hi> yet it will be
very hard to find a more convenient word
whereby to express the distinction of these
<hi>Three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For which reason I could never yet
see any just cause to quarrel at this <hi>term.</hi> For
since the <hi>H. Spirit</hi> of God in <hi>Scripture</hi> hath
thought fit in speaking of these <hi>Three</hi> to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
them from one another, as we use in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
speech to distinguish <hi>three</hi> several <hi>Persons,</hi> I
cannot see any reason why, in the explication of
this <hi>Mystery</hi> which purely depends upon <hi>Divine
Revelation,</hi> we should not speak of it in the
same manner as the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth: And though
the word <hi>Person</hi> is now become a <hi>Term of Art,</hi> I
see no cause why we should decline it, so long
as we mean by it neither more nor less than what
the <hi>Scripture</hi> says in other words.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. It deserves further to be considered, That
there hath been a very <hi>ancient Tradition</hi> concerning
<hi>three</hi> real <hi>Differences</hi> or <hi>Distinctions</hi> in the <hi>Divine
Nature;</hi> and these, as I said before, very nearly
resembling the <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence this <hi>Tradition</hi> had its original is not
easie upon good and certain grounds to say; but
certain it is that the <hi>Jews</hi> anciently had this <hi>Notion:</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95347:12"/>
And that they did distinguish the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and
<hi>the H. Spirit of God,</hi> from <hi>Him</hi> who was <hi>absolutely</hi>
called <hi>God,</hi> and whom they looked upon as the
<hi>First Principle</hi> of all things; as is plain from <hi>Philo

by the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> in his incomparable <hi>Book</hi>
of the <hi>Truth of the Christian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And among the <hi>Heathen, Plato;</hi> who probably
enough might have this <hi>Notion</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> did
make <hi>three Distinctions</hi> in the <hi>Deity</hi> by the Names
of <hi>essential Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that whatever Objections this matter may
be liable to, it is not so peculiar a <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
<hi>Christian</hi> Religion as many have imagined, though
it is revealed by it with much more clearness and
certainty: And consequently, neither the <hi>Jews</hi> nor
<hi>Plato</hi> have any reason to object it to us <hi>Christians;</hi>
especially since <hi>they</hi> pretend no other ground for
it but either their own <hi>Reason,</hi> or an <hi>ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
from their <hi>Fathers:</hi> whereas we <hi>Christians</hi> do
appeal to express <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> for what we
believe in this matter, and do believe it singly
upon that account.</p>
            <p>V. It is besides very considerable, That the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
               <hi>Scriptures</hi> do deliver this Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi>
without any manner of doubt or question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature:</hi> And not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95347:13"/>
only so, but do most stedfastly and constantly
assert that there is but <hi>One God:</hi> And in those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Texts,</hi> in which these <hi>three Differences</hi> are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is expresly
asserted; and where St. <hi>John</hi> makes mention of
the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Unity</hi> of
these <hi>Three</hi> is likewise affirmed, <hi>There are Three
that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and
the Spirit; and these Three are One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> VI. It is yet further considerable, That from
this <hi>Mystery,</hi> as delivered in <hi>Scripture,</hi> a Plurality
of Gods cannot be inferred without making the
<hi>Scripture</hi> grosly to contradict it self; which I cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
suppose the <hi>Socinians</hi> would be as loth to
admit as we our selves are. And if either <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
or <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> have so explained
this <hi>Mystery</hi> as to give any just ground, or so
much as a plausible colour for such an Inference,
let the blame fall where it is due, and let it not be
charged on the <hi>H. Scriptures;</hi> but rather, as the
<hi>Apostle</hi> says in another Case, <hi>Let God be true, and
every Man a liar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
               <hi>VIIthly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> I desire it may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That it is not repugnant to Reason to believe
some things which are incomprehensible by our
Reason; provided that we have sufficient ground
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95347:13"/>
and reason for the belief of them: Especially if
they be concerning <hi>God,</hi> who is in his Nature <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible;</hi>
and we be well assured that he hath
revealed them. And therefore it ought not to
offend us that these <hi>Differences</hi> in the <hi>Deity</hi> are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible</hi>
by our finite understandings; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> it self is so, and yet the
belief of <hi>that</hi> is the Foundation of all Religion.</p>
            <p>There are a great many things in <hi>Nature</hi> which
we cannot comprehend how they either are, or
can be: As the <hi>Continuity of Matter,</hi> that is, how
the parts of it do hang so fast together that they
are many times very hard to be parted; and yet
we are sure that it is so, because we see it every
day. So likewise how the small <hi>Seeds</hi> of things
contain the whole <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of the things
from which they proceed and into which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
they grow; and yet we plainly see this
every year.</p>
            <p>There are many things likewise in our <hi>Selves,</hi>
which no man is able in any measure to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
as to the manner how they are done and
performed: As the <hi>vital union</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body:</hi>
Who can imagine by what device or means a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
comes to be so closely united and so firmly
link'd to a <hi>material Body,</hi> that they are not to be
parted without great force and violence offer'd
to Nature? The like may be said of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95347:14"/>
of our several <hi>Faculties</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
of <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and especially of
the <hi>Liberty</hi> of our <hi>Wills:</hi> And yet we certainly
find all these <hi>Faculties</hi> in our selves, though we
cannot either comprehend or explain the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner in which the several Operations of
them are performed.</p>
            <p>And if we cannot comprehend the manner of
those Operations which we plainly perceive and
feel to be be in our <hi>Selves,</hi> much less can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to comprehend things without us; and least
of all can we pretend to comprehend the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and every
thing belonging to Him. For God himself is
certainly the greatest <hi>Mystery</hi> of all other, and
acknowledged by Mankind to be in his Nature,
and in the particular manner of his Existence,
incomprehensible by Human Understanding.
And the reason of this is very evident, because
God is infinite, and our knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is but finite; and yet no sober man ever
thought this a good reason to call the Being of
God in question.</p>
            <p>The same may be said of God's certain fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
of future Contingencies which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the uncertain Wills of free Agents:
It being utterly inconceivable how any Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
how large and perfect soever, can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95347:14"/>
know beforehand that which depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>free Will</hi> of another, which is an arbitrary
and uncertain Cause.</p>
            <p>And yet the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not only attribute
this Foreknowledg to God, but gives us also
plain Instances of Gods foretelling such things,
many Ages before they happen'd, as could not
come to pass but by the Sins of Men, in which
we are sure that God can have no hand; though
nothing can happen without his permission:
Such was that most memorable Event of the
Death of <hi>Christ</hi> who, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us,
was <hi>by wicked hands crucified and slain;</hi> and yet even
<hi>this</hi> is said to have happened <hi>according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
foreknowledg of God,</hi> and was punctually
foretold by Him some hundreds of years before.
Nay, the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not only ascribe this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and perfection to the <hi>Divine</hi> Knowledge, but
<hi>natural Reason</hi> hath been forced to acknowledg it,
as we may see in some of the wisest of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.</hi>
And yet it would puzzle the greatest
<hi>Philosopher</hi> that ever was, to give any tolerable
account how any Knowledg whatsoever can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and infallibly foresee an Event through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and contingent Causes. All the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
satisfaction that can be had in this matter is
this, that it is not at all unreasonable to suppose
that <hi>infinite Knowledg</hi> may have ways of knowing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95347:15"/>
things which our <hi>finite Understandings</hi> can by no
means comprehend how they can possibly be
known.</p>
            <p>Again, there is hardly any thing more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
than how a thing should be of it self,
and without any Cause of its Being; and yet
our Reason compels us to acknowledge this:
Because we certainly see that something is, which
must either have been of it self and without a
Cause, or else something that we do not see must
have been of it self and have made all other
things: And by this reasoning we are forced to
acknowledg a <hi>Deity,</hi> the mind of Man being
able to find no rest but in the acknowledgment
of one <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>wise Mind</hi> as the <hi>Principle</hi> and
<hi>first Cause</hi> of all other things; and this <hi>Principle</hi>
is that which Mankind do by general consent call
<hi>God.</hi> So that God hath laid a sure foundation
of our acknowledgment of his Being in the
Reason of our own Minds: And though it be
one of the hardest things in the world to conceive
how any thing can be of it self, yet necessity
drives us to acknowledge it whether we will or
no: And this being once granted, our Reason,
being tired in trying all other ways, will for its
own quiet and ease force us at last to fall in with
the general apprehension and belief of Mankind
concerning a <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95347:15"/>
To give but one <hi>Instance</hi> more; There is the
like Difficulty in conceiving <hi>how any thing can be
made</hi> out of nothing; and yet our Reason doth
oblige us to believe it: Because <hi>Matter,</hi> which
is a very <hi>imperfect Being</hi> and merely <hi>passive,</hi> must
either always have been of it self; or else, by the
infinite Power of a most <hi>perfect and active Being,</hi>
must have been made out of nothing: Which
is much more credible, than that any thing so <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi>
as <hi>Matter</hi> is should be of it self: Because
that which is of it self cannot be conceived to
have any bounds and limits of its <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi>
for by the same reason that it necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is and of it self, it must necessarily have all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which it is certain <hi>Matter</hi> hath not; and
yet <hi>necessary Existence</hi> is so great a Perfection, that
we cannot reasonably suppose any thing that
hath this Perfection to want any other.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, by these <hi>Instances,</hi> that it is not
repugnant to Reason to believe a great many
things to be, of the manner of whose Existence
we are not able to give a particular and distinct
account. And much less is it repugnant to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe those things concerning God
which we are very well assured he hath declared
concerning Himself, though these things by our
Reason should be incomprehensible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95347:16"/>
And this is truly the Case as to the matter
now under debate: We are sufficiently assured
that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and
that this <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is therein declared
to us. Now that we cannot comprehend it,
is no sufficient Reason not to believe it: For if
this were a good Reason for not believing it,
then no man ought to believe that there is a
God, because his Nature is most certainly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible.
But we are assured by many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that there is a God; and the same <hi>natural
Reason</hi> which assures us that <hi>He is,</hi> doth likewise
assure us that <hi>He is incomprehensible;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our believing Him to be so doth by no
means overthrow our belief of His Being.</p>
            <p>In like manner, we are assured by <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
of the truth of this Doctrine of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
and being once assured of <hi>that,</hi> our not
being able fully to comprehend it is not reason
enough to stagger our belief of it. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny what he sees, though the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of admitting it may be something
which he cannot comprehend. One cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Frame of this World which he sees with
his eyes, though from thence it will necessarily
follow that either <hi>that</hi> or something else must be
of it self; which yet, as I said before, is a thing
which no man can comprehend how it can be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95347:16"/>
And by the same Reason a man must not deny
what God says, to be true; though he cannot
comprehend many things which God says: As
particularly concerning this <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
It ought then to satisfy us that there is sufficient
evidence that this Doctrine is delivered in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
and that what is there declared concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it doth not imply a Contradiction. For why
should our finite understandings pretend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that which is infinite, or to know all
the real <hi>Differences</hi> that are consistent with the
Unity of an Infinite Being; or to be able fully
to explain this <hi>Mystery</hi> by any similitude or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
taken from <hi>finite Beings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I leave this Argument, I cannot
but take notice of one thing which they of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are perpetually objecting to us
upon this Occasion. And it is this, That by the
same reason that we believe the Doctrine of the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> we may and must receive that of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi>
God forbid: Because of all the
<hi>Doctrines</hi> that ever were in any Religion, this of
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is certainly the most abominably
absurd.</p>
            <p>However, this <hi>Objection</hi> plainly shews how
fondly and obstinately they are addicted to their
own Errors, how mishapen and monstrous so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
insomuch that rather than the Dictates of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95347:17"/>
their Church, how absurd soever, should be
called in question they will question the truth
even of <hi>Christianity</hi> it self; and if we will not
take in <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and admit it to be a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Article</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> they grow so
sullen and desperate that they matter not what
becomes of all the rest: And rather than not
have their Will of us in that what is <hi>controverted,</hi>
they will give up that which by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is an <hi>undoubted Article</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith</hi>
and not controverted on either Side; except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who yet are hearty Enemies
to <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and have exposed the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
of it with great advantage.</p>
            <p>But I shall endeavour to return a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Answer</hi> to this <hi>Objection;</hi> and such a one as
I hope will satisfy every considerate and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
mind, that after all this confidence and
swaggering of theirs there is by no means equal
reason either for the <hi>receiving</hi> or for the <hi>rejecting</hi> of
these <hi>two Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> There is not equal reason for the <hi>belief</hi>
of these <hi>Two Doctrines.</hi> This <hi>Objection,</hi> if it be
of any force, must suppose that there is equal
evidence and proof from <hi>Scripture</hi> for these <hi>two
Doctrines:</hi> But this we utterly deny, and with
great reason; because it is no more evident from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95347:17"/>
the words of <hi>Scripture</hi> that the <hi>Sacramental Bread</hi>
is substantially changed into <hi>Christ's natural Body</hi>
by virtue of those words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> than
it is that <hi>Christ</hi> is substantially changed into a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Vine</hi> by virtue of those words,<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I am the true
Vine;</hi> or than that the <hi>Rock</hi> in the Wilderness,
of which the <hi>Israelites</hi> drank, was substantially
changed into the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> because it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
said, <hi>That Rock was Christ;</hi> or than that
the <hi>Christian Church</hi> is substantially changed into
the <hi>natural Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> because it is in express
terms said of the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 23.</note> That <hi>it is his Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides this, several of their own most
learned <hi>Writers</hi> have freely acknowledged, that
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> can neither be directly proved,
nor necessarily concluded from <hi>Scripture:</hi> But this
the <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> did never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
of <hi>Christ;</hi> but have always appealed to the
clear and undeniable Testimonies of <hi>Scripture</hi> for
the Proof of these <hi>Doctrines.</hi> And then the
whole force of the Objection amounts to this,
that if I am bound to believe what I am sure God
says, though I cannot comprehend it; then I am
bound by the same reason to believe the greatest
Absurdity in the World, though I have no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of assurance of any <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. And if this be their meaning, though
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95347:18"/>
we understand not <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> yet we
very well understand what they would have, but
cannot grant it; because there is not equal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe <hi>two</hi> things, for <hi>one</hi> of which there
is good proof, and for the other no proof at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> neither is there equal reason for the
<hi>rejecting</hi> of these <hi>two Doctrines.</hi> This the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
supposes, which yet cannot be supposed but
upon one or both of these two grounds: Either
because these two Doctrines are equally <hi>incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible,</hi>
or because they are equally loaded with
<hi>Absurdities</hi> and <hi>Contradictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is no good ground of <hi>rejecting</hi> any
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> merely because it is <hi>incomprehensible;</hi> as
I have abundantly shew'd already. But besides
this, there is a wide difference between plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> concerning God; and
it does by no means follow that, if a man do
once admit any thing concerning God which he
cannot <hi>comprehend,</hi> he hath no reason afterwards to
believe what he himself <hi>sees.</hi> This is a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and destructive way of arguing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it strikes at the foundation of all Certainty,
and sets every man at liberty to deny the most
plain and evident <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> if he
may not be humor'd in having the absurdest
things in the World admitted for true. The next
step will be to persuade us that we may as well
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95347:18"/>
deny the Being of <hi>God</hi> because his Nature is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible</hi>
by our <hi>Reason,</hi> as deny <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
because <hi>it evidently contradicts</hi> our <hi>Senses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Nor are these <hi>two Doctrines</hi> loaded with
the like <hi>Absurdities</hi> and <hi>Contradictions:</hi> So far from
this, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and hath already been
explained, hath no Absurdity or Contradiction
either involved in it, or necessarily consequent
upon it: But the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>
is big with all imaginable Absurdity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
And their own <hi>Schoolmen</hi> have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
exposed it; especially <hi>Scotus,</hi> and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to do so, as any man that attentively
reads him may plainly discover: For in his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation</hi>
about it he treats this <hi>Doctrine</hi> with the
greatest contempt, as a new Invention of the
Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent III.</hi> To
the <hi>Decree</hi> of which <hi>Council</hi> concerning it he seems
to pay a formal submission, but really derides it
as contrary to the common <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of
Mankind, and not at all supported by <hi>Scripture;</hi>
as any one may easily discern that will carefully
consider his manner of handling it and the result
of his whole <hi>Disputation</hi> about it.</p>
            <p>And now Suppose there were some appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Absurdity and Contradiction in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Trinity</hi> as it is delivered in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
must we therefore believe a Doctrine which is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95347:19"/>
not at all revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and which hath
certainly in it all the <hi>absurdities</hi> in the World, and
all the <hi>Contradictions</hi> to <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason;</hi> and
which once admitted, doth at once destroy all
Certainty. Yes, say they, why not? since we
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are satisfied that this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
is revealed in <hi>Scripture;</hi> or, if it be not, is
defined by the Church, which is every whit as
good. But is this equal, to demand of us the
belief of a thing which hath always been contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
not only between <hi>us</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> but even
among themselves, at least till the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Trent?</hi> And this upon such unreasonable terms,
that we must either yield this <hi>Point</hi> to them or
else renounce a <hi>Doctrine</hi> agreed on both Sides to
be revealed in <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To shew the unreasonableness of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
Let us suppose a <hi>Priest</hi> of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> pressing a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> to the belief of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
and because one kindness deserves
another, the <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> should demand of him
the belief of all the <hi>Fables</hi> in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> or in the
<hi>Alchoran;</hi> since none of these, nor indeed all of
them together, are near so absurd as <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation:</hi>
Would not this be much more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and equal than what they demand of us?
Since no Absurdity, how monstrous and big so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
can be thought of, which may not enter
into an Understanding in which a Breach hath
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95347:19"/>
been already made wide enough to admit <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi>
The Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> did not half so
much deserve to be exposed by the <hi>Prophet</hi> for
their Superstition and folly, as the Priests of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do for this sensless and stupid <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of theirs with a <hi>hard Name.</hi> I shall only add
this one thing more, That if this Doctrine were
possible to be true, and clearly prov'd to be so;
yet it would be evidently useless and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For it pretends to change the substance of
one thing into the substance of another thing
that is already and before this change is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be made. But to what purpose? Not to
make the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ, for that was already in
Being; and the Substance of the <hi>Bread</hi> is lost, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it remaineth but the <hi>Accidents</hi> which are
good for nothing, and indeed are nothing when
the Substance is destroy'd and gone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All that now remains is to make some</hi> practical
Inferences <hi>from this</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Unity <hi>of the</hi>
Divine Nature. <hi>And they shall be the same
which God himself makes by</hi> Moses,<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>which</hi> Text
<hi>also is cited by our</hi> Saviour, Hear, O Israel, the
Lord thy God is one Lord;<note place="margin">Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. 29, 30, 31.</note> and thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: And
thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self. <hi>So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our</hi> Saviour <hi>the whole Duty of Man,
the</hi> love of God <hi>and</hi> of our neighbour <hi>is founded in
the</hi> Unity <hi>of the Divine</hi> Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:95347:20"/>
I. The <hi>love of God; The Lord thy God is One
Lord,</hi> therefore <hi>thou shalt love Him with all thy
heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>this is the first and great Commandment:</hi>
And it comprehends in it all the <hi>Duties</hi> of the <hi>first
Table</hi> as naturally flowing from it. As that we
should <hi>serve Him only,</hi> and pay no <hi>Religious Worship</hi>
to any but to <hi>Him.</hi> For to pay <hi>Religious Worship</hi>
to any thing is to make it <hi>a God</hi> and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it for such: And therefore <hi>God</hi> being but
<hi>One</hi> we can give <hi>Religious Worship</hi> to none but to
<hi>Him</hi> only. And among all the parts of <hi>Religious
Worship</hi> none is more peculiarly appropriated to
the <hi>Deity</hi> than <hi>solemn Invocation</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> For he
to whom men address their Requests, at all times,
and in all places, must be supposed to be always
every where present, to understand all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and wants, and to be able to supply them;
and this God only is, and can do.</p>
            <p>So likewise from the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
may be inferr'd, that we should not worship
God by any <hi>sensible Image</hi> or Representation:
Because <hi>God</hi> being a <hi>singular Being</hi> there is nothing
like <hi>Him,</hi> or that can without injuring and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his most <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>immense Being</hi>
be compared to <hi>Him:</hi> As <hi>He</hi> himself speaks in
the <hi>Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 46. 5.</note> 
               <hi>To whom will ye liken me, saith the Lord,
and make me equal?</hi> And therefore with no <hi>Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
whatsoever can it be lawful to give <hi>Religious
Worship,</hi> or any part of it, to any but <hi>God:</hi> We
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95347:20"/>
can <hi>pray</hi> to none but to <hi>Him,</hi> because <hi>He only</hi> is
every where present,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8. 39.</note> and <hi>only knows the Hearts of
all the children of men;</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> gives as the
reason why we should address our Supplications
to <hi>God</hi> only, <hi>who dwelleth in the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the Reason of these <hi>two Precepts</hi> is
founded in the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Singularity</hi> of the <hi>Divine
Nature,</hi> and unless there be more <hi>Gods</hi> than <hi>One,</hi>
we must <hi>worship Him only,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> to none but
<hi>Him:</hi> Because we can give <hi>Invocation</hi> to none but
to <hi>Him only</hi> whom we believe to be <hi>God;</hi> as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> reasons,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> 
               <hi>How shall they call on Him in
whom they have not believed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The <hi>love</hi> likewise of our <hi>Neighbour</hi> is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and may be
inferr'd from it: <hi>Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is
One Lord, therefore thou shalt love thy Neighbour as
thy self.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives this reason why
<hi>Christians</hi> should be at unity among themselves;
<hi>There is One God and Father of all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 6.</note> and therefore
we should <hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
Peace,</hi> that is, live in mutual love and peace. The
<hi>Prophet</hi> likewise assigns this reason why all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
should be upon good terms with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 10.</note>
and not be injurious one to another, <hi>Have we
not all One Father? hath not One God created us? Why do
we then deal treacherously every man against his brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore when we see such hatred and
enmity among <hi>Men,</hi> such divisions and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95347:21"/>
among <hi>Christians,</hi> we may not only ask
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s question, Is Christ divided? that we
cannot agree about serving him; either all to
serve him in one way, or to bear with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our differences: I say we may not only
ask St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s question, <hi>Is Christ divided?</hi> but may
ask further, <hi>Is God divided?</hi> Is there not <hi>One</hi> God,
and are we not all his Offspring? Are we not all
the Sons of <hi>Adam, who was the Son of God?</hi> So
that if we trace our selves to our <hi>Original,</hi> we
shall find a great nearness and equality among
men: And this equality that we are all Gods
<hi>creatures</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> and that the <hi>One only God</hi> is
the <hi>Father of us all,</hi> is a more real ground of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<hi>love,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> in our dealings one
with another, than any of those petty differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and distinctions of <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> of <hi>rich</hi>
and <hi>poor,</hi> of <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>foolish,</hi> of <hi>base</hi> and <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
can be to encourage men to any thing of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence,
injustice,</hi> and <hi>inequality of dealing</hi> one towards
another. Because <hi>that</hi> wherein we all agree, that
we are the <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Children of God</hi> and have all
<hi>One</hi> common <hi>Father,</hi> is essential and constant; but
those things wherein we differ are accidental and
mutable, and happen to one another by turns.</p>
            <p>Thus much may suffice to have spoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>first Proposition</hi> in the <hi>Text, There is one
God:</hi> To <hi>Him, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghost</hi> be all
Honour and Glory, Dominion and Power, now
and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
