            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>How muche? thou woteſt nere what thou ſaieſt. For wilt thou bee more greeued, with the dewe profe, then with thonly reporte of his falſhed, by whom thou art not a litle deceiued? when, for all the reporte, thou maieſt yet remayne, other in doubte, or cleane out of credence therof, and ſo be deceiued ſtille, where as by the dewe proffe, thou maieſt bee certaine and ſure, and no longer deceiued, excepte thou wilt thy ſelfe. And therfore with the reporte, thou canſt not bee ſo muche greued, as with the dew proffe thou oughteſt to be glad and well pleaſed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>HERE.</speaker>
               <p>No ſyr not ſo. For although I do here my frende euill reported, yet becauſe the reporte maie chaunce to be falſe, it can not greue ſo muche, as the dewe proffe therof, whiche dooeth aſſure me, that it is trewe. Wherfore the proffe muſt nedes be more greuous, then the reporte, if I take it right.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
               <p>That is in reſpect of hym, and not of thy ſelfe, that is to ſaie, for his ſake, and not for thine owne. To bee ſory for thy neighbours falſhed, in that he ſhulde chaunce to bee one of that ſorte, is very well doone, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou haue it by profe, or reporte other. But of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12765:3"/>
other ſide, as touchyng thin owne parte, to bee ſory for that thou art by a dewe profe brought to the knowlage therof, were more then extreme fooliſhneſſe: ſith by that, thou canſt take no maner of hurte, but rather the great commoditee of eſcapynge all ſuche diſpleaſure as might chaunce to enſue of the contrarie. And therfore what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynge is it, not to be gladde to knowe the falſhede of a deceiuer, But euen to be wilfully and worthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as many a one is? And therfore if thou be one of that ſorte, whiche are ſo greeued with the reporte of Frithes falſhed, that thei can not bee pleaſed with the dewe profe therof, it will be as harde for the, as it is for them, to take any profite of the beſte probacion that is therof poſſible to bee made: whiche vnto them is farre inſufficient, and nothyng worthe.</p>

Therfore how dooeth Frithe handle this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but euen as though our ſauiour Chriſte, at his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucion hereof, had ſaide, Here I leaue it amonge you, thoſe whether ye will beleue it or no? if he had ſo ſaid: what might Frithe dooe more, to the fortifiyng therof, then he dooeth? wherfore ſith it is plaine, that our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſte neuer ſaide ſo: Nor yet, as all trewe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten hertes dooe know, neuer ment ſo: what a thinge is this of Frithe, that he wolde yet make vs beleue ſo?</p>
               <p>Farther more, if it be a ſacrament, then is it an article of our feith: as bothe the one and the other, Frithe him ſelfe dooeth confeſſe and graunte. Therfore if it be an article of our feith: Then the trewth that is in it, muſt needes be of Chriſte: for what ſo euer hath not in it a trewth of Chriſt, without faile can be no article or part of his feith. Now becauſe a thing can not be beleued or not beleued, but that the trewth therof, muſte needes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12765:6"/>
therin go withall, Marke what foloweth: This arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle (he ſaieth we are not bound to beleue: And the trewth of this article, is the trewth of Chriſte. Wherfore we are not bounde to beleue the trewth of Chriſte, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue Frithe. For, to beleue, or not beleue this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, without the trewth therof, or the trewth therof, without the article, is not poſſible, becauſe they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable, and can not be beleued or not beleued, but bothe together: Beſide this, if there bee any one of the ſacramentes more excellent then other, doubtles this ſacrament of the bleſſed bodie and bloud of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt muſt nedes be the cheefe. And therfore if we be not bound to beleue this ſacrament: plaine it is, that we are not bound to beleue any: for bound to any and bounde to the chiefe: of the other ſide, not bounde to the cheife, and bounde to none. Therfore what muſte folow, but, after this doctours mynde, we maie bee bolde, without any parill, to ſhake hands with them al, and bidde them cleane farre well. As they but late went very nere it, which reteined but euen bare two of them. And that was perchance, but euen for a while nother.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, thus thou haſt now a ſufficiente profe of the firſte ſtone, that this blynde builder hath layd in his foundacion: whiche is ſo euell fauordly, and vntrew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wrought, that it can not couch or well lie of any ſide, but ſo ſotteringe and farre out of ſquare, that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to beare any good piece of worke, as euen nowe it maie, and here after ſhall muche more largely apere. For if a ſtone well wrought and euill laide, can not make but a ſhrwed peece of worke: what doeth a ſtone euill lated and wors wrought, but marre all together? Therfore how Frithe laied this
<pb facs="tcp:12765:7"/>
ſtone (beſide his wronge working therof) thou maieſt perceiue, was after this ſorte: It is a ſacrament he ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) and an article of our feith, and yet we nede not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue it: would any man thinke, that it coulde be laied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wors then ſo? yet to ſee, whether it will lie any better an other waie, let vs turne it, vpſet downe.</p>

Therfore ſay not (as thou ſaidſt) that I lay this of mine owne head, for I laie herein nothing els, but onely the ſame, that was in effecte, wrought and conceiued in Frithes head, as it is now proued by an ineuitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his owne woordꝭ before recited: wherin, whether he dooe now apere, more fooliſhe then falſe, or more falſe then fooliſhe, iudge thou, if thou canſt: for crew it is, that I can not.</p>

                  <q>The foundacion (he ſaieth) of that little treatiſe was, that it is none article of our feith neceſſary to be beleued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der peine of damnacion, that the ſacrament ſhuld be the naturall body of Chriſt: which thing is proued on this maner.</q>

               <p>Softe, ſtay there awhile: for it is mete and conueniente, that before we entre into the profe of a matter, we ſhulde firſt perpende, weigh and conſider the matter it ſelfe, and be certaine therof, leſſe otherwiſe, we ſhould goe about to proue, we can not tell what. Therfore the matter (as I take it) is this, that he ſaith, it is none article of our feithe, neceſſarie to bee beleued vnder peine of damnacion, that the ſacrament ſhulde be the naturall bodie of Chriſte.</p>

               <p>Then hath he leid two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacions.

And this nowe is, that it is none article of our feithe neceſſarie to be beleued, that the ſacrament is the naturall bodie of Chriſte. Wherfore theſe bee two foundacions.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
               <p>That is not ſo, his owne woordes doothe proue the contrarie. For, in ſatiſfiyng the requeſte of his brother in Chriſte, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng this ſacrament, his owne woordes (thou knoweſt)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12765:8"/>

               <p>
                  <q>Firſt I proued vnto hym (he ſaith) that it was none arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our feith neceſſarie to be beleued. &amp;c.</q>

               <p>Here thou ſeeſt no leſſe, but of all that buildyng, this parte he laied firſte, as he ſaith hym ſelfe. And in all buildynges, that is the foundacion, whiche is firſt laied. Therfore other he laied that, for a foundacion, or els thou muſt nedes graunt, that there he builded without any foundacion at all: as the moſte fooliſhe builder ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dooeth. And therfore although he dooeth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prely name but one foundacion, yet two (as I ſaid) he hath laied for all that, wherof ſith we haue tried the one alredie, let me nowe here what profe he maketh of this other?</p>

               <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
               <p>In very dede, with ſome of his owne woordes, I ſaie to it this. Firſt we muſt all acknowlage, that he is the moſte ſubtill, craftie, and wilie ſolititour of his maſters cauſe, that euer traueled in this matter, ſo farre
<pb facs="tcp:12765:9"/>
as I haue redde. For if the diuell hym ſelfe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and ſo ſhulde come amonge vs, to ſee what he coulde dooe againſte the faithe of this holy ſacramente, what might he inuent or imagine therin, more ſubtilly, more craftily, and with more wilyneſſe for the purpoſe, then this man of his, hath doone alredie? For he dooth not directely denie it a ſacrament, he dooth not directly denie it an article of our feith: he doothe not directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that we are bounde to the belefe of it nother: But he goeth anere waie to worke then ſo. For all theſe waies, or any of them, he knewe right well, had ben of ſuche a ſorte, to ſwade at the firſte, that men wolde haue ben therin, more redy to ſpette at hym, then willyng to here hym. Wherfore he thought to begynne an other waie, that is to ſaie, with no more, but onely the deniall of the peine of damnacion, dewe for the not beleueinge therof. And that becauſe he conſidered, how prone, reddie, and gladde all men are, to bee ridde of the perill and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of peines, ſpecially the peines of damnacion. And therfore to creepe the more eaſely into their fauour, he thought to enter with that, whiche thei had moſte luſte to here: Beyng well aſſured, that if he preuailed therin (as it ſemed to him moſte like) all the reſte of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhould eaſly folowe: as to playne it is, that it hath doone, in a great ſorte. For if I ſhuld intende to allure thee from the belefe, that Chriſte was borne of a virgin, how coulde I ſo craftily, and ſo eaſely brynge it aboute by any meanes, as by this perſwaſion, that there is no perill of damnacion therin? For let me once brynge the out of the feare of that perill, And then, who dooth not ſee, how eaſy a matter it were, to bryng the out of thee feare of all other perils, whiche are nothynge in reſpecte
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12765:9"/>
of that, ſith thou mighteſt kepe the from them, with not bewraiyng thy ſelfe? And when thou arte once therin, throghly ridde and paſte the feare of all perils, what caſe art thou in then, with thy feithe of that article, but euen cleane careles? for no man careth, but for feare of ſome diſpleaſure that might enſue. Therfore when thou art careles, whether thou beleue it or no, what nede any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perſwaſion to moue the from it? ſpecially when the propretee of the thyng is ſuche, as will neuer abide with him, that careth not for it: for he that careth not for it, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothyng by it. And he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſetteth nothyng by it, other hath loſt it, or will not longe kepe it. And therfore, when it is once come to be nothyng ſet by, To what cometh it farder, but euen to contempte and extreme hatred? wherof there can be no greatter profe, then the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experience therof, to great and openly knowen? For hath not this wilie Reinarde, by the meanes of this his diabolicall perſwaſion of no perill of damnacion in the lyke caſe, brought many a one to the ſame pointe, with this holy ſacrament whiche we nowe ſpeake of? as it maie moſte plainely apere, by the ſhamefull approbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous woordes and behauiour of his owne diſciples. whiche ſticke not, ſome in the pulpet, and moe in the ale howſe, to call it iacke in the boxe: A god of .xxiiii. a penny: A god of the bakers makyng: A great idoll, a ſacrament of the halter, in diriſion of it, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alter: with ſuch other moſte ſhamefull, both ſaiyngꝭ and examples, ſo horrible and odible, as can not but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre all good Chriſten eares to here them. Therfore in this pointe to conclude (as I began) Firſt me muſte all acknowlage (if we dooe well) that he is (as I ſaide) the moſt wilie, ſubtill, and craftie ſolititour of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

               <p>Secundarily, we muſt all acknowlage likewiſe, that he is not ſo wilie, ſubtill, and craftie one waie, but that he ſhewth hym ſelfe as fonde, and fooliſhe an other waie, as it dooth partely apere euen nowe, and muche more ſhall here after.

               <p>That the ſacrament is not the naturall bodie of Chriſte. For who knowth any thynge, and knoweth not that? although it bee commonly called the bodie of Chriſte, as right well it maie for diuers cauſes, whiche here after ſhall well apere.</p>

And for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance therof, dooſt thou not ſee againe that he goeth a bowte to proue, that the naturall bodie of Chriſte, is not in the ſacrament? As though it were all one to ſaie, that the ſacrament is not the naturall bodie of Chriſte, and to ſaie, that the naturall bodie of Chriſte, is not in the

ſacrament: Euen as I might ſaie, thy ſowle is not thy bodie, and for to make the beleue the ſame, goe aboute to proue, that thy ſowle is not in thy bodie: as though to be, and to be in, were all one, that is to ſaie, as though to be the howſe, and to be in the howſe, were without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difference. Therfore becauſe Frith, in diuers places of his booke, doubtyng of mens ſightes, dooth ſaie in the fourthe lefe (this might expounde our matter, if men had eies to ſee,) other he him ſelfe, had eies to ſee this muche as I ſaie, or els he had not: If he had not, but ſpake blyndly he wiſte nere what, how fooliſhe dooth he apere?

               <p>If thou call this good reaſon, thou haſte but a little witte.

And beſide his fooliſhe ſpeakynge in this that he ſaithe, If I ſhulde beleue that his very naturall bodie were naturally therin, as who ſaie, becauſe we doe beleue that Chriſtes very lyuely bodie, is preſently and verely in the ſacrament, we beleue it to bee therin naturally: when we dooe not beleue it to be ſo in heauen. And yet we beleue it to bee verely there in dede, for all that. But this man dooeth ſpeake, as though it were alwaie a generall rule, that where ſo euer any thynge is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, it wer there alſo naturally. As who ſaie, when an arowe is ſhotte vp in to the aire, it were there natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or a bladder blowen full of aire: and conueied by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence downe to the botome of the water, it were there naturally. Or as who ſaie, when god toke Helias from the ſocietee, and companie of mortall men, and did lifte hym vp into heauen, he paſſyng through the aire, was there aboue naturally: Beſyde (I ſaie) all this, very falſe, fooliſhe, and nothyng to the purpoſe, what is there in it els, whiche doothe proue it none article of our feith, that we are bownde to beleue?

But without faile, becauſe his heretical lie therin, is ſo great, that it will with no maner of thyng be couered, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

For he plaieth that parte him ſelfe, &amp; ſo do not we, but the contrarie. And againe, as though we wold obiect, that we are bounde ſo to beleue it, &amp; that by gods worde: but where or which of gods wordes that is, he telleth vs not. Wherfore this propre obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of his madde phantaſticall feignyng, I will paſſe ouer, leſte I ſhuld with more talke, rather hied, then diſcloſe the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes of it. And therfore beholde it well thy ſelfe, for I leue it vnto thee, euen as it is, becauſe it appereth more fooliſh of it ſelfe, then I can declare with all I can ſaie. And yet becauſe his ſolucion therof, dooth anſwere it ſo well, as though thobiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe had neuer bene ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, thou ſhalt here it, to thintent thou maieſt perceiue, what a colour he dooth caſte vpon the matter, vnder the onely pretence of an anſwere, and nothyng els.</p>

                  <q>To this we maie anſwere (he ſaith) that we beleue gods woorde, and knowlage that it is trewe: but in this we diſſent, whether it be trewe in the ſenſe that we take it in, or in the ſence, that ye take it in: and we ſaie agayne

that though ye haue (as it appereth vnto you) the euident woordes of Chriſte, And therfore conſiſte in the barke of the letter: yet are we compelled by the conferryng of the ſcriptures to gether within the letter, to ſerche out the minde of our ſauiour. which ſpake the woordes.

But we doe it to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our conſciences, whiche are compelled by other places of ſcripture, reaſons, and doctours ſo to iudge of it.

Therfore it ſhall folow, that we are not bound therto vnder peine of damnacion. The firſt part of mine argument, is proued by ſaint Auſten <hi>ad Dardanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For there is I thinke no propoſicion, whiche he dothmore often inculcat then this, that the ſame feith ſhall ſaue vs, which ſaued our fathers. The ſecond part is ſo manifeſt, that it nedeth no probacion: for how could they beleue that thing, which was neuer ſaid nor done? and without the worde they could haue no feith, vpon the treuth of theſe two partꝭ muſt the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nedꝭ folow.</q>

               <p>A, I know what thou mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt well enough. And therfore hold thy peace a while, tyll I haue tolde the,<note place="margin">Logike.</note> what I meane. For Logike (I ſay) is a certaine arte, which doeth teache a compendious waie to diſcerne the veritee of a thing, from the falſitee, and that can not bee doone, excepte both bee knowen. Therfore among all other thingꝭ, there is for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe inuented a certaine argument, which is made and formed of three partꝭ. And of the which three, the firſte and the ſeconde are called in ſchooles, two propoſicions, the more and the leſſe. And when thoſe two, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient kinde be both trew, and trewly knitte together, then the third part, which of them bothe, muſt needes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and is called the concluſion, can neuer be falſe. And againe, when any of thoſe two propoſicions be falſe, or not trewly knit together, the concluſion, which ſhuld fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, can by them, neuer be trew. This argument alſo, when the firſt part, and the ſecond is trew, wherof their neceſſarie concluſion muſt nedes bee trew alſo, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a <hi>Syllogiſmus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sillogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion.</note> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both be falſe, for the which their intended concluſion, can by them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be trew, it is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called a Sophiſticacion. So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Logike and Sophiſtrie, there is in this caſe no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but vnder one aparent maner and forme, the one holdeth the veritee, and the other the falſitee. Therfore this facultee, art, or cunning of Logike, I dare wel ſaie,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12765:16"/>
there is no iuſt louer of trewth, but wil iudge it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be had, when it is but the iuſt trial of trewth it ſelfe. And yet is it a thing, which in ſpecial, ſome teachers doe vtterly forbid, and cry out vpon. But that wold they neuer doe, if their teaching were good &amp; trew. For who be thei, that teache a doctrine, and forbiddeth their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the iudgement of ſuch, as can beſt ſkill to diſcerne what it is, but onely fals harlotes, which goe about to deceiue.</p>

the ſence wherof: were doubtfull and incertaine (for the which no treuth therupon were probable) and yet before the ambiguitee therof were put awaie, wold grounde mine argument vpon the ſame: what could cauſe me ſo to do, but onely to make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke, I proue that I proue not, And ſo make them beleue, that thei ought not. For the intent of eueri erneſt argument, is alwai to cauſe the concluſion to be graunted, whether it be trew or fals. Therfore what motiue therof canſt thou finde, in who ſo euer ſo doth, but euen a malicious intencion to deceiue other? Wherfore, whether blind ignorance, or els this wilful malice, were the cauſe why, that Frith did builde his argument vpon this flitting foundacion, I leaue it partly for this time, to thine owne iudgement.

               <p>Yes ſir, he might chaunce (as many men do) purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put foorth an argument, taken of an incerteine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to here what wold be ſaid vnto it.</p>

For although that, be ſomtime vſed in ſchooles, to the intent it might by that, be lerned, where the falſitee of ſuch argumentes doth reſt: yet queſtionles Frith had here no ſuch purpoſe. For he did not put it forth, to ſee what wold be ſaid to the contrarie, or that it ſhuld be lerned, where the deceite of it laie. But his intent was onely by the craftines therof, to draw men into his falſe and wicked opinion.

               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:12765:19"/>For who but he, wolde as who ſaie, ſo hedlyng at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture iudge ſainte Auſten (when he ſaith, the ſame feithe ſhall ſaue vs, whiche ſaued the olde fathers) to mene the ſame feith in reſpect of euery particular point diſtinctly, and not the ſame onely in reſpect of the whole together confuſely. For theſe two conſideracions dooe much differ in euery thyng. And that wonderous plainly in the law, as thou didſt euen nowe declare thy ſelfe. For in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideracion and reſpect of the whole, confuſely to gether, it is euen the ſame now, that it was an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth yeres paſt, &amp; was euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame that it is now: that is to ſay, the lawe of England now, and none other then: the lawe of Englande then, and none other nowe. whiche worde dooeth ſignifie, all the whole thinge to gether more or leſſe without any difference or reſpecte of any ſpeciall partes at all. For when thou heareſt it ſpoken, it dooeth put the no more in mynde of any one parte, then of any other. but of the vnitee of them all together, which, the name dooeth onely ſignifie. But the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracion of the ſame in partes diſtinctly, dooeth differ farre from that. For in reſpect therof, it is not euen the ſame now, that it was an hundreth yeres paſte, nor the ſame then, that it is now, by all the actes and ſtatutes, which hath bene added vnto it ſince, and yet can it not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe but that it is the ſame lawe in general ſtil, for al the new partꝭ, which it had not before. Alſo a tree, being full of new leaues, twigges, braunches, &amp; bowes, is yet the ſame tree, that it was, yeres paſt before thei ſpro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge out of it: but how the ſame? the ſame in reſpect of the whole, which is but one. And not the ſame in reſpect of the partꝭ which are many. For ſome partes be new, but ſo are not al. yet before the new partꝭ were ſprong out of
<pb facs="tcp:12765:20"/>
it, it was none other, nor yet no leſſe then the ſame tree, that it is afterwarde: &amp; afterward none other nor yet no more, then the ſame tree, that it was before. Therfore as the tree, full of new partꝭ, is euen the ſame tree, that it was before: and yet not the ſame in euery pointe. And as the lawe of this lande, is euen the ſame law now, that it was an hundreth yeres paſte, and yet not the ſame in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery point. Euen ſo is the feith of Chriſte now, the ſame that it was before his incarnacion, that is to ſaie, the feith of Chriſte then, and the feithe of Chriſte now, all one and the ſame, in reſpect of the whole (wherof it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the name, without reſpect of any nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of partes more or leſſe) but yet not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame in reſpect of euery point, without any maner of difference perticularly.

               <p>Without faile there be diuers differences, not onely to ſure to be doubted in, but alſo to manifeſte &amp; open to be inquired of. For had the olde fathers before Chriſtes incarnacion beleued in euery particular pointe of the feithe as we dooe: that is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12765:20"/>
to ſaie, beleued his bleſſed birth, paſſion, reſurrection, and aſcencion to be doone and paſte, as we dooe: and we to come as thei did: Euen ſo farre differ we eche from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it had els ben damnable, bothe of their parte, and ours to. Alſo there was conteined in their feithe diuers ſacramentes, whiche we haue not in ours. And lykewiſe in ours, whiche thei had not in theirs, and that the chiefe of eche parte. Ageyne, their feithe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng much hid, and couered with ſo many figures, darke ſhadowes, and miſticall prophecies, as in maner the whole courſe of ſcripture dooth teſtifie that it was: who therfore wolde not ſee it to be then, but obſcure, groſſe and confuſe, in reſpecte of the pure diſtincte clereneſſe, whiche ours tooke, by the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mynge of our ſauiour Chriſte hym ſelfe, and the predicacion of his goſpell? And what was that ſame obſcuritee, but as who ſaie, a coueryng of many poyntes together confuſely, whiche the new bright ſplendour of Chriſte, did open and ſhewe diſtinctly? wherby it maie well appere, that their feithe and ours, coulde not bee throughly lyke and bothe one, in euery pointe perticularly. More ouer there is no doubte, but that there were many good and faithfull folke, of the commune people of the Iewes, beſide the prophets. Neuertheles, we maie not thinke, that thei had the feith in ſuche maner as the prophettes had them ſelfes (whiche were therwith immediately inſpired of god) that is to ſaie, not ſo clerely, ſo ſpecially, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly as thei had, but much more obſcurely, groſly, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſely: By reaſon wherof it is plain, that their feith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined many thynges moe then thei were ware of them ſelfes, the which thinges were yet not ſo hid &amp; vnknowne to the prophettes that taught them. Furthermore it is
<pb facs="tcp:12765:21"/>
not to be thought, that eche of the prophets had it lyke diſtinctly nother. When ſome of them be called more, and ſome leſſe, as the cauſe wherof, doeth well apere by their woorkes, of the whiche, ſome one is farre more large then diuers of the reſte together: God ſhewed not diſtinctly &amp; apertly, all to eche of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ſome to one, and ſome to an other. Yet we may not ſaie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he, or any of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune people, which were feithfull, had for all that, any leſſe then altogether co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſely. For who ſo euer, at the leaſt waie, hath it not ſo, doubtles hath rightlie therof, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng at all: becauſe the trewthe of the whole feithe (as I ſhewed the yeſter daie) is priuely hid and conteined in euery parte of it. Finally, as the maner of hauynge the feithe, differd betwene the prophets and the common people of the Iewes then: ſo dooth it not onely betwene their tyme and ours, but alſo betwene ſome one ſorte, and an other, of vs euen nowe. For there is no doubte, but the plowman hath now the ſame feithe, whiche hath the doctour of diuinitee, and the doctour, the ſame that he hath, that is to ſaie, the feithe of Chriſte: but yet farre vnlike. For where the plowman hath it in maner but groſly and confuſely: the doctour hath it more ſpecially and diſtinctly. And therfore in the plowmans confuſe feith: doubtles there bee many mo ſpeciall articles and miſteries conteined, then he is ware of him ſelfe, whiche be not vnknowne to the doctour: Yet neuertheleſſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belefe, as well of them, as of the reſidewe, the plowman is no leſſe bownde, (for all that he is not ware of them) then is the doctour of diuinitee with his preſiſe knowlage. For the ſame feithe ſhall ſaue the one, which ſaueth the other: Although thei haue it not bothe lyke, but with great difference. Therfore when the feith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12765:21"/>
the fathers and vs, hath by reaſon of tyme, taken one difference, and that ſuche as thei could not haue bene ſaued, beleuyng in euery poynt as we doe, nor we bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng as thei did. And when it hath alſo taken an other difference in thynges, no leſſe then very ſacramentes, and that of the chiefe of bothe partes. And beſyde all that, when there is betwene their feith and ours ſuche a difference in the maner of hauyng of it, that it maie bee ſaied, thei had the ſame and not the ſame that we haue: and we the ſame and not the ſame that thei had, becauſe that, whiche thei had more groſly confuſely, and obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we haue it more particularly, diſtinctly and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. Saint Auſten (thou maieſt well knowe) when he ſaieth, (as Frith dooth allege hym) the ſame feithe ſhall ſaue vs, whiche ſaued the fathers, neuer ment (as Frith dooth falſely vnderſtande hym) the ſame feithe in euery condicion perticularly, but the ſame, in reſpecte of the whole confuſely, that is to ſaie, the feith of Chriſte ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, without any diſtincte conſideracion of partes. As a man doth ofte tymes ſpeake or thinke of money, without any conſideracion of this coine or that, or how many diuers coynes bee conteined vnder the generall name of moneie. As there hath bene ſometyme fewer, and ſometyme mo, and yet the generall name therof, no more, no leſſe, nor none other, but alwaies one and the ſame.</p>

Wherfore, of the thirde parte, whiche is the concluſion, thou nedeſt not doubte what it is: And therfore becauſe thou haſt ſufficiently herde, how
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12765:24"/>
well he hath proued the partes therof: Beholde nowe the whole together, after the ſame forme and maner as he doth put it: And ſee how it will appere in an other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle or two. ¶The ſame feithe (he ſaith) ſhall ſaue vs, whiche ſaued the olde fathers before Chriſtes incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion. But thei were not bownde vnder peine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion, to beleue, that the ſacrament of baptiſme is a ſacrament. Therfore it ſhall folowe, that we are not bownde therto, vnder the peine of damnacion. The firſt parte of myne argument is proued, by ſaint Auſten (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Frithes vnderſtandyng) <hi>Ad dardanum. &amp;c.</hi> The ſeconde parte is ſo manifeſte, that it nedeth no probaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For how coulde thei beleue that thyng, whiche was neuer ſaide nor doone: And without the woorde thei could haue no feithe. Vpon the trewth of theſe two partꝭ, muſte the concluſion needes folow: whiche is this: That we are not bounde to beleue that the ſacramente of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is a ſacrament. And euen by the ſame argument, that the bleſſed ſacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aulter, is not ſo much as a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nother, as of his own wordꝭ I proued vnto thee before: ſo that, although we are (as euery man knoweth) bownde all, vnder peine of damnacion, to receiue the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptiſm, yet we be not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to beleue it: that is to ſaie, we are not bounde to beleue the ſame thynge, whiche we are bounde to receiue, when the iuſte rule is this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loke of what neceſſitee the thing is to be had, of the ſame neceſſitee, it is to be beleued. But thou maiſt ſee, what a feith this mans argument techeth vs, ſo new and ſtrange, as I dare wel ſaie, neuer trew chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man was aqueinted withal, or the lyke. And yet let vs beholde, the patterne therof once againe in an other caſe: and ſo bliſſe vs cleane from it for euer. The ſame feith ſhall ſaue vs,
<pb facs="tcp:12765:25"/>
whiche ſaued the olde fathers before Chriſtꝭ incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But the Iewes diſperſed now in Chriſtendom (as in Roome, Venice, and in other places) haue the ſame feithe, whiche the olde fathers had before Chriſtes incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion. Therfore it ſhall folowe, that the ſame feithe ſhall ſaue vs, whiche the Iewes hath nowe. The firſte parte of myne argument, (after Frithes vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge) is proued by ſaint Auſten <hi>ad dardanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> &amp;c. The ſeconde parte is ſo manifeſte, that it nedeth no probaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for the credence of ſo many, no light perſons, but of ſobre wittes and good lernyng bothe, as hath come from Roome, Venice, and other places (where many of the Iewes be nowe abidyng) and hath made reporte here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge vs, not onely of their feith to be of the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiche was the olde fathers feith, but alſo of their excedyng diligence wherwith thei ceſſe not to kepe and obſerue the ſame, and the ceremonies therof, ſo muche as thei maie, inſtructyng, teachyng, and bringynge vp their children in ſuch maner therin, that thei be thought more prompte, readie, and perfecte in the letter of the olde teſtament, at .xvi. or .xviii. yeres of age, then the moſte parte of our ſtudentes be at thirtie. The credence (I ſaie) of thoſe ſo many graue and ſad perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng from where thoſe Iewes bee, and reportyng theſe thynges of them, with muche and many other moe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng the ſame, dooth ſhew an argument ineuitable, that thei haue nowe the ſame feithe, whiche the olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had before Chriſtes incarnation, ſpecially when in their faſte holdynge and kepynge therof, dooth conſiſte all their great hope, and whole truſte of pleaſynge god to their ſaluacion. Wherfore vpon the trewthe of theſe two partes, muſte the concluſion nedes folowe. whiche
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12765:25"/>
is euen this, that the ſame feith, which the Iewes hath now, ſhall ſaue vs: that is to ſay, without batiſme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the beliefe that our ſauiour Chriſt is come, or hath ſuffered death, or hath riſen againe, or hath aſcended to heauen, of the which, they beleue not ſo much as any one. Iudge now thy ſelfe, whether this bee of trew Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike, or of deceiueable Sophiſtrie: yea rather of very trew feith, or abhominable hereſie: Is it not a proper argument, which can ſo trie our dewtie in euery article, from one to an other, that without parill of damnation we maie leue our beliefe of them altogether? For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without any doubt, loke how much it maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinſt this article, which he wold ouerthrow, if he might: Euen ſo much it maketh not onely ageinſt many moe directly, but alſo againſt them altogether conſequently. If it make nothing againſt all (as I ſaide before) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faile no more doth it againſt this one: For any thing againſt this one, and ſo much againſt all: Nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all, and as litle againſt this.</p>

That is to ſaie, certeinly, the mediator made manifeſt, wolde the ſacrament of our regeneracion to be manifeſt For there was ſomething hidde from the old iuſt men: when for all that, they were ſaued by the ſame feith which was to bee reueled, when the tyme therof came. Now marke how Frithes allegacion agreeth with this.

               <p>I ſhall tell the. Frith toke this place of S. Auſten, as though it had bene
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12765:27"/>
like vnto a ſnaake: whoſe venim (men ſaie) is but in the head and the tayle: whiche beyng cutte away, the reſte of the bodie maie well be eaten, as it is ſaid, to be vſed in ſome countreis. And therfore according to the ſame, Frith perceiuing the head and taile of this place of ſaint Auſten to be ſuche, as were enough and able to kyll and deſtroy the whole pith of his purpoſe altogether, did in his allegacion cutte them both cleane away: and yet he ſuſpectinge that they wold, at the leaſt, bee miſſed and aſked for, if he ſhuld haue brought forth all the reſt of his bodie, as it is, did alſo therfore cutte out therof, but this preatie peece (the ſame feyth) ſo litle, as wherby it ſhulde not bee knowen, of what kinde of bodie it was: And ſo, neither the head, nor the taile be looked for, nor miſſed nother. For if he had brought forth the whole reſt of the bodie together, that is to ſay, the middle part as it is, and ſaid thus as ſaint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten doth (they were ſaued by the ſame feith) we muſte nedes haue required the head of that bodie, and aſked of him, which they? For thou maiſt well perceiue, that ſaint Auſten wold not haue ſaid, they, (which hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to ſome other worde) except he had put ſomewhat before, vnto the which he dooth referre it. And that was nothinge els, but (as it apereth in his owne plaine wordes) the old iuſt men, from whom (he ſaith) there was ſome thinge hidde. Ageyne likewiſe, we muſt haue required alſo the ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e of that bodie to, and haue aſked of him, whiche ſame feith is that? for this worde, the ſame, muſte nedes bee referred to ſomewhat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after, or els it can haue no ſence: And there is nothing before, that it can be referred vnto. wherfore it is declared by that, which commeth after, and that is the
<pb facs="tcp:12765:28"/>
ſame feith, which (as ſaint Auſten ſaith) was to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when the time therof came. Now for al that this is the principal place of ſaint Auſten, wherin Frith hath his great and moſt ſingular truſt, for the ſpecial defence and chefe profe of his foundacion, yet if there be any ſparke of good will and wit in the at all, thou maieſt clerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and ſee, not only how nothing it maketh for him, but alſo how cleane it maketh directly ageinſt him, and ouerthrowth his purpoſe quite: ye and farder, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincibly it doth declare and proue that to be trew, which I haue ſaid vnto the all reddy concerninge the ſame. For doubtleſſe this is the place (as he ſaith him ſelfe) wherof he doth (after his facion) gather and ſaie, <q>The ſame feith ſhall ſaue vs, which ſaued the old fathers before Chriſtes incarnacion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Where as ſaint Auſten ſaith, (if thou marke him well) that they were ſaued, by the ſame feith, wherin was ſome thing hidde from them. And againe, by the ſame feith, which was to bee reueled, when the time therof came: whiche was not in their daies: but (as he ſaieth) when the mediator was made manifeſte, and wolde the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of our regeneracion to be manifeſt: And that was not before Chriſtes incarnacion. Wherfore thou maieſt now euen here perceiue, by the plaine wordes of ſaint Auſten him ſelfe, directly againſt Frithes purpoſe how the old fathers feith and ours, dooth both differ, and not differ, not differ in reſpect of the whole, conſidered in generall: And yet much differre, in reſpect of the partꝭ conſidered in ſpeciall. For by the plaine wordes of ſaint Auſten, there was ſome thinge hidde from them, that is not hidde from vs: And ſome thing reueled to vs, that was not reueled to them. And yet one and the ſame feith
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12765:28"/>
in reſpect of the whole confuſely together: and not one, nor the ſame nother, in reſpect of the partes conſidered a ſonder. Wherfore, of that which was hidde from them, and now reueled vnto vs, why may not this holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the beliefe therof be a part, as well as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptiſme is: if there be no reaſon nor trewth to the contrary, as there is not in dede, where is Frithes foundacion become? Therfore ſhall I nede now to aſke the any more, why Frith doth not here allege ſaint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens owne wordꝭ, firſt in latine, and then in Engliſh, as he doth in other places, but leaueth them both cleane out as he doth? I thinke thou ſeeſt the cauſe why well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough now thy ſelfe: If not, how ſaieſt thou to ſuch a felow as bringeth in a witneſſe, and when the witneſſe ſhuld ſpeake, he will not ſuffre him to tell his tale?</p>

But that he wold in no wiſe dooe, becauſe he knew the name of his witneſſe, might in his cauſe ſeme to dooe ſomewhat, where as his very tale withall, could in dede dooe nothing, but mar altogether. And therfore to brag out the matter, forth he commeth with his bare witneſſe whom he kepeth cleane in ſilence, as vntruſtie to talke in his cauſe, while he telleth of his owne head, all the whole tale, and maketh vp the euidence him ſelfe.

<q>The firſte parte of mine argumente is proued by ſainte Auſten <hi>ad Dardanum.</hi> And I dare boldly ſaie almoſte in an hundreth places.

               <p>Sir that ſhall ye dooe. For conſequently in the ſame. v. leafe of his boke, theſe be his wordes.
<q>Of thoſe places (he ſaieth) you may plainly perceiue, not onely that it is none article neceſſarie to be beleued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der peine of damnacion, ſeyng the olde fathers neuer beleued it, and yet did eate Chriſt in feith, both before thei had the <hi>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na,</hi> and more expreſly through the <hi>manna</hi>: And with no leſſe fruite after the <hi>manna</hi> was ceaſed. And albe it the <hi>manna</hi> was to them as the ſacrament is to vs, and they eate euen the ſame ſpirituall meate that we dooe yet were they neuer ſo madde, as to beleue, that the <hi>manna</hi> was chaunged into Chriſtes owne natural bodie: but vnderſtode it ſpiritually, that as the outward man did eate the material <hi>manna,</hi> which comforted the bodie: ſo did the inwarde man through feith eate the bodie of Chriſt, beleuynge that as <hi>manna</hi> came downe from heauen and comforted their bodies: ſo ſhulde their ſauiour Chriſt, which was promiſed them of god the father, come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ſtrength their ſoules in euerlaſting life, rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge them from their ſynne by his death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And likewiſe dooe we eate Chriſte in feith, both before we come to the ſacrament, and more expreſly through the ſacrament. And with no leſſe fruite after we haue receiued the ſacramente, and neede no more to make it his naturall body, then the <hi>manna</hi> was, but might muche better vnderſtande it ſpiritually: that as the outwarde man dooeth eate the natural breade, whiche comforteth the bodie: ſo dooeth the inwarde man through feith eate the bodie of Chriſt, bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that as the bread is broken, ſo was Chriſtes bodie broken on the croſſe for our ſynnes, whiche comforteth our ſoules vnto life euerlaſtinge. And as that feith did ſaue them, without beleueing that <hi>manna</hi> was altered into his body: euen ſo dooeth this feith ſaue vs: although we beleue not, that the ſubſtance of breadde is turned into his naturall bodie. For the

I require no anſwere of this, but conſider it well with thy ſelfe. And therfore what is there more in all his woordes, whiche thou haſt here reherſed, but onely his owne ſwaſions: and fooliſh continuall daunſing about this ſame woorde the ſame? wherwith thou ſeeſt he wolde conclude &amp; confirme what ſo euer he babled before.

               <p>Then ſaie I, that if thou marke it well in his firſte and ſeconde caſe ioigned together, he dooeth put, whether he dooe heare them, or not here them. And in the ſeconde, and thirde caſe, whether he vnderſtande them or not vnderſtande them: So that he dooth not put theſe caſes, but onely to thintente that in euery caſe, he might auoide and cleane exclude, the nede of all the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of ſcripture, ſaue onely twelue. For when he ſaieth he maie be ſaued without them, whether he here them or here them not: and whether he vnderſtande them, or vnderſtande them not. And therfore after his owne doctrine, whether he beleue them, or beleue them not? What nede maketh he of any of them all, but meneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie with them clene in euery condicion. For if he maie be ſaued without them (as he ſaith he maie) then it is clere, that he hath no nede of them. If he haue no nede of them: doubtles he hath no nede to beleue them. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he haue no nede to beleue them: in very dede, he hath leſſe nede to vnderſtande them (for more neceſſarie is belefe, then is vnderſtandynge in thynges of our feith) and therfore if he nede not beleue them, nor vnderſtande them, plaine it is, that he nedeth not ſo much as here the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for what ſhuld he here, that he nedeth not beleue) Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he nede not ſo muche as here them, he hath vtterly no nede of them at all: if he haue no nede of them at all: then be thei (as he wolde make them in dede) no partes of the feithe at all: excepte he will ſaie (as he dooth ſo muche as it cometh to) that all the moſt parte of the feith nede not to be herde: And conſequently, nor beleued no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Thus are we clerely diſcharged of all the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of ſcripture, ſaue onely twelue in euery condicion wherof he might be aſked this prety queſtion, why thei were writen? But how ſo euer this diueliſhe doctrine behaueth it ſelfe: what other thing is the feithe of Chriſt, but all the veritees of ſcripture? And contrary wiſe, what other thyng are all the veritees of ſcripture, but the feith of Chriſte? Therfore when all the veritees of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are conteined in the feith of Chriſte (as it is one of them ſo to beleue) And the feith of Chriſte (as I ſhewed thee yeſterdaie) can not bee trewly had, but all whole to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether: It muſte nedes folowe, that who ſo euer hath trewly the feith of Chriſte, hath alſo therin no leſſe then all the veritees of ſcripture. Fals therfore is the doctrine of Frith, that ſaieth, we maie be ſaued without them all, ſaue only twelue: when the feith cannot be trewly had, without them all. More ouer, how ſaieſt thou to this: is it not a neceſſarie veritee vnto ſaluacion, to beleue that the commaundementes of god are good, and ought to be kepte?</p>

               <p>Vtterly that Frith is a fals lier: when he ſaith, thoſe articles of our Crede, are onely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie vnto ſaluacion. For which is it of thoſe .xii. to beleue, that the commaundementes of god be good, and ought to be obſerued and kepte, or that there is any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill in it: if we do not ſo beleue? Thoſe .xii. onely be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, ſaith he. This veritee thou ſeeſt is none of them (although as all other, it maie bee reduced vnto them)
<pb facs="tcp:12765:37"/>
whiche he will none of in any caſe, leſt that, whiche he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to ouerthrowe, ſhoulde ſo by that meanes, bee brought in likewiſe: after his minde therfore without this, we maie be ſaued. That is to wit, without the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe, that the commaundementꝭ of god be good, or ought to be obſerued &amp; kepte: who will not ſee, that this were enough, to declare what a teacher he is? or who hath ſo dull a wit, that he can not perceiue how diueliſh his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is? and it were but only by this, that he can finde no waie to come to it, but only by ſuch damnable pathes as this is? Beholde how faine he wold proue it no nede, ſo to beleue in the bleſſed ſacrament of the alter, as all trew Chriſten people beleueth: In very dede ſo faine, that, to bryng it to paſſe with al, he ſticketh not here (as thou ſeeſt thy ſelfe) to leue vs clene without the nede of any, and of all the veritees of holy ſcripture, mo then bare .xii. for in thoſe .xii. veritees of our Crede, he thought ſurely, that this veritee of the bleſſed ſacrament could not be founde. And therfore he dooth ſaie: that thei onely are neceſſarie vnto ſaluacion, to thintent he might vtterly therby exclude the nede of this, whiche he wolde ſo cleane put awaie, that euen for that cauſe, he excludeth no leſſe, then all the reſte, ſaiynge:
<q>The other pointes conteined in ſcripture, although thei be vndoubted veritees: yet maie I bee ſaued without them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And this he declareth in euery condicion, that is to ſaie, whether he beleue them or not: whether he vnderſtande them or not, and whether he miſconſtrew them or not: All theſe I ſaie (ſaith he) maie be doone without any ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdie of damnacion.</p>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:12765:38"/>I thought euen as much, when he intendeth none of them both. For his purpoſe is not to make vs beleue them, but onely to make vs to beleue no moe.

Therfore his intent is (as who ſaie) there to ſtoppe in our feith, that it ſhulde goe no farther, and not to bringe it thether, nor there to vpholde it. For although his blindneſſe be ſo great and manifeſt, that euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame, which he laboureth to improue and ouerthrow, he confeſſeth to be a veritee of ſcripture (or els wolde he neuer cal it an article of our feith, as in the .xvi. lefe of his booke he dooth in deede) ſaiyng theſe wordes.</p>

               <p>Although his blindneſſe (I ſay) be ſo great, that he him ſelfe dooeth confeſſe this a veritee of ſcripture, which he laboreth ſo ſore to improue: yet becauſe he thought it coulde not be found among the .xii. veritees of our Crede euen therfore wolde the catchpoule, as it were in a pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde, pyn vp therin our feith, from all the veritees of ſcripture beſide: and all to thintent it ſhulde not come at this veritee of the holy ſacrament, and that for the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall hatred he beareth vnto it.

               <p>Nedeth it not, to bliſſe vs from that probable reaſon, which might leade vs to diſſent from ani veritee of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? For what is the ſcripture but godꝭ worde? therfore what is any verite of ſcripture, but the verite of godes word? And what probable reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is that, which ledeth one to diſſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any veritee of godꝭ word, but only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſitee of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuels worde? Yet herein, ſaith Frith, there is no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril. This thou ſeeſt, he moueth vs vnto. For with a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (he ſaith) we may without any peril, diſſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the veritees of ſcripture, ſaue .xii. and I ſaie, by that rule, from them to. Therfore, while Frith doth here in plaine wordes, ſhew vs a way, to diſſent from the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of holy ſcripture, whiche is the worde of god, what other thing therin doth he els, but vtterly ſhew vs the waie of the diuell? How be it herein, he teacheth vs but a poynt of his owne facultee. For by this probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, founde he the meanes, to diſſent and come awaie from the veritees of holy ſcripture him ſelfe. For els, without fayle, he had bid in them ſtill. By this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon alſo, riſeth the firſt heretike of euery ſecte. And by this probable reaſon, deceiueth he an other. By this probable reaſon gender they mo and mo. By this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon grow they, ſometyme to a multitude. And by this probable reaſon they continew, to the diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the faithfull flocke of Chriſt. Alſo by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon which is but apparent, which ſemeth iuſte, and is not, which promiſeth trewth, and paieth not,
<pb facs="tcp:12765:41"/>
which beareth in hand to dooe, that it can not. By this probable reaſon (I ſay) heretikes are enticed, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and led, from the veritees of ſcripture, from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritees of godꝭ woorde, and from the veritees of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life. And by this probable reaſon, they are prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſet a woorke, to crie to the people, and ſay beware of deceiuers, beware of falſe teachers, beware of ſubtill Sophiſters. And what other thing therin do they els, but ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly and euen directly againſt their owne purpoſe, moue the audience to be ware of them, &amp; of no men els? For ſuch and the ſame are thei, &amp; in dede none other. Therfore let vs now returne to his third caſe againe, brefly to ſee what we left therin behind (he ſaith) <q>Or be it in caſe, that I here them, and vnderſtand them and yet by the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an other text miſconſtrew them</q> Here he driueth me to ſuch a ſtreit, that I can not tel whether I maie more wonder at him, or at his caſe. For tell me, if euer thou herdſt of any ſuch braine. How is it poſſible for any man to miſconſtrew the ſame, which he doth vnderſtand? Is it one thing to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and an other to know? Is any man therfore able to take a thing otherwiſe, then he knoweth it is? Doth not the knowlage or vnderſtanding of a thinge, cleane put away the miſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruing therof? For whereof, commeth miſconſtruing, but of miſunderſtanding? neuertheleſſe, <q>Be it in caſe (he ſaith) that I vnderſtande them, and yet by the reaſon of an other text miſconſtrew them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here thou ſeeſt plaine, that he putteth vnderſtanding, and miſconſtruing, both together in one reſpect, and one caſe, and that by the reaſon (he ſaieth) of an other text. Therfore whether he meaneth the veritee of that other text, to be vnderſtanded, or not vnderſtanded, let vs trie what foloweth of each of them, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12765:41"/>
ſure, to come to his meaning, at the leaſt in one of them. Therfore if he meane it vnderſtanded, then this muſt fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that the vnderſtanding of the veritee of that ſame one other text, maie put away the vnderſtanding of all the veritees of ſcripture .xii. except: when it may, bring the vnderſtander to the miſconſtruction of them, as by his words it may, when of them al (he ſaith)</p>
               <p>Or be it in caſe that I here them, and vnderſtand them,' and yet by the reaſon of an other text miſconſtrew them.' So that the trew vnderſtanding of that ſame other text, is but a meane, to make the veritees of all the reſt to be miſconſtrued, and that of him that vnderſtandeth them. And what is that to ſay but this, that the trewe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of one text, maie bringe a man from the trewe vnderſtanding of of an other, when it bringeth him to the miſconſtrewyng therof? And therfore doeſt thou not ſee, what good reaſon and trewth, he teacheth in this caſe? haſt thou heard of this ſame leſſon before that the trew vnderſtanding of one text, ſhuld plucke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the trew vnderſtanding of an other, from him that hath it? I haue herde that the trew vnderſtanding of one text, might induce and bring to light, the trew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of an other: But I neuer herd a fore now, that the trew vnderſtanding of one, might miſconſtrew, &amp; ſo put away, the trew vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of an other, when trewth (as I tolde the before) is a meane to come by trewth, &amp; not a meane to miſconſtrew &amp; put awai trewth. for ſo, were trewth againſt trewth, and vnderſtanding againſt vnderſtanding: And therfore Frith doth here to ſaue al vpright, make miſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruction, which is the great enemy of them both, to be as a ſtickeler betwene them: wherfore of the other ſide, if he meane y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the verite of this
<pb facs="tcp:12765:42"/>
other text which may make this miſconſtruction, is not vnderſtanded, then muſt this folow, that the ignorance, and not vnderſtanding of the trewth of one text, may put away the knowlage and vnderſtanding of the trewth of an other text, as it muſt nedes dooe, if it maie make it miſconſtrued, as Frith dooeth hold it maie. And ſo ſhall blinde ignorance be more mighty and able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and put away clere and perfite knowlage, from him that hath it, then perſite knowlage is able to expell and put away it: as though the ignorance of one thing, were the driuer away of the knowlage of an other, whiche is an ouerthwart rule, contrary to all reaſon and trewth. For it is the naturall propertee and ſtrengthe of knowlage, where ſo euer it commeth, to ſubdew and expell ignorance, and not of ignorance, to ouerthrow and expell knowlage. How be it I will not ſay. but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance maie and commonly doth in many caſes, kepe trewth from knowlage and vnderſtandinge: but yet when and wherin ſo euer knowlage and vnderſtanding doth once get the victorie, and obteineth it in dede, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance then goeth ſtreight to wrake, and is vtterly put to flight, for any thing therin it can dooe more. Wher. fore, the trewth of one text, vnderſtanded or not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded, can neuer driue the trewth of an other, out of vnderſtanding, as it might doe, if it might driue it to miſconſtruction, as it can not, becauſe there ſhulde be then (as I ſaid) trewth againſt trewth, and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, which can not be. Therfore whether the trewth of this other text, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Frith ſpeaketh of, be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, yet falſe is this his ſaiyng therof, that it may cauſe the trew vnderſtanding of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther text or veritee of ſcripture, to be miſconſtrued of him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12765:42"/>
that hath it, and ſo put awaie: when it is not poſſible for the trew vnderſtandynge of a thynge, and the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruynge of the ſame, to ſtande to gether, excepte Frith wyll ſaie, that he can ioigne them together this waie, as when he vnderſtandeth a veritee neuer ſo wel, yet he can purpoſely miſconſtrewe the ſame neuertheleſſe, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilde and deceiue his neghbour withall, and beare him in hande, it is otherwiſe ment, then he hym ſelfe, dooeth knowe it is.</p>

And thoſe two partꝭ doth he ſo glew together with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie, to the intent they ſhuld ſo go and be taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inſeperably, that he wold not ſay, I leue them as thinges indifferent, but ſaith, I leaue it as a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, putting them both together in the ſingular numore as one. And ſo referreth, it to gods inſtilling in euery mans minde, not the one, or the other diſiunctiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but euen ioyntly both together, according to his owne ſaiyng indifferently: Wherfore why may I not ſay, (as I ſaid) that he doth referre vnto God thinſtillinge as well of falſhed as of trewth in euery mans minde, when therin he doth ſo knit and wrappe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them both together with his indifferencie, and that in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular numbre, that we can not by his owne wordes, deuide or plucke them aſonder?</p>

And as for his naturall reaſons that thou ſpeakeſt of, I am well able to proue, that they bee in the name of them, nothynge els, but a ſorte of deceueable ſophiſticacions: wherin he plaieth as one did (ſynce I maie remember) beynge aboute to ſteale ware out of a ſhoppe in London, and perceiuyng that he was ſpied and lyke to bee taken, he to goe, and diuers after hym, criynge ſtoppe the thefe ſtoppe the thefe, and he herynge that, cried euen ſo lykewiſe hym ſelfe, as faſte as they did, by reaſon wherof, ſuche as met hym in the waie, nothynge ſuſpectynge hym, looked ſo muche after an other, whiche as thei thought ſhoulde bee before hym, that he by that meanes gat to ſaint Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyns, and deceiued them all.

               <p>Yes mary ſir, and that is this: I wolde faine knowe by what reaſon you can proue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ſame article, which we haue bene aboute all this while, is one of them, that we are bownde of neceſſitee to beleue vnder peine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion: Ye haue hitherto inueied againſte Frith, for holdyng the contrarie, but yet haue ye doone nothynge to the probacion therof your ſelfe: for it is two thynges to proue Frithes opinion falſe, and to proue yours trewe:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
               <p>Well, although the probacion of the trewthe, can not haue a veray apte and conuenient place, before the falſitee bee cleane reſelled and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put awaie, and that in the whole, as it is not nowe, but
<pb facs="tcp:12765:54"/>
in parte, yet all voide of thy requeſt, I wyll not leue thee, becauſe I perceiue thee, ſomewhat deſyrous to here of the matter: And therfore while Frithes opinion is this, that it is an article of no neceſſitee to bee beleued, and our feithe is plaine to the contrarie, the one parte, or the other, muſte nedes be trewe: wherfore becauſe the one parte, or the other muſte nedes be trewe, and betwene trewthe and falſhed there can be no meane, it can not be auoided, but ſith the falſhed is founde of his ſyde: The trewthe muſte nedes remaine with vs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>HERE.</speaker>
               <p>Nay ſir that foloweth not: for the falſhed that ye fynde with Frithe, is in his probacion and not in the thynge, which he goeth aboute to proue. For ye knowe right well, that a man maie miſſe in the probacion of a trew thynge ſometyme, and yet is not the thynge falſe, becauſe the probacion is not trewe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
               <p>So maieſt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe euery falſhed, whiche any falſe harlot goeth aboute to proue trewe: for ſoone maieſt thou ſaie, that although he faile in his probacion, yet is the thynge that he wolde proue, trewe enough for all that, becauſe a man maie be deceiued in the probacion of a trew thynge. When in dede the faulſitee of a thynge, is ofte times more then halfe diſcloſed, by the falſitee of the probacion. And therfore although the manifeſte falſhed of Frithes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacions, dooe not euen very apertly proue the falſhed of his opinion. Yet dooth it make at the leaſt, an ineuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble coniecture therof. And therfore euen as much for the trewth of our ſide: for what ſhall or maie we gather of this, that all the reaſons whiche he hath brought for his purpoſe, doth not only not proue his intent, but alſo draw after them ſuche odible conſequences, as euery good chriſten eare muſt nedes abhorre to here? what ſhall we
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12765:54"/>
gather (I ſay) of this, but that the mighty and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trewth of the contrary part, will in no caſe ſuffre it ſelfe to be ouerthrowne. Furthermore, what wilt thou ſay, if Frith doe ſufficiently proue our parte him ſelfe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>HERE.</speaker>
               <p>That can not be, for all his whole purpoſe is vtterly to the contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CATH.</speaker>
               <p>I graunt the ſame, and yet marke him well. For he intendinge in dede to proue the contrary, maketh neuer a reaſon, but that (as I haue declared vnto the) it renneth vtterly euen as much againſt the neceſſitee of other neceſſary articles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as it doth againſt this, for which he did purpoſe it: and that were not poſſible, but becauſe the like or the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame neceſſitee of beliefe, is as wel in this, as in them, and all one: for how ſhuld his reaſons purpoſed only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the neceſſary beliefe of this article, touch the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, beliefe of any other likewiſe, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they touch the light of the ſonne, the heat of the fire and other like, being no more purpoſed againſt thoſe other neceſſary articles, then againſt theſe thinges, but vtterly becauſe thoſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and this, be all of one ſort, and of like neceſſitee to be beleued, and eache of theſe thinges, that is to ſay, the light of the ſonne, and the heat of the fire, cleane of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort? For what reaſon ſo euer be brought againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, ſo farre it doth alway renne as the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the thing, againſt which it is brought, doth extende, and no farther: As be it in caſe, that one were ſo madde, as to deny the immortalitee of thy ſoule, and wolde goe aboute to diſproue the ſame. Yet what ſo euer reaſons he ſhuld make againſt it, without faile muſt nedes renne likewiſe, euen as well againſt the immortalitee of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſoules beſide, as againſt thine, and that could not be, but becauſe that ſame immortalitee is commune
<pb facs="tcp:12765:55"/>
and doth apperteine as well vnto thy ſoule as to theirs. Wherfore after the like maner, the cauſe why, that Frithes reaſons doth renne, as well againſt the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitee of other neceſſary articles, as it doth againſt the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitee of this (for which they were purpoſed) is vtterly becauſe, the very ſame neceſſitee of beliefe, is commune and doth aperteine as well vnto this, as to them and all one: for els it were not poſſible for thoſe reaſons purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but onely againſt this, to make any thing more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the neceſſitee of thoſe other, then againſt (as I ſaid) the light of the ſonne, or any thing els beſide. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt nedes folow, that this article, is of as great neceſſitee to be beleued, as any of the other is. wherfore becauſe Frith wolde haue proued it indifferent and could not, he hath therfore now proued it neceſſary and wolde not. Wherwith content thy ſelfe, thou getteſt no more of me at this tyme.</p>

               <p>It is no meruaile at all: for doubtles if Frith had no more trewth, vertue, wit, and learning in thine opinion, then he had in his owne head, thou ſhuldeſt ſone haue perceiued in his booke, a great deale more, then I haue ſhewed the.
