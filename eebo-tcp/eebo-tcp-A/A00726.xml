            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Iude. verse. 3.</bibl>
               <q> ¶ Beloued, when I gaue all diligence, to write vnto you of the common saluation, it was necessarie for me to write vnto you, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you, that you should earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the maintenance of the Faith, vvhich was once deliuered vnto the Saints.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE blessed Apostle Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> finding that many in his time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan well, and ended ill, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seduced by wicked miscreants made shipwracke of the fayth, forsooke their first loue, departed away from the liuing GOD, and embraced this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world: writeth this his Epistle gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the Christians of those times, to strengthen the vveake, confirme the doubtfull, and stay such as were ready to fall.</p>
            <p>The argument whereof is contained in these words, which I haue now read in
<pb facs="tcp:15508:3"/>
your hearing; wherein three thinges are to be obserued. First, he maketh knowne vnto them his loue: in that he calleth them his <hi>beloued.</hi> Secondly, his carefull and diligent study and endeuour, not onely by word being present, but also by writing beeing absent, to procure their euerlasting good, and to direct them to the attayning of eternall saluation, in that he professeth, <hi>he gaue all diligence to write vnto them of the common saluation:</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he sheweth, what it was, that in those his carefull deliberations (how he might most happily worke their eternall good) he found most necessary to write vnto them of. <hi>It was necessary for me to write vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you to exhort you to contende &amp;c.</hi> Of these thinges in order, as they lie in the words of the Apostle, &amp; first of the first, which is his <hi>loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many and great are the things Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God requireth of them, whom he appointeth Rulers and Gouernours ouer his people. For as he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto them part of his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, giueth them his owne tytles, setteth them vpon his owne seate, committeth
<pb facs="tcp:15508:3"/>
the care of his people vnto them, and trusteth them with the execution of his owne iustice and iudgement, so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them, and putteth in them a spirit of more, then ordinary wisedom, courage, and magnanimitie, fit to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and beare the weight of so great a burthen. But aboue all he requireth of them a tender and louing affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, of whom they take the charge, that they seeke not their owne priuate pleasure, profit, or content, but the good of them ouer whom they are set.</p>
            <p>And as this is required generally of all Rulers, so most principally of them, to vvhom the Word of reconciliation, the dispensation of the Diuine myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the power of the keyes of the kingdome of heauen is committed. This our Sauiour shewed by his manner of proceeding, and the course he tooke, when hauing accomplished the worke of redemption, and being ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne back to him, that sent him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to send out his Apostles with most ample Commission for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:15508:4"/>
of the Saints, the worke of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, and the conuersion of such, as he had bought &amp; purchased with his most precious blood. For though he had made choyce of such men for that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as had beene conuersant with him in the dayes of his flesh, seene his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and workes of wonder, and heard the words of his heauenly wisedome, and were most fit to be witnesses of all the things he did and suffered, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the ioyfull tydings of saluation to the people of the world, yet would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> giue them no Commission, till he vvere assured of their loue. And therefore, though he had promised to builde his Church on <hi>Peters</hi> fayth and ministerie,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> and to giue vnto him the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen, yet before he performed this promise, and said vnto him,<note place="margin">Iohn, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Feed my lambes, feede my sheepe,</hi> he demaunded thrice of him concerning his <hi>loue.</hi> Neither doth he aske him of his loue towards them, he was to take charge of, but of his loue towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, thereby the more to enforce it, and raise it to a higher degree, as if he had
<pb facs="tcp:15508:4"/>
thus said: If I haue de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erued any thing of thee, if my death and bitter sufferings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue thy loue, if thou owest any thing vnto me for the benefits of the heauenly calling, the knowledge of that truth, which flesh and blood could not reueale vnto thee, and the dignitie of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, wherewith I haue honoured thee, as (I say vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to thee) thou owest more then thy selfe: turne the course of thy loue vpon the people of my purchase: for they are the inheritance my Father gaue me, vvhen I came into the worlde, the reward of my labours, the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of my trauailes, and the price of my blood: for their sakes I left my throne in Heauen, put off my robe of Maiestie, and put vppon me the habite of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, they are my Temple, in which I am worshipped, my Church, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest wherof my Name is called vppon, my spouse, whom my soule loueth, and my body, with out which I am not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and full.</p>
            <p>An example of this loue, which God requireth of vs, himselfe gaue vs, when he loued vs, and gaue his Sonne for vs,
<pb facs="tcp:15508:5"/>
whiles we were yet his enemies. An e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof Christ shewed vs, when he poured forth his soule in bitter passions, to redeeme his people from theyr sinnes. An imitation of these examples in the highest degree, that euer was founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst mortall men, we haue in <hi>Moses,</hi> that desired to haue his name blotted out of the booke of life, rather then GOD should be dishonoured, or his people destroyed: and in <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ule,</hi> who wished to be <hi>Anathema</hi> from the Lord Iesus, for the Iewes his brethren and kinsmen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh. A portion, degree, and measure of this loue, resteth vpon all the true seruaunts of God, whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that so often, when they speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people of God, they call them <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.</hi> So much of the Apostles loue. His <hi>diligence</hi> follovveth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diligence</hi> or studie, is an intentiue fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the minde on some one thing much esteemed, and respected. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Apostles, and Apostolike men in the worke of the Ministry, the gathering of the Saints, and procuring the euerlasting good, and eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:15508:5"/>
of Gods people appeareth in three thinges; the multiplicitie of the thinges, they do for the working of this intended good: the sedulitie in doing them: and the diuers manner of doing of them.</p>
            <p>Touching the first: who can expresse the varietie of the things, they do for the good of them, whom GOD hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to theyr charge? They teach the ignorant, convince them that erre, seeke them that are lost, bring backe them that are ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the way, heale the sicke, binde vp the broken harted, comfort the heauy, &amp; such as are deiected with sorrow, they strengthen the weake, confirme the doubtful, stay them that are ready to fall, and raise vp them that are fallen.</p>
            <p>This multiplicity of endeuours, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the good of Gods people, we shall find in the blessed Apostle Saint <hi>Paule</hi> more, then in all the rest: who though he vvere the last, and esteemed himselfe the least, and not woorthy to be named an Apostle; yet laboured he more, then all they, who sometimes disputeth, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exhorteth, sometimes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, sometimes entreateth, sometimes
<pb facs="tcp:15508:6"/>
counselleth, sometimes threatneth, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times promiseth, sometimes terrifyeth, &amp; sometimes comforteth; sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the Spirit of meeknes, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a rodde in his hand, calleth backe some, as beeing out of the way, encourageth others, &amp; maketh himselfe one of their companie, as beeing in a good way: some he calleth his ioy, his crowne &amp; glorie, and to some he obiects folly &amp; madnes; to some he giueth milk, to some strong meat: sometimes he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth and banisheth from the Church, sometimes he confirmeth his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same againe. These are the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers &amp; different things the Apostles and Apostolike men doe for the good of Gods people.</p>
            <p>Now as theyr diligence appeareth in this varietie, and multiplicitie of things they do, so likewise in theyr sedulitie in doing them, in that they doe them in season, and out of season; and in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner of doing them, in that they perfome them by vvord being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and by Letters being absent. The Apostle Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> desiring to benefite
<pb facs="tcp:15508:6"/>
the vvhole Christian Church, (vvith all the parts whereof it was not possible for him to be present) sheweth his diligence in vvryting: <hi>It was necessarie for me to vvrite vnto you.</hi> VVhere we are occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to speake first of vrryting in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: and secondly of sacred vvryting, &amp; and the obiect of it.</p>
            <p>Great and inestimable is the benefit of writing, for by it all the treasures of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, pietie, vertue, and learning, that euer God poured forth vpon the sonnes of men, are communicated to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. By it we may commune withall the Patriarches, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Fathers of the Church (the lights and wonders of the world) that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were; and whensoeuer any doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth and troubleth our mindes, we may call a greater &amp; more generall Councell, then either <hi>Constantine, Theodosi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The benefit of writing will appeare to be the greater, if we compare them, who (being renow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed for wisdome and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) neuer wrote any thing, (as <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras
<pb facs="tcp:15508:7"/>
Socrates</hi> and others, of whom very few things remaine) with <hi>Plato, Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and the like, that committed the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of their learning, and wisedome to writing, who, being dead long since, yet liue, and are the great Maisters of the world euen vnto this day. Hence it is that no treasure was anciently, nor is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently esteemed greater, then the holy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of the church; in which respect the <hi>Romanistes</hi> deserue exceeding ill, that did formerly, &amp; doe presently adulterate the monuments of antiquitie, and leaue nothing sincere, and vncorrupt, as their manifold forgeries in former times, their <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> and other like prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of these times make it too plaine</p>
            <p>This beeing noted in generall tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the benefit of writing, let vs come to the more especiall consideration of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writing and the obiect of it.

            <p>The third sort of things for which men contend, are such as we ought to contend for; to wit, matters of fayth, no part whereof we must betray, how deere so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the defence of it cost vs. For these things we must contend <hi>earnestly.</hi> Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie in matters of fayth and religion displeaseth God.

But it will euer be true, which Christ obserued in his time; the children of this world are wiser in theyr generation, then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light.

            <p>It is obserued, that in the time of the <hi>Arrian</hi> heresie, at the first the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques had all aduantages on their side, the determination of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell called &amp; confirmed by the royall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of <hi>Constantine</hi> was for them, and <hi>Constantine</hi> resolute to suppresse that heresie, and to send into banishment the maintainers of it.

he belieued by faith. This doctrine of fayth (least we mistake it) is described by two circumstances. It was <hi>once deliuered,</hi> and it was deliuered <hi>to the Saints.</hi> It is said to haue been <hi>once</hi> deliuered, to expresse the difference betweene the manner of the diuine reuelation formely, and since Christ appeared. For before, the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truth was reuealed, not all at once, but in diuers sorts, and degrees, according as the time wherein the reuelation vvas made, was neerer, or more remote from the appearing of Christ, but in the last times God spake by his owne sonne, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him at once deliuered all that, that shal be knowne concerning himselfe, till the ends of the world. So that we which are Christians must be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eue nothing but that which was deliuered at the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christianitie.</p>
            <p>So that the error of the <hi>Montanists</hi> is to be reiected, which imagined, that Christ reuealed not all the mysteries of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to <hi>Peter,</hi> on whom he promised to build his Church, to <hi>Iohn,</hi> the disciple he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o deerely loued, which leaned on his breast at the mysticall supper, and to the
<pb facs="tcp:15508:17"/>
rest of that blessed company, but reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many things till the spirit descended vppon <hi>Montanus,</hi> and his prophetesses: as also the phrensie of those heretickes in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which affirmed, that as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was author of the old Testament, &amp; the Sonne of the New, so the holy Ghost in the last times must be the author of a third, which is a law of loue, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the last, to continue for euer, &amp; to haue none after it, may (as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) be rightly termed the eternall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, so abusing the place of the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But passing by these errors of phanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and vaine men: in that the faith is said to haue beene <hi>once deliuered,</hi> we obserue two things; the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rst, that that onelie is true which was deliuered at the first. For howsoeuer many things be more fullie, distinctly, and expresly knowne in latter times then they were formerly, yet they were deliuered at the first infolded in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralities, out of which they are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more distinctly, and expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, euen as a child, when it is first borne, hath all those parts of body, that
<pb facs="tcp:15508:17"/>
euer after it hath, though not expressed and enlarged as afterwards they are, as <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis</hi> most aptly noteth.</p>
            <p>Secondly we may obserue, that vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer may be proued to be most aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, is vndoubtedly true, as being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly inspired from the spirit of truth. <hi>Quod primum, verissimum:</hi> the truth is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the counterfeite, the thing before the imitation of the thing, the habite before priuation, and good before euill: the good seede was first sowed, and then the enuious man came, <hi>et superseminauit zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zania,</hi> and sowed tares, where the good seede was before.</p>
            <p>We deny not therefore, but most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly graunt vnto our aduersaries, that Antiquitie is a note of the true Church; not as if that Church were alwaies pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and most vncorrupt, which first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ued in the profession of it: for then the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> and <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, would proue themselues as pure or purer, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Romanists</hi> are wont to stand much vppon this note of Antiquitie, but hovv wil they proue, they haue the faith which was first deliuered.
