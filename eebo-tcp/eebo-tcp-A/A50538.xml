            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MEeting accidently at a <hi>Coffee-Houſe</hi> with a Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Paper, reflecting on two Eminent and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Phyſitians, Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Goodall;</hi> my Curioſity led me to enquire the truth of Fact, believing nothing ill or mean, as that Paper would inſinuate, could come from Men of their Rank and Figure: Upon true Information the Story runs thus:</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> being ſent for to a Patient, preſcribed the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Bark, as a Remedy he believed would cure the Diſeaſe. The Patient refuſed, alledging it had been often taken by the advice of one <hi>Blackſtone</hi> an Apothecary in <hi>Newgate-Market,</hi> (which by the way is more than <hi>Blackſtone</hi> dare juſtifie, being puniſhable for him to give repeated Doſes without a Phyſitian;) however Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> modeſtly told the Patient, he would not anſwer for <hi>Blackſtone</hi>'s Practice, or Powder; but if they would pleaſe to ſend to Dr. <hi>Goodall,</hi> who he knew to have a good ſort by him, which might be depended upon, he believed Dr. <hi>Goodall,</hi> upon his Note, would ſupply them with ſuch a proportion as was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Accordingly a Note was writ, and Dr. <hi>Goodall</hi> ſent two Ounces, at the rate mentioned in the Paper.</p>
            <p>But this was purely accidental, without any deſign of Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> or Dr. <hi>Goodall,</hi> to ſell, or get advantage by the Medicine, Dr. <hi>Goodall</hi> taking that Money of the Patient, purely in regard and tenderneſs to the Apothecary, the moſt moderate of the Trade taking that or a better Price for the Medicine; for being it was not to a Charitable Patient, he was not obliged to give it <hi>Gratis;</hi> ſo on the other hand, he was not willing to give any advantage againſt the Apothecary.</p>
            <p>This being the Truth of Fact, betrays the great Malice, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Weakneſs, nay Madneſs of that Paper; which I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove by this enſuing inſtance.</p>
            <p>I ſent a Bill to <hi>Blackſtone</hi>'s Shop, for ſome Doſes of the ſame Powder, and inſtead of 4<hi>s. per</hi> Ounce, they took at the rate of 12<hi>s. per</hi> Ounce, ſeveral times, and told the Maid that fetch'd it, they did not uſe to ſell it ſo cheap, but they let her have it ſo, in hopes to get her Miſtreſſes Cuſtom: Now the deſign of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being to inſinuate Extortion in the Doctors, let the world Judge where lies the Extortion.</p>
            <p>I publiſh this for real Publick Good, to ſhew the Candour, Juſtice, and Civility of the two Phyſitians, and the Baſeneſs, Folly, and horrid Extravagance of the Authors of that Paper, who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> was juſt to his Patient, to preſcribe a good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, Dr. <hi>Goodall</hi> kind to let the Patient have it, and that with ſo much reſpect and kindneſs to the Apothecary,) reflects upon theſe worthy Perſons for ſo doing; chiefly too, becauſe a more rotten ſort of Stuff, perhaps, would not do the feat; is a piece of Villany, to be puniſht by the Civil Magiſtrate, and not by any further notice from the Doctors; who are too Great, Generous and Good, to bark againſt ſuch little Curs; who, as their own Paper does conclude <hi>Nothing, are Nothing,</hi> and <hi>ſit for Nothing, Purely, Simply,</hi> (and if poſſible) <hi>leſs than Nothing.</hi>
