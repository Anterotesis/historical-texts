         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. The INTRODVCTION.</head>
            <p>WILLIAM PENN Entituleth his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
<hi>The Foundation shaken;</hi> which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he termeth a <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> he
acknowledgeth to be, at least, our <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:</hi>
In the beginning of his Epistle to the Reader,
he doth inveigh against Human Tradition; amongst
which he numbreth not onely those things which are
<hi>Circumstantial,</hi> but also those Doctrines which Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
generally believe to be <hi>Essential:</hi> And at the
latter end of his Epistle he confesseth, the Doctrines of
the <hi>Trinity, Satisfaction, and Iustification by imputed
Righteousness,</hi> to be cardinal Points, and chief Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
firmly believed as Articles of Christian Faith,
which he telleth us he hath endeavoured the total en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervation
of. It is plain then, that this man striketh
at the Root, and laboureth to overthrow the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Christianity, as we have built upon it, that
he might overthrow the faith of weak and unestabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
Christians: But <hi>the Foundation of God standeth
sure;</hi> the great Fundamental Truths concerning our
Lord Jesus Christhis Godhead, being the second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Trinity, equal with the Father; his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which he made to God's Justice for Man's sin;
and justification by his imputed Righteousness; are
like a Rock which cannot be moved; against which,
what ever waves do arise and beat, for removal of,
though the noise and clamors be great, yet the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
will be in vain; the Rock remaineth where it
was, and the waves of opposition are broken to pieces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42394:4"/>
It is possible indeed that the Faith of some may suffer
shipwrack by such assaults, because, they were never
well grounded, fastned and fixed in the principles of
Religion; because, they never received the truths of
the Word either with true saving Faith, or true sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Love; and therefore, the Lord hath threatned to
<hi>give such up unto strong delusions to believe a lie, that they
might be damned, 2 Thes.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10, 11, 12. These are the
persons who hear Christ's Word, and do not practice
accordingly; therefore, our Saviour compareth them
to fools <hi>that build their house upon the sand, upon which
the rain descendeth, and the floods come and the winds
blow and beat, and it falleth, and the fall therefore is great,</hi>
Mat. 7. 26, 27. This is the <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi> which
<hi>W. P.</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> may shake, and overthrow, and
be instrumental to pull down into the same ruine and
destruction with themselves: But such who have built
upon the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only true
<hi>Foundation, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 11. Such who have <hi>built</hi> indeed
<hi>upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, whereof
Iesus Christ himself is the chief Corner-stone. Eph.</hi> 2. 20.
They have built upon the Rock, (upon which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
stumbleth and falleth, will be broken to pieces;
but upon which whosoever buildeth, is safe) therefore
are not tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine;
neither is it possible (because of Christ's care and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
for them) that they should be overthrown
by any of the blasts of Satan, or any of his instruments,
<hi>Math. 24. 24, If it were possible they shall deceive the very,
Elect.</hi> The <hi>Quakers,</hi> however, some of them, and those
of the chiefest and Ring-leaders, have at sometimes
let fall from their Black-mouths most hideous Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and vented most damnably-heretical Doctrines:
as for instance, <hi>George Fox</hi> positively affirmed thus,
<hi>I am equal with God;</hi> this was deposed at a general
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42394:4"/>
Sessions in <hi>Westmerland. Iames Nayler</hi> said in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Mr. <hi>Baldwin,</hi> a man of eminent trust and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
<hi>That he did witness, that he was as holy, just, and
good, as God.</hi> In the <hi>Quakers</hi> book called, <hi>Saul's Errand
to Damascus,</hi> it is asserted, <hi>That there is no distinction
of Persons in the Godhead. Nayler</hi> and others have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to this effect, <hi>That whosoever expects to be saved by
him that died at Ierusalem, shall be deceived.</hi> I might
mention many other such Blaspemies and Heresies;
See <hi>The perfect Pharisee,</hi> by the <hi>Newcastle</hi> Ministers at
the beginning. I say, though the <hi>Quakers</hi> have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
spoken out their blasphemies and corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
yet for the most part they are so subtle, that
they do not suffer the inward shape of their mind to
appear so plainly abroad, lest every one should run
from them with loathing and abhorrency; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the import of their words be blasphemy and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
yet they shroud their meaning under ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
phrases; and especially at their first assault and
endeavours to gain proselities and followers, they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the hook with the pleasing bait of sugred words
and fair speeches, whereby they deceive those that are
unskilful in the word of Righteousness, and in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of their erroneous ways; whence it is that many
ere they are aware, and not knowing whither they are
going, are drawn into their pernicious ways, by reason
of whom the way of truth is evil spoken of.</p>
            <p>But <hi>W. P.</hi> being himself a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and speaking in
their name and vindication, as himself telleth us, p. 36.
and they dispersing his books, and calling for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
and he being counted amongst them one of their
chief, because of some smattring of learning which
they conceit he hath, and which he himself seemeth to
have a high conceit of (which how groundless it is,
shall be discovered in the places where he doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42394:5"/>
to show something of a Scholar) doth in his
Pamphlet plainly assert and stand up for those <hi>Quaker</hi>-Doctrines
which I shall prove to be blasphemous and
damnable Heresies. And hath openly made it known
to the World, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> in those three great
points which he doth militate against, and endeavour
the refutation of, are Rank <hi>Socinians,</hi> who more grosly
erre in the Fundamentals of Religion, than the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
themselves. And because W. P. doth take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from the meeting with me and others in dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
(if it might be so called, where nothing was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
answered) to put forth his Pamphlet; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he giveth but a lame, and in somethings a false
account of transactions; therefore, I shall 1. give a
true and brief Narative of what passed at the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or Conference, with answer to his Postscript,
2 Establish the truths he objecteth against, by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Argument; 3 Answer his objections against
those truths. Lastly, apply my self to deluded <hi>Quakers,</hi>
for the recalling of them, and to all other Christians
for the cautioning and establishing of them against
the attempts of such as would draw them aside into
the dark and dangerous path, which doth as certainly
lead to Hell as the broad way of Prophaneness.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. A brief Narrative of T. V's meeting with some Quakers
in Spittle-yard, with the occasion and transactions
there, and some exceptions to the account which W. P.
hath given thereof.</head>
            <p>MY first meeting with the <hi>Quakers</hi> was upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
at the house of a friend in <hi>Houndsditch,</hi> in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42394:5"/>
der to the preserving of some who were tempted to
go amongst them; I met there several <hi>Quakers,</hi> two
of which were the chief speakers: It would tire the
Reader, as I believe it did the hearers, to give rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all their wild and impertinent discourse; I
could not get them to speak out, and plainly to assert
some of their Principles, through fear it is likely lest
their mouths should be stopped before the people;
yet after many words, they asserted the perfection of
Saints in this Life, and the place of Scripture which
they brought for the proof of their assertion was,
1 <hi>Iob. 3. 9. Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin.</hi>
Unto this I answered, That the words in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (one of them interrupted me
at the mention of the Original words, saying, It was
the smoke of the bottomless pit) that the signification
was, doth not make it his business to sin; and the
meaning was, that such as were born again, did not
make a trade of sin, did not go on in a course of sin;
or did not commit sin, that is, with the full bent of the
will as the wicked do; But that it could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of not committing sin at all; because, the
same Apostle in the same Epistle, Chap. 1. 8. telleth
thus, <hi>If we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and
the truth is not in us.</hi> There he speaketh of himself and
others that were born again, and plainly acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
they were not without sin. It was further urged,
that if all that were born of God were perfectly free
from sin; then it would follow, that who ever found
any sin in them, were not born of God, consequently
in state of nature, and so if they should die with any sin
remaining, they would certainly go to Hell, and so
none there, yea none in the world would be saved.
Moreover I appealed to the experience of the best of
them, whether they could say they were wholly free
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42394:6"/>
from sin, whether they had no irregular thoughts nor
affections: this they would not affirm, neither did
they absolutely deny: when they pleaded the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
that the same Apostle <hi>v.</hi> 12. acknowledgeth that
he had not as yet attained, neither was yet perfect; and
if the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> who had arrived to so great a
heighth in grace that he was (how ever as some think
little in bodily stature) yet taller by the head and
shoulders than others in regard of his grace and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
attainments; how could Audacious <hi>Quakers</hi> (who
if <hi>Quakers</hi> indeed because of their damnable opinions, I
am confident have not the least degree of true grace)
boast of perfection, as if they had got above the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
himself. I told them that all true Believers were
perfect in a sence, they were Evangelically perfect, but
not legally, not absolutely perfect; they had perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of parts, but not perfection of degrees; and in
this sence the work of Grace, though the work of God
was not perfect in regard of our selves, but by degrees
was carried on unto further perfection. After this,
when they could give no answer to the Arguments
urged against them, they burst out into a clamor, and
talking all altogether, opening their mouths as wide
as they could, and shutting their ears as hard as they
could, repeating the same things over and over again;
<hi>You make your selves the Patrons of sin; He that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
sin is of the Devil;</hi> And whilst they pleaded, <hi>That
all which were born of God were without sin,</hi> they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
themselves to be none of those that were born of
God by the sin which they were palpably guilty of in
the multitude of their words, especially in their wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture from its genuine sence &amp; meaning,
and in the perverse disputings of their corrupt minds.
Our discourse was to this effect, wherein they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42394:6"/>
so much of their rotten Tenents, so much of
their folly and weakness, being unable to maintain
what they had asserted, that one said to them, <hi>An't
please God I will believe you no more.</hi> Others that were
wavering before, were confirmed against them, aud
established in the ways of Truth, and so continue still
to this day.</p>
            <p>The next week after this meeting I went into the
Country for a fortnight, and in my absence, two of my
friends (Mother and Daughter) went off to the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi>
the Daughter was the first whose inclinations
and humour carried her that way for some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
for the preserving of whom from the <hi>Quakers</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions
upon the request of the Mother, I had several
discourses with her; I gave several reasons against their
tenents and ways, unto which she could give no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
nor any ground of her liking their ways, which
was not answered; onely a perverse will (which I am
inform'd her Mother hath so much indulg'd in other
things, unbefitting a parent, that in this, it is like to
prove the destinction both of mother and child) did
lead her this way, against all reasons and perswasions;
I acknowledge I did say, <hi>It was worse to go to the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<hi>meetings than to a Bawdyhouse;</hi> because the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement
of the soul with their damnable erors, which
there she was likely to contract, was more deep and
more hardly to be washt off, than the defilement of
whoredom or adultery; and what our Saviour said
of the Pharisees, I may say of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
go into the Kingdom of Heaven sooner than they:
moreover I told her that, <hi>If there stood a cup of poyson</hi> in
the window, <hi>I would rather drink it than suck in their
damnable Doctrines,</hi> because poysoning of the body was
not so bad as the poysoning and damning of the soul.
I said further (not that I would give her up) but that,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42394:7"/>
if she went again, <hi>God might give her up to believe a lye
that she might be damned:</hi> the former is come to passe,
and the last is most likely to follow; and now let
W. P. call my zealous endeavours to keep a poor soul
out of the dark path, which leadeth to utter darkness,
peevish zeal, and railing accusations, and what he
pleaseth, I am sure I neither did, nor spake any thing
unbecoming a Minister of the Gospel. W. P. char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
me with cautioning the <hi>Pater-familias</hi> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is false, and the Master
of the Family I am confident will not a verr it, and
why he should charge it I know not, except that he
might usher in those expressions, <hi>Forgetting that they
hold their liberty by connivance and the many appeals made
by their non-conforming Bretheren for indulgence;</hi> unto
which I say that we do not forget it, neither would we
be unthankful either unto God or man for it; and if by
the appeals made by our non-conforming Brethren
for indulgence, he doth mean and reflect upon the
grateful acknowledgement, which some of them lately
made unto the Supreame Magistrate, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of whose government we all do live. He disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
little of a Christian spirit, if he finds fault with it,
since we have a command, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1, 2. That suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks be made
for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority, that
we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
honesty;</hi> and therefore as we make conscience to pray
for our Soveraign, so we look upon our selves, as obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to give thanks both to God, and unto him when
through his clemency and favour, we have liberty to
live peaceable and quiet lives in all Godlinesse and
honesty. But to proceed in the narrative: the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had such influence upon the mother, that she was
instrumental to draw her into this pernicious way,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42394:7"/>
which when I heard of, I went to their house to use
my endeavors for the reducing of them; where I had
not been long, but the two men I had before discoursed
with in <hi>Hounds-ditch</hi> came in; amongst other things
they flatly denied that there were three persons in the
Godhead, and that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost was
a threefold variety or manifestation of God. I did not
think fit to enter into a dispute concerning that and
other points then; because it was so late, and because
I desired to have witnesses on my side, as well as theirs.
This was the occasion of my meeting with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
at my House, which W. P. speaketh of, and was
present at, but it is false (what he saith) that I bespake
my usual Auditory, an hour before the Quakers were
appointed to come, for I neither gave publick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
neither spake to any of a sooner time than I sent
sent word to the Quakers of. W. P. chargeth me for
bringing not onely a second, but a third and fourth,
least I should incur a non-plus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That I should
bring one with me was appointed when the Meeting
was promised, that our number might be the same,
with the two that were to dispute with us, and whom
we two had met with before; but if other two of my
Bretheren were present, it was without any desire of
mine, but onely their our inclination brought them
thither for some time after our discourse began; and
if they spake any thing, it was not because they
thought I stood in any need they should help me out,
but because of G. W's confused discourse and indirect
answers to my Arguments, they attempted to bring
him to some order, and to have gained an answer
from him, that the dispute might more intelligibly
and successfully have proceeded.</p>
            <p>When the assembly was come together I began with
prayer, which was no sooner ended, but (the other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42394:8"/>
two Quakers who promised to meet with, us not
appearing,) <hi>George Whitehead</hi> began to speak, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that he was there come to defend the Quakers
opinions, which I had asserted were damnable; and
when he would have first discoursed of the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them; I told him and the people that I owned my
charge of damnablenesse on the Quakers opinions,
and though I did not decline to dispute about the light
he spake of, and other errours of the Quakers, yet I
thought it most proper to begin with the Doctrine of
the Trinity, denied by the Quakers I last met with,
who directly affirmed that the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost were not three distinct persons, but a threefold
variety or manifestation, and this I asserted to be a
damnable errour, and would prove it to be so, and
therefore I asked him whether his opinion was the
same with theirs, unto which M. <hi>Danson</hi> added, that he
had asserted the Quakers to have an infallible spirit,
so that what was the opinion of one, must consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be the opinion of all, and therefore that he must
either own this opinion, or disown them for Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
G. W. at first did neither plainly assert nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
deny the opinion, but filled his mouth, and the
people eares with a multitude of words, wherein was
so much ambiguity and obscurity, that the sentiments
of his mind were not easily to be perceived. But W. P.
standeth up, falsly and blasphemously reflecting on
the Doctrine of the Trinity, as an errour sprung up
three hundred years after Christ, and directly denied
that there were three distinct persons in the Godhead,
with three distinct incommunicable properties. Then
I asked G. W. whether he owned W. P. for a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and not being disowned, I urged an argument
against his assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>If the Father be another from the Son, and the Son ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42394:8"/>
from the Father, and the Holy Ghost another from
each, and all three are God; and the property of the Father
is to beget the Son, and the property of the Son, to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the Father, and the property of the Holy Ghost, to
proceed from the Father, and the Son; then there are three
distinct persons in the Godhead, with three distinct incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
properties.</item>
                  <item>But the Father is another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Therefore there are three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>When I had propounded my argument, <hi>W. P.</hi>
shrunk, saying he did not come thither to dispute, but
left it to G. W. who neither would repeat my Sylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism,
nor give any direct answer, either to the <hi>Major</hi>
or <hi>Minor;</hi> I could have multiplyed words as G. W.
did, and applyed my self to the people, instead of
speaking to the purpose, but this I forbore propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my argument Sylogistically, and the distinction
of three persons being denied, though no direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
given to the argument urged to prove it; I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
another argument from 1 <hi>Iob. 5. 7. There are
three that bare record in Heaven, the Father, the Word,
and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.</hi>
               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>The Father, Word, and Holy Ghost are either three sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
or three manifestations, or three operations, or three
persons, or something else.</item>
                  <item>But they are not three substances, nor three manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nor three operations, nor any thing else.</item>
                  <item>Therefore they are three persons.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. W.</hi> maketh no direct reply to this Sylogism, but
findeth fault with the terms, and <hi>W. P.</hi> telleth us that
God did not use to wrap his Truths in Heathenish
Metaphysicks, but in plain language; but let the
Reader judge whether there be the heathenish Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks
he speaketh of in this Sylogism, wherein there
is not a word but what is to be found in the Scripture;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42394:9"/>
not but that some words may be made use of, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
Scripture Truths, which are not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
themselves, so they expresse the thing which the
Scripture doth signify (in other Phrases more proper
to the languages, the Scripture were wrot in) and I
could make it evident out of the Books of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
themselves, that they use many words which are
not in the Scripture. No answer could be obtained
to my argument in the Meeting, but W. P. taking the
argument into further consideration, attempteth at
length in his Pamphlet to make a reply, and first
taxeth me to be as little a Scholar, in regard of the
manner of my Sylogism, as a Christian in regard of
the matter of it. My Sylogism was urged to prove
the three glorious persons in the Godhead, the denial
of which doth necessarily infer the denial of Christ to
be God equal with the Father, and let any judge who
approveth himself most a Christian, either W. P. in
denying this, or I in asserting and proving it. As to
the manner of my Sylogism, some Quakers (it may be)
who know not what a Sylogism is, may believe that
it bespeaks me to be little a Scholar, but no Scholar
will judge so from that Sylogism, which they know to
be according to rule, and to carry a firm proof in it
drawn from the Induction of particulars, but W. P.
discovereth himself to be that which he taxeth me for,
namely, <hi>little a Scholar,</hi> and though he hath been at the
University, yet that either he never read Logick, or
never understood Logick, or hath forgot Logick, or
that purposely he hath laid aside Logick, that herein
he might be like to the Quakers in answering nothing
to the purpose; for besides his finding fault with my
Sylogism, his reply to it doth most of all detect his
want of Learning and grosse absurdity, for which
he would have been hissed out of the Schools, had he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42394:9"/>
done it in the University; for though he telleth us he
will give his reason, why he will deny my <hi>Minor,</hi> yet
most ridiculously and ignorantly he argueth against
my conclusion. The <hi>Minor</hi> as he repeateth it is: <hi>But
they are not three manifestations, three operations, three
substances, or three some things else, besides subsistences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>The conclusion,</label> Therefore three subsistences.</p>
            <p>If he had indeed denied the <hi>Minor,</hi> he must have
asserted that they were either three substances, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
or manifestations, or something else; but he
mistaketh the conclusion for the <hi>Minor,</hi> and argueth
that they are not three subsistences. <hi>No one substance
can have three distinct subsistences,</hi> &amp;c. W. P. argueth
against the Trinity of persons in the unity of Essence,
behold the Christian! he argueth against the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Sylogism calling it the <hi>Minor,</hi> behold the
Scholar! yet because his argument is against our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
therefore I shall give answer thereunto, and his
other cavils together in the sixth chap. After this, he
reflected upon Mr. <hi>Madox</hi> in the 11. page, whose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

This Doctrine is strange to none but such as are strangers to

            <p>[<hi>To the capacity of the people</hi>] You mean, to the scorn, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42394:10"/>[<hi>Compar'd their three Persons to three Apostles</hi>] By their three
persons, you mean the three increated Persons of the ever blessed
Trinity, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. Of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency
and wickedness of this Comparison you shall hear by and
by, onely here let me tell you that we have endeavoured to make
them ours, by a fiducial application of them to our selves, and it
is no dishonor to us, though it be a blasphemous reflection on
them, that they are in reproach called our three persons, because
we appear in vindication of them, [<hi>saying, he did not understand
how Paul, Peter, and Iohn, could be three persons, and one Apostle.</hi>]
Neither did we assert it, either directly, or by consequence; For
though we call the father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons,
or He's, according as they are held forth in the Scriptures, yet we
say, there is a vast and infinite difference between three created,
and the three increated persons; for three created persons, are
so many distinct and separate Essences, as they are persons: but
all the increated persons have the same simple and unseparated
essence of God, <hi>Ioh. 10. 30. I and my Father are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 7.
These three are one, not one in person, for so the Father is <gap reason="foreign">

as to subsistence or manner of being, but one in nature and
essence; so that though <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> being of a finite
nature, cannot be three persons and one Apostle, yet I am sure
from the Scripture, that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an infinite nature, are three persons, and yet but one God;
and till you can prove, that finite and infinite, or God and the
Creature are all one, it will be in vain to make such a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for the shaking of this Foundation-truth:—</p>
            <p>[<hi>A most apt comparison to detect the ridicult of their doctrine.</hi>]
Or rather to discover the monstrous blindness, hardness, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
of his own and your hearts, who dare so boldly spit in the
face of God, like men that have cast off all fear and reverence of
God, as well as of men.—</p>

on my person, I purposely overlook, because I contend not for
mine own honor, but for the honor of God.</p>
            <p>[<hi>In stead thereof, perhaps to save his brethren, or shew himself,</hi>
There was no need to save my Brethren, for I do not remember
one word, either of Scripture, or right reason, that was opposed
to what they asserted and proved; so that it was neither to save

my Brethren, nor to shew my self, that I then appeared, but to

shall therefore prove the contrary. And first, that the minor is
not false, nor impertinent, appears by his words, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
for you acknowledge that in scorn to the Doctrine of the
Trinity, he compar'd it to three finite men, viz. <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and
<hi>Iohn,</hi> which you call a most apt comparison to detect the ridicule
of our Doctrine: Secondly, that the major is not false, nor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
as is manifest; for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to hurt or blast the

perverse disputings and railings of men of corrupt mindes, that

               </gap>, blasphemies, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4.
And what can be more derogatory to the glory of the infinite God,
than to fasten the imperfections and limitations of finite creatures
upon him, and to assert three separate essences, as the necessary
consequent of three distinct persons? this was the old Arian Plot,
whereby he and his followers endeavored to prejudice the mindes
of well meaning, but simple men, against the Deity of Christ, and
the Holy Ghost; and this is to blaspheme God and the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>[<hi>A strange way of argumentation, to beg what cannot be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

you mean by separate, I know not; if you mean so separate, as to
destroy the unity and simplicity of the Divine Essence, I own no
such separation; if you take it to be all one with distinct, then I
say it was no begging of the question; for it had been sufficiently
proved, that there are in the Divine Essence three distinct persons,
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.—</p>

and I called them three Hee's, to try if you would own the Deity
of Christ and the Holy Ghost under any Title, and you by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to call them three Divine Hee's, have made it manifest that
your Quarrel is not with the word Person (as some then appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended)
but with the Doctrine or Fundamental Truth expressed
by the three persons, <hi>viz.</hi> the modal distinction and essential union
or one-ness of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which is no less
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42394:11"/>
than to deny and reject God; for though you pretend to own God
the Father, yet in rejecting the Son, you reject the Father; for
saith Christ, he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me,
<hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16 and the beloved Disciple telleth us, that whosoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
the Son, the same hath not the Father, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
            <p>[<hi>If he can finde a he without a substance, or prove that a subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is any thing else than the form of a he, he will do well to justifie
himself from the imputation of ignorance.</hi>] That my calling the
three persons, three Hee's, implies a He without a substance, is
the first thing that you would here insinuate, but this is your gross
ignorance of this great mystery: For each of these Hee s is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
God, and hath the entire undivided nature, substance, or es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, and all that you can say to the contrary, is but like
childrens shooting Paper-pellets against a Rock; your latter
phrase discovers your ignorance of Philosophy, as much as the
former doth of Divinity; for a subsistence is not the form of a he
(as you suppose it to be) but it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the manner
of his being, the form of God the Father is his divine nature, but
his subsistence is his manner of being in the relative property of the
Father, and the form of God the Son is the same divine nature,
but his subsistence is his manner of being in the relative property
of a Son; and the form of God the Holy Ghost, is the same divine
nature, but his subsistence, is his manner of being in the relative
property of the Holy Ghost, as proceeding from the Father and
the Son: and now having found a subsistence, that is not the form
of a he, I hope I shall be justified from the imputation of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
at least, as to this particular.</p>
            <p>[<hi>And till their Hypothesis be of better authority,</hi> G. W. <hi>neither
did, nor doth design mens inventions so much honor</hi>] What authority
our Hypothesis is of, is at present left to the Reader to judge, but
shall certainly be proved one day to be of such authority, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
G. W. nor W. P. shall be able to withstand: But what you
mean by designing mens inventions so much honor, is not easie to
to conjecture, unless you would have us to think it is an honor to be
reproached by G. W. and it is not impossible that they who thrust
all expressions of true honor out of the world, should account
their incivilities an honor to those on whom they bestow them.</p>
            <p>[<hi>For it is to be remarked, that G. W. is no otherwise a Blasphemer,
then by drawing direct consequences from their own Principles, and
recharging them upon themselves.</hi>] What direct consequences did
he draw from our Principles: his telling the people that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was the cause of those gross apprehensions that ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have of God the Father, as if he were an old man, and of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42394:12"/>
Christ like a little childe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and his comparing the three increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to three Apostles,
<hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> and his asserting the separate essences in
God, as the result of three distinct persons, are no direct conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from our Principles: but these are the things for which
he is justly charged with Blasphemy; and if it be Blasphemy to
say that man is equal with God, I know not how it can be any thing
less than Blasphemy, to say that God is but equal with man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to his essence, or subsistence, and that because three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
men are three distinct substances, which was the meaning of
his comparison, but is boldly asserted by you in your Pamphlet,
page 13. Reas. 1. I tremble to see and read such black lines.</p>
            <p>[<hi>So that he did not speak his own apprehensions, in this comparison,
but the sense of their assertion.</hi>] Our assertion will bear no such
sense; For though according to the Scripture, we call them Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or He's, in respect of their manner of subsistence, yet we still
remove all imperfections, limitations, and separation from the
Divine Essence.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Therefore Blasphemer and Blasphemy are their own.</hi>] Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
being disproved, your conclusion necessarily falls to the
ground; he that made that unfit Comparison, and drew those
reproachful consequences from this Scripture-truth, with a design
to blast and overthrow the Deity of Christ and the Holy Ghost, he
is the Blasphemer, and his is the blasphemy, but that was G. W.
and W. P. therefore you are the Blasphemers, and yours is the
Blasphemy: The Lord convince you both of this your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and give you repentance, that you may recant those damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
speeches, whereby you have not onely blasphemed God
your selves, but endeavored to provoke others to do the like:
Now to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost,
the one Holy, and onely Wise God, be glory now and ever.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. The Conclusion of the Narrative, with an Answer unto
W. Pen's Postscript and Cavils against T. V's Sermon.</head>
            <p>TO conclude the Narrative of our meeting with
the Quakers in <hi>Spittle-yard;</hi> when I saw I could
get no answer to the Arguments I had urged for the
proof of the Trinity, and the day was now worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
I thought it would be but lost time, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42394:12"/>
upon the Auditory, to hold them longer there in
discourse with such rambling Disputants, (who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
cunning in nothing more than in putting by
the thrusts and dints of Arguments with diverting
speeches, which if they had received the force of with
direct reply, their weakness would quickly have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to the people, by their falling down before
them) therefore calling for silence, I did shut up the
Discourse with prayer; and here <hi>W. P.</hi> puts forth the
sting of the serpent, and discovereth the prophaness
of his spirit, in terming my prayers <hi>strangely affected
Whines;</hi> What more opprobious terms would the
Dam-me Blades of the times, or the most wicked
Scoffers of God and Godliness have used? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I falsly accused them for Blasphemers unto God,
let the Hearers of their Discourse, and the Readers of
his Pamphlet, with the Answer, judge. That there
was stigmatizing the Quakers with the name of Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers,
is owned and proved; the other of Impudent
Villain, as also that there should be striking, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
is a falshood, for I never either saw it, or heard
any complain of it; and it is well known that in all
our meetings there is peace, and if there were any
rudeness it was when the Quakers came amongst us.
I am sure it was very rude in them to stay and make
such a bauling amongst the people after a dismiss was
required, &amp; when those which could have answered (I
cannot say stilled) them, were retired. <hi>W. P.</hi> tells the
Reader, that <hi>T. V. came palely down stairs.</hi> I fear <hi>W. P.</hi>
hath some defect in his eye-sight, and indeed if the eyes
of his body were no clearer than the eyes of his mind,
he might easily mistake; <hi>T. V.</hi> had more reason to blush
to hear the hideous Blasphemies which were vented
by them; surely he had no reason to look pale through
fear of any big Arguments which they had used against
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42394:13"/>
the truth, lest they should have knockt him on the
head as he came down stairs. <hi>W. P.</hi> chargeth <hi>T. V.</hi> with
a promise of another meeting with them; the promise
was not absolute, as several can witness; if it had been,
it could not be called a breach of promise, if he sent
them word he would meet with some of them, as <hi>G. W.
W. P.</hi> and a few others, since points might more calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be debated, and truth might in likelyhood be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sifted before a few, than before such a multitude.</p>
            <p>And as to that which <hi>W. P.</hi> speaketh of clearing
themselves from their Accusations (of Blasphemy he
meaneth) I wonder he should ever think to wipe off
the name of a Blasphemer, except he should renounce
his error, there being Blasphemy in the very denial of
the Doctrine of the Trinity; so that the greater the
multitude, the greater would have been his shame; but
he hath taken a course to proclaim himself a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and Heretick before more than that Auditory;
and if such a vindication of himself doth yield them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
satisfaction, he hath it. <hi>W. P.</hi> further informeth
the Reader of his visiting my Meeting on a Lecture-day,
and that I (shewing both injustice and cowardize)
shamefully slunk away, &amp; so baulked a defence of my
own Principles. Unto this I answer, that they gave
me no notice before of their coming; that I had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
before by promise to meet with some friends about
business, so soon as I had done; that I did not think it
fit to dispute with Quakers after preaching a Sermon,
and my purpose is never to do it, because I look upon
it as the devils plot, hereby to steal away the precious
seed of the Word out of the mindes of the people, that
so it may prove unfruitful. Further I told <hi>W. P.</hi> there
was a Letter in the house in order to a meeting with
him for discourse of the Principles, wherein was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
some conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> that they would dispute
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42394:13"/>
Sylogistically, that they would plainly assert their principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which we should dispute of, four were named, with desire
to know whether they would own them; But when I perceived
that they made such a noise, and would not receive my answer why
I did not think fit to stay, and discourse with them at that time,
I went away from them, but neither shamefully nor cowardly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in the apprehensions of such who take any occasion, to fasten
reproach upon the Ministers of the Gospel. And yet whatever
reason I had then to retire, &amp; though no answer were given in the
dispute before to either of my arguments; some have not spared
to report in the Town, that I was worsted by the Quakers, which
how unreasonable it is, those which read this narrative, may easily
judge. And whereas W. P. at the conclusion of his Book, doth
charge us for want of zeal for our Principles, want of Love to our
Reputation, and want of Conscience in our Promises, because he
said we have evaded the many opportunities offered for treaty. I
answer, that these are false aspersions cast upon us without any
good ground, there were indeed Letters passed, and the conditions
before offered not being in full accepted, M. D. and my self inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and accordingly I sent them word, to meet with them and
fully to conclude together upon the conditions, and the time, and
place of meeting; but at that time Mr. <hi>D.</hi> had some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
occasion that called him out of Town and could not be
there; I was at home expecting him every minute, till the time
was almost slipt; when W. P. and another came to my house, whom
I gave to understand that Mr. D. was not yet come, but I thought
it was somewhat extraordinary that kept him away; W P. required
his presence elsewhere: about two or three days after, Mr. D. came
to Town and to my house, and we both of us resolved to meet with
them that week, but before I could send W. P. word, I had infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of a Book he had in the Presse against me; and then I jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that a meeting with him would not be of such signification as
to give answer to him in the same way as he hath written against
me and the truth, therefore I did forbear to meet, and began to
write. And now let any judge whether W. P's calumnies are deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Before I shut up this Chapter, I shall give a brief reply unto
W. P's Post-script of animadversions, on some particulars in my
Sermon which he heard, of which he took notes, not for his edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
as others do, but that he might pick out something to cavil
at, and reproach the Doctrine withal; He termeth them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictictions,
serting them in columns, one over against another. And
here he doth shamefully again discover his weakness and want of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42394:14"/>
learning; if he had known what a contradiction is, surely he would
have blushed to give that term to the things he there maketh
mention of, which have not so much as an inconsistency together,
except the line he putteth between them should make it; What
contradiction or falshood is it for a <hi>Person to overcome the world,
and the victory in this life to be imcompleat?</hi> Were not the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
overcome by the children of Israel, their force subdued? and
yet the victories they had over them were not so compleat, but
that some remained amongst them, who were like pricks &amp; thorns
that did them mischief, and sometimes rose up in rebellion against
them. What contradiction is it for <hi>Persons to be in Christ and cast
off the Old man,</hi> &amp;c. And this, that <hi>worldly lusts cannot be extirpated
out of Gods people in this world.</hi> May not? have not worldly lusts a
being and some power to oppose in Gods people, where they have
lost their rule, and their Iron yoke is taken off from their necks?
will not the experience of all Gods people bear witness to this, and
what else meaneth that of the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 5. 17. The Flesh lusteth
against the spirit</hi> and <hi>Rom. 7. 22. I see another Law in my members
warring against the Law of my minde,</hi> &amp;c. was not the Apostle one
of Gods people? what contradiction is this much like the former
<hi>Gods people overcome their lusts,</hi> &amp; this <hi>their lusts sometime take them
captive?</hi> Doth not the Apostle add, Rom. 7. 22. that the Law in his
members did lead him captive? may not a conquerer be lead cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
sometimes? may not a man be <hi>victus in praelio &amp; victor in
bello,</hi> overcome in some skirmishes, and yet a conquerer in the war?
the Heathen will tell you this, and should it then seem so strange
in Divinity? what contradiction is it for sin to <hi>Tyranizeover belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but not to have dominion, it's in captivity in chains?</hi> as if a
slave in chains might not sometime break loose, and tyranize for a
while, and yet not be said to have dominion, because he hath no
setled rule, but is quickly brought under, and fastned in his bonds
again; what Bedlam-distinction then is it (as W. P. calleth it)
between the tyranny and the dominion of sin? if his common sence
(he sayeth it is against,) were like all sincere Christians common
sence &amp; experience, he would not thus groundlesly cavil: what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
is it, you must <hi>Overcome the world, or the world you,</hi> and
<hi>If you fight you will overcome them;</hi> or this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>He leadeth them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
and <hi>They sometime take him captive.</hi> Can you forbear smiling
at the man? he calleth these things contradictions, But instead of
my Sermons deserving the imputation of contradictory, his cavils
do justly lay him under the imputation of weakness and absurdity.</p>

            <p>THe Trinity of Persons in the unity of the Divine

in the Trinity of Persons, that three should be one,

first and second in the third, and that without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
without confusion, all related to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and al distinguished one from another by incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
personal properties, and yet all one and
the same in regard of one individual Essence, this is
such a mystery as doth exceed the weak and narrow
understanding of the most enlightned and clear sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christians fully to comprehend: some by gazing
too long upon the Sun become blind; and some by
prying too much into this mystery, and attempting
to bring it to the standard and module of their reason
have lost the sight thereof and sunk into grosse appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
and denied either the unity of the Godhead,
affirming the three persons to be three distinct Gods,
or denied the Trinity, affirming the Godhead to be
without three distinct persons; thus while they have
professed and conceited themselves to be wise, they
have proved themselves to be fools, &amp; void of true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
by changing the glory of God into that
which is unworthy of him. But we, having a sure
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42394:15"/>
word of Prophecy in the Scriptures, which is like a
light shining in a dark place, ought to give heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and conform all our conceptions of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the discoveries which he hath made of himself
in his word; God knoweth himself better than any
creature can know, and what he hath spoken of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
must needs be so because he cannot represent
himself otherwise than he is, and if there be a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in him which we cannot reach, we adde folly to
our weakness if we do in the least question it: reason,
it may be, will leave us in our search after the Deity
in the Trinity, and the Trinity in the Deity; but
where reason faileth, Faith must supply it's room; the
proper object of Divine Faith is such things as we
purely do assent unto upon Divine authority; such
are not onely Histories and Prophesies, but also My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
which reason cannot demonstrate unto us: in
this mystery of the Trinity we must exercise our Faith
though we cannot clear it to our selves by demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
not as if we were to lay reason quite aside in
this thing, or trample it under foot; not as if we
should put out the eye of reason that we might see
more clearly with the eye of Faith; for though this
mystery be above reason, yet it is not against reason;
yea there is the greatest reason in the world that we
should assent unto that for truth which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
of himself in his word, because he is a God of
truth, and nothing is more true than that which God
hath spoken. Wherefore if the Scriptures have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
that there are three distinct persons in one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Essence, it is a certain truth, and it is reason
and duty that every one should assent unto it though
the mystery of it, there being no such thing to be
found in nature, cannot be fully comprehended. Here
then I shall propound my assertion, and prove it out of
Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42394:15"/>My assertion according to the generally believed
Doctrine of the Church of God, is this, <hi>That there are
three distinct subsistents or persons in the same single Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Essence or Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The argument bottom'd upon the Scripture to
prove my assertion is this:</hi> 

               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>If the Divine Essence or
Godhead is and can be but one, and the Father is God, and
the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, and the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost be three distinct subsistents or persons;
then there are three distinct subsistents or persons, Father;
Son, and Holy Ghost in the same single Divine Essence or
Godhead.</item>
                  <item>But the Divine Essence or Godhead is, and can be but
one, and the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy
Ghost is God, and the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three
distinct subsistents or persons.</item>
                  <item>Therefore there are three distinct subsistents or persons,
Father, Son and Holy Ghost in the same single Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
or Godhead.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The consequent of the major proposition is plain
and firm, that no man of reason can in the least que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
or deny.</p>
            <p>The minor proposition is that which must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and there are five things in the proposition to
be proved: 1. That the Divine Essence or Godhead
is and can be but one. 2. That the Father is God.
3. That the Son is God. 4. That the Holy Ghost is
God. 5. That the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are
three distinct subsistents or persons.</p>
            <p>1. The Divine Essence or Godhead is and can be but
one, <hi>Deut. 6. 4. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one
Lord,</hi> Isa. 44. 6. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, I am the first and
I am the last, and besides me there is no God,</hi> Isa. 45. 21,
22. <hi>There is no God else besides me, a just God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
there is none besides me; look unto me and be ye saved
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42394:16"/>
all the ends of the Earth, for I am God and there is none
else.</hi> And it cannot be otherwise for if there were
more than one God, then the Godhead might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
it might be limited, and by consequence would
be finite and so not God, because God is infinite. I
need not insist upon this because the unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
is not denied by the adversaries I have to deal
withal.</p>
            <p>2. The Father is God, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 6. To us there is but
one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him.</hi>
I need not multiply places of Scripture, nor adde ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to prove that the Father is God, since it is
generally acknowledged by all that acknowledge a
Deity and the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>3. The Son is God, this <hi>William Penn</hi> plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth,
he denieth that the Lord Jesus Christ is God,
wretched blasphemy! that would thrust the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ off from the Throne of his Godhead? His
denial of the Divinity of Christ, as well as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of the Holy Ghost is plain enough. I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
his words as they lye in his first argument against
the three distinct persons in the Godhead, page 13.
<hi>And since the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is God (which their opinion necessitates them to confesse)
then unlesse the Father, Son, and Spirit are three distinct
nothings, they must be three distinct substances, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
three distinct Gods.</hi> I shall answer the argument
in its proper place, only observe here that he denieth
the Son and Spirit to be God, by a plain consequence,
for first he telleth us that our opinion necessitates us to
acknowledge that the Father is God, and the Son
God, and the Spirit God, which showeth that his
opinion is otherwise that the Son and Spirit are not
God; especially it followeth from the scope of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
which is to prove that if the Father be God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42394:16"/>
and the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, than
there are three distinct Gods; but W. P. having plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
asserted his belief that there is but one God, he
must of necessity deny by his argument, that the Son
and Holy Ghost are God, for neither he nor any Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
of them all, will deny that the Father is God.
Behold here the Christian! that hath offered such an
affront and indignity unto the Son and Spirit, as to
divest them (what in him lieth) of their Divinity; is
not this a treading of the Son of God underfoot, and
doing despight to the spirit of grace? and should not
this cause the hearts of all sincere Christians who have
any zeal for their masters honour, to arise with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against such Black-mouth'd blasphemers,
and to abhor their opinions and ways? but more of
this in the exhortation at the latter end; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism,
abominablenesse and foulness of this opinion,
being such a blasphemy and reproach of the eternal
Son of God, may excuse a little disgression to expresse
my abhorrency thereof.</p>
            <p>The thing to be proved is, that the Son is God, I
do not mean nominal, so as those are that are called
Gods, whether in heaven or in earth; but really so,
that he is God co-essential, co-equal, co-eternal with
the Father: The onely proof of this is to be drawn
from the Scripture.</p>
            <p>I. Joh. 1. 1. 3. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God: All things
were made by him, and without him was not any thing
made that was made.</hi> By the Word we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Essential, not the written Word, namely, the
Son, the only begotten of the Father, which is Christ,
it being the same whom <hi>Iohn</hi> came to bear witness of,
ver. 7. the same which was made flesh, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. Now that this Word, or Son of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42394:17"/>
God, is God, is evident from this place, where 1. He
is called God, <hi>The Word was God.</hi> 2. It is said, <hi>All
things were made by him.</hi> So Col. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. <hi>For by him were
all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth
visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions,
or principalities, or powers, all things were created by him,
and for him.</hi> Whence it followeth, 1. That he himself
was not made, for then he must be made by himself,
which is absurd and impossible; and if he were not
made, then he is no creature, and if no creature, then
God; all things that have a being, being divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God and his creatures.</p>
            <p>2. It followeth hence that all things being made by
him, that he is the Creator, that he is Infinite in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Wisdom, and Goodness, as his works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do demonstrate.</p>
            <p>3. It followeth that all things being made by him,
that he was before all things, as it is said expresly, <hi>Col.
1. 17. And he is before all things;</hi> that he was before the
beginning of time, when creatures received their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
it being necessary that he which made creatures,
should be before the creatures he made, and therefore
he must be eternal, and by consequence that he must
needs be God, none being eternal <hi>a parte ante</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of heretofore, but God.</p>
            <p>II. Joh. 8. 58. <hi>Iesus said unto them; Verily, verily I
say unto you, Before Abraham was I am.</hi> That the Jews
did apprehend him to assert himself to be God, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by their taking up stones to cast at him for the
Blasphemy, which they through their unbelief of his
Deity, did think he had spoken. And that he did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hereby assert himself to be God, is evident from the
words themselves: <hi>I Am</hi> is the Name whereby God
made himself known to <hi>Moses,</hi> and the children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
Exod. 3. 14. <hi>And God said unto</hi> Moses, <hi>thus shalt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42394:17"/>
thou say unto the children of</hi> Israel; I Am <hi>hath sent me
unto you. I am</hi> doth signifie infinite, eternal, necessary,
independent Being, &amp; this Christ doth apply to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
therefore he is God. Moreover, in our Saviours
saying, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I am,</hi> it must needs have a
reference to his Divine Nature; for in regard of his
humane nature the Jews spake truth, <hi>v. 57. Thou are
not yet fifty years old;</hi> as man, he was a son of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and born many generations after him; therefore his
Being before <hi>Abraham</hi> (yea before the world, by the
former Scriptures proved) hath a reference to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature and Godhead.</p>
            <p>III. Joh. 3. 13. <hi>And no man hath ascended unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of
Man which is in heaven.</hi> That Christ was not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at that time, as man, is evident because he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth speaking to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> yet he telleth him,
He is in heaven, that is, as God he filleth both heaven
and earth.</p>
            <p>IV. Rom. 9. 5. <hi>Whose are the Fathers, and of whom as
concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for ever, Amen, Of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
came,</hi> that setteth forth his humane nature. <hi>Who is over
all God blessed for ever,</hi> that evidently doth prove his
Divine Nature. The Title of God with universal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
and eternal Blessedness, cannot without
blasphemy and absurdity be ascribed unto any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as it is here unto Christ.</p>
            <p>V. Philip. 2.6. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought
it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> In this Scripture there
are two Proof that Christ is God: 1 He is said to be in
the form of God: by the form of God we can rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand nothing but the Essence of God; and
to be in the form of God, is to subsist in the Essence of
God, Christ subsisting eternally in the Essence of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42394:18"/>
God, must needs be God. 2. It is said, <hi>He thought it
no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> that is, he was equal
with God without robbing God of his honor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any detraction from the Deity; And none can be
equal with God, but he that is God, and such is Christ.</p>
            <p>I might here add for the proof of Christs Divinity,
all those Scriptures which ascribe the same divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to Christ, as Eternity, <hi>Heb. 1. 8. Vnto the Son
he saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thy Throne O God, is for ever and euer.</hi> Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<hi>Ioh. 21. 17. Lord, thou knowest all things, thou
knowest that I love thee.</hi> Omnipresence, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 20.
<hi>Lo, I am with you always.</hi> Omnipotence. <hi>In making all
things,</hi> as before, <hi>and upholding all things by the word of
his power,</hi> Heb. 1. 3: As also those Scriptures which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the same honor and worship to Christ, which is
due onely to God. <hi>In him we must believe,</hi> Joh. 14. 1.
<hi>In his name we must be baptized,</hi> Math. 28. 19. <hi>Vpon his
name we must call,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 2. <hi>At his name we must bow,</hi>
Phil. 2. 10. None can reasonably question Christs Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who give credit to the Scriptures Authority.</p>
            <p>4. The fourth thing is to prove that the holy Ghost
is God, which <hi>W. P.</hi> also doth deny, and this also I
shall prove from Scripture.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>But</hi> Peter <hi>said, Act.</hi> 5. 4, 3. Ananias <hi>why hath Satan
filled thine heart to lie to the holy Ghost, to keep back part of
the price of the Land?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Why hast thou conceived this
thing in thine heart? thou hast not lyed unto men, but unto
God.</hi> Him whom the Apostle calleth Holy Ghost in the
3d. verse, he calleth God in the 4. verse; and him whom
he calleth God in the 4th verse, he calleth the Spirit
of the Lord in the ninth verse. <hi>How is it that ye have
agreed to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6. Now there are diversities of gifts,
but the same spirit; and there are differences of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
but the same Lord; and there are diversities of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42394:18"/>
operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</hi>
He that is called the same Spirit in the 4th. verse, is
called the same Lord in the fifth verse; and the same
God which worketh all in all in the sixth verse, and
that what is spoken of Administrations and Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the fifth and sixth verses, is attributed to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as appeareth by the seventh verse, where they are
called, <hi>The manifestation of the Spirit given to every man
to profit withal;</hi> and more plainly verse 11. <hi>But all this
worketh that one and the same Spirit, dividing unto every
man severally, as he will.</hi> And what can be more plain
to prove that the Holy Ghost, or Spirit, is God, when
he worketh all in all, and distributeth spiritual gifts
unto men, according to his own good pleasure?</p>
            <p>III. Isa. 6. 1. I saw the Lord sitting upon a
throne, <hi>&amp;c. v.</hi> 2, 3. Above stood the Seraphims, and cryed
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts. <hi>The three Holies
signifie the three Persons; the Lord of Hosts, the one
God,</hi> ver. 8. I heard the voice of the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And he
said, Go tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand
not, <hi>&amp;c. This must needs be spoken of God, and it is
by the Apostle applyed to the Holy Ghost,</hi> Act. 28. 25.
Well spake the Holy Ghost, go to this people, and say, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you shall hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. 1 Cor. 2. 10. <hi>For the Spirit searcheth all things,
yea the deep things of God.</hi> None is omniscient to
know all things, yea whatsoever is in the unsearchable
minde of God, but he that is God, and therefore the
Holy Ghost is God. I might speak further of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Works, as Regeneration, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. guiding Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
into all truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 13. Sanctification, and
the like; of our being baptized by him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11.
and in his name, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. and his being called One,
that is, one God, where he is numbred up amongst
the three Persons that bare record in heaven, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42394:19"/>
All which undeniably prove that the Holy Ghost is
God, co-essential, and co-equal with the Father and
the Son.</p>
            <p>5. The fifth and last thing is to prove, That Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Ghost are three distinct Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
or Persons. Concerning the name Person, I shall
not speak of it, because Mr. <hi>Danson</hi> intendeth to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
that word from the cavils of <hi>W. P.</hi> in answer to
what concerneth him p. 10. That there are three such
distinct Persons in one Divine Essence, is evident from
the Scripture, See Math. 3. 16, 17. <hi>And Iesus when he
was baptized, went up straightway out of the water, and
to the Heavens were opened unto him; and he saw the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God descending like a Dove, and lighting upon him;
And lo a voice from Heaven, saying, This is my beloved
Son in whom I am well pleased.</hi> Here is a distinction of
all the three Persons, the Son was clothed in flesh, and
came up out of the water; the Spirit was in the shape
of a Dove, which came down from heaven; the Fa-
was in the voice, saying, This is my beloved Son.</p>
            <p>Another Scripture which holdeth forth this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
is <hi>Ioh. 16. 17. I will pray the Father, and he shall
give them another Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth.</hi> The
Son prayeth, the Father giveth; The Spirit of Truth
is the Comforter that is given. I shall adde a third
Scripture, 1 <hi>Ioh. 5. 7. There are three that bare record in
heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and
these three are one.</hi> They are the distinct Persons, but
one undivided Essence.</p>
            <p>But further to confirm this truth denied by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
I shall prove from the Scripture that there
are three distinct Persons in one Divine Essence,
1 From the distinct. Names given to them. 2 From
their distinct personal Acts. 3 From their distinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Properties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:42394:19"/>1. From their <hi>distinct Names,</hi> they are called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Ghost, <hi>Math. 28. 19. Baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.</hi> Father, Word, and Holy Ghost, in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7.
before cited. These names do evidence a distinction,
not of nature and essence, for they are one; therefore
of personality.</p>
            <p>2. From their <hi>distinct personal acts,</hi> I mean such acts
as can be ascribed unto none but such as are persons.
1 Giving the Comforter is ascribed to the Father,
<hi>Ioh. 14. 16. I will pray the Father, and he shall send you
another Comforter;</hi> it is proper onely to a person to
give, this act requiring both understanding and will:
2 Sending the Comforter is ascribed to the Son, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
15. 6. <hi>When the Comforter is come whom I will send unto
you from the Father:</hi> and it is proper onely to a person
to send. 3 Guiding into all truth, speaking what he
heareth, is ascribed to the Holy Ghost, <hi>Ioh. 16. 13. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
when he, the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide
you into all truth, for he shall not speak of himself, but
whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak.</hi> And who
can deny that these are personal acts? The distinction
of the persons in these acts is evident in all these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where the Son speaketh of himself in the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I will pray, I will send; he speaketh of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Spirit in the third person, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
he evidently distinguisheth one from another by
the preposition <hi>from</hi> speaking of the Spirit, whom I
will send from the Father. Surely he must wink very
hard that doth not perceive a distinction of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Father, Son, and Spirit, in these places.</p>
            <p>3. That the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are three
distinct persons, is evident <hi>from these distinct personal
and incommunicable Properties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The personal property of the Father is to beget
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42394:20"/>
the Son, <hi>Heb. 1. 5. Vnto which of the Angels said he at
any time, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi>
and the Son being eternal, as hath been proved, this
generation must be eternal.</p>
            <p>2. The personal property of the Son is to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the Father, <hi>Ioh. 1. 14. We beheld his glory, the
glory as of the onely begotten of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The personal property of the Holy Ghost is to
proceed from the Father and the Son,</hi> Ioh. 15. 26.
And when the comforter is come, whom I will send from
the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from
the Father, he shall testify of me.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude the proof of the distinction of the
persons of the Father, the Son and Holy Ghost, in
the unity of the Divine Essence, with the two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made mention of before in the disputation;
which because no answer was given unto, they remain
in force.</p>
            <p>The first argument is this against W. P's plain as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
that there were not three distinct persons in
the Godhead, with three distinct incommunicable
properties.
<list type="syllogism">
                  <item>If the Father be another from the Son, and the Son ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

property of the Son to be begotten of the Father, and
the incommunicable property of the Holy Ghost to proceed
from the Father and the Son; then there are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct

            </p>
            <p>The second argument out of 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7. to prove

<list type="syllogism">

The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is
God, and yet they are nor three Gods, but one God,
the persons of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are
distinct, but the Godhead is the same, not specifically
the same, as the same humane nature is in all indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
men, but numerically the same, so as no similitude
or comparison is to be found in the creatures to set it
forth. The fooles gathering his skirt into three

            <head>CHAP. VI. Ananswer to part of the 10, the 12, 13, 14, and 15 pages
of W. P's Pamphlet, which he intituleth the Trinity of
distinct separate persons in the Vnity of essence, refuted
from Scripture, right reason, with information and
caution in the close.</head>
            <p>THe word separate person, I disown any further
than we may conceive it to signify no more than
distinct, (and so <hi>W. P.</hi> was told again and again in the
meeting,) I need speak no more of that, since his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
are to refute the distinction not the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of persons in the glorious and ever blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
And his first attempt is to refute this Doctrine
by Scripture. The Scriptures which he alledgeth to
overthrow the Doctrine of the Trinity of persons,
are such as prove the unity of the essence, that there
is but one God, which we do not in the least deny,
but have and do assert with as firme belief as he or any
in the world can do; but though the Godhead, or
Divine essence be but one, this is not inconsistent with
the plurality and distinction of the three persons in
the same Godhead.</p>
            <p>And here it is very remarkable how <hi>W. P.</hi> doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
weakness and want of learning in the proof of
the unity of the Godhead by Scripture, for however he
doth attempt to show something of a Scholar in quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one Hebrew text in the margin, as if he were well
acquainted with the original Hebrew tongue, so as to
be able to read and understand it without punets, yet
most ignorantly and rediculously he cites three texts,
namely, <hi>Isa. 40. 25. chap. 48. 17. Psal.</hi> 71. 22. to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42394:22"/>
prove Gods unity, in all which the Hebrew maketh
no mention of it; the translation indeed is <hi>Holy one,</hi>
and <hi>Holy one of Israel,</hi> and he very sillily writes ONE
in great letters as if one did bear the emphasis of the
place, when there is no such word as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> one, in the

some Scriptures which the Socinians do make use of
to prove that Christ is not God, one is <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 17.
<hi>Iesus said unto him why callest thou me good? there is
none good but one, that is God.</hi> Whence no Socinian
can rationaly infer that Christ is not God, any more
than that he is not good; for his question doth not
infer a denial of his Divinity or goodnesse, but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
according to the young man's apprehension
of him, and by way of probation. For in other
places (as hath been shown) Christ's Divinity is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough declared. Another Text is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3.
<hi>This is life eternal that they might know thee (Father)
the only true God.</hi> In this place Christ excludeth not
himself from being God, but, <hi>only,</hi> excludeth all
false Gods; and if you mark it, the word <hi>only,</hi> as also
the word <hi>one,</hi> doth belong to the predicate <hi>God,</hi> and
not to the subject <hi>Father,</hi> it being not <hi>onely thee to be
the true God,</hi> but <hi>thee to be the only true God,</hi> and so it
may be applyed to the Son, and <hi>Iesus Christ whom
thou bast sent to be the only true God,</hi> which is signifyed
in that place and expressed 1 <hi>Iob. 5. 10. we are in him
that is true, even in his Son Iesus Christ, this is the true
God and eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Scriptures prove that there is one God
essentially in opposition unto all that upon any other
account are called Gods, not being Gods by essence,
all which do but assert that which is acknowledged
and hath been already proved in the former Chapter
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42394:22"/>
that there is but one God. In the argument which
W. P. draws from the fore-mentioned Scriptures, he
doth again show his ignorance, if he know not that
in several of these places the word <hi>one</hi> is not in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew;
or his deceitfulness, if he know and dissemble
it, and thinks by laying stress on the word <hi>one,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon the understandings of the vulgar, as if
there were some great force in his argument from
those places, when indeed they prove not in the least
what he alledgeth them for.</p>
            <p>But allowing W. P. to draw his argument from
those places, which do prove the unity of God;
though God be declared and believed to be but one,
it will not follow that the Divine nature doth not
subsist in three persons; the Scripture indeed doth
hold him forth as one God, but there it speaketh of
his essence; and yet withal doth elsewhere sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare that in this one essence there are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
persons; therefore we professe our beleif of the
Holy three (persons) as well as the Holy one God,
and both according to the plain Scripture before
urged for proof hereof, 1 <hi>Ioh. 5. 7. There are three that
bare record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the
Holy Ghost, and these three are one.</hi> But this distinction
of one God and three persons so plainly signifyed in
that Scripture, W. P. most impudently and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
calleth impertinent: and the reason he giveth
is, because <hi>God was not declared and believed incompleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or without his subsistance, nor did require homage from
his creatures as an incompleat and abstracted being,</hi> &amp;c.
which is a most egregions <hi>non sequitur,</hi> besides that he
fastneth that on us which neither we nor any Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Christian ever yet affirmed, <hi>viz:</hi> that God was
ever declared or believed incompleatly without his
subsistance, or as an incompleat and abstracted Being;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42394:23"/>
we know no such thing as the essence of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a subsistance; we know the Divine nature only
in the three persons, not abstracted from them, or
being any way out of them, and so God is not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
or worshipped without that which is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to himself, namely without his subsistance:
but the Divine essence is worshipped as subsisting in
the three persons, and so the blessed Trinity is not
our nor any mans fiction (as he impiously speaks,)
but this folish and absurd notion is his own fiction, or
the fiction of some of his Socinian brethren.</p>
            <p>After W. P's. vain attempts to refute the Doctrine
of the Trinity from the Scripture, he fronts his other
arguments with the swelling but false title <hi>Refuted from
right reason,</hi> false I say, for besides that what ever
attempt reason doth make for the refuting of any
Scripture truth, which is the object of faith, as this
is concerning the Trinity of persons in the unity of,
the Divine essence, it doth hereby discover it self to
be crooked and depraved reason, and the arguings
from it are called <hi>the perverse disputings of men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
minds and destitute of the truth. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 5. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the fourth verse; W. P. (who before had
charged me, for using Heathenish Metaphysicks in
disputing for the Truths of God, though my terms
were either Scripture-words, or carried Scripture-sense)
doth here most Heathenishly make use of
Metaphysical terms, in arguing against the truth, but
that so weakly, that his Argumentation is so far from
deserving the name of <hi>right reason,</hi> that more properly
it may be called <hi>no reason,</hi> as shall be made evident in
the Answer unto his Arguments, which if they seem
crabbed, it is not because of the strength, but because
of the obscurlty of them, for some of the phrases are
so uncouch, and his reasoning are so odly jointed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42394:23"/>
together; (to avoid that part of a Scholar, in putting
them into a Sylogistical form,) that it is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to find out what his cloudy brains conception
and meaning is than to give answer unto any of his
cavilling Arguments. And here having promised to
reply to his reason, p. 10. why he flatly denied my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
proposition, (in the Sylogism before mentioned)
wherein he argueth onely against the conclusion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to prove that there are not three subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences,
and the argument he useth being the same in
sense and scope with his first argument under that
which he calleth a Refutation from <hi>right reason;</hi> I
shall answer both together, and omit nothing in his
argument, that hath any show of cogency in it. His
argument is thus: <hi>No one substance can have three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
subsistances, and perserve its own unity,</hi> and not to
repeat all his words in the obscure way that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
his arguments, but to help him in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodizing
of them; his consequence is, that <hi>every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Subsistance will have its own substance,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<hi>that three distinct subsistances will require three
distinct substances;</hi> consequently, if the Doctrine of
the Trinity of subsistences were true, <hi>there would be
three Gods.</hi> And in his first argument he argueth that
<hi>every person is inseparable from it's own substance,</hi> and
therefore <hi>Father, Son, and Spirit either are three distinct
nothings;</hi> or if persons, <hi>then three distinct substances, and
consequently three distinct Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Answer:</label> If Substance be taken here for Essence (as
it must be,) otherwise it will conclude nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, then the proposition is most false: that <hi>no
one substance can have three distinct subsistances, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it's own unity;</hi> for though a created Essence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
finite, limited, and divisible, cannot be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
unto any more than one subsistance; yet it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42394:24"/>
followeth not that the divine Essence which is infinite
and indivisible, cannot be communicated to several
subsistances; neither doth W. P's. reason prove the
contrary, <hi>viz:</hi> that every subsistance will have it's
own substance, unlesse he can prove that each distinct
subsistence must necessarily have it's own substance,
(in God as well as Creatures) distinct from what the
other subsistences have; For one and the same sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
nature or substance may be, and is the substance
or nature subsisting in each person of the Trinity; and
so every subsistence hath it's own substance, and yet
not distinct, but one and the same, and therefore as
three Essences, so three Gods cannot be concluded
from hence; and though every person in the Trinity
be inseparable from it's substance, yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that the substance must be distinct in every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
though the persons be distinct, neither doth it
follow that the persons are either three distinct no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
(as W. P. blasphemously reproacheth the ever
glorious Trinity,) or three distinct Gods, because
the distinction is in regard of the personality, and not
in regard of the Essence, and whereas Pag. 10. he
seemeth to adde another reason, why the <hi>infinite God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
cannot subsist in three manners or forms,</hi> (he means
the three persons) <hi>because then one of them could not be
a compleat subsistence without the other two, and so parts,
and something finite would be in God; or if infinite, then
there would be three distinct infinite subsistences, and by
consequence there would be three distinct Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Answer:</label> Each person is a compleat person or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
without the personality or subsistence of the
other two, that is, distinct from the other two; but
not without the substance of the other two, which is
the same in all three, from whence it doth no ways
follow that parts or something finite is in God nor
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42394:24"/>
that there are three infinite subsistences, for though
in the concrete every subsistent is infinite, yet in the
abstract infinitenesse is not applicable to the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
of which more in answer to the second argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is to the same purpose with the close of
this page 13.</p>
            <p>
               <label>2. <hi>Arg.</hi>
               </label> The Divine persons are either finite or infinite;
if finite, then something finite is in God; if infinite, then
there would be three distinct infinites, and consequently
three Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Answer:</label> The Divine persons or subsistents are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in the concrete. The Father is infinite, the Son
is infinite, the Holy Ghost is infinite, the Father is
omnipotent, the Son omnipotent. and the Holy
Ghost omnipotent, and yet three are not three infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
or three omnipotents, but one infinite, one om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent;
and the reason is because these and all other
essential attributes agree to the persons, onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Essence from whence they flow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though person or subsistent in the concrete be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
omnipotent, and the like, in regard of the
Essence included therein; yet this can not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ascribed to the subsistence or personality, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though there be three distinct personalities, unto
which infinitenesse is not ascribed, yet there being but
one and the same single Essence in all the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
unto which infinitenesse is attributed, it doth
not follow that there are three infinites, or the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
that there are three Gods. But W. P. in his
arguings confoundeth the person with the persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
the subsistent with the subsistence, the concrete
with the abstract, taking the former for the latter;
but if he should understand the person in the abstract
for the personality or subsistence, then it is denied
that either finitenesse for infinitenesse doth properly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42394:25"/>
belong unto it; it being altogether improper to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the property of the nature, to the subsistence of
that nature in the abstract; as immortality and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
do not agree to any particular subsistence as
such, but to the nature in which it doth subject; or to
instance in the subsistence of a man, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to ascribe the properties that belong to him
unto his subsistence, to say that his subsistence in the
abstract is either a learned or unlearned subsistence, a
great one, or a small one; a white one or a black one;
and so it is improper to say that either of the persons
in regard of their personality, or subsistence, are finite
or infinite, but in regard of their Essence in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
they are infinite, which Essence being but one
in each, there is but one infinite, and by consequence
but one God.</p>
            <p>
               <label>W. P's. third Argument is this:</label> If each person be God,
and that God subsists in three persons, then in each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
there are three persons or Gods, and so from three they
would increase to nine, and so in infinitum.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Answer:</label> W. P. confoundeth again the concrete
and the abstract together; it is granted that each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is God in the concrete, and that God (not in the
concrete but in the abstract God essentially or the
Essence of God,) doth subsist in three persons, from
whence, it doth not at all follow that there be three
persons in each person, but that there are three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in one Godhead, and so his consequence of the
persons encreasing to nine, and <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> is both
ridiculous and absurd.</p>
            <p>
               <label>W. P's. fourth argument</label> being built upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that we deny the persons to be infinite, which
we have affirmed, it proveth nothing, and therefore
requireth no answer; and I have not leasure to trace
him with remarks upon his absurd arguings upon a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42394:25"/>
false supposition, which he conceived we might
have.</p>
            <p>
               <label>W. P's last argument is this:</label> If these three distinct
persons are one, then they are not incommunicable amongst
themselves, but so much the contrary to be in the place of
one another, for if the onely God is the Father, and
Christ be that onely God, then is Christ the Father, and so
round.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Answer:</label> Though the three persons be one, that
is, one Essence, yet it doth not follow that they are
not incommunicable amongst themselves, and that
they are in the place of one another. Here W. P.
confounds again the persons and the personalities, the
concrete and the abstract; the persons are in the one
Essence or Godhead, and agree among themselves,
yet these persons in regard of their personal proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
are incommunicable to each other; the subsistents
are the same in regard of the Essence, the subsistences
are not the same; and therefore though the only God
be the Father, and Christ that only God, yet it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not that Christ is the Father, because Christ is
the onely God Essentially, that is, hath the Nature
and Essence of God, and so hath the Holy Ghost, and
yet both are personally distinguished from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The next thing that followeth under that head I
need not repeat, it being nothing against us, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Divine nature to be inseparable from
the three persons, and communicated to each, and
each person to have the whole Divine nature; and
likewise the Father to be in the Son, and Son in the
Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 10. and the Spirit in the Son; and
we know no absurdity that followeth from hence,
these persons being in each other by reason of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
which is the same in every of them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42394:26"/>
the consequences he draweth from the denial
hereof we have nothing to do with, so that W. P.
more justly may take shame and ridiclousnesse unto
himself.</p>
            <p>W. P's. reasonings against the ever Blessed and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Trinity falling to the ground, let us look into
his <hi>Information and caution</hi> which he subjoyns, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any thing of truth and congency be there to be
found. There he pretends to inform the Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the original of this doctrine, and first he
would have the Reader assure himself, that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from Scripture nor reason. But I suppose most
Readers will be more wise and cautious than to build
their assurance upon the bold assertions, and crude rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
of this presumptuous and Heaven-daring dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant.
That this doctrine is not from reason, will
be easily granted, yea that it is contrary to corrupt
reason, such as W. P. hath plainly declared it self to
be; it is a mystery which flesh and blood cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal,
but the Father which is in Heaven; yet so as it
is not contrary to right and truly sanctifyed reason.
And whereas W. P. asserteth that it is not from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he must not think to impose this upon Christians
who have look't into the Word, any more than what
he further asserts as to the first three hundred years,
upon those that have look't into the writings of the
ancient Fathers. The Doctrine of the Trinity is
as old as the Scriptures themselves, and hath been
proved out of the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> and other
places of the Old Testament, by <hi>Mr. M. Chap.</hi> 4th.
and abundantly out of the New Testament <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.
The Readers that search and believe the Scriptures,
will never believe <hi>W. Penn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Doctrine of the Trinity came into the
world above three hundred years after the first
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42394:26"/>
preaching of the Gospel <hi>by the nice distinctions, and
too daring curiosity of the Bishop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>is one of
W. Pen's loud lyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was indeed opposed by <hi>Arius</hi> about that time,
who denied Christ to be equal to, and of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
with the Father, yet not first opposed by him,
but by other hereticks before him; one of whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
(if not worse;) W. P. hath in his Pamphlet
sufficiently proved himself to be; and if it were oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
before, sure it was known before, so that W. P. might
have derived the pedigree of his abomination and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy,
(if he had consulted Church History) higher
than from <hi>Arius.</hi> The miserable end of which bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemour
and dishonourer of the eternal Son of God,
who voided his entrails with his excrements in a place
of easement, and so died by an unheard of death,
should caution all others from offering the like indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
unto the Son, as to disrobe him of his Deity, and
number him amongst creatures like themselves, lest he
stretch forth the arm of his Almighty power, and
make them feel him (if they will not otherwise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him) to be God by bringing some remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
destruction upon them in this world.</p>
            <p>W. P. <hi>Thus was it conceived in ignorance brought forth
and maintained by cruelty,</hi> &amp;c. What a strange compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is here of impudence and folly! thus boldly and
blasphemously to assert this great fundamental truth
to be conceived in ignorance and maintained by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and yet in the next breath he owns persecution
to be as well on the <hi>Arians</hi> side, as the other, and so
by his own confession the <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrine was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by cruelty, and with how great cruelty and
bitternesse, those which look into the Histories of
those times may easily see. To say nothing of W. P's.
so proud censuring so eminent a champion of Jesus

Christ as <hi>Athanasius</hi> was, when he shall produce the
grounds of his suspecting the Creed, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>The Athanasian Creed,</hi> to be the Results of Popish
School-men, it will be time enough to answer that
Clause.</p>
            <p>Next <hi>W. P.</hi> cautioneth the Reader to take heed of
<hi>embracing the Determinations of prejudiced Councils,</hi> &amp;c.
and yet giveth no reason why the Reader should be
prejudic'd against them, except the belying of the
Scripture testimony be a reason, which I suppose was
the ground of their Determinations in this point; and
no further are any Councils to be heeded than they do
agree in their Results with the Scriptures. I hope
the Reader will rather take heed of embracing such
damnable Doctrine as this peremptory Dictatour
would impose upon the understanding of the weak;
and indeed weak they must needs be, and blinde too,
and either renounce the Scriptures, or their own sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that will suffer their assent to these great Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-truths,
to be in the least enfeebled by any thing
that this raw Disputer alledgeth for the maintaining
of this Blasphemy and Heresie, or oppugning our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and never to be shaken Foundations.</p>
            <p>And here <hi>W. P.</hi> who had discovered before his skill
in Logick, by arguing against the conclusion of my
Syllogism, telling us he opposed the <hi>Minor;</hi> his skill
in the <hi>Original Tongues,</hi> in noting the <hi>Holy ONE</hi> in
great letters to prove Gods Unity, when the word <hi>One</hi>
is not to be found in the Hebrew Text; doth make a
third attempt to show something of a Scholar, but is
as unhappy as before, and as grosly as in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
attempts, doth signifie to all that understand
Learning, that he is a proud boaster, and pretender
to that which he never attained unto. He telleth us
the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity was never believed by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42394:27"/>

<hi>with many other, who appear wholly forreign to

these Authors <hi>W. P.</hi> maketh mention of, with others
who writ in those times, will finde both his lies to be
very great, and his reading to be very little, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

            <p>The Doctrine of the Trinity is plainly enough to
be gathered from several passages in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> Lib. 1.

            <head>CHAP. VII. The Doctrine of the satisfaction of Christ, the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
of the real and glorious Trinity asserted and proved.</head>
            <p>IF the doctrine of the ever glorious Trinity or three
persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in one God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
had been overthrown by W. P. or could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
shaken by the <hi>Sociniant,</hi> which with all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
they can device, in vain, they do endeavour,
if he or they could prove (which they never can) that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42394:29"/>
there is but one person in the God-head; then it
would follow that Christ could not be the eternal Son
of God, the second person of this glorious Trinity (as
<hi>W. P.</hi> most blasphemously, stileth him the second person
of the imagin'd Trinity,) and by consequence the
Doctrine of satisfaction depending upon this person,
would fall to the ground, and might by invincible
argument be refuted, it being impossible for any meer
finite creature to make plenary satisfaction to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Justice of God; But the Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
being established by Scripture Testimony, and
the Lord Jesus Christ proved to be God equal with
the Father, the Doctrine also of satisfaction depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
upon this second person of the real and ever glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Trinity, will remain firm against all <hi>Quaker</hi>
and <hi>Socinian</hi> attempts to overthrow it: and before I
give answer unto the objections and cavils against this
Doctrine. I shall breifly assert and prove the doctrine
by the Word of Truth in the Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>W. P. in his title <hi>The impossibility of Gods pardoning
offin, without a plenary satisfaction refuted,</hi> seemeth to
infinuate that he denyeth onely the impossibility of
Gods pardoning sin without satisfaction; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
readeth his arguments shall finde them to be the
very same, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> use against Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
it self, and that he plainly denyeth the thing;
therefore I shall not concern my self, to enquire what
God could or might do, if he pleased; but what
he hath decreed and determined to do, and declared
in the Scripture to be his will; and here I affirm</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That God never doth, nor will, nor can pardon any,
sinner without satisfaction made to his offended Iustice for
their sins.</hi> And that because his holiness, righteousness,
and truth, obligeth him to take vengeance upon all
that have transgressed his Law; the Lord is so Holy
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42394:29"/>
that he <hi>hateth all the workers of iniquity, Psal.</hi> 5. 5. and
what is Gods hatred, but <hi>Percatum pro merito suo velle
punire, as Bradsh. de Iust.</hi> his will to punish sin and
sinners according to their desert? His Justice doth
engage him <hi>by no means to clear the guilty, Exod.</hi> 34. 7.
and his truth would be enfringed, if he should not
<hi>curse every one that centinueth not in all things which are
written in the Book of the Law to do them, Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>That no sinners themselves by any thing they can
do or suffer in this life, can give satisfaction unto Gods
Iustice for their sins.</hi> And the reason is because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
good they do is no more than duty, wherein also
they must have Divine help to enable them, and when
they have done their duty, their works are but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and they unprofitable servants, and this can make
no compensation for their faults before, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10.
<hi>When have done all the things commanded, say we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
servants,</hi> &amp;c. Our righteousnesses are as filthy
raggs, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. And what ever sinners suffer in this
life, it is infinitely short of what their sins have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
Gods Justice is infinite and requierth an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
satisfaction; sinners are finite and therefore there
is no porportion between any thing they can bring,
and what Gods Justice doth require for satisfaction.</p>
            <p>III. That Iesus Christ being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> God and Man
in one person, was onely fit to make, and hath actually made
satisfaction unto Gods infinite and offended Iustice for the
sins of Men.</p>
            <p>It was necessary that the person that should make sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
should be man, because none but a creature
could suffer, and none but a man could be a fit High-Priest
to offer up Sacrifice, and make reconciliation
for the sins of Men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. It was necessary he
should be God, because none but God so neerly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
could strengthen the manhood, to bear up under
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42394:30"/>
such a pressure of wrath, and break thorow such suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as had taken hold on Christ for mans sins; and
if he had not been God as well as man, the sufferings
and satisfaction would have been but finite, and so no
proportionable satisfaction, but through the infinite
dignity of his person, the satisfaction is of infinite
value. That Christ hath actually made satisfaction unto
Gods Justice for the sins of men, is the great Doctrine
which I shall prove from the Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. We read in the Old Testament, of the many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
which were offered up unto God, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing
of his wrath, and the procuring remission for
mens sins, all which of themselves could not in the
least attain that end, for the Apostle telleth us plainly,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4. that it was not possible that the blood of
Bulls and Goats should take away sin; but these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
did typically refer unto the Sacrifice, which
Christ should offer of himself unto God, whereby sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
should be made unto God, and remission
obtained for men.</p>
            <p>2. In the New Testament, the Scriptures are plain
which prove the satisfaction, which Christ made to
Gods Justice, for mans sin by his death on the Cross.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Math. 20. 28. The Son of Man came to give his life a
ransom for many.</hi> and 1. <hi>Tim. 2. 6. He gave himself a
ransom,</hi> the price which Christ did pay for the ransom
of men, doth evidently prove that it was for satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
From what did Christ ransom many, if it were
not from the vengeance of God, which their sins did
expose them unto? and how could his giving his life
ransom them, if he did not hereby give satisfaction
unto the demands of Gods Justice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom. 5. 6. In due time Christ died for the ungodly,</hi>
and how did Christ die for the ungodly? was it onely
for their good, and so give them an example? was it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42394:30"/>
not in their stead, and that by his death in their
room he might satisfy offended justice? we are said
to be reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
v. 10. And could this be, if he died only for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?
Can we say that we are reconciled to God
by the death of any Saints, whose death is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary?
Was not Christ an innocent person? And
would the Father have deliver'd him up unto death
had it not been in the room of others? He died for
sin indeed, not his own, he being perfectly free from
sin, but for our sins.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Pet. 2. 24. Who his own self bare our sins in his
own body on the Tree:</hi> And how did he bare our sins,
but by bearing the punishment due for them? <hi>He
was wounded for our transgressions, &amp;c. Isa.</hi> 53. 5.
And wherefore did he bear the punishment of
our sins, but that he might give satisfaction unto
God's justice?</p>
            <p>Rom. 3. 25. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,
through faith in his blood, &amp;c.</hi> so 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 2.
Christ was set forth to be a propitiation or propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory
sacrifice, which doth plainly imply that God
was angry with sinners, and that Christ by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory
sacrifice of himself, did appease God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
by giving satisfaction here by unto his Justice.
And therefore also Christ is called an offering and
sacrifice. Eph. 5. 2. <hi>As Christ hath loved us, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
himself for us an offering unto God for a sweet smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
savour,</hi> and <hi>Heb. 9. 22. He appeared to put away
sin by the sacrifice of himself, &amp;c.</hi> How could Christ
put away sin by this sacrifice, if this sacrifice were
not for satisfaction?</p>
            <p>Gal. 3. 13. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
of the Law, being made a curse for us.</hi> How could
Christ redeem us from the curse of the Law, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42394:31"/>
deliver us from the wrath to come, part of the curse
due to us for sin, if he had not (by being made a
curse for us, and thereby undergoing the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
our sins deserved) made satisfaction unto
Gods justice?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>It is only through this satisfaction which Christ
hath made, that remission of sins, and reconciliation
unto God is attained, or attainable by any of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men.</hi> The three former propositions are the
reason of this last, which doth necessarily result
from them, and in this the Scripture also is clear,
Eph. 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his
blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of
his grace.</hi> So Col. 1. 14. and Verse 20. <hi>Having
made peace by the blood of his Cross, by him to reconcile
all things to himself.</hi> Rom. 5. 10. <hi>If when we were
enemies we were reconciled unto God by the death of
his Son.</hi> My small Tract will not permit inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in urging all the Scripture-arguments, which
may be brought to prove this great Doctrine of
Christs satisfaction, nor to vindicate the Scriptures
that prove it from all Socinian exceptions. If any
would read more largely this subject handled in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the Socinians, Dr. <hi>Owen his Mystery of the
Gospel vindicated, and Socinianisme examined,</hi> I would
commend to them as a Book of great worth and use
in this day, when Socinians begin so much to put
forth the head; as also for a lesser and later piece, I
would commend to them, Mr. <hi>Ferguson's Iustification
only upon a satisfaction.</hi> The Texts I have quoted
and urged, may satisfie the sober and considering
Christian, who I believe doth wonder at <hi>W. P</hi>'s.
confidence in asserting that there is nothing in the
Scripture that doth look towards a satisfaction.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. An Answer to W. Ps cavils against the Doctrine of
Christs Satisfaction.</head>
            <p>THe Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us, 2 Pet. 3. 16. <hi>Of
some unlearned &amp; unstable persons who wrest the
Scriptures to their own destruction. W. P.</hi> hath plainly
discovered himself to be such a one whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
doth speak of, as will appear in the review of
the Scriptures he alledgeth against Christs satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
wherein I shall shew how they are wrested
by him.</p>
            <p>Exod. 34. 6, 7. <hi>The Lord passed by, &amp;c. proclaimed
The Lord, the Lord God gracious and merciful, keeping
mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression
and sin.</hi> If <hi>W. P.</hi> had read and considered, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the following words in the same 7. verse.
<hi>And will by no means clear the guilty;</hi> the beames of
Gods justice and holiness might have shined with
such a lustre in his face, as that he should not have
dared to offer such an affront and indignity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and incur the guilt which God there threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
he will not clear men of (without the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a satisfaction to his offended justice) to set
up his mercy and love as inconsistent herewith;
and what blasphemy as well as absurdity is this to
say, that God could not be gracious, should he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
the utmost farthing, when he is so much the
more gracious unto men in exacting nothing from
them, but taking his whole satisfaction at the hands
of Christ, whom of free grace he sent into the
World to dye, and hereby to satisfie his justice
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42394:32"/>
in their stead. God indeed proclaims himself to
be gracious and merciful, whereby he declares what
he is in his Son, whom he had before promised to
give, and in whom alone all Nations of the Earth
that ever should obtain his favour were to be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
2 Chron. 32 9. <hi>If you turn again to the Lord,
the Lord is gracious and merciful, &amp;c.</hi> I deny the
consequence from this Scripture, that Gods remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is grounded on Mens repentance, but his grace
and mercy through Christ is the reason of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
of sinners to repent and turn unto him,
as is evident from that Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. that
we are made accepted only in the beloved, without
whole satisfaction and intercession, the repentance
and reformation of sinners would not in the least
avail for remission and acceptation.</p>
            <p>Neh. 9. 17. <hi>Thou art a God ready to pardon, &amp;c.</hi>
Isa. 55. 7. Let the <hi>wicked forsake his way, &amp;c.</hi> Let
<hi>him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy on
him, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity.</hi>
Mic. 7. 18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> These and the like places prove
God to be gracious and merciful, ready to forgive,
and that he hath engaged himself to do it: And
who is there that denyeth all this? But where is
the inconsistence between this and Christs satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Yea, where would have been the exercise
of any grace and mercy towards us, if it had not
been for Christs satisfaction? He hath promised to
pardon sin in the new Covenant, but was not that
Covenant ratifyed with the blood of Christ? and
doth not the Apostle tell us plainly, Heb. 9. 22.
<hi>That without shedding of blood there is no remission?</hi> So
that our opinion, or rather belief is not <hi>strange,</hi>
but his consequence is so; and his denyal of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42394:32"/>
doth <hi>destroy the design of the Covenant of grace</hi>
(which cannot be of force without it) and not our
asserting of it; And though <hi>God be exalted upon the
Throne of his mercy</hi> to forgive sinners, that by faith
are interested in the merits and satisfaction of his
Son; yet <hi>W. P.</hi> and all <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> which
deny Christs satisfaction, and thereby <hi>ipso facto,</hi>
exclude themselves from all share in it, will finde
at the length, that <hi>God is exalted upon the Throne of
his judgment,</hi> to take vengeance upon them all, that
will not be beholding to his Son to appease his
wrath. Math. 6. 12. <hi>And forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors.</hi> From whence <hi>W. P.</hi> argueth,
<hi>that which is forgiven is not payed.</hi> I answer, that
which is forgiven is not payed by us, but it is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Christ, and it is free to us, though it cost
Christ dear. He further argueth, that we are to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
without satisfaction, and therefore God doth;
I answer, that God doth forgive without satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from us; and as those that do injure us, we
ought to forgive them freely without satisfaction,
because vengeance doth not belong to us, but unto
the Lord, who in our room, as it were, will have
satisfaction one way or other from them, and hath
threatned to recompence every injury upon their
heads; so the Lord doth freely forgive us, and yet
so, as that still he doth preserve the honour of his
justice in taking satisfaction from Christ.</p>
            <p>Joh. 3. 16. <hi>God so loved the World, that he gave
his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, &amp;c.</hi> This Scripture is nothing to
<hi>W. P</hi>s purpose, but strongly against his errour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if we be saved only by faith in Christ, than it
must need be in Christ, as a sacrifice for sin, as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
the Law and bearing Gods wrath, and by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42394:33"/>
consequence, as making satisfaction: I grant that
Gods love of benevolence, or electing love is not
the effect of Christs satisfaction, from whence it was
that he sent his Son into the World for our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but his love of complacency is the effect of
Christs satisfaction, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 17. He is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with us only in Christ.</p>
            <p>Rom. 8. 31, 32. Carrieth the same argument,
and therefore may have the same answer, neither
is it any absurdity to say that God should be at the
charges of his own satisfaction. Job 33. 24. <hi>I have
found a ransome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Act. 10. 34. <hi>Whosoever believeth in him shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
remission of sins.</hi> This place is grosly wrested
and perverted by <hi>W. P.</hi> since remission is through
faith in Christ, called <hi>faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3. 25.
And how in his blood, but as his blood is the price
of our redemption? but <hi>W. P.</hi> calleth faith only a
believing of his testimony; yea, he addeth obeying
his precepts, as a concurring cause of remission,
which is rank Popery, importing justification by
works.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. That God himself reconcileth sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to himself by Christ is most true, and most
strongly argueth against his errour, and for our
cause; for how doth God reconcile us to himself
by Christ, but by the blood of his Cross? <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20.
And what doth this import, but satisfaction by this
blood, without which there is no reconciliation?</p>
            <p>Eph. 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his
blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of
his grace.</hi> This place is an invincible argument for
Christs satisfaction, redemption through Christs
blood on our part, clearly importing satisfaction
through Christs blood on Gods part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42394:33"/>
this with other places, which <hi>W. P.</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
against the truth, do prove to be for the truth,
and cut the throat of his own tenents, who most
childishly (God infatuating of him) bringeth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the destruction of his own cause. His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
that grace is not justice, because forgiveness
is according to the riches of Gods grace is very
weak, for though grace be not formally justice, yet
grace and justice are very well consistent, as Rom.
3. 24. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace, &amp;c.</hi> vers. 25.
<hi>To declare his righteousness for the remission of sins,</hi>
vers. 26. <hi>That he might be just, and the justifier of him
that believeth.</hi> As God is just (in respect of Christ)
he pardoneth them that believe, because of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
though all be free grace in regard of us.</p>
            <p>1 Pet. 5. 10. <hi>But the God of all grace that hath
called us, &amp;c.</hi> This hath the same consequence, as
the other, and therefore needs no other answer.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Iob. 4. 9. In</hi> this was manisested the love of
God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have granted it is out of love that God
sent his Son, but it doth no way follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Son did not make satisfaction to his justice;
and therefore though <hi>W. P.</hi> in enumerating some
of the ends of Christs mission into the World, doth
reach no higher than his setting him forth as a
perfect example, which is the <hi>Socinian</hi> doctrine,
yet the Scripture teacheth us otherwise, that the
great end of Gods giving his Son, and Christs
coming and laying down his life, was to purchase
remission and salvation for us. Therefore though
<hi>W.</hi> P. telleth us the Scripture is silent in reference
to the doctrine of satisfaction, it is a sign his Eares
are dull, and his Eyes closed, if he have not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of this doctrine, undeniably proved from
the Scripture; and it is not our asserting, but his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42394:34"/>
denial of Satisfaction that doth reflect Indignity
upon God, and is repugnant to the Nature, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and Tendency of the second Covenant.</p>
            <p>The Absurdities and grosse consequences, as <hi>W. P.</hi>
termeth them which follow from this Doctrine, do
shew the absurdity and grossness of this mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions;
to the first I have shewn the consistency
of Grace and Satisfaction. To the second I have
given an undeniable reason why man must in some
cases forgive without Satisfaction, and God will
not; but how absurd and Blasphemous is it (this
supposed) to say man is more capable of extending
mercy than God, when Gods mercy to us (which
this satisfaction of Christ doth make way for the
exercise of) is so great that all our mercies are
Cruelties in comparison, and the Lord takes no
more Satisfaction from those he extendeth his
especial mercy unto, then we do which freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
private injuries. The third Absurdity (as
he calleth it) in words we own it to be sound Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
which appeareth to be gross to none but such
whose reason is depraved, and therefore <hi>I</hi> am sure
<hi>W. P.</hi> can have no right reason to refute this doctrine.
He argueth, <hi>If Christ satisfied Gods justice, he did it
either as God, or as Man; or as both God and Man.
But he did it not as God, nor as Man, nor as both
God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore he hath not satisfied Gods justice at all.
I</hi> shall not here argue against his conclusion, but
deny his minor asserting, that Christ did satisfie
Gods justice as God-man; and it doth not follow,
if his proofe should be good that he could not do it
alone as God, or alone as Man, that therefore he
could not do it as God-Man; neither is it true, as
be obscurely phraseth it, that <hi>where two middle po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42394:34"/>
are inconsistent with the nature of the end for
which they are brought, their Conjunction doth rather
augment than lessen the difficulty of their accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
For as the Soul cannot see without the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for want of an Organ, nor the Body cannot see
without the Soul for want of a visive faculty, yet
the man can see, and so both Soul and Body can
do that in Conjunction which neither can do in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
Therefore though God separately can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
satisfie, (from a better reason than any he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
because he cannot suffer, and man separately
cannot satisfie, because the satisfaction would not
be of Infinite value, yet as God-man he satisfied,
the Manhood suffering, and the God-head putting
a value upon it.</p>
            <p>The consequences, which he further deduceth
from this Doctrine of Satisfaction, he very fitly
stileth <hi>irreligious and irrational;</hi> but I deny they are
deducable from this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>To the First, Who do ascribe more Grace and
Mercy to God, then we who do apprehend it in his
Son? How then do we say it is unlawful and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
he should be gracious?</p>
            <p>To the Second, What compaltion or force
doth this Doctrine inser to be laid upon God in
the exercise of his justice? when he doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his justice freely, as he doth love his Image, in
his people freely, yet both are necessary, because
natural, and neither forced and compeld by any
external Agent.</p>
            <p>To the Third, What a wretched audacious sinner
is this! to fasten unworthiness upon God, if he
punished an innocent person, and required satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
where nothing was due; when the Son did
voluntarily undertake to be our surety, and was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42394:35"/>
punished as bearing our sins, and satisfied for us,
and not himself; what unworthiness in God to
change the persons, and put his Son to death to
save us alive? Is it not unworthiness and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
baseness in any of the Children of men, to
open their mouths against God for this? And if it
were unworthy to punish an Innocent person, and it
is certain Christ was punished, if he were not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for us to satisfie Gods justice, it will follow
from <hi>W. P's</hi> words, that Christ should be a sinner
(which is Blasphemy) and that he was punished
for his on sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. P</hi>'s fourth Consequence is abominably
false, and the contrary true, this Doctrine doth the
best answer the real intent of Christ's Life and
Death.</p>
            <p>The fifth Consequence is as impious as unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
when the Love and Compassion of the Father
and the Son is alike; the one in sending, the other
in coming to redeem lost Sinners.</p>
            <p>The sixth Consequence is ridiculous, that Christs
satisfaction should rob God of the gift of his Son
for our Redemption; who seeth not (but some
blind Moles) that our Doctrine doth ascribe God
the greatest glory for this gift?</p>
            <p>The seventh consequence is childish, and a shame
that a man that pretendeth to any brains should
mention it, That though Christ hath satisfied for
us, the debt remaineth still to Christ, as if when
one man dischargeth for another, the debt should
still abide.</p>
            <p>The eighth Consequence is so abominable, that
it might make the Reader tremble and wonder,
that a Worm, whom the Lord could easily crush,
should open his mouth thus against the glorious
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42394:35"/>
               <hi>Iehovah,</hi> as to say, that it Gods justice be satisfied by
Christ, then Man is no ways beholding, or the least
Obliged to God; as if we were not beholding to
God for giving his Son, for accepting this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
for giving us a share therein; are not we
beholding to God for all, though Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
all?</p>
            <p>The ninth Consequence, <hi>that God should hereby
lose all power of enjoyning Godliness, and punishing
Disobedience,</hi> doth not in the least follow; for God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is enjoyned upon all, though not in order to
the meriting Eternal Life, and God threatneth to
punish the Disobedient, whom if they continue to
the end in their Impenitency and Unbelief, he will
punish eternally in Hell, notwithstanding this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Christ in which they have no share;
but Believers that are interested herein, God, as he
hath brought them out, so he hath engaged to keep
them out of a course of Disobedience; and if they
do transgres in some particulars, he hath threatned
to chastise them, which is not inconsistent with
Christ's satisfying his justice for their sins, since
Chastisment is not an act of Vindicative Justice,
but Fatherly Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. P.</hi> concludes with a <hi>Caution,</hi> wherein he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
to perswade People, not to entertain this
Principle concerning Christ's Satisfaction, which is
in effect, to perswade them to cast off the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, and turn <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahomitans;</hi> for
what is there in the Christian Religion, if there be
not Satisfaction by Christ, the Foundation of all
other priviledges? Take away Christ's Satisfaction,
and you take away Gods Favour, Remission of sin,
Peace of Conscience, Immunity from the Curse and
Condemnation of the Law; Take away Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42394:36"/>
then the Word and Spirit and we are false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
thereof; then is our preaching vain, and your
Faith also is vain, then you are all yet in your sins,
then you must all of you of necessity be damned
and punished eternally. Take away Satisfaction,
and you take away Christ; and you take away all.
And therefore let not <hi>W. P.</hi> think to easily to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
people to let go this Principle, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
doth it, hath made Shipwrack of his Faith,
and of necessity must fall into the Ocean of Gods
Wrath, which none can escape without this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>And therefore I would here caution <hi>W. P.</hi> with
more reason then he doth the people, and speak to
him according to the Words of the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi>
to <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. 21. 22, 23. I perceive thou
hast no part in this matter (namely Christ's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which thou deniest) neither is thy heart
right in the sight of God; but hereby evidently
dost declare thy self to be in the Gall of Bitterness,
and the bond of Iniquity; yet repent of thy
wicked Blasphemies, and Abominable heretical As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions,
if perhaps the thoughts of thy heart may
be forgiven thee.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. The Iustification of the Vngodly, by the imputed
Righteousness of Christ asserted and proved.</head>
            <p>HAving proved and vindicated the Doctrine of
Christ's Satisfaction from the Cavils of <hi>W. P.</hi>
The Doctrine of Justification by Christ's impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Righteousness, doth evidently follow from it;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42394:36"/>
for since there can be no Remission of sin (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Justification) without Satisfaction to Gods
offended Justice, as hath been proved; and since
this Satisfaction cannot be given to God by Sinners
themselves, and Christ only hath given it, which
also hath been proved, there is no way imaginable
how we can be justified, but by the Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness to us, 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>For he hath
made him to be Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we
might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi> As
Christ was made sin for us, though Innocent, by the
Imputation of our sin to him, for which he was
condemned and punished: So we are made the
Righteousness of God in him, though guilty, by the
Imputation of his Righteousness unto us, whereby
we are justified. And what other meaning than
Iustification by Christ's imputed Righteousness can
that Scripture have, which speaketh of the <hi>Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Man, unto whom the Lord imputeth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
without Works,</hi> Rom. 4. 6. That this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
spoken of, is Iustification, appeareth from
the scope of the place which is to prove the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Iustification, and the following words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
do evince it, <hi>vers. 7. Blessed is the Man whose Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
are forgiven, &amp;c.</hi> That this Righteousness is
not a mans own is evident, because it is a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
without Works, and then whose Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
can it be, but the Righteousness of Christ?
and that this Righteousness is imputed are the
words of the Scripture, therefore the proof is
firm, that we are justified by the Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness. Unto which Scripture, <hi>I</hi>
may add for the further clearing and Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Doctrine of Iustification by Christ's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Righteousness, this Argument grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Scripture.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42394:37"/>
               <list type="syllogism">
                  <item>If there be no other way for Sinners to be iustified, but by
Faith in Iesus Christ, then Iustification is by the Imputed
righteousness of Christ.</item>
                  <item>But there is no other way for Sinners to be justified,
but by Faith in Iesus Christ.</item>
                  <item>Therefore Iustification is by the imputed Righteousness
of Christ.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Consequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Faith justifieth only with a respect to Christ's
Righteousness without us called therefore Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
by Faith, distinguished from our own
Righteousness, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. and how is this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
by Faith, but as it is applied by us, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by God to us through Faith; Faith cannot
justifie as a work, because all works are excluded
in the matter of Justification, therefore it must
Justifie as an Instrument applying Christ Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which being without us, can be made ours no
other way than by Imputation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> that Sinners are justified only by
Faith in Jesus Christ, is as clear as any Doctrine in
the whole Book of God; it being the design of
the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> to prove this expresly, in the first
part of Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the second
and third Chapter of his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi>
How many times doth he say, we are justified by
Faith without Works? and how strongly doth he
Argue the necessity of Iustification this way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the universal Guilt upon Mankind, and
deficiency of Righteousness inherent, therefore
that they must seek for a Righteousness without
themselves, which is Christs Righteousness, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they can be justified only by Faith; which
Faith he putteth in opposition to all works, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Ceremonial and Morral Law; but also to
all Works wrought in Faith (which are works still)
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42394:37"/>
such as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Works, and <hi>Davids</hi> Works were,
who yet were not justified upon the account of any
of their Works, that all Boasting might be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. And the Apostle telleth us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>vers.</hi> 5. That God justifieth the <hi>Vngodly,</hi> no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
being the Subjects of Gospel Iustification but
as <hi>Vngodly,</hi> that is as having sinned, and as having
no Works, no Righteousness of their own to
procure Justification for them; The sence is
that God findeth every one Ungodly, Guilty, Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
whom he doth justifie freely by his Grace,
through the Redemption and Righteousness of
Christ; but he doth not leave them Ungodly;
where he removeth the guilt of sin, he removeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the filth of sin, Iustification and Sanctification
being inseparable Companions; and though Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
be altogether distinct from Sanctification,
yet it is never without Sanctification; which if
<hi>W. P</hi>'s cloudy Brains had rightly apprehended, it
would have given an answer, in the making of
them, to most of his Objections, which he hath
brought against this Doctrine, where he argueth
from the Concomitant unto the Cause, and his
deductions or most pittiful <hi>non sequitur's.</hi> I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to have run thorow them all, and given parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Answers to them, but that Mr. <hi>Danson</hi> who
is concerned to reply to something in his Book,
Intendeth to answer him in this Point, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
to give a Synopsis of <hi>Quakerisme</hi> in other points
(besides these three) Namely, their asserting:
1. <hi>Good Works to be the Meritorious cause of our
Iustification. 2. That a State of Freedome from
sin is attainable in this life. 3. That there is a
leight in every Man, sufficient to guide him to salvation.</hi>
4. <hi>That the Scripture is not the Word of God, nor a
standing rule of faith and life. 5. That there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42394:38"/>
of the body. 6. That there is no need or use of
Ordinances, Baptisme, Lords Supper, &amp;c.</hi> The book
he intendeth will be small, but the use of it may be
great, (in this day when the <hi>Quakers</hi> are so busie to
gain proselites) for the establishment of Christians
in the truths and ways of God.</p>
            <p>In <hi>W. P</hi>'s conclusion, by way of caution, he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, he doth not disown Father, Word, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to be one, but he disowneth them to be three
Persons, which hath been proved out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that the Trinity (as he saith) hath not a
foundation in the Scripture; that its original was
three hundred years after Christianity was in the
World, hath been proved to be false. What he
speaketh concerning the Council of <hi>Sirmia, That
the controversie concerning the Trinity should not be
remembred, because the Scriptures made no mention
thereof,</hi> is also falsely alledged; for by that very
Council the Doctrine of the Trinity is expresly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
as a chief article of the Christian faith; and
the distinction of Persons, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, plainly implyed in the Anathema, which
was pronounced upon those that asserted they were
but one Person; that which <hi>W. P.</hi> citeth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in which this Council was
heterodox, as it might well be, when so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
by the Emperor <hi>Constantius,</hi> who himself
was infected with Arianisme. But <hi>W. P.</hi> should
have looked into the Councils more ancient and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique,
than the <hi>Sirmian,</hi> namely the first <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi>
Council, which condemned the <hi>Arian</hi> heresie,
blasphemously denying the Son to be coeternal and
coessential with the Father: the first <hi>Constantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi>
council which condemned the <hi>Macedonian</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
denying the Deity of the Holy Ghost. The
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42394:38"/>
Council of <hi>Ephesus Chalcedon,</hi> who with other appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
oecumenical Councils, generally assented to the
Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Consubstantiality of
the three Persons.</p>
            <p>What <hi>W. P.</hi> further addeth concerning the occasion
of Idolatry, is groundless; the scandalizing of Turks,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no wonder, when the preaching of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
was such a stumbling-block of old. After he
confesseth that Christ offered unto God a Satisfactory
Sacrifice, and yet he denieth Christs Satisfaction and
Justification by his <hi>imputative</hi> Righteousness; all
which three Doctrines being Fundamental, establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Word of Truth, <hi>W. P</hi>'s attempts to subvert
them are in vain, and have discovered him to be both
a Blasphemer and an Heretick.</p>
            <p>Since I began my Answer to <hi>W. P.</hi> there came to
my hands a Pamphlet, subscribed by <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi>
styled <hi>The Quakers Challenge,</hi> wherein amongst others
he challengeth me at two Weapons (as he calleth
them) to Fast seven days and seven nights; and to
Wake seven days and seven nights, and that hereby
tryal shall be made who are in the truth.</p>
            <p>Though the Pamphlet be ridiculous, yet I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to let it pass without any remark; and my
Answer is, when the Lord hath appointed these ways
for tryal of the Orthodox and Hereticks, I shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
them; but not finding any such Command, or
Warrant in the Word to forbear Food or Sleep so
long; but on the contrary, because it is a tempting of
God, and a breach of the sixth Commandment, which
requireth all lawful endeavors for the preservation of
our own life, as well as the lives of others, therefore
it would be a God-provoking sin, to endanger self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther
by such Weapons. The Scripture Instances
of Fasting many days together were miraculous, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42394:39"/>
not for our imitation; others I have heard of that
have lived as many days together as he speaketh of,
without meat, or drink, or sleep, but they have been
distracted people, amongst whom this man deserveth
to be numbred: and if I should answer him in the
way he challengeth, I should be accounted by the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as mad as himself. His Lie he venteth concerning
me, is refuted already in my Narrative.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="10" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. X. The Call, and Exhortation.</head>
            <p>HAving asserted and proved the three great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the <hi>Trinity, Satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
denyed by <hi>W.</hi> P. I shall further add by way of
premise to the <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Exhortation</hi> (what was before
intimated) that these three are great Fundamental
Truths of the Christian Religion, necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in order to Salvation; the unbelief and denyal
of which, will bring unavoidable damnation.</p>
            <p>1. The Doctrine of the Trinity of distinct Persons in
the Unity of the Divine Essence is a Fundamental
Truth, because the Godhead in the three persons is
the proper object of saving Faith and right Worship,
and those that do not savingly believe, and rightly
worship God, cannot possibly be saved; besides, the
denyal of the three distinct persons in the Godhead,
doth necessarily inferr the denyal of the co-eternal
co-essential Deity of the Son and Holy Ghost, which
is Blasphemy and damnable Heresie, so accounted by
the most ancient and authentique Councils, and by the
true Church of God in all Ages.</p>
            <p>II. The Doctrine of Christ's Satisfaction and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42394:39"/>
by his imputed Righteousness, are Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Truths also, without which there can be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
Reconciliation, Remission, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no Salvation.</p>
            <p>This being premised, I shall now apply my self first
to the Quakers, and then to others.</p>
            <p>To <hi>W.</hi> P. and other Quakers who believe these and
other Quaker damnable errors, I shall propound these
four Queries, which I shall answer according to truth.</p>
            <p>
               <label>
                  <hi>Que.</hi> 1.</label> Do you know what you are?</p>
            <p>1. <hi>You are strangers to Christ,</hi> (whatever your fancy be
of Christ within you) and I am confident that none of
you all that believe these errors, have had experience
of the new birth and forming of Christs image upon
your hearts, since there never is a work of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and uniting the souls of any to Christ, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
them in such darkness and error, as you are left
and bound up in: No, had you been ever truly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
you would have been humbled and emptied
of your selves, you would have seen your selves lost in
your selves, and your need of Christs satisfaction and
imputed Righteousness, without which you would
have been assured that there is no possibility Gods
anger should be appeased, and your souls saved; It is
not turning Quaker, that is turning from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan to Christ: but on
the contrary it is a turning from light to darkness, and
from Christ to Satan, and what will be the issue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
not remission of sins and salvation, but the fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of guilt upon you, and eternal destruction.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>You are enemies to Christ;</hi> and I believe that Jesus
Christ hath scarcely greater enemies under the Sun
than you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are greater enemies to Christ, than
those who deny his eternal Deity? (as I have proved to
be the plain consequence of W. P's words, and of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42394:40"/>
denial of the Trinity) who are greater enemies to
Christ, than those that deny his Satisfaction and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by his merrits? who are greater enemies to
Christ, than those that oppose his faithful Ministers
and Embassadors, and that lye in wait to deceive and
mislead Christians? you are enemies to his truths, and
ways, and ordinances, and cause, and interest, and
Ministers, and true Disciples; and all this with Christ
in your mouths, and I am confident the Lord doth
hate and abhor you for such hypocrisy.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>You are Children of the Devil;</hi> and the works of
your Father you do, and will do; you are his more
close and subtle agents, that in a seeming more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
way, do all you can to enlarge the bounds of his
Kingdom; and like Satan when the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of God assemble themselves to worship their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
some of you will appear amongst them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
them; I wonder how you can have the face to
pretend Religion, when it is so apparent that you are
more than ordinarily acted by the Devil to oppose it.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>You are Serpents and a generation of Vipers,</hi> full of
deadly poyson, poyson in the head, the poyson of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
errours, from whence poyson doth drop forth
at your lipps and into your pens; you are Serpents
putting forth your stings where ever you come, hissing
at all those who are not of your brood: If our Saviour
were on Earth to preach to you as he did to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,
he would with as great reason thus stile you, as
he did them.</p>

up in some of the deepest mysteries of his Kingdom;

lower form, but you that I speak to are arrived to some
proficiency, and are well instructed in some of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42394:40"/>
chief principles of the Devils Catechism, so that you
are able also to instruct others in the Devilish
Doctrines you have learnt of him. Your master is a
lyer from the beginning, and the Father of lyes, and
you have learnt and believed some of his lyes, as if they
were certain truths.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>You are in the Devils arms;</hi> he huggeth you so
fast, that it is more difficult to pluck you from thence
than the most wicked and profane.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>You are in the Devils chains,</hi> whereby he is lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you captive at his will, they are chains of darkness
and errour, which he hath upon you, whereby he is
dragging you towards the regions of eternal darkness</p>

                  <hi>Que:</hi> III.</label> Do you know what you are doing?</p>
            <p>1. <hi>You are dishonouring God;</hi> in dishonouring the
Son, you dishonour the Father, in reproaching Gods
Embassadours, you reproach the King that sent them;
you are spots, and blemishes to Religion, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it ridiculous to the prophane world.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>You are murdering your own Souls,</hi> embruing your
hands in your own blood, you are poysoning, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
killing your selves; and you are some of the
greatest soul-murderers of others, of any that live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth.</p>

               <label>
                  <hi>Que.</hi> IV.</label> Do you know whether you are going?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are going the certain way to Hell;</hi> your way is
not in the common rodewith others, but it is a by-way
and dark path, in which you often stumble and fall,
and at length it will meet with the great rode of the
world, at the Gate of Hell, in which you will as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
enter at last, if you go on in this path, as <hi>Cain</hi>
and <hi>Iudas,</hi> that are there already. And here I might
sound a peal of Judgement in your ears, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn
you of the wrath to come (to escape which, one
day, you would give ten thousand worlds for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42394:41"/>
in Christs Satisfaction and imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when it will be too late,) but for the present
most of you are Judgement-proof and Sermon-proof;
and so prejudiced against us Ministers, who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
as Watch-men by the Lord, to forewarn the
people of their danger) that our reproofsand warnings
are rejected, and railing language is the return of
our admonitions.</p>
            <p>Yet in the name of the Eternal and Living God,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, whose I am, and whom
I serve in the work of the Ministry, I call upon you
that are eluded by the Quakers, and have not as yet
sucked in all their poysonous principles, which they
have cunningly concealed from you, but now have
made manifest to the world, that without any further
delay, you would come out from amongst them, and
seperate your selves; that you would save your selves
from this untoward generation; that you would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
your selves as a bird out of the snare of the fowler,
and as a Roe out of the hand of the hunter, praying to
the Lord to grant you repentance, (for going amongst
them) unto the acknowledgement of his truths (which
they deny) and that you may be recovered out of the
snare of the Devil, who hath hitherto led you cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
considering that if you go in this way, your steps
will certainly take hold on Hell; O then hasten,
hasten, poor captiv'd deluded Souls! hasten for the
Lords sake, for your poor souls sake, hasten from these
Soul-murderers unto the Lord Jesus the Soul-Savior,
and into the ways of life and salvation, which he hath
prescribed in his word.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I shall in a word bend my speech unto all
(as yet undeluded) Christians, by way of exhortation
to stedfastness in the truths and way of the Lord, and
as they desire their salvation to beware of the Quakers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42394:41"/>
damnable Doctrines. There are two ways, whereby
God doth try his people, the one is by persecution,
and other is by heresie, and the Apostle telleth us,
1 <hi>Co.</hi> 11. 19. that it is necessary heresies should, arise that
they which are approved might be made manifest;
this later way doth sometimes discover more unsound
Professours than the former; the approved and elect
of God I am sure will stand, and if any go out from us,
it is a sign they were not of us, for if they had been of
us, no doubt they would still have continued with us,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. And here I shall again repeat what I did
before assert, that it were better for you to drink a cup
of poyson, than to suck in the Quakers damnable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
Take heed of this infection which is worse than
poyson and plague, more dangerous and destructive.
For this end labour to get on the girdle of truth, let
the truths of the word be fastned about the loyns of
your minds, that is, get the principles of Religion
fixed in you; which that they may, mingle them with
faith and love, and live under the powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of them: And that you may be the further off
from danger, avoid the Company and Meetings of
the Quakers, (lest coming thither out of novelty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Gods way, you be left by God, and as too
many have been, you be caught by the Devil in the
snares which there he layeth) and come not neer the
Tents of these enemies of Jesus Christ, lest you be
swallowed up in the same ruine which is coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. If you would save your selves from their
plagues, you must keep your selves out of their ways.
I shall shut up all with the exhortation of the Apostle
<hi>Peter,</hi> having told believers of the unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
who did wrest the Scriptures to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
(as do the Quakers,) he exhorteth them,
2 Epist. 3. cap. 17. 18. <hi>v. Yee, therefore beloved, seeing ye
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42394:42"/>
know these things before, beware lest ye also being lead away
with the errour of the wicked fall from your own stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord
and Saviour Iesus Christ;</hi> Now <hi>to God the Father, to
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, be glory and honour,
both now and for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
