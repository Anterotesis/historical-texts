            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Preface Introductory ADDRESS'D <hi>To the very Ingenious and Learned Doctor </hi>J. L.</head>
            <p>I Willingly acknowledge, that divers Phyſicians have Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and Learnedly, and ſome of them very Eloquently, ſet forth the praiſes of the Blood, and manifeſted how noble and excellent a Liquor it is, But I muſt beg their pardon if I doubt whether their Writings have not better celebrated its Praiſes, then diſcover'd to us its Nature. For, tho the laudable curioſity
<pb facs="tcp:42323:3"/>
of the Moderns has acquainted us with ſeveral things not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to us by the Ancients, yet, if I miſtake not, what is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known of Humane Blood, is as yet imperfect enough, and conſiſts much more of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than Experiments; being ſuggeſted far more by the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> that Nature her ſelf has afforded Phyſicians, than by Tryals induſtriouſly made, to find what ſhe will not, unſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by Art, diſcover. I will not be ſo raſh as to ſay, that to mind (as too many Anatomiſts have done) the Solid parts of the Body, and overlook Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the Fluids, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Blood, were little leſs
<pb facs="tcp:42323:3"/>
improper in a Phyſician, than it would be in a Vintner to be very ſolicitous about the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of his Cask, and neglect the conſideration of the Wine contain'd in it. But though I will not make ſo bold a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, <hi>yet</hi> when I conſider how important a part of the Humane Body, the Blood is; and that <hi>as</hi> when it is well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and does orderly move, it conveys nouriſhment and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and motion, and in a word health to the reſt of the living Engine: So the Maſs of Blood being either vitiated, or (which is very often the effect of that Depravation) diſorderly mov'd, is the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>divers,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:42323:4"/>
the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of moſt Diſeaſes, whoſe cure conſequently depends main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the rectifying of the Blood when (I ſay,) I conſider theſe things, I cannot but think it an Omiſſion, that ſo important a Subject has not been more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and induſtriouſly enquir'd into. But I hope you were not in earneſt, when you ſolicited <hi>me</hi> to repair that Omiſſion. For you know, I have not the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to pretend to be a Phyſician. And being none, I muſt want both the Skill and many Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, wherewith a Man that were profeſſedly ſo, would be advantag'd. And <hi>though</hi> I deny not that many years ago I propounded to ſome Ingenious
<pb facs="tcp:42323:4"/>
Phyſicians a Hiſtory of the Fluid parts of the Body, ſuch as the Humours and other Juices, and alſo the Spirits of it; and did particularly draw up a ſet of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, and make divers Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments in reference to the Blood, <hi>yet</hi> thoſe Papers being ſince loſt, and a long Tract of Time, and Studies of a quite other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, having made me loſe the Memory of moſt of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; I find my ſelf unable to contribute any thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to your laudable deſign. And as all the ſearch your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands oblig'd me to make after my Papers, has hitherto prov'd fruitleſs, ſo they having been written when I had far more
<pb facs="tcp:42323:5"/>
Health, Vigour, and Leiſure than I now have, and when my Thoughts were much more converſant with Medicinal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; any thing that I ſhall now preſent you about the Blood, will not only be extremely ſhort of what ought to be ſaid, but will alſo be ſhort even of what, if I miſtake not, I did ſay of it. But yet all this is ſaid, not to excuſe me from obeying you at all, but to excuſe me for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſo unskilfully. For, ſince you will have me ſet down what I can retrieve about Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood, you ſhall receive it in the following Paper; which conſiſts of Four Parts. The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof contains a <hi>ſet</hi> of <hi>Titles</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42323:5"/>
(which I call <hi>Of the Firſt Order,</hi> for Reaſons to be given you in the Advertiſements about them) towards the Natural and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory of Humane Blood, which may direct thoſe that want better Guides, what Enquiries to make, and to what Heads to refer, what they have found by Obſervation or Tryal. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Part contains but bare Titles (whoſe Syſteme yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I look upon as likely to make the uſefulleſt part of the enſuing Papers) and becauſe I have neither leiſure nor Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to anſwer all or moſt of the Titles, I thought fit in a couple of Subjects, namely the <hi>Serum</hi> of Humane Blood, which is a
<pb facs="tcp:42323:6"/>
               <hi>Natural,</hi> and the Spirit, which is a <hi>Factitious</hi> part of it, to give ſome inſtances of what I had thoughts to do on others; and propoſe ſome Example to thoſe that may be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practis'd in drawing up Natural Hiſtories, than the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and courſe of my Studies of Natural Things permitted me to be. And what is ſaid on theſe two Subjects, makes the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> Part of theſe Papers. As for the other Titles (of the Hiſtory of the Blood) I contented my ſelf, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with my haſte, to ſet down what occur'd to me in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Order wherein they offer'd themſelves; without ſcrupling
<pb facs="tcp:42323:6"/>
to mingle here and there among the Hiſtorical Notes, ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments that I formerly but deſign'd, as Tryals that might prove Luciferous, whatever the event ſhould be. This Rapſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of my own Obſervations makes one of the Four Parts, and the <hi>Second</hi> in Order, of what your Commands embolden me to offer you at this time. And I ſhall be very glad to be ſo happy as to find, that by doing a thing, that I am wont to do ſo delightfully as to obey you, I have by breaking the Ice contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſomething to ſo noble and uſeful a work as <hi>the Hiſtory of Humane Blood.</hi> About which, that I may not make the Porch much
<pb facs="tcp:42323:7"/>
too great for the Building, I ſhall add to this Preamble no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but theſe two Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; of which the Firſt ſhall be, That it is not my deſign in theſe Papers, to treat of my Subject, as it may be conſider'd (to borrow a School Phraſe) <hi>in fieri,</hi> which would have oblig'd me to trace the Progreſs from the reception of Aliments at the Mouth, to the full Elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which were to write the Hiſtory of <hi>Sanguification</hi> as well as that of Blood; but to treat of this Liquor as 'tis compleatly elaborated, and that too, not as 'tis form'd in the Veſſels of a living Body, but as it is Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated, and let out by the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet;
<pb facs="tcp:42323:7"/>
ſuch Blood alone being that on which I had ſome opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make Tryals, and to this firſt Advertiſement, I ſhall ſubjoyn as the Second, That in the following Papers I have, as the Title intimates, treated but of ſuch Humane Blood, as was taken from ſound Perſons; <hi>both</hi> becauſe being no profeſs'd Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, I had not the Opportunities of Examining that of Sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons moleſted with particular Diſeaſes, (which yet would much conduce to a compleat Hiſtory of the Blood;) <hi>and</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Knowledge of the Nature of the Blood, when 'tis rightly conditioned, is neceſſary to thoſe that would diſcern, in
<pb facs="tcp:42323:8"/>
what particulars, and how far it deviates in the Sick, according to that generally received Axiome, <hi>Rectum est Index ſui &amp; Obliqui</hi>: On which account the Scheme of Titles drawn up for the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Healthy Blood,</hi> may ſerve for a direction to any that would write the <hi>Hiſtory of Morbid or Depraved Blood</hi> in any particular Diſeaſe, as a Pleuriſie, a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ague, the Dropſy, the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For having compared the Qualities and Accidents of this vitiated Blood, with thoſe of the Blood of Sound Men deliver'd in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Syſteme of Titles, 'twill not be difficult for a Phyſician to find, to what heads he is to
<pb facs="tcp:42323:8"/>
refer thoſe things that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably recede from ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Healthy Blood. And theſe Receſſions or Depravations, with perhaps a few Additions of ſome Peculiarities, if any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, will make up the Hiſtory of the Blood as 'tis wont to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated in that Particular Diſeaſe, one General Admonition ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing (if that it ſelf be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary) to make the Reader take notice, that in all other Points the Blood of Perſons ſick of that Diſeaſe is not unlike that of thoſe that are Healthy.</p>

            <head>THE Natural Hiſtory OF Humane Blood. PART. I. <hi>Containing A Liſt of Titles for the Hiſtory of </hi>Humane Blood<hi>. To which are Premis'd ſome Advertiſements about them.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat the Scope and meaning of the enſuing Scheme of Titles, (and divers others that I drew up for differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects) may be the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, I muſt lay down in this place ſome paſſages borrowed from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42323:10"/>
the (unpubliſh'd) Eſſay or Letter I wrote to Mr. <hi>Oldenburg</hi> (Secretary to the R. Society) about the way of compile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Natural Hiſtory. I propos'd then in that tract three ſorts of Heads, to which the particulars that might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr, and properly belong to the Hiſtory of the Subject to be treated of, whether a <hi>Body,</hi> or a <hi>Quality</hi> or an <hi>Operation,</hi> or a <hi>Proceſs,</hi> (that is, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive change) might conveniently be referred. Theſe diſtinct ſets of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks or Enquiries I call <hi>Orders,</hi> Ranks or <hi>claſſes,</hi> and becauſe to each of theſe ſets, it was found by Experience, that things of ſomewhat differing nature were to be referr'd, as <hi>Queries</hi> more properly So called, <hi>Propoſitions</hi> either Affirmative or Negative, and other Heads of Natural Hiſtory, that are leſs fit to be reduc'd to either of the two former Sorts, then to be look'd upon as Subjects to be treated of. For this reaſon, I ſay, among others, I thought fit to comprize all theſe ſorts of particular Topicks, or Articles or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42323:10"/>
Inquiry (to uſe our illuſtrious <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erulam</hi>'s phraſe) under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and comprehenſive name of <hi>Titles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt Order</hi> or <hi>Claſſis</hi> of theſe Titles, I would have to conſiſt of ſuch as occurr'd readily enough to my thoughts, upon the firſt deliberate view, or general Survey, of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be treated of. For 'tis ſcarce to be expected that at the firſt attempt a man ſhould be ſo clear ſighted, or ſo happy, as to pitch, or light upon as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and compendious ways of Inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and as good Methods of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting, and delivering what is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as when a ſtudious Enquiry has furniſh'd him with better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations about the Subject he is to treat of; and therefore it may ſuffice for the <hi>firſt</hi> time, that the mind do as it were walk round the Object, it is to contemplate, and view it on every ſide, obſerving what differing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it will that way afford, (as when a Painter or an Anatomiſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42323:11"/>
looks upon a mans Body, firſt when the Face and Belly are towards him, then when the Back and other hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parts are ſo) and that he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Limits and Boundaries of it, and of the moſt Eſſential and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Parts, or other things that belong to it. Wherefore in the firſt <hi>Uaſſis</hi> of Titles, one need not be too ſcrupulous about the enumerating, and marſhalling the Particulars referable to it, but may be more Solicitous, that the Titles ſhould be various, and comprehenſive enough, than that they ſhould be nicely Methodical, and much leſs than that they ſhould be accommodated to any particular <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</hi> And becauſe, even at the firſt deliberate view, ſome (though perhaps very few) of theſe Titles may appear conſiderable, and fertile enough to deſerve, that there ſhould to each of them be refer'd two or a greater number of Subordinate, and more particular Topicks; I thought fit for methods ſake to call the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42323:11"/>
Titles, that is thoſe of the firſt <hi>Claſſis, Primary Titles,</hi> and the Subordinate, <hi>Secondary ones.</hi> [Of which Diſtinction a Notable Inſtance will be met with in what is hereafter delivered, about the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood. All the Sixteen Titles together with the <hi>Appendix,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Epiſtolary Diſcourſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Secondary Titles, referable to that Primary one, which is the Eighteenth in the firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> of the Hiſtory of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood.]</p>
            <p>When by Reading, Conference, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and (which is here mainly to be conſider'd) the Tryals ſuggeſted in the Topics of the firſt <hi>Claſſis,</hi> or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Naturaliſt has receiv'd the beſt and fulleſt Information he can procure, of all that belongs to the Subject he is to treat of, he may then proceed to frame another ſet of Titles, which may be called the <hi>Second,</hi> or (if no other interpoſe) the laſt Order or <hi>Claſſis</hi> of them, which, if he have been diligent and any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42323:12"/>
thing proſperous, will be much more copious and better rang'd than the <hi>firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For now divers things will in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood appear to belong to the Subject of the Hiſtory, which were not at firſt taken notice of to do ſo, yea per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps were not at all thought of, and the further diſcovery made of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing treated of, may direct the Hiſtorian to range his To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, or Titles in a better Order, and more natural Method, than thoſe of the <hi>firſt Claſſis.</hi> And, which is a thing of far greater Moment, divers, and perhaps moſt, of the Particular Titles will appear to be of greater extent, or more comprehenſive, than they were formerly conceived to be: ſo that a Particular Title may well be thought fit to be branch'd into many Subordinate Topics, or Articles (which we lately called Secondary Titles) ſome one of which may perhaps com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize as many Experiments, or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, as 'twas at firſt gueſs'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42323:12"/>
would appertain to the prime or more general Title itſelf. And from the Materials orderly drawn together under this laſt ſet or <hi>Claſſis</hi> of Titles, with ſome requiſite changes in point of Method, and Connexions, and ſome Additional things as Tranſitions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the help I ſay, of ſuch Alterations and Additions, the Particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the laſt Order or <hi>Claſſis</hi> conſiſts, may be digeſted and framed into an Inchoate Natural Hiſtory of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they have relation to; I ſaid, an <hi>Inchoate Hiſtory,</hi> to intimate, hat even after all that has been already done, I think it too probable that the Hiſtory will hereafter appear to have been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begun then compleated, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, &amp; the Induſtry of skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men being ſo very fertile, that the knowledg of the Subject of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will from time to time be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, and ſo the Hiſtory it ſelf may be enlarged and corrected, but will not, I fear in many Ages, if ever it be at all, be made abſolutely perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42323:13"/>And on this occaſion I muſt add That when the Subject to be treated of is very comprehenſive or very Difficult, as the <hi>Generation of living Creatures, Magnetiſm, Fermentation, Gravity,</hi> &amp;c. it may be very uſeful, if not almoſt neceſſary, to interpoſe between the Titles of the <hi>Laſt</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Firſt Claſſis,</hi> a ſet of Titles that may be call'd of the <hi>middle</hi> Order, or <hi>Claſſis.</hi> For the framing whereof the Hiſtorian is conſiderately and narrowly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurvey the Nature of the Subject, and make a heedful Collation of that, and of the ſeveral Notices attain'd by his Endeavours to furniſh the differing Titles of the firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of Particulars. For by this Collation there will in likelihood be ſuggeſted to him, many new To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics of Enquiry, and Hints, which added to the former will deſerve to have a new <hi>Claſſis</hi> fram'd conſiſting of Articles more copious, and various than the Firſt, and fit to be rang'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42323:13"/>
in another Order. It may perhaps illuſtrate what I have been ſaying and am going to ſay, about the ſeveral <hi>Claſſes</hi> of Titles, if on this occaſion I ſhall add, that a Natural Subject being propoſed to be Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically treated of, there may occurr ſomething like what happen'd to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in reference to the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> For at their firſt entrance into it, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the other Spyes took a tranſient view of the Country, and could bring back but an unaccurate account of it, together with a little of the moſt remarkable Fruit. But upon a ſecond Expedition, the Spyes were furniſhed with fuller Inſtructions, and order'd to direct their Reſearches to the anſwering of a great many particular Articles of Enquiry; their Induſtry to anſwer which produced in Methodical Tables or Schemes, a far more copious and diſtinct Chorography, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the fruitfull land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſcarce to be expected that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42323:14"/>
at the very firſt time the <hi>Titles,</hi> whether Primary or Secondary, of a natural Hiſtory ſhould be made ſo comprehenſive, and be ſo skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounded, as not to need to be either enlarged, or reformed by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Thoughts, and a further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the Practical knowledge of the Subject treated of. I therefore thought it neceſſary, or at leaſt uſeful, to ſubjoin to the firſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Titles of each of the Natural Hiſtories, I delineated, a <hi>Mantiſſa</hi> or <hi>Appendix,</hi> that ſhould conſiſt of two Sorts of Particulars; viz, <hi>Paralipomena</hi> and other <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda,</hi> whereof the <hi>firſt</hi> ſhould contain ſuch things, as may be properly referrable to ſome one or more of the <hi>Titles,</hi> (either Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, or Secondary,) diſtinctly enumerated in the Scheme of the Hiſtory, and were but by haſte or overſight kept from having place among them. The <hi>other</hi> conſiſts of new Particulars, that,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42323:14"/>
after the Hiſtory was written, were Suggeſted by further Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries; whether theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars did directly belong to any of the preceding <hi>Titles,</hi> or might only in a general way contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomewhat to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or illuſtration of the Subject.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42323:16"/>I do not think it unlikely that ſome of the Titles of our intended Hiſtory of Blood and a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the particulars that you will meet with in it, may ſeem frivolous to you at the firſt peruſal. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in proceſs of time, theſe very things will not appear impertinent, nor be found uſeleſs. For 'tis a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as of more difficulty, ſo of more utility, than men are wont at firſt to diſcern, to find out, and bring into a narrow compaſs, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of particulars relating to one Subject, and preſent them as it were at one view, to the Intellect to act upon And there is many a particular Experiment o<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Obſervation which upon the firſt, or perhaps the 2d reading may ſeem but ſlight or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, which afterwards is found capable of being made good uſe of by thoſe who ſeriouſly intend, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to attain, not a maim'd or a Superficial, but a deep and ſolid knowledge of the Subject of their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42323:17"/>
Enquiry. And to ſuch Indagators many particulars, that at firſt were paſt by unregarded, becauſe there appeared no direct uſe or obvious application of them, will be found ſerviceable to hint new <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> or Theories, or to illuſtrate them, to examine thoſe of others, and if they be true, to confirm them, and if er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, to confute them. For, to be ſhort, the knowledge of matters of fact cannot but be ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and probably more ways than one, ſerviceable to a Naturaliſt, that has Sagacity and Judgment to make a right uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Having already advertis'd you, that the following Papers treat of none but Extravaſated Blood, ſince I had no other at command, to make my Tryals upon; I preſume you will not wonder that you find not in the Scheme of Titles ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Proceſs</hi> of Sanguification, or the <hi>Series</hi> of changes that the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſucceſſively undergoes, from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42323:17"/>
its being taken in at the mouth, till it be turned into Blood.</p>
            <p>Of the motions of the Maſs of Blood, and particularly its Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Of the Chyle, <hi>Lympha,</hi> and other Liquors, that are ſuppos'd to enter and mingle with the Blood.</p>
            <p>Whether the Humours, Phlegm, Gall, and Melancholy, be really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Blood, as conſtituent Parts of it.</p>
            <p>Whether ſome other ſubſtances may not with as much reaſon be admitted into the compoſition of the Blood.</p>
            <p>Theſe, as I was ſaying, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome other Titles ſhould have been added, if my Deſign had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further, than to treat of Blood ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Body, and I wiſh that you, who by your Abilities and Profeſſion are far better qualify'd than I for ſuch a work, would fill up theſe, Titles and add them, ſome as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries, and others as <hi>Appendices,</hi>

            <p>Perhaps it may not be altogether impertinent to add, that I had once ſome Thoughts of a Deſignation of a Natural Hiſtory of other Liquors of a humane Body, as well as the Blood; I mean ſuch as the Gall, the <hi>Lympha,</hi> the <hi>Succus Pancreaticus,</hi> Spittle, Urine, Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I quickly perceiv'd it was fit for me to reſign ſuch Tasks to Phyſicians; only I ſhall here Subjoin, as a ſmall <hi>Specimen,</hi> a ſet of Titles for the Hiſtory of Urine, which though by reaſon of its Affinity in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards to Blood, it muſt have many Titles in common with it, yet ſome will be differing according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Subject; which (Liquor) I therefore pitch upon, becauſe I dare own to you, and I do it not without Premeditation, and having wrought on Urine longer than on a Blood itſelf, that I think Urine to be a Liquor, which, as much deſpis'd as it is by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, deſerves to be ſolicitouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd

               <p>SInce Humane Blood does in Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation afford a not inconſiderable quantity of Oyl, one may well ſuppoſe it to be a Combuſtible Body: but every one will not think it ſo Inflammable, as upon Tryal purpoſely made I found it to be. For having taken a piece of Humane Blood dryed till it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pulverable, and held it in the flame of a Candle, it would take fire, and afford a Flame much like that which excited it, burning with a crackling noiſe (much like that of Sea Salt caſt into the Fire) and here and there melting. But the Inflammable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch dryed Blood did much better appear, when putting together 4 or 5 throughly kindled Coals, we laid on them a piece of dry'd Blood
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42323:27"/>
of the bigneſs of a ſmall Nutmeg, or thereabouts, for this yielded a copious and very yellow Flame, and if it were ſeaſonably and warily blown from time to time, as the <hi>Effluvia</hi> dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into ſmoak, it would by theſe frequent re-accenſions continue to yield clear and Yellow Flames of no contemptible bigneſs (in proportion to the Body that yielded them) much longer than one would expect. And during a good part of this Deflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Blood appeared as it were to fry upon the Coals, and in good part to melt into a Black ſubſtance almoſt like Pitch. There was alſo a crackling noiſe produc'd, like that which Chymiſts obſerve when they decrepitate common Salt.</p>
               <p>Theſe Experiments for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance were repeated. But I ſhewed another Inſtance of the Inflammable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Blood, that was ſomewhat ſurpriſing. For, having caus'd ſome Humane Blood (being part of the ſame that was made uſe of in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42323:27"/>
foregoing Tryals) to be ſo far dry'd that it was reducible to fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I took ſome of this Powder that had paſt through a fine Search, and caſting it through the Flame of a good Candle, the grains in their quick Paſſage through it took fire, and the Powder flaſh'd, not without noiſe, as if it had been Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin. This Experiment was reiterated with ſucceſs.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42323:28"/>
according to their Sex, Age, Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the ſame perſon it may be varyed by the time of the year, and of the day, and by being drawn at a greater or leſser diſtance from a Meal, and by divers other Circumſtances. But beſides all theſe things there is a Mechanical difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if I may ſo call it, that attends the work we are ſpeaking of. For the Blood begins to coagulate ſo ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is emitted, that 'tis ſcarce a practicable thing to weigh it hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically, either by immerſing into it a Solid Body heavier than it ſelf or by weighing the whole Blood in Water; the former way being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>fibrous</hi> part of the Blood, and the latter by the <hi>Serum.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame account it is ſomewhat (though not ſo much) difficult to compare with any accurateneſs, the weight of Blood, with that of water in a Glaſs, as alſo for other reaſons which he that ſhall conſiderately go about to try it, will quickly find
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42323:28"/>
But however, ſince it may be a thing of conſiderable uſe, to have ſome tolerable Eſtimate, though nor an exact one, of the difference in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity between Water and Humane Blood, by which ſo many parts of the Body, conſiſtent as well as fluid, are by various <hi>changes</hi> of Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both conſtituted and nouriſhed. I ſhall ſubjoyn a Tryal, that this conſideration invited me to make as well as I could. We took the Blood of a ſound man emitted all at one time, and put the whole maſs of it, as well the Serous as the Fibrous part, into an oblong Glaſs, of the fitteſt ſize and ſhape we could light on amongſt ſeveral. And have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffered the Blood to reſt till all was ſetled, and the many Bubbles vaniſhed, we carefully mark'd with a Diamond that narrower part of the Glaſs, which the upper ſurface of the Blood reach'd to. Then we weighed the Glaſs and the Blood in a very good Ballance and having
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42323:29"/>
poured out the Blood (for other uſes) and waſhed the Glaſs, it was filled with common Water to the lately mentioned Mark, and then weighed again in the ſame Ballance; afterwards the Water being poured out, the Glaſs alone was Counterpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſame ſcales, and its weight being deducted from each of the two formerly mentioned weights, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was found to have weighed ℥ix. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vi. 50. <hi>Gr.</hi> And the Blood (equal to it in bulk) to have weigh'd ℥x. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. 4. <hi>Gr.</hi> So that the difference between them being <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. 14. <hi>gr.</hi> the Blood was beavier than ſo much Water, but about the 25th part (for I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Fraction) of its own weight. But this Experiment, for the Reaſons above intimated, deſerves to be reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated more than once.</p>

For having weighed out ſome Grains of a reſublimed Salt of Humane Blood, that ſeemed very pure, the Odour was ſo ſtrong and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42323:31"/>

And yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days after, if I miſtake not ſeven or eight, I found the Salt ſo little diminiſh'd as to its ſenſible bulk, (for I did not think fit to weigh it) that it ſeemed to have waſted but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and yet what remained had ſcarce any odour at all that I (whoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of ſmelling are acute enough) could well perceive, notwithſtanding which this White Body retain'd a ſaline Taſt; and a little of it being for tryals ſake put upon a ſolution of common Sublimate in fair Water, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily turned it White.

quantity, perhaps ſome pounds of Blood, and the Calcination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſo obſtinate a fire, that a mans patience may eaſily be tired before the Operation be perfected, or by the ſmall appearance of Calcination that the Caput Mortuum will afford him after having been kept Three or Four hours in the fire, he may be induc'd to conclude that all the Salt of Blood is volatile in a good Fire, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it will yield no fix'd Salt.</p>
               <p>But having by an obſtinate Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation obtain'd between Three or Four Drams of this Salt, I found not that it was a fix'd Alcaly or a Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate Salt, but rather as I expected, of the nature of common or Sea-Salt, thô not without ſome little diverſity which diſcover'd itſelf by ſome nice Tryals. But as to the main our Salt was ſcarce diſtinguiſhable from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin Salt, for it taſted very like it, a ſtrong Solution of it did not readily (for I was not at leiſure to wait
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42323:40"/>
long for the Event) turn Syrup of Violets green or greeniſh, nor (which was more) Precipitate a Brick Colour or browniſh Yellow, no more than a white Powder, out of Solution of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate. I alſo found by Tryal that the Spirit of Salt did not diſſolve it as an Alcaly. And to theſe ways of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining it I added three others, that I had not known us'd for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and which had all three of them ſuch Events as were expected, for having put ſome Oyl of Vitriol upon a little of our dry Salt, it did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, as I had divers times obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd it to do upon common Salt, corrode it with great violence, and with much foam and ſmoak. We alſo drop'd a little of our fix't Salt diſſolved in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled water, upon a Solution of fine Silver made in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> whereupon immediately enſued a Precipitation of a copious white Powder.

exactly the Proportions of the differing Subſtances, that may be chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically obtain'd by vulgarly known Operations, from a propoſed parcel of Humane Blood; eſpecially ſince I think that 'tis without ſufficient grounds that Chymiſts do univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take it for granted, that in Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations carefully made, the matter that paſſes into the Receiver, or at leaſt aſcends, together with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, or <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> amount to juſt the weight that the entire Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had before Diſtillation. Which Paradox I endeavour to make highly probable, if not certain, in another Paper, that belongs not to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Collection.</p>

               <hi>The Third Part,</hi> Containing Promiſcuous Experiments and Obſervations about the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of healthy Mans Blood; (Whereof the firſt may be referr'd to the Sixteenth, and moſt of the reſt to the Seventeenth of the Titles of the firſt Order.)</head>
            <p>SInce the Diviſion that Nature her ſelf makes of Humane Blood, when being let out of the Veins, it is ſuffer'd to refrigerate and ſettle, is, into a <hi>fluid</hi> or <hi>Serous,</hi> and a <hi>conſiſtent</hi> or <hi>Fibrous</hi> part; and ſince 'tis found that oftentimes the former of theſe Parts either equals or exceeds the latter in quantity; I thought it might probably much conduce to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcovery of the Nature of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42323:45"/>
Blood, to make ſome Tryals upon the <hi>Serum</hi> by it ſelf, of which it will not, I hope, be uſeleſs to give a ſummary account in the following promiſcuous Obſervations, that were made only upon the <hi>Serum,</hi> or Whey of the Blood of Perſons preſum'd to be ſound.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Having ſeparately weighed the <hi>Serum,</hi> and the Conſiſtent Part of a parcel of Humane Blood, obtained at once by a ſingle Phlebotomy, we found the latter to weigh ℥iv + <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>viſs. and the former ℥iij + <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made the like Tryal with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parcel of Blood drawn from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, the Fibrous part weighed ℥iv + <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>v, and the <hi>Serum</hi> four ounces. But thô in both theſe Tryals the weight of <hi>Serum</hi> that appear'd in one Maſs, was inferiour to that of the Fibrous Part, yet it would not be ſafely inferr'd, that, abſolutely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Fibrous part of either of theſe parcels of Blood exceeded the other, ſince we weighed only the <hi>Serum</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:42323:45"/>
that we found in a diſtinct Maſs; whereas a multitude of Serous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles may well be ſuppos'd to be lodg'd between the Parts of the Conſiſtent Maſs or Portion of the Blood; ſince beſides that it is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably upon the account of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed Seroſity, very ſoft, it affords a great deal of Aqueous Liquor.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This may ſufficiently appear by the following Experiment, which was purpoſely made to examine this Conjecture.</p>
            <p>We took a Porrenger of Blood, wherein the <hi>Serum</hi> was ſeparated from the <hi>Fibrous</hi> Portion, that was coagulated into one Conſiſtent Maſs, and having carefully pour'd off all the fluid part, we put the remaining Maſs, (which weighed ℥iv. + <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> v + 34 <hi>gr.</hi>) into a ſmall Head and Body, and diſtill'd it in the Digeſtive Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, till the Matter left in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Cucurbite was quite dry, which it did appear to be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ſo indeed. Then taking
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42323:46"/>
out the ſeparated Parts of this Red Maſs, the dry'd Portion was found to weigh but ℥j + <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij + 34 <hi>gr.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Serous Liquor that paſs'd into the Receiver, and was lympid and aqueous, without any ſhew of Salt or Oyl, amounted to ℥iij + 53 <hi>gr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For further ſatisfaction we repeated this Experiment with the Fibrous part of another parcel of Humane Blood, and found the dry Maſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Cucurbite to weigh but ℥j + <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj + 50 <hi>gr.</hi> whereas the Phlegmatick Liquor diſtill'd from it amounted to ℥vij, that is to more than three times and a half as much as the dry part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Having Hydroſtatically exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the <hi>Serum</hi> of Humane Blood, we found it heavier than common Water. For a piece of Red Sealing-Wax, being ſuſpended in a good Ballance by a Horſe-hair, was found in the Air to weigh <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j + 56. <hi>gr.</hi> and the Water 35 <hi>gr.</hi> but did in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> weigh but 33 <hi>gr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:42323:46"/>This Tryal was confirm'd by a more exact one, made with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument that I purpoſely caus'd to be made for weighing Liquors nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in which, when Common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weighed 253 grains, an equal bulk of <hi>Serum</hi> weighed 302. And becauſe I ſuppos'd that all <hi>Serums</hi> of Humane Blood would not be of equal Specific Gravity, I thought fit to try that of the Blood of another perſon in the ſame Inſtrument, and found it to weigh two grains leſs, that is, 300 grains in all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We once employ'd ſome <hi>Serum</hi> that could not be (or at leaſt was not) pour'd off ſo clear, but that it appear'd of a reddiſh colour; and thô we filter'd it through Cap-paper, yet a good number of the tinging Corpuſcles were ſo throughly ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it, that the Liquor paſsd through the Filtre of a Yellow Colour.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To try whether Acids would coagulate our <hi>Serum,</hi> as I had found they would ſome other Animal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42323:47"/>
I dropt into it ſome Spirit of Salt, which did immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce with it ſome white Concretions that quickly ſubſided to the bottom, and there (when there was a pretty quantity of them) appear'd like a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light and tender Cheeſe-Curd.</p>
            <p>The like Operation, but more powerful had Oyl of Vitriol upon another parcel of our <hi>Serum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. We dropt into ſome of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, good Spirit of Sal-Armoniac, which, as we expected, rather made it more Fluid, than did appear to coagulate it, as the Acid Liquors had done.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To try whether theſe Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations did not more proceed from the Coalition and Texture of the Acid Salts and the <hi>Serum,</hi> than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the peculiar action of thoſe Salts as Acids, we dropt into another portion of our <hi>Serum,</hi> a ſtrong Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſate Salt, <hi>viz.</hi> Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> which inſtantly produc'd a White Curd, as the Spirit of Salt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42323:47"/>
had done, but not, as it ſeem'd to us, ſo copiouſly.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We pour'd alſo upon ſome <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> highly rectifi'd Spirit of Wine, which, as we expected, did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coagulate ſome part of it into a White Curd, that was copious enough, but appear'd much lighter than either of the former, ſince it would not like them ſubſide, but kept at the top of the Liquor.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To try alſo what a Salt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with a Metal, would do upon our <hi>Serum,</hi> we put to it a little ſtrong Solution of Sublimate, with which it preſently afforded a white and curdled ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>We put ſome of our <hi>Serum</hi> upon ſome Filings of <hi>Mars,</hi> but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the colour of the Liquor it ſelf, we could not ſatisfie our ſelves about the Event. And thô we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards put another parcel of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> upon Filings of the ſame Metal, yet neither did this give us ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in regard the Vial having been
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42323:48"/>
miſlaid, was not look'd upon again till many days after; at which time the Liquor was grown ſo thick and muddy, that we could not well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any more of the colour, than that it was ſomewhat dark, but not either black or blackiſh; yet by a Tryal or two that we made with a little of this Liquor, it ſeem'd to have made a Solution of ſome part of the Steel: For putting it to ſome freſh Infuſion of Galls made with Water, it preſently afforded a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Precipitate; but this was ſo far from being Inky, that it was not ſo much as dark colour'd, but rather whitiſh; at which ſome ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous Experiments (mentioned in another Treatiſe) that I formerly made, kept me from wondering. Yet I ſhall not omit to add on this occaſion, that having mix'd with ſome of our impregnated <hi>Serum,</hi> a convenient quantity of Infuſion of Galls made in a highly rectifi'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Spirit, the two Liquors did not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42323:48"/>
only afford a kind of <hi>Coagulum,</hi> or Precipitate, but being left together for ſome hours, aſſociated into a Conſiſtent Body, wherein the Eye diſcover'd no diſtinct Liquor at all.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But expecting more clear ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, by putting ſome of our Liquor upon Filings of Copper, which when wrought upon by Bodys that have in them any thing of Urinous Salt, are wont to give a conſpicuous Tincture, we accordingly found that the Metal had in a very few hours diſcolour'd the <hi>Menſtruum</hi>; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards (the Vial being left unſtopt, that the Air might have Acceſs to the Liquor) it began by degrees to grow more and more Blew, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a day after was of a deep Ceru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leous Colour.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And, to be confirm'd in our Conjecture, that this Tincture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from ſome Particles of Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt latent in the Liquor, we mix'd ſome of it with a convenient quantity of Syrup of Violets, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42323:49"/>
thereby obtain'd what we look'd for, namely, a colour, which by reaſon of the action of thoſe Particles upon the Syrup, appear'd of a fine Green.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Blew Tincture or Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Copper (mention'd number the 10th) I thought fit to keep for ſome time, to try whether the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Particles would as it were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm the <hi>Serum</hi> they were diſpers'd through, and preſerve the Liquor from Putrefaction. And in Effect, thô the Vial was left unſtopt in a window in my Bed-Chamber for many weeks, yet I (whoſe Organs of ſmelling are very tender, and who did often put the Vial to my Noſe) did not perceive the Liquor to grow at all ſtinking.</p>
            <p n="13">13. About ℥ij, by gueſs of <hi>Serum</hi> of Humane Blood were left in an unſtop'd vial, (which they more then half fill'd) for Twenty days or Three weeks and though the Glaſs uſually ſtood in a South Window, and in the month of <hi>July,</hi> yet, ſomewhat
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42323:49"/>
to our wonder, the <hi>Serum</hi> did not by the ſmell appear putrefy'd, and yet had let fall a conſiderable quantity of Whitiſh Sediment. But within Three or Four days after this, the Liquor was found to ſtink offenſively. Wherefore we tryed whether this more then incipient Putrefaction was accompanyed with any Acidity, but could not perceive that it was, ſince it would not ſo much as take off the blew colour of the infuſion of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> or our <hi>Succedaneum</hi> to it. When it was in this ſtate we put it to diſtill in a low Cucurbite with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fire, to try if from this faetid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as is uſual from putrefy'd U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the Spirit would firſt aſcend. But we found the Liquor that firſt came over to be ſo little Spirituous or Saline, that it would not in an hours time turn Syrup of Violets green. But yet we judg'd it not quite deſtitute of Volatile Alcaly, becauſe having let fell ſome of it into a good ſolution of Sublimate, it preſently made at White Precipitate.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:42323:50"/>14. We took ſome Ounces of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of Humane Blood, filtred through Cap Paper to free it from all concreted Subſtance, and having committed it to Diſtillation in a ſmall Retort place'd in a Sand Furnace, we obtained only a few large drops of a Darkiſh red Oyl, ſome of which ſubſided to the bottom of the other Liquor, but the greater part ſwam upon it. We obtain'd in this firſt Diſtillation no Volatile Salt in a dry form, but after a pretty deal of inſipid Phlegm had been drawn off, there came over a good proportion of Spirituous Liquor, which ſmell'd almoſt like the Spirit of Blood; and contain'd a pretty deal of Volatile Alcaly, ſo that it would readily turn Syrup of Violets Green, and make a White Precipitate in the ſolution of Sublimate, and a great Ebullition with Spirit of Salt: This Spirit being rectifyed in a ſmall Head and Body, there was left in the bottom of the Glaſs a greater quantity than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42323:50"/>
of a ſubſtance thick like Honey, and which was for the moſt part of a dark Red, and ſeem'd to contain more Oyl than appeared upon the firſt Diſtillation. The Liquor that came over the Helm, ſeem'd more pure, but not very much ſtronger. than the firſt Spirit. Yet, having put it into a Glaſs Egg with a ſlender neck, and given the veſſel a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſituation in hot Sand, we obtain'd a Volatile Alcaly that ſublim'd into the neck in the form of a White Salt. If this Tryal be reiterated with a ſucceſs like that I have now recited, 'twill ſeem to argue that the <hi>Serous</hi> or <hi>Fluid</hi> part of the Blood affords the ſame Elementary Principles or Similar Subſtances, both as to <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>kind,</hi> that the <hi>Fibrous</hi> and <hi>Conſiſtent</hi> part does, though not as to <hi>quantity,</hi> that of the Oyl and dry Salt being leſs in a determinate por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Serum,</hi> than they would be in a like quantity or weight of the concreted part of the Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:42323:51"/>Having long ſince obſerv'd, that <hi>though</hi> the Spirituous parts of Mans Urine are wont to require that the Liquor be digeſted or putrefy'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Six weeks, to looſen them from the more ſluggiſh parts, and make them aſcend before the Phlegm, <hi>yet</hi> if freſh Urine be pour'd upon a due proportion of Quick-lime, a good part of the Spirit will preſently be untyed, and made capable of aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Diſtillation, I thought it worth while to try, what would be afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Serum</hi> of Humane Blood if it were put upon Quick-lime, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we diſtill'd it. In purſuit of this Enquiry, we put theſe two Bodies together, upon whoſe commixture there enſued (but not preſently) a ſenſible but tranſient heat. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Body being committed to diſtillation afforded firſt a kind of Phlegm in a gentle fire, and then in a ſtronger, a moderate quantity of Liquor that was thought to ſmell manifeſtly of the Lime, but had not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42323:51"/>
a brisk taſt. This was accompany'd with ſomewhat more of high coloured &amp; faetid Oil than was expected. The other Liquor being ſlowly rectify'd, the Spirit that firſt came over had a ſtrong and piercing ſmell, but leſs rank than that of Humane Blood drawn the ordinary way. Its taſt alſo was not only quick, but ſomewhat fiery. Being dropt upon Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lets, it preſently turn'd it green, with a ſtrong Solution of Sublimate in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and another of Quick-ſilver in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> it immediately made two White Precipitates. And being mingled with ſome good Spirit of Sea-Salt though upon their being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded there appear'd a thick but whitiſh Smoke, there was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd any viſible conflict or Bubbles. Yet the Colour of the Spirit of Salt, appear'd much heightn'd by this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. But here I muſt, though not in due place, take notice, that having put the lately mentioned mixture of the Spirit of <hi>Serum</hi> and of Salt to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42323:52"/>
evaporate, that we might obſerve whether it would afford a Salt much figur'd like Sal-armoniac; we found, that it did not, bot that the Colour produc'd in the Mixture whilſt fluid, was ſo heightned in the concretion we ſpeak of, that it appeared of a Blood-red Colour, but for the ſhape, it was ſo confus'd, that we could not reduce it to any known kind of Salt. By all which <hi>Phoenomena</hi> this Spirit of the <hi>Serous</hi> part of Blood, ſeems to be very near of kin to that of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted</hi> part of Blood, elſewhere by us deſcribed. Becauſe Quick-lime is wont to be ſuſpected by Phyſicians, by reaſon of its Cauſtick and Fretting Quality, I thought fit to try whether the Fixt Salt of Pota-ſhes (which is a Lixiviate Alcaly as well as Lime,) being ſubſtituted in the Room of it, would in Diſtillation have the ſame Effect upon <hi>Serum</hi> of Humane Blood. Wherefore to Four parts of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, we put one of the Salt, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſtill'd them ſlowly in a Glaſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42323:52"/>
Head and Body, we obtain'd good ſtore of a Liquor, which was not judg'd any thing near ſo ſtrong, as that formerly mention'd to have been drawn off from Quick-lime. And having put this weak Liquor, afforded by our <hi>Serum,</hi> to rectify with a gentle heat, we found that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the two ſpoonfuls of Liquor that firſt aſcended, were not Spirituous, but very Phlegmatick. Nor would it well turn Syrup of Violets Green, though it afforded ſome little and light Precipitate, when it was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Solution of Sublimate.</p>
            <p>This may ſeem ſomewhat the more remarkable, if I add on this occaſion an Experiment, that may be ſometimes of Practical uſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Phyſick, and may afford much Light to thoſe that are ſtudious, to know the Nature and Preparations of ſo very uſeful a Subject, as <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi> We took three parts of freſh Urine, (that was not many hours old) and having put into it one
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42323:53"/>
part of Salt of Pot-aſhes, (becauſe that was at hand, for elſe I preſume the fixt Salt of Tartar, or even of Common Wood aſhes, would have ſerved the turn) and having ſlowly diſtill'd them in a Head and Body, there firſt aſcended a Liquor Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough; which being ſet aſide, We continued the Diſtillation (after having poured the Mixture into a Retort) till the Remains appeared dry. In this operation it is to be not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that we obtain'd not one drop of Oyl; and that (perhaps for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) this Spirit of Urine was not near ſo faetid, as being made the Common way 'tis wont to be: and that the Liquor that came over to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the latter end of the Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was ſo unlike that which the <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood afforded us, that it was not only conſiderably ſtrong, and manifeſtly ſtronger than that which firſt aſcended, but had a pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating and fiery Taſt, which left a laſting Impreſſion upon the Tongue;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42323:53"/>
and with good Spirit of Salt made a notable Ebullition, which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not, that upon Tryals purpoſely made, I found the Spirit of Urine drawn from Quicklime to have done. And, whereas with this laſt mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Liquor, I never (that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) found any Volatile Salt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend (in a dry form) in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the help of Salt of Pot-aſhes, there came up without Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, divers Grains of Volatile Salt, one of which was Cryſtalline, and conſiderably large; ſo that we could with pleaſure obſerve it to be like a Plate curiouſly figur'd; but becauſe of ſome leſſer Corns of Salt, that hid one part of it, I could not clearly diſcern whether it were Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal or Octogonal.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt not conceal, that having for greater certainty reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Experiment, it had not ſo good ſucceſs; the Liquor that came over ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing much more Phlegmatick, than that which the former Tryal afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42323:54"/>
us; tho we both times employ'd Salt of Pot-aſhes taken out of the ſame Veſſel, and the Urine of the ſame Perſon. So that what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the difference may be, does not yet occur to me; but perhaps will upon further Tryals: yet this Liquor, that appear'd ſo weak at its firſt coming over, being rectified <hi>per ſe,</hi> afforded more than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of a Brisk Saline Spirit, from which we eaſily obtain'd a pretty quantity (in proportion to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor) of Volatile Salt in a dry form, and of a very White Colour.</p>
            <p>We took between two and three Ounces of <hi>Serum</hi> of Humane Blood, and having put it into a Bolthead, capable by our gueſs of containing about four times as much Liquor, and having ſeal'd the Glaſs Hermetically, ſet it by, as well to obſerve whether any manifeſt Changes would appear in it within a Week or two, (of which none in that time occurr'd to us) as for ſome other Purpoſes, that may be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42323:54"/>
gueſs'd at by the following Account of the Event.</p>
            <p n="1">1. After we had kept the Liquor ſeal'd up above a whole Year, it did not appear to be at all coagulated, nor to have let fall any manifeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence; but ſeem'd to be as fluid as when it was firſt put in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It did not appear to have bred any the leaſt Worm or Maggot. And this I the rather take notice of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it agrees very well with what I have elſewhere alledg'd, in disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Opinion, that think, all the fluid and ſoft Parts of Humane Bodies do naturally, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in no long time breed Worms, or ſome ſuch Inſects; which, for my part, I never obſerv'd to be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Blood it ſelf, though very long kept, and putrified, provided it were freſh enough when put into the Glaſs, and by an exact Cloſure kept from being any way blown upon by Flies, or impregnated by Seminal Particles, that may be unſuſpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42323:55"/>
convey'd to it by the Air.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor did there appear to the Eye any <hi>Mother,</hi> as they call it, or Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious Subſtance, that is ſuppos'd in Liquors always to accompany, and betoken Putrefaction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. One of my Deſigns, in our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, being to try whether the <hi>Serum</hi> would, by the mutual Action of the Parts upon one another, or by that of ſome Catholick, permea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fluid, afford ſo much Air as would either crack, or more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly break the Glaſs; the Tip at which the Bolt-head was ſeal'd, was warily taken off with a Key, whereupon there ruſh'd out a pretty deal of Air, with a conſiderable noiſe: And I doubted not that this generated (or at leaſt extricated) Air, had been conſiderably compreſs'd whilſt it was pent up; when caſting my Eyes on the Liquor, to diſcover what change this Eruption had made there, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd on the upper Surface of the Liquor a multitude of ſmall Bubbles,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42323:55"/>
ſuch as are wont to be ſeen in Drink a little Bottled, upon the opening of the Veſſel; and alſo in divers Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, after the Air has been pent up with them, when the Glaſſes come to be unſtopp'd. And I alſo the leſs wonder'd at this, becauſe I remember'd what formerly hapned to me, after having ſeal'd up ſome Sheeps Blood, and kept it for ſeveral Days in a gentle warmth; for, tho the Glaſs it was enclos'd in, were far larger than this that contained our <hi>Serum</hi>; yet after ſome time, when no Body offer'd any violence to it, or was near enough to ſtir it, it was ſuddenly blown up with a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing noiſe by the Aereal or Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Corpuſcles that were produced, or ſet free by the Putrefaction we diſcover'd to have been made.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſmell of our <hi>Serum</hi> was ſtrong, but not Cadaverous, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſembled that of the Tincture of Sulphur made with Salt of Tartar and Spirit of Wine, or of ſome ſuch
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42323:56"/>
Sulphureous Preparation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. One of the chief aims I had in keeping our <hi>Serum</hi> ſo long Seal'd up, was to try, whether by a Digeſtion, or Putrefaction for ſome Months, the <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood would like Urine (which is commonly thought to be a Liquor made of it, and of very near Cognation to it) afford a Saline Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or an Alcaly Volatile enough to aſcend before the Phlegm. And in purſuit of this enquiry we commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our <hi>Serum</hi> to Diſtillation in a ſmall Glaſs Head and Body, and in a Digeſtive Furnace, being careful to take the firſt Spoonful, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts of Spirit that paſſed into the Receiver: But we found, that, tho this Liquor at firſt ſmell'd ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, (I ſay at firſt, becauſe the Odour ſoon after grew fainter) yet the taſt was not at all brisk nor Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous like that wont to be obtain'd by Diſtillation from Putrify'd Urine. Nor did our Liquor being drop'd into a little Syrup of Violets, give it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42323:56"/>
any manifeſt greenneſs. But yet, becauſe I found it not inſipid, I thought fit to examine it a little more critically, and dropt a convenient quantity of it into a clear and Satu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Solution of Sublimate in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, by which means there was produc'd a whiteneſs like that (but not near ſo denſe) which Spirit of Urine, or Volatile Salt would have produc'd. And by this I was invited to mix ſome of it with a little Syrup of Violets upon a piece of White Paper, and alſo to wet with the ſame (Diſtill'd) Liquor, ſome ſmall filings of Copper ſpread upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther piece of Paper, and to leave them both all Night in the open Air, that the Liquor might have time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to work upon the Syrup, and the Metal. By which courſe we found in the Morning, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was turn'd green, and the latter was ſo far diſſolv'd as to leave a large blewiſh ſtain upon the Paper. I mention theſe things the rather,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42323:57"/>
becauſe according to the Opinion of ſome Learned Men, this degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Serum</hi> ſhould have been of an Acid, not an Alcaliſate nature.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The near Cognation that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome Learned Phyſicians, there is between Milk, and the more Serous part of the Blood, invited me to try whether, (according to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment made on New Milk, that I have heard aſcribed to the famous <hi>Sylvius,</hi>) our <hi>Serum</hi> of Humane Blood would grow Red, by being kept continually ſtirring over a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate heat with a competent quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Salt of Tartar, but in two try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, we found not any redneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, tho one of them was made in a Veſſel of refin'd Silver, with an eighth part of the Salt in reference to the <hi>Serum,</hi> which was the ſame proportion that we had us'd when we made the Experiment ſucceed well in Milk.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Perhaps it will be needleſs to take notice, that the <hi>Serum</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42323:57"/>
Blood will by heat be in a ſhort time coagulated into a kind of Gelly, or rather, as far as I have obſerv'd, into a Subſtance like a Cuſtard, as to Conſiſtence, tho not as to Colour. And therefore I ſhall now add, that having found that Acid Spirits alſo would coagulate <hi>Serum.</hi> I thought fit to try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alcalys would not oppoſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard its Coagulation. Of which Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al the event was, that having put Spirit of Humane Blood to a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient quantity of <hi>Serum,</hi> and caus'd them to be kept ſtirring over a very gentle Fire, though the Volatile Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly did not hinder the Coagulation, yet it ſeem'd to make it both more ſlow, and more ſoft or laxe. And this effect was yet more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when we try'd another parcel of <hi>Serum</hi> with Salt of Tartar inſtead of Spirit of Blood.</p>

            <p>HAving by want of leiſure and opportunity, been reduced to treat of the Hiſtory of Humane Blood in ſo imperfect and deſultory a way, that ſeveral of the Titles have been left wholly untouch'd, and others have been but tranſiently and jejunely treated of; I thought fit to handle more fully, ſome one of the Primary Titles, and branch it into its ſeveral ſubordinate or ſecundary Titles. And for this purpoſe I pitch'd upon the Spirit of Humane
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42323:58"/>
Blood, being willing on ſo noble a Subject to give a <hi>Specimen</hi> of what might have been done to Illuſtrate the other Primary Titles, if ſome requiſites had not been wanting. And ſince the Spirit of Humane Blood is at leaſt one of the nobleſt of Urinous or Volatile Alcalies; ſo that moſt of the things that ſhall be taught concerning that, may with ſome little variation be apply'd to Spirit of Urine, Hartſhorn, Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, Soot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I thought fit to lay down a Scheme of ſubordinate Titles, whoſe Heads (which amount to above half the number of the Primary ones, that belong to the whole Hiſtory of Blood) ſhould be ſo numerous and comprehenſive, that this Paper may paſs not only for an Example, but for a kind of ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Hiſtory of Volatile Salts in general, and ſo ſupply the loſs of a Paper that I once begun on that Subject.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhould without further
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42323:59"/>
Preamble proceed to the intended Hiſtory, but that I think it requiſite to premiſe three or four ſhort Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Whereof the Firſt ſhall be, That the Spirit I employ'd in making the following Tryals and Obſervations, was drawn from Humane Blood without any Sand, Clay, or other Additament, (ſave perhaps that by a miſtake that could do no miſchief, a ſmall parcel had ſome Vinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit put to it to preſerve it a while) and that the firſt diſtillations (which I ſo call to diſtinguiſh them from Rectifications) were perform'd in Retorts plac'd in Sand, (and not with a naked Fire) care being taken that the Veſſels were not too much fill'd becauſe Blood, N. B. if it be not well dry'd, is apt to ſwell much, and paſs into the Neck of the Retort, if not into the Receiver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I deſire to give notice, that the Blood we made uſe of, was drawn from Perſons that parted with it out of cuſtom, or for prevention,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42323:59"/>
which was the main reaſon why I was ſo ſcantly furniſhed with Blood, that of ſound perſons being in the place I reſided in, very difficult to be procur'd in quantity, and that of ſick perſons being unfit for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may not be amiſs for obviating of ſome Scruples, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe that, there being ſo great a Cognation between the Spirit and Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, that, as we ſhall ſee anon, 'tis probable that the latter is little other than the Spirit in a dry form, and the former than the Salt united with Phlegm enough to give it a Liquid form; 'tis preſum'd that it may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to conſider the Volatile Salt of Blood as its dry Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To the three foregoing, 'twill be fit to add this Fourth Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, That tho, in compariſon of the Particulars thrown in to the Second and Third Part of thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, the enſuing Fourth Part is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42323:60"/>
methodically written, yet you are not to expect to find in the Method any thing of Accurateneſs; ſince the Experiments and Obſervations whereof this Fourth Part conſiſts, were written in looſe Papers, at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant times and on differing occaſions, and becauſe of this and of my haſte, will be found, without any regular dependence or connexion, referr'd to the Titles under which they are rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that order, or rather diſorder, wherein they chanc'd to come to hand.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is not unlike, that you will think the Queſtion propos'd in this Title, more <hi>curious</hi> than <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>; and I ſhall not quarrel with you if you do ſo. But that you may not think it groundleſs, I deſire two things may be conſider'd; firſt, how ordinary it is, eſpecially ſince the Learned Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s Writings came to be applauded, to look upon Fevers as inordinate Fermentations of the Blood. And the ſecond, that <hi>tho</hi> Humane Urine, which has a great cognation with the Humane Blood, will not, whilſt freſh, afford by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42323:62"/>
a Spirit or Volatile Salt, till the Phlegm be firſt drawn off, and then requires a good Fire to make it riſe; <hi>yet,</hi> if it be kept for a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent time (which uſually amounts to divers weeks) in <hi>Fermentation,</hi> (as Chymiſts commonly call that, which in this caſe I would rather ſtile <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction</hi>) the Spirit and Volatile Salt will with a gentle Fire aſcend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much, if not before any Phlegm.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Conſiderations, as I was intimating, may keep that from being thought a groundleſs Queſtion, which has been above propos'd. And, thô I more incline to the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> than to the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> at leaſt as to the firſt part or member of the Queſtion, yet I thought it well deſerv'd to be determin'd, if it may be, by Experiment. But for want of a ſufficient quantity of Blood, and good luck in making Tryals with that I could procure, I muſt ſuſpend my Judgment, till further Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reſolve me one way or other.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42323:63"/>
By what I have yet try'd, I am not much encourag'd to expect from Humane Blood a Vinous or Ardent Spirit, thô that be the uſual product of Fermentation in Liquors, and I am the leſs encourag'd to expect this, becauſe I am not ſure that there is any Fermentation truly &amp; properly ſo call'd in Humane Blood, either within or out of the Body; having never yet found any thing in the Blood, or Urine, that convinc'd me, that either of thoſe Liquors would afford an ardent Spirit. I remember I once kept Humane Blood for a year together, in a Glaſs very carefully, and if I miſtake not, Hermetically clos'd, with a purpoſe to try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Spirits would firſt aſcend. But when the Blood came to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the contact of the Air, the ſtink was ſo great and offenſive, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to ſome Ladies that liv'd in the houſe, that we were fain to have it haſtily thrown away. Another time, having caus'd ſome Sheeps
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42323:63"/>
Blood to be digeſted in a pretty large Vial Hermetically ſealed, after it had continued a good while in the Digeſtive Furnace, upon a ſudden, thô no Body touched it, it broke with a ſurprizing noiſe, and blew off the long neck of the Vial. Two or three almoſt like miſchances I had with Attempts made on Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood, which I was the more troubled at, becauſe I thought it not very improbable, that by Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Texture of Blood, like that of Urine, may be ſo looſen'd or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alter'd, that a Volatile Salt or Spirit may in a ſlow diſtillation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend before the Phlegm. But, as I ſaid before, 'tis only from further Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that I muſt expect Satisfaction in theſe Enquiries.</p>
               <p>Yet in the mean time I ſhall add on this occaſion, That the ill ſucceſs I had in my Attempts to draw a Spirit from entire Portions of Blood, without ſeparating any part from it, or adding any foreign Body to it,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42323:64"/>
did not hinder, but <hi>rather</hi> invite, me to try, whether I could not make ſome Experiment of affinity to thoſe above mentioned upon whoſe ſucceſs I might ground ſome kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, what would have been the Events of thoſe Tryals, in caſe they had not miſcarryed. Wherefore look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood as the likelyeſt part of it, as well as much more likely than the entire Blood, to concur to a Fermentation properly ſo call'd; we took ſome Ounces of this <hi>Serum,</hi> and put to it about a fourth part of Raiſins (of the Sun) well bruis'd, and kept them in a Glaſs, whereof a conſiderable part was left empty, and having clos'd the Veſſel, we kept it in a warm room for many days. The Event of this Tryal was, that within few days the Raiſins began to emerge, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continued to float; and there was produc'd or extricated a conſiderable quantity of permanent and Springy Air, as by a certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42323:64"/>
deſcribed in another Paper, did manifeſtly appear. Both which <hi>Phaenomena</hi> ſeem'd plainly to argue, that there had been ſome degree of Fermentation produc'd in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But yet when we came to diſtill the thus alter'd <hi>Serum,</hi> thô it did not ſtink, as if it had putrefied it would have done, yet the Liquor that firſt aſcended, even with a gentle heat, did not taſt or ſmell like a Vinous Spirit, thô it was differing from meer Phlegm. If I had been furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a greater quantity of <hi>Serum,</hi> perhaps the reiterated Experiment would have given more ſatisfaction; and in making it I would have been careful to obſerve, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Fermentation might not be ſuſpected to proceed not ſo much from the whole <hi>Serum</hi> as ſuch, as from the Aqueous Particles, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from the others that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd with them to compoſe it.</p>
               <p>As for the Second Queſtion intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this preſent Firſt Title, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

whether Blood will by Digeſtion or Putrefaction be ſo opened, as that when it is diſtill'd, the Spirit will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend before the Phelgm: I likewiſe endeavour'd to try, That, with the Serous part of the Blood pour'd off from the Fibrous or Coagulated, as ſuppoſing it in this ſeparated ſtate, more proper for our Tryal than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Blood: and having kept a pretty quantity of this <hi>Serum</hi> above four times as long, as I had obſerv'd to have been ſufficient, to make Urine in Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion part with its Spirit before its Phlegm; we diſtill'd this long kept Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor with a very gentle ſire, that few or none beſides the fugitive parts might at firſt aſcend.

So that for the preſent about this difficult Queſtion, I ſhall venture to ſay no more than this, that what has hitherto
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42323:66"/>
occurr'd to me, inclines me to think that the Spirit of Humane Blood is totally compos'd of Volatile Salt and Phlegm, if by Phlegm, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not Simple, or Elementary Water, but a Liquor, that, althô it paſs among Chymiſts for Phlegm, and deſerves that name better than any other Liquor afforded by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood, yet in the ſtricteſt acception it is not That; for when the Spirit, Volatile Salt, and Oil, are ſeparated from it by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Sublimation, as far as they are wont to be in Chymical Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Volatile Alcalies, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Liquor, which paſſes for Phlegm, will yet be impregnated with ſome Particles of Oyl, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alſo with ſome few of volatile Salt, that are too minute to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable by the naked Eye. But whether frequent Rectifications may ſo accurately ſeparate theſe Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous parts, as perfectly to free the Aqueous ones from them, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42323:66"/>
thereby reduce the Phlegm to Simple or Elementary Water, I am content at leaſt till I ſhall have had ſufficient Quantities of diſtill'd Blood for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the requiſite Tryals, to leave as a Problem. And this the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not ſure, but that by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſtillations, ſome Particles of the Fire may from time to time Subſtantially be aſſociated with thoſe of the Liquor; nor yet but that even in the firſt Diſtillation of Humane Blood, The Fire may have either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated or produc'd a Liquor that though almoſt ſtrengthleſs, and not juſtly referable to either of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Principles or Ingredients, Oyl, Salt and Earth, is not yet Phlegm truly ſo call'd, but a Liquor as yet <hi>Anonymous</hi>; as I have elſewhere ſhewn, that Woods and many other Bodies afford by Diſtillation a Liquor that is not an Oyl, and is neither Acid nor Alcaliſate, and yet is no true Phlegm, but as I have there ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, an <hi>Adiaphorous Spirit.</hi>

               <p>I need not ſpend much time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a thing that is now ſo well known to many Phyſicians and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts of this and ſome of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries, as 'tis that of late years Saline Spirits obtain'd by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation have been obſerv'd to be of two ſorts. But becauſe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, even of the Learned eſpecially in the remoter parts of Europe, that are not well acquainted with this Diſtinction, leſt ſome to whom you may ſhew this Paper ſhould chance to be of that number, it may not be amiſs to intimate in two or three Words, that the <hi>Saline Spirits</hi> that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42323:68"/>
in Diſtillation, are ſome of them <hi>Acid</hi> in <hi>Taſt,</hi> as Spirit of Nitre, Spirit of Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſome others have Taſts very differing from that, being rather ſomewhat like <hi>Common Salt,</hi> or like <hi>Lixiviate</hi> Salts. And the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is greater in their <hi>operations</hi> than in their <hi>Taſts</hi>; For being put together there will preſently enſue a manifeſt Conflict between them, and uſually (for I have not found it to hold in all caſes) the one will Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate the Bodies that the other hath Diſſolved. And 'tis neceſſary to add, that among the Salts called <hi>Alcalies,</hi> ſome are <hi>Fixt</hi> in conſiderable degrees of Fire, and others not, for which reaſon divers modern Spagyriſts and Phyſicians, that take <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcaly</hi> for the true <hi>Principles</hi> of Mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, call the one <hi>Fixt</hi> and the other <hi>Volatile Alcalies.</hi> And, <hi>though</hi> I have elſewhere queſtioned this Doctrine, and given my Reaſons why I approve neither it nor the Appellations newly mention'd, and often call the <hi>Salts</hi>

               <p>Theſe things being premis'd I may now ſeaſonably propound this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Queſtion, <hi>To what Species of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Bodies the Spirit of Humane Blood is to be referr'd?</hi> I ſay of <hi>Saline Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> becauſe though the Spirit of Blood be a Liquor, yet its more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Operations ſeem almoſt (if not more then almoſt) totally to depend upon the Fugitive Salt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it abounds. The ground of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Queſtion may be twofold; the one, that I have elſewhere prov'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the general ſuppoſition, that ſome <hi>Volatile Salts,</hi> that ariſe even in a dry form, may not be of an <hi>Alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate</hi>;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42323:69"/>
but <hi>Acid</hi> nature, and the other, that not only <hi>Helmont</hi> and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but a great part of the Modern Chymiſts and Phyſicians too, aſcribe Digeſtion to an Acid Ferment or <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> in the Stomach; Whence one may ſuſpect that ſtore of Acid Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles may paſs into the Maſs of Blood, &amp; impregnate it, as I elſewhere ſhew that Particles of differing Natures may be even by the ſenſes diſcovered to do.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this, I ſhall not ſcruple to ſay in anſwer to the propounded Queſtion, that, as far as I have hitherto been able to obſerve, the Spirit of Humane Blood is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly referable to that Claſſis that many call <hi>Volatile Alcalies</hi> (and I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinous Spirits</hi>) for I find Spirit of Blood capable of doing thoſe things, the performance of which has been looked on almoſt ever ſince I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly propos'd them, as the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to know Volatile Alcalies, and diſtinguiſh them from the other ſorts of Saline Bodies. For the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42323:69"/>
Blood will make a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with divers Acid Spirits, as Spirit of Salt, <hi>Aqua fortis, &amp;c.</hi> It will immediately turn Syrup of Violets from its Blew Colour into a fair Green, 'twill Precipitate a Solution of Sublimate in common Water, into a White Powder, and in ſhort I found it to perform thoſe other things that may be expected from <hi>Volatile Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calies</hi> as ſuch, as often as I had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make Tryal of it, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on one Body, and ſometimes on another.</p>
               <p>If I were ſure (as for Reaſons elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where declar'd I am not) that the Digeſtion of Aliments were made by an Acid Ferment or Juice, whence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Stomach is furniſh'd with it, I ſhould be prone to ſuſpect that ſome Acid Particles may be mingled with the Blood. But however that would not hinder me from referring the Spirit of Humane Blood to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Alcalies, becauſe ſo few <hi>Acid</hi> Particles would be either deſtroy'd
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42323:70"/>
by the <hi>Alcaliſate</hi> ones, that are ſo abundant in the Spirit, or at leaſt theſe would be ſo very much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, as to allow us very war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably to give on their account a Denomination to the Mixture. As if a few <hi>drops</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vinegar</hi> were mix'd with ſome <hi>Pints</hi> or <hi>Pounds</hi> of ſtale <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> they would either be depriv'd of their Acidity by ſome Corpuſcles of a contrary nature, that they would meet with in the Liquor, or they would be ſo obſcur'd and overpower'd by the Fugitive Salts it abounds with, that the Acetous Corpuſcles would not hinder the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Liquor drawn from the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by diſtillation to be juſtly refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the <hi>Claſſis</hi> of <hi>Volatile, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinous Salts.</hi>

Nor do I yet ſee any certain way, by which the Affirmative part of the Queſtion, thô it ſhould be true, can be clearly demonſtrated. Therefore
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42323:71"/>
leaving the peremptory Deciſion of this Queſtion, to thoſe that ſhall think themſelves qualify'd to make it, I ſhall (at leaſt till I be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd) content my ſelf to make a Couple of Remarks, in reference to the propos'd Enquiry.</p>
               <p>And firſt I think, there may be a great difference between Volatile Salts or Spirits, as they are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepar'd for medicinal uſes, and as they may, by reiterated Rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and otherways of Depuration, be brought to as great a ſimplicity or Purity, as a dextrous Chymiſt can bring them to: I thus expreſs my ſelf, becauſe as to an Exquiſite or Elementary Simplicity thô ſome eminent Artiſts pretend to it, I am not ſure that Chymiſts can attain it; eſpecially conſidering what I elſewhere ſhew of the unheeded Commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that may (at leaſt ſometimes) be made by the Corpuſcles of the Fire, with thoſe of the Bodies it works on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42323:71"/>My other Remark is, that whether or no, if the Spirit of Humane Blood, and other Liquors abounding like it in Volatile Alcalies, were reduc'd to as great a purity as they can by Art be brought to, they would be altogether alike in their Nature and Qualities; yet, if we conſider them (as men uſe to do) in that ſtate wherein they are wont to be thought pure enough for medicinal uſes, and are accordingly employ'd by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and Chymiſts; I think it very probable, that there is ſome difference between the Spirit of Humane Blood and ſome other Volatile Alcalies, and particularly thoſe afforded by Urine and by Harts-horn. For thô to me the bad ſmells of all theſe Liquors ſeem to be much alike, yet divers Ladies, and thoſe of very differing Ages, affirm they find a manifeſt difference between theſe ſmells, and do abhor the odour of Spirit of Blood as a ſtink, though they will with pleaſure hold their noſes a great
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42323:72"/>
while over the Sp. of Harts-horn, and even that of (vulgar or European) Sal-armoniac (which is in effect a Sp. of Mans Urine) and affirm themſelves to be much refreſh'd by it. And, whereas with Spirit of Urine or of Sal-armoniac joyn'd in a due proportion with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt, I have uſually (as I have long ſince noted in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Paper <note n="a" rend="inter">The uſefulneſs of Experimental Philoſophy.</note>) been able to make a Salt that ſhoots into the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Figure of <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> which figure is very differing from that of Sea Salt, Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have ſeldom, if ever obtain'd (at leaſt in any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity) a Salt of that ſhape, by the commixture of the Spirit of Humane Blood, with that of common Salt; for, though their Saline Corpuſcles, upon the Evaporation of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous moiſture, would coagulate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet the concretion ſeem'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, and either all or a great part of it was deſtitute of that neat and diſtinct ſhape, that I had ſeveral times
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42323:72"/>
obſerv'd in concretions, made by the mixture of the Spirit of Sea-Salt with Urinous Spirits. And, as to the Medicinal vertues of Spirit of Blood, <hi>though</hi> I have not had opportunity to make compariſons experimentally, and therefore ſhall forbear to affirm any thing my ſelf, <hi>yet,</hi> if we credit the famous <hi>Helmont,</hi> there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable difference between the Sp. of Humane Blood, &amp; that of Humane Urine, ſince he ſomewhere expreſsly notes, (though I remember not the place, nor have his Book at hand) that the Spirit of Humane Blood cures Epilepſies, which is a thing the Spirit of Urine will not do.</p>

For ſome Mens Blood may be much more Phlegmatick or ſerous than that of others, which it ſelf may be more or leſs Spirituous according to the Complexion, Age, Sex, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the perſon that bleeds. But, to make ſome Eſtimate, that will not probably much recede from what may be ordinarily found, I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that Twelve Ounces of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42323:73"/>
healthy Humane Blood afforded us ſeven Ounces and a half of Phlegm, and conſequently about Four Ounces and a half of dry ſtuff. And then I ſhall add, that having committed to Diſtillation in a Retort in a Sand Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace ſeven Ounces of well dry'd (but not ſcorch'd) Blood, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd about ſeven Drams, that is, about an Eighth part of Spirit, to which thô it were not rectified, that Name may well enough be given, becauſe it was ſo very rich in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Saline parts, that it left in the Receiver, and in the Vial I kept it in, a good deal of Volatile Salt undiſſolv'd, which a Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Liquor would not have done. And if that be admitted for a truth, that was above propos'd as a very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conjecture; namely, that Spirit of Blood is but Salt and Phlegm united, we may well ſuppoſe that Humane Blood yields a far greater proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit than this; ſince from the ſeven Ounces of dry'd Blood laſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42323:74"/>
mentioned, we obtain'd about Five Drams of Volatile Salt, which if we had by Diſtillations united with a fit quantity of Phlegm, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have afforded us near Two Ounces more of a Liquor deſerving the name of Spirit.</p>

               <p>And as to the firſt of the Three <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,</hi> we have noted to be referrable to the <hi>Conſiſtence</hi> of our <hi>Spirit; Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> is a Quality that is ſo radicated, if I may ſo ſpeak, in the nature of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Fluids</hi> or <hi>Liquors,</hi> and does ſo obſtinately accompany them, that I durſt not omit to examine the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Gravity (that is, the <hi>Gravity in proportion to the Bulk</hi>) of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Humane Blood</hi>; though by reaſon of the ſmall quantity I had of it, I could not make uſe of the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, that I was wont to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in Hydroſtatical Tryals, where I was not ſo ſtinted in the Liquor to be examined. But however I made a ſhift to make a Tryal of this kind, by which I found, that a compact body weighing fifty eight Grains in the <hi>Air,</hi> and in <hi>Water</hi> ſix Grains and three fourth parts weighed in Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Spirit of Humane Blood,</hi> but five Grains and one fourth part. And on this occaſion I ſhall tell you,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42323:75"/>
what I preſume, you did not expect, which is, that notwithſtanding the Volatility of our Spirit of Blood, I found that a pretty large piece of Amber being put into it, did not, as moſt men would confidently expect, fall to the bottom of the Liquor, but kept itſelf floating at the upper part of it, and if plung'd into it would emerge.</p>
               <p>The next Quality we refer'd to the <hi>Conſiſtence</hi> of our <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> is the <hi>Degree</hi> of its <hi>Fluidity,</hi> or, if you pleaſe, its greater or leſſer <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from Tenaciouſneſs</hi> or <hi>Viſcoſity,</hi> which ſome <hi>Modern Philoſophers</hi> (whoſe Opinion needs not here be diſcuſs'd) think to belong to all <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors</hi> as ſuch. Now one may be the more inclin'd to expect a manifeſt Degree of <hi>Tenacity</hi> in the <hi>Spirit of Humane Blood,</hi> becauſe among many Modern Chymiſts it paſſes for an <hi>Alcaly</hi>; and we know that divers other <hi>Alcaliſate Liquors,</hi> as <hi>Oyl of Tartar per deliquium, Fix'd Nitre</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd

the ſame way, <hi>Solution of Pot-aſhes,</hi> &amp;c. are ſenſibly <hi>unctuous,</hi> and but languidly Fluid. But yet I did not obſerve, that ſome rectified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Humane Blood, that I purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly try'd between my Fingers, did feel more <hi>unctuous</hi> than <hi>Common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And whereas thoſe that ſell <hi>Brandy,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> are wont to ſhake it, till it afford ſome <hi>Froth,</hi> and then by the ſtay this makes on the Surface, to judge of the <hi>Tenacity or Tenuity</hi> of the Liquor, eſteeming that to be the moſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctuous,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Bubbles</hi> make the <hi>longeſt ſtay,</hi> and that the fineſt on which they ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſappear; I thought fit by the ſame Method to examine Spirit of Humane Blood, and found that the Froth would laſt very little on the Surface of it, the bubbles breaking or vaniſhing, almoſt (if not quite) as nimbly, as if the Liquor had been good Spirit of Wine. And I likewiſe obſerv'd, that when I warily let fall ſome of our well rectify'd Spirit of

Blood upon ſome other body, it ſeemed to me, that the ſingle drops were manifeſtly ſmaller than thoſe of Water, and of ſeveral other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, would have been, which will be much confirm'd by one paſſage of what I have to ſay about the third Quality referrable to the Conſiſtence of the Spirit we treat of.</p>
               <p>Becauſe it may be a thing of ſome <hi>Importance,</hi> as well as <hi>Curioſity,</hi> to know how <hi>ſubtil</hi> the <hi>active parts</hi> of <hi>Spirit of Humane Blood</hi> are, and how diſpoſed and fitted to diſperſe or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe themſelves through other Liquors of convenient Textures; to make a viſible diſcovery of this, I bethought my ſelf of a Method, that having formerly deviſed for ſeveral purpoſes, I thought fitly applicable to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Deſign. For having looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a great defect, that men have lazily contented themſelves to ſay in general, that ſuch a Body is of <hi>ſubtile,</hi> or of <hi>very ſubtile</hi> Parts, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves to find out any way
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42323:76"/>
of making more <hi>particular</hi> and leſs indeterminate <hi>Eſtimates</hi> of that <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty</hi>; I was invited to find out and practiſe a way that might on divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſomewhat ſupply that defect. But having delivered this eaſy method in another Paper, I ſhall forbear to repeat a tedious account of it in this; ſince it may here ſuffice to tell you in ſhort, what will perhaps ſurprize you; namely, That according to the forementioned way, we ſo prepar'd Common Water by Infuſions made in it without heat, that by putting one ſingle drop of our rectified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Humane Blood into ℥iv. + ℈iv. (which make 2000 grains) of the prepar'd Water, and lightly ſhaking the Vial, there appeared throughout the Liquor a manifeſt Colour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no degree at all was diſcernible in it juſt before. Which ſufficiently argues a wonderful ſubtilty of Parts in the Spirit we employ'd; ſince that a ſingle drop of it could diſperſe its Corpuſcles, ſo as to diffuſe it ſelf
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42323:77"/>
through, and mingle with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times as much Water, and yet retain ſo much Activity, as to make their preſence not only ſenſible, but conſpicuous, by a manifeſt change of Colour they produc'd. I confeſs this computation is made, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that a drop of Water weighs about a grain, and that a drop of our Spirit of Blood was of the ſame weight with a drop of Water.</p>
               <p>The former ſuppoſition is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made; and though I have not found it to be exactly true, but that a drop of Water weigh'd a <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillum</hi> more than a Grain; yet that difference is much more than recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd, by that which we found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the weight of a drop of Water, and the weight of one of Spirit of Humane Blood. For having in a very good and carefully adjuſted Ballance, let fall ten drops of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, and as many of our Rectified Spirit of Humane Blood, (as judging it a ſafer way to make
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42323:77"/>
an Eſtimate, by comparing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny drops of each Liquor than one alone;) we found, as we might well expect, that a drop of this laſt nam'd Liquor, as it was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſſer, ſo it was far lighter, than a drop of Water, in ſo much, that the whole ten drops did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to four Grains. So that we may ſafely judge the drop of Spirit to have manifeſtly diffuſed it ſelf, and acted upon above 4000 times ſo much Water in weight, (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in bulk too) ſince indeed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion extended a good way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that of one to 5000; and ſo may be ſaid to be as that of one to between 4000 and 5000, which, <hi>tho</hi> it may ſeem incredible to thoſe that are unacquainted with the great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of Nature and Art, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutions they can make of Bodies; <hi>yet</hi> I can by repeating the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eaſily convince a doubter, in leſs than a quarter of an hour. And this Subtilty of the Parts of Blood
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42323:78"/>
will appear yet greater, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, (what I think I can evince,) that no contemptible part of the ſingle drop I employ'd was Phlegm, uſeleſs to the change produc'd, the operation being due to the Energy of the Saline Spirits of the little drop.</p>

               <p>THoſe <hi>Qualities,</hi> that in my Opinion more generally than deſervedly are call'd <hi>firſt,</hi> do not any of them belong to the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood, in ſuch manner as to oblige me to ſay any thing of them in relation to it. And therefore I ſhall content my ſelf to have made this tranſient mention of them, to keep it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42323:78"/>
from being thought, that through forgetfulneſs I had overlook'd them. Yet ſomething there is, that may not inconveniently be refer'd to the heat or coldneſs of Spirit of Humane Blood; in regard that Phyſicians, as well as Philoſophers, diſtinguiſh theſe Qualities into <hi>Actual</hi> and <hi>Potential.</hi> For it ſeems, that the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood is in reference to ſome Liquors potentially cold, ſince it refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerates them, and in reference to ſome others potentially hot, ſince being mingled with them, the mixture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes actually hot. Of this laſt I ſhall here ſet down the enſuing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>Into a ſlender Cylindrical Glaſs we put the lower part of an Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically Seal'd Thermoſcope, which in this Paper and elſewhere I uſually call the gag'd one, becauſe it was adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the ſtandard of ſuch Inſtruments kept at <hi>Greſham</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Into this Cylindrical Glaſs we pour'd as much moderately
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42323:79"/>
ſtrong Spirit of Blood, as would co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Ball of the Thermometer, and then drop'd on that Liquor ſome good Spirit of Salt, upon whoſe mingling with it there was produc'd a Conflict accompany'd with noiſe and bubbles, and a heat, which nimbly enough made the Spirit of Wine aſcend above two inches and a half. This Experiment is therefore the more conſiderable, becauſe there are divers Volatile Alcalies that being confounded with Acid Spirits, tho they ſeem to make a true Efferveſcence, yet do really produce a notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Coldneſs. And that which to me ſeem'd conſiderable on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, was, that whereas I had ſeveral times found by Tryal, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Verdegreaſe (which ſome call the Spirit of <hi>Venus</hi>) would with the Volatile Salt of Sal Armoniack, or of Urine, produce a ſeeming Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence, but a real coldneſs; this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Verdegreaſe it ſelf, being mix'd in the forementioned ſmall Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42323:79"/>
Glaſs, with but moderately ſtrong Spirit of Blood, did not only produce a hiſſing noiſe and ſtore of bubbles, but an actual heat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Spirit of Wine in the Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſcope was made quickly to aſcend above an inch and a half, tho the Liquors employ'd amounted not both together to two ſpoonfuls.</p>

               <p>IT will not only ſerve to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Subtilty and Penetran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Spirit of Human Blood, but it may be alſo of ſome uſe to Phyſicians, if it be made appear by Experiments, that this Spirit is by itſelf not only a good <hi>Medicine</hi> for ſeveral diſeaſes, (as will be hereafter ſhewn,) but may be alſo employ'd
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42323:80"/>
as a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> to diſſolve ſeveral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and even ſome Metalline ones. And becauſe theſe laſt mention'd are the moſt unlikely to be readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble, by a ſubſtance belonging to the <hi>Animal Kingdom,</hi> as Chymiſts ſpeak; I ſhall ſubjoyn two Tryals, that I made to evince this Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power of the Spirit of Blood.</p>
               <p>And firſt we took Crude Copper in Filings, (which if they be very ſmall, are ſo much the fitter for our purpoſe) and having pour'd on them ſome highly rectify'd Spirit of Human Blood, we ſhook them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in about a quarter of an hour or leſs, perceiv'd the <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> to begin to look a little Blewiſh, which argu'd its operation to have already begun. And this colour grew higher and higher, till after ſome hours the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Copper enough to make it deeply Ceruleous. Some other, and ſomewhat differing Tryals on the ſame Metal will be met with in their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42323:80"/>
proper place. In the mean time I ſhall here take notice, that in ſome Circumſtances the Spirit of Blood has ſuch an operation upon Copper, whoſe quickneſs is ſurpriſing. For having made a coin'd piece of that Metal clean and bright (that no greaſe or foulneſs might hinder the effect of the Liquor,) and put a drop or two of our Spirit upon it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in about half a Minute of an Hour, (obſerv'd by a watch that ſhew'd Seconds) the verge of the moiſtned part of the Surface appear'd blewiſh, and almoſt preſently after, the reſt of the wetted part acquir'd a fine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure Colour.</p>
               <p>We alſo took filings of <hi>Zink,</hi> or (as in the ſhops they call it) <hi>Spelter,</hi> and having pour'd on them very well rectified Spirit of Blood, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that even in the cold it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began to work manifeſtly, thô not vigorouſly. But being aſſiſted with a little heat, it diſſolv'd the Zink briskly, and not without producing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42323:81"/>
ſtore of bubbles, being alſo a little diſcolour'd by the operation of this Experiment, ſome uſe is made in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, and therefore need not be deliver'd in this.</p>
               <p>On this occaſion I ſhall add, that for curioſities ſake I took a piece of Coagulated Blood, but not dry'd, ſomewhat bigger than a large Pea, having a care to take it from the lower part of the lump of Blood, that it might be black, the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part of Fibrous Blood that lies next the Air, being uſually Red. This clot of Blood we put into a ſlender Vial of clear Glaſs, that the colour might be the better diſcern'd, and then pour'd on it a little Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Spirit of Humane Blood, and ſhook the Glaſs alittle; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in a trice the colour of (at leaſt) the Superficial part of the Blood, was, as I had conjectur'd, manifeſtly chang'd, the blackneſs quite diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and being ſucceeded by a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42323:81"/>
very florid colour like that of fine Scarlet. The Liquor alſo was ting'd, but not with near ſo deep or ſo fair a Red, and by the little bubbles that from time to time paſt out of the Clod into it, it ſeem'd to work ſomewhat like a <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> And yet ſoon after coming to look upon this lump of Blood again, I found it to have much degenerated from its former colour, to one leſs fair and more dark.</p>
               <p>We took alſo another Clot of Blood like the former, ſave that one part of it which had lain next the Air, was not black; and having in a Vial like the former pour'd on it ſome Spirit of Blood, taken out of the ſame Vial whence I took the firſt parcel, the Reddiſh colour ſeem'd preſently to be much improv'd, and made more fair, and like true Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. But the black was not ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, as to be depriv'd of its black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but retain'd a dark and dirty colour. So that this ſecond Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42323:82"/>
requires a further Tryal, when there ſhall be conveniency to make it, and it will the rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve one, becauſe what has been already recited of the Operation of the Spirit upon the two parcels of Blood, may ſuggeſt uncommon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections to Speculative Wits.</p>
               <p>And here on this occaſion it will be proper to relate to you, that having a confus'd remembrance, that I had a great while before put up ſome Humane Blood, with a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Volatile Spirit, to keep it fluid and preſerve it, without diſtinctly remembring what Volatile Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I had employ'd; I found among other Glaſſes that had been laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, one Bolt-head with a long Neck, to which was ty'd a Label, importing that at ſuch a time twelve Drams of Humane Blood, were put up with two Drams of Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood. By the date of this Paper it appear'd, that this Blood had been preſerv'd much above a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42323:82"/>
whole twelve Month; and yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd through the Glaſs of a fine Florid Colour, and ſeem'd to be little leſs than totally Fluid. And indeed when we came to open the Veſſel, which was carefully ſtopt with a good Cork, and hard Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wax, we found no ill ſcent or other ſign of Putrefaction in the Mixture, and but a very ſmall Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Blood lightly clotted at the bottom; the reſt paſſing readily through a Rag. So that the Spirit of Humane Blood ſeems to have a great embalming Vertue; ſince 'twas able ſo long and well to preſerve ſix times its weight, of a Body ſo apt to Concrete and Putrefie, as Humane Blood is known to be, and probably would have preſerv'd it much longer, if we had thought fit to proſecute the Experiment. To this account of our Trial I know not whether it will be worth while to add, that having broken it off, that we might diſtill the above mentioned Mixture with a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42323:83"/>
very gentle heat, the firſt Liquor that aſcended was not a Spirit, but a kind of Phlegm, thô afterwards there came up, beſides a Spirituous Liquor, a Volatile Salt in a dry form.</p>
               <p>On this occaſion I ſhall ſubjoyn the following Tryal, long ſince made with a Spirit, that I ſuppoſed to have been weaker than that, with which the lately mentioned Experiments were made.</p>
               <p>In order to a deſign that need not here be mentioned, I caus'd ſome Filings of <hi>Mars</hi> to be purpoſely made, that being preſently employ'd they might not contract any Ruſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the operation of our Liquor might be made doubtful. On theſe we poured ſome of our Spirit, and having kept them together a while in Digeſtion, we found as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that the Liquor had wrought on the Metal, and produc'd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of a light ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in colour almoſt like <hi>Crocus,</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:42323:83"/>
but ſomething paler. And we alſo found more than we expected; for there appeared in the Liquor good ſtore of thin Plates, like a kind of <hi>Terra Foliata,</hi> (as the Chymiſts ſpeak) which after a very ſlight agitation, being held againſt the Sunbeams, exhibited the Colours of the Rain-bow in ſo vivid a manner, as did not a little delight, as well as ſurprize the Spectators, but I did not perceive that the taſt of the Liquor was conſiderably Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>

               <p>To make ſome Trial of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Power of the Spirit of Blood, upon ſubſtances that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to Animals, I thought it might particularly conduce to ſome Medical purpoſes, to try what it would do upon the ſolid part of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42323:85"/>
Blood it ſelf ſlowly dry'd, ſo as not to be burn'd, but only to be reducible with ſome pains to fine Powder. Accordingly upon this well ſifted Powder of Blood, we put ſome moderately ſtrong Spirit of the ſame ſubject, on which the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor began very ſoon to colour it ſelf, even in the cold; and within no long time after, it appear'd as Red as ordinary French Claret Wine. This Extraction made me ſuſpect, that the Phlegm that was not carefully ſeparated from the Spirit I then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, might haſten the coloration of the <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> For which reaſon I put upon another Portion of the ſame Powder ſome rectify'd Spirit of Blood, ſo well deflegmed that it would not diſſolve a grain of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt of Blood: And I found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as I ſuſpected, that this <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> did not any thing near ſo ſoon draw a Tincture, as the other had done; for after divers hours the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour it had obtain'd was but brown,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42323:85"/>
but after ſome hours longer the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour appear'd to be heightned into Redneſs, but yet manifeſtly inferiour to that of the ſomewhat Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirit above mentioned, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it did yet in a longer time grow almoſt equal. By this means we may not only diſguiſe the Spirit of Blood, but impregnate it with the finer parts of the unanalys'd ſolid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which may poſſibly make the Spirit a Remedy more proper for ſome Diſeaſes or Conſtitutions: and this Medicine I ſometimes call the entire Tincture of Humane Blood, becauſe it conſiſts of nothing elſe but ſuch Blood.</p>
               <p>To ſhew at length that the Spirit of Humane Blood may extract Tinctures out of ſome of the hardeſt Bodies, I made the following Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.</p>
               <p>We took ſome choice Filings of Steel (for ſuch are thoſe that are ſaved by the Needlemakers) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put them into a ſmall Egg, we
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42323:86"/>
pour'd on them ſome highly rectify'd Spirit of Blood, and kept them all Night in digeſtion in a moderate heat. The next day (but not early) we found the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> turn'd of a Browniſh Red colour, that was deep enough. And ſome of the Filings that chanc'd to ſtick to the ſides of the Glaſs, but were higher than the Liquor could reach in its groſs body, <hi>ſeem'd</hi> to have been, either by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations from the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> or perhaps by the Tranſient Contact of it, as it was pouring in, turn'd into a kind of Yellow <hi>Crocus Martis.</hi> I muſt not here forget, that having kept the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> and the Filings together in the forementioned Egg for ſome days longer, the colour was grown opacous, and appear'd to be black, when it was look'd on in any conſiderable bulk, this laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion I employ, becauſe it had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother appearance, when it was ſomewhat thinly ſpread upon White Paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:42323:86"/>Perhaps it may be a Remark not altogether uſeleſs to Phyſicians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many of whom Chaly beate Remedies are in very great requeſt, if I add, that for reaſons not needful to be mentioned here, having a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that our Spirit would work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Steel, in another manner than the Acid Solvents wont to be uſed by Chymiſts and Phyſicians, we pour'd ſome of our Tincture drawn from Filings of Steel, upon a freſhly drawn Tincture of Galls (infus'd in Common Water,) and did not find that this Liquor would with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion make any Inky mixture, nor that the Precipitate that was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produc'd, was of a black, much leſs of a true Inky colour: Though I have found means to produce in a trice a black mixture, with other Martial Solutions and Tinctures, which for curioſities ſake I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made Green, ſometimes Red, ſometimes Yellow, and ſometimes, if I miſtake not, of neither of thoſe colours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:42323:87"/>I have been the more expreſs in ſetting down the Particulars above delivered, becauſe I hope they may be ſomewhat helpful to Rectify the Judgment of divers very ingenious modern Phyſicians, eſpecially among the Cultivaters of Chymiſtry, who build much upon a ſuppoſition, which though I deny not to be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, I doubt is not ſolid, and I fear may be of ill conſequence. For by the above recited Tryals it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that 'tis unſafe either to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that if Chalybeates be diſſolv'd in the body, it muſt be by ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Juice; or to conclude, that if Steel be diſſolv'd by the Liquors of the Body, it muſt be <hi>ex praedominio,</hi> (as they ſpeak) Alcaliſate; ſince a Liquor that exerciſes a great Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity againſt Acids, diſſolves it; and by parity of reaſon one may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably infer the quite contrary of what they ſuppoſe; in regard that Steel in our Experiment was (parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at leaſt) diſſolv'd by what they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42323:87"/>
call an <hi>Alcaly</hi>; and conſequently ought to be <hi>ex praedominio,</hi> of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid nature.

               <p>I put ſome Spirit of Humane Blood upon powder'd Amber, ſifted through a fine Sieve, and kept it in Digeſtion for ſome days, giving it a pretty degree of heat; but we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd not hereby any Tincture at all conſiderable; whether it was, that the Spirit was not yet highly enough rectify'd, or that the Amber (which was of a finer ſort of white Amber)
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42323:88"/>

Title may be refer'd the event that followed, upon our having put ſome Spirit of Humane Blood upon that ſort of <hi>Gum-Laccae,</hi> that comes out of the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> in Grains, and (for that reaſon) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd <hi>Seed-Lac.</hi> For the Spirit we put upon this, tho this be a reſinous Gum, and of no eaſy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſoon became tincted; which I expected it ſhould, becauſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd that the Redneſs wont to appear in many of the Seed-like Grains, is but ſuperficial, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſome adhering Blood of the little (winged) Inſects, that by their bitings occaſion the production of this Gum, upon the Twigs of the Tree where the <hi>Lac</hi> is found; on which Twigs I have more than once ſeen ſtore of theſe Gummous Grains. So that the Tincture ſeems not to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42323:88"/>
be drawn from the <hi>Lac</hi> it ſelf, but rather to be afforded by the Blood of theſe little Animals, which the Spirit of Humane Blood, that will draw Tinctures from dry'd Mans Blood, diſſolves; and this Tincture may probably be a good Medicine, ſince moſt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects us'd in Phyſick, as <hi>Millepedes,</hi> Lice, Bees, Aunts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Even in our colder Climates, afford Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of very ſubtle and pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, and of conſiderable effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.</p>

               <p>OF the Precipitating Power of Spirit of Humane Blood, I have yet obſerv'd nothing that is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, and therefore it may ſuffice to ſay in general, that, as far as I have had occaſion to try, it has in common with thoſe other Volatile Spirits, which I elſewhere call <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinous,</hi> a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Precipitating moſt Bodies that are diſſolv'd in Acid <hi>Menſtruums</hi> I ſay <hi>moſt,</hi> becauſe (as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more fully ſhewn) it is an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, though a vulgar one, to ſuppoſe (as Chymiſts and Phyſicians are wont to do) that whatever is <hi>diſſolv'd</hi> by an <hi>Acid</hi> will be <hi>Precipitated</hi> by an <hi>Alcali</hi> as ſuch, whether Fixt or Volatile, which latter ſort they take
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42323:90"/>
the ſpirits of Urine, Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be of. For there is no Neceſſity this Rule ſhould hold, when the Body is of ſuch a nature, that it may be diſſolv'd as well by an <hi>Alcaly</hi> as by an <hi>Acid.</hi> And though, the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of <hi>Alcali</hi> and <hi>Acidum</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not to think there were any ſuch Bodies, yet I have in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paper Experimentally evinc'd, that there are ſo. And it may be prov'd without going very far, ſince we lately obſerv'd <note n="a" rend="inter">See the viii. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</note> that good Spirit of Humane Blood Would in the cold diſſolve both Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; Zink, which are Bodies that will each of them be readily diſſolv'd by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Acid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bating ſuch Bodies as thoſe I have been ſpeaking of, I have not found but that Spirit of Humane Blood Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates other Bodies diſſolv'd in Acid <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> much after the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42323:91"/>
ſame manner that Spirit of Urine and other ſuch Volatile Alcalies are wont to do. Of this, among other Inſtances, I remember that I made Tryal upon Red-lead or <hi>Minium</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in the Acid Salt of Vinegar, Silver in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> Gold in <hi>Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> and Tin diſſolv'd in an appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> I alſo with our Spirit Precipitated the Solutions of divers other Bodies, which need not here be nam'd. But in regard of the great and frequent uſe that men make of Sea Salt, in preſerving and ſeaſoning what they eat, it may not be amiſs particularly to mention that out of a ſolution of common Salt made in common Water, we could readily Precipitate with the Spirit of Blood, a ſubſtance that looked like a White Earth; and ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I obtain'd in far greater quantity, from that which the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers call <hi>Bittern,</hi> which uſually remains in their Salt pans after they have taken out as much, or near as

               <p>The Spirit of Humane Blood does alſo make a Precipitation of <hi>Dantſick</hi> Vitriol diſſolv'd in Water, but not, that I have obſerv'd, a total one, which you need not wonder at, becauſe it will diſſolve Copper, which is one of the Ingredients of Blew Vitriol.</p>

               <p>The like Relation may be found between <hi>Spirit of Blood</hi> and many other Liquors, which it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and tedious to enumerate.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42323:93"/>
it will permanently unite, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that theſe two Liquors do (to ſpeak in their Language) belong even to differing <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> the one to the <hi>Animal,</hi> and the other to the <hi>Vegetable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the Eſſential Oyls (as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts call them) of Aromatick Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, or at leaſt with ſome of them the well Rectifyed Spirit of H. Blood ſeems to have a greater Affinity. For having taken a dram of this Liquor, and an equal weight of Oyl of Aniſe-ſeeds drawn in a Lembick [<hi>per veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi>] and ſhaken them well together they made a ſoft or ſemifluid White <hi>Coagulum,</hi> that continu'd in that form for a day or two, and probably would have longer done ſo, if I had not had occaſion to proceed further with it.</p>
               <p>It may not be impertinent on this occaſion to take notice, that becauſe I preſum'd, that, though Spirit of Blood would not totally mix with Eſſential Oyls, (as Chymiſts call
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42323:94"/>
them) it might either communicate ſome Saline parts to them, or work a change in them; I digeſted a while in a Glaſs with a long neck, ſome Rectifyed Spirit of Humane Blood, with a convenient quantity of Oyl of Aniſe-ſeeds drawn in a Lembick, and found, as I expected, that the Oyl grew colour'd of a high Yellow, and afterwards attain'd to a Redneſs; which Experiment I the rather mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may poſſibly afford you a hint about the Cauſe, of ſome Changes of Colour, that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in ſome of the Liquors of the Body.</p>
               <p>Upon the foremention'd Affinity or congruity of the Spirit of Blood with that of Wine, and with (ſome) Eſſential Oyls, I founded a way of taking off the offenſive ſmell of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Humane Blood, which is the only thing that is likely to keep the more delicate ſort of Patients from employing ſo uſeful a Medicine, as this will hereafter appear to be.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42323:94"/>
But to deal with a Philoſophical can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, I muſt not conceal from you, that, till Experience ſhall be duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, I ſhall retain a Doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the way employ'd to deprive our Spirit of its <hi>ſtink,</hi> will not alſo deprive it of part of its <hi>Efficacy.</hi> But on the other ſide, I conſider it as a thing probable enough, that theſe Aromatis'd Spirits may, by being impregnated with many of the finer parts of the Oyls employ'd to correct their Odour, be likewiſe endow'd with the vertues of thoſe Oyls, which are Liquors that Chymiſts not improbably believe to conſiſt of the nobleſt parts of the Vegetables that afford them.</p>
               <p>To Aromatiſe the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood we employ'd two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ways, the firſt whereof was this; we took a convenient quantity of well Rectifyed Spirit of Blood and having put it into a Glaſs Egg, we added to it as much, or (what may in many Caſes more than ſuffice)
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42323:95"/>
half as much, Eſſential Oyl of Aniſe-ſeeds for inſtance; And having ſhaken theſe Liquors together to mingle them very well, we plac'd the Glaſs in a ſit poſture, in a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace where it ſhould not have too great a heat, by which means the ſlight Texture of the <hi>Coagulum</hi> being diſſolv'd, part of the Oyl (ſometimes a great portion of it) appear'd by it ſelf floating at the top of the Spirit. Whence being ſeparated by a Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel or otherwiſe, the remaining Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor was Whitiſh and without any ſtink, the ſmell predominant in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the Aniſe-ſeeds, of which it taſted ſtrongly, though the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Spirituous parts of the Blood did in this Liquor retain a not inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degree of their brisk and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant Taſt.</p>
               <p>The other way I thought of to Aromatiſe our Spirit of Blood, was by employing a <hi>Medium</hi> to unite it with Eſſential Oyls. For which purpoſe in a Vinous Spirit, ſo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegm'd
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42323:95"/>
that in a Silver ſpoon it would totally burn away, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd by ſhaking a convenient proportion, as an eighth part or a far leſs (according to the ſtrength of the Oyl) of an Eſſential Oyl (of Aniſe-ſeeds for inſtance,) and to this ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we added an equal quantity, or ſome other convenient one, of our Rectifyed Spirit of Blood, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſhaking mix'd them as well as we could, we ſuffer'd the expected <hi>Coagulum</hi> (which was ſoft and not uniform) to reſt for ſome time, after which it appear'd that ſome of the Oyl was reviv'd, and ſwam in drops diſtinct from the other Liquor, which conſiſted of a Mixture of the two Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, impregnated with the Particles of the Oyl they had intercepted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. This Liquor abounded with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concretions made by the concoagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Sanguineous</hi> and <hi>Vinous</hi> Spirits. And theſe with a very gentle heat ſublim'd in the form of a Volatile Salt, to the upper part of the Glaſs;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42323:96"/>
Which Salt ſeem'd to have a much leſs penetrating odour, then the meer Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, but had quite loſt its <hi>ſtink,</hi> and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a conſiderable Quickneſs, and ſomewhat of the ſcent of the Aniſe Seeds; the remaining Liquor alſo was depriv'd of its ill ſmell, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately imbued with that of the Oyl.</p>
               <p>I thought it worth trying, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there would be any Affinity between our Spirit (which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd contain'd in it many latent Particles of an Oleaginous nature) and the highly rectifyed Oyl of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troleum</hi>; which is a Mineral <hi>Bitumen</hi>: and having ſhaken together a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient quantity of theſe two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in a new Vial, they preſently turn'd into a White Mixture. And tho after it had for many hours been left to ſettle, the greater part of the Oyl ſwam above the Spirit, yet there appear'd betwixt the two Liquors a good quantity of a whitiſh Matter, which ſeem'd to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42323:96"/>
be ſomething that had been produc'd by the Precipitation or Union of many Particles of the Spirit and Oyl, that were more diſpos'd than the reſt to combine with one another.</p>

               <p>THat the Contact of the Air has a ſpeedy and a manifeſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Humane Blood, is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewn by ſome Experiments of an <hi>Italian Virtuoſo, Signior</hi> — and ſome of mine. But whether, after Humane Blood has had its Texture ſo much alter'd, as it uſes to be by Diſtillation, it will retain any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Relation to the Air, I have not been able to make Tryals enough to determine; but however it will not be amiſs, to ſet down the chief Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments I made on this occaſion, becauſe they may be conſiderable as parts of our Hiſtory, tho they ſhould not be ſo, as Arguments deciſive of our controverſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:42323:97"/>The firſt Experiment was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, by thinly ſpreading upon a piece of White Paper, (which ought to be cloſe, that it may not ſoak up the Liquor) ſome ſmall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Copper, and wetting them well, without covering them quite over, with a few drops of good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Blood, for by this means being very much expos'd to the free Air, the Action of the Liquor was ſo much promoted, that within a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute or two it did, even in the cold, begin to acquire a blewiſh colour, and in fewer Minutes than one would have expected, that colour was ſo heightened as to become Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleous. But when I put another parcel of the ſame Filings into a Vial, and cover'd them with Spirit of Blood, and then ſtopt the Vial, to keep it from intercourſe with the external Air, the Liquor would not in ſome Hours acquire ſo deep a colour.</p>
               <p>The other Experiment we made, in order to the lately propos'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42323:97"/>
was the ſame for ſubſtance, that I had formerly made, (and have elſewhere at large deliver'd) with the Spirit of Urine, and with that of Sal-Armoniac, ſave that, to ſpare our Spirit of Blood, we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd a far leſs quantity of it, then we did of either of the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Liquors. For having in a clear Cylindrical Vial of about an Inch Diameter, put more Filings of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than were requiſite to cover the bottom, we pour'd upon it, but ſo much Spirit of Humane Blood, as ſerv'd to ſwim a Fingers breadth, or about an Inch above them. This Liquor, becauſe of the quantity of Air, that was contain'd in the Vial, did within few Hours acquire a rich Blew colour, and this after a day or two began to grow more faint, and continued to do ſo more and more, till it came to be almoſt loſt; but yet the Liquor was not altogether Lympid, or colourleſs, as I have often had it with Spirit of Urine, or
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42323:98"/>
of Sal-Armoniac; which remains of blewiſhneſs I was apt to attribute to the great quantity of Air, that was included in the Vial with ſo ſmall a quantity of Liquor. And tho I thought it not impoſſible, but that length of time might deſtroy theſe Remains of blewiſhneſs alſo, yet not having leiſure to wait ſo long, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopt the Vial, and perceiv'd, as I expected, that in a very ſhort time, perhaps about two Minutes of an hour, the Surface of the Liquor, where it was touch'd by the newly enter'd Air, became Ceruleous, and in a ſhort time after, perhaps leſs than a quarter of an hour, the whole Body of the Liquor had attain'd a deeper colour than that of the Sky, which colour, the Vial being ſeaſonably and carefully ſtop't, began in two or three days to grow paler again.</p>
               <p>Theſe Experiments would, I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not, to many ſeem manifeſtly to infer a great Cognation or Affinity (for I know not well what name to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42323:98"/>
give it) between the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood and the Air. But tho I ſhall not deny the Concluſion as 'tis an Aſſertion, I dare not rely on the validity of the Inference; becauſe I have for curioſities ſake made the like Experiments ſucceed, with other Spirits abounding with Volatile Salt. I foreſee it may very ſpeciouſly be pretended, that thoſe Tryals ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the account of ſome Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the Blood, ſince Spirit of Urine is made of a Liquor ſeparated from the Blood; and that, tho the Sal-Armoniack that is made in the Eaſt, may conſiſt in great part of Camels Urine, yet that which is made in Europe, (where Camels are rarities) and is commonly ſold in our Shops, is made of Mans Urine, and conſequently its Spirit may well be preſum'd to be impregnated with Spirit of Humane Blood. And I confeſs, that when this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came firſt into my mind, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo probable, that I ſhould
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42323:99"/>
perhaps have acquieſced in it, if it were not for what I am going to ſubjoyn; namely, That I found by Tryal carefully made, that with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Volatile Spirit made without any ſubſtance that is afforded by the body of Man, I could with Filings of Copper make an Experiment, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry analogous to that above related. But becauſe in <hi>this</hi> Tryal, the reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated contact of the Air produc'd in the Liquor not a Ceruleous, but a Green colour, I am willing to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend my Judgment about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem lately propos'd, till experience ſhall have further inform'd me.</p>
               <p>I know not whether it will be worth while to relate, that having in an unſtopt Glaſs, put ſome Spirit of Humane Blood into a Receiver, plac'd upon our Pneumatick Engine, and withdrawn the incumbent Air by pumping; the Spirit of Blood ſeem'd to afford leſſer and fewer Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Bubbles, than ſuch a quantity of Common Water it ſelf would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42323:99"/>

But, as I lately intimated, I know not whether this obſervation be conſiderable, becauſe being not willing to weaken by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it, a freſh parcel of Spirit, I know not whether the paucity of Air obſerv'd in that lately mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, were accidental or not.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THat there is in the Spirit of Humane Blood, ſuch a thing, as a Chymiſt or a vulgar Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher would call <hi>Hoſtility,</hi> or an <hi>Antipathy</hi> in reference to <hi>Acids,</hi> has been plainly enough, tho very briefly, intimated in a Paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the third of the precedent Titles. But yet it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42323:100"/>
to add in this place, that our Spirit of Humane Blood exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes this Hoſtility againſt more than one ſort of Acid Spirits, tho perhaps they differ not a little from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Nitre, Spirit and Oyl of Vitriol, <hi>Aqua For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Aqua Regia, &amp;c.</hi> and not only againſt <hi>Factitious Acids,</hi> but againſt <hi>Natural</hi> ones too, the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood may diſcover a manifeſt Hoſtility, as I found by the conflict it would make with newly expreſs'd Juice of Lemmons which it would put into a confus'd agitation accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with bubbles. And this was yet the more evident, when I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd the Volatile Salt of Blood, that is, the Spirit in a dry form: for having ſqueez'd upon a parcel of this, ſome Juice of Lemmons, there was preſently excited a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, accompany'd not only with froth, but with noiſe. But (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the ſtrongly Acid Liquors made by Diſtillation) whether the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42323:100"/>
great commotion, and froth, and hiſſing noiſe, that uſually follows upon the mixing of Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood with any of theſe <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums,</hi> do proceed from a true Hoſtility, or an Antipathy deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo call'd, or elſe be a motion to Coaleſcence or Union; or an effect of the diſturb'd motions proper to the differing, but now confounded, Liquors; or laſtly, a conſequent of ſome Impediment, which the new Texture of the mingled Liquors gives to the free paſſage of ſome Aethereal or other ſuttle Permeating Matter or Fluid, I ſhall not take upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; but rather to what I lately told you, of the at leaſt ſeeming contrariety of the Spirit of Humane Blood to Acid Spirits, I ſhall add (what perhaps you did not expect) that this Hoſtility extends even to the inviſible <hi>Effluvia</hi> or Emanations of theſe Liquors, as may be readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen by the following way, that I long ſince pitch'd upon to make
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42323:101"/>
it not only viſible but manifeſt.</p>
               <p>This is eaſily done by putting any ſtrong Acid Spirit, as of Salt, or of Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into a Vial ſomewhat wide-mouth'd, and ſome well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegm'd Spirit of Blood into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for when I purpoſely inclin'd theſe Glaſſes ſo towards one another, that their Lips did almoſt touch, and their reſpective Liquors were ready to run out, <hi>tho</hi> neither of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors did at all viſibly fume whilſt they were kept aſunder, tho the Glaſſes were unſtopt, <hi>yet,</hi> as ſoon as the Liquors came to be approached in the way juſt now mention'd, the Fumes meeting each other in the Air would make little Coalitions, which would be manifeſtly viſible in the form of aſcending Smoke, which was wont at firſt to ſurprize the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Spectators; and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Smoke would continue a good while, if the Vials were not ſever'd to make it ceaſe, which upon their remove it would preſently do.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42323:101"/>
I have divers times practis'd a more eaſy way of making theſe Fumes conſpicuous; but it belongs more to another Paper, and what has been now deliver'd may ſuffice for my preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Yet it may not be improper to take this occaſion, to acquaint you with an Experiment that I made, to obſerve what the contrary Salts, that abound in our Spirit of Blood and in ſome Acid Liquors, would produce, when they were combin'd and brought into a dry form. I ſhall therefore annex a Tranſcript of the Experiment I ſpeak of, as I find it regiſtred in one of my Note Books.</p>
               <p>[We took ſome pure Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, and having juſt ſatiated it with Spirit of Nitre, we ſlowly evaporated away the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous moiſture, that the Acid and Urinous Salts might be united into a dry Concretion, from which my deſign was to ſeparate them again, the Salt of Blood in its Priſtine form,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42323:102"/>
and the Spirit of Nitre in the form of Salt-peter. To effect this, we put the compounded Salt into a ſmall Bolt-head with a long and ſlender neck, and then added to it a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of Salt of Tartar, and as much diſtill'd Water as would ſuffice to make the Mixture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Liquid, to promote the Action of the contrary Salts upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By which mutual Actions we ſuppos'd, that the Saline Spirits of Nitre, being more congruous to the fix'd Salt than to the Volatile, would forſake the Salt of Blood, (which it detain'd before from flying away,) and give it leave to ſublime; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly having kept the Glaſs, wherein the mixture was made, for a competent time in a convenient heat, we obtain'd what we look'd for; ſince a good proportion of fine Volatile Salt aſcended in a dry form, into the Neck.]</p>
               <p>Having put to ſome of the Spirit of Humane Blood, a ſmall quantity
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42323:102"/>
of exceeding ſtrong Spirit of Nitre, there was upon the conflict of the two Liquors excited ſo great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of thick white Fumes, that I could not but wonder at it, having never ſeen any thing of that kind comparable to it. And theſe Fumes Circulating long in the Cavity of the Glaſs, whereof perhaps a tenth part was full of Liquor, did many of them, tho the Veſſel were wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd, fall back and run down the ſides of the Glaſs into the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant mixture, as if they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd ſtreams of a Milky Liquor. And when at length, after theſe Fumes had diſappear'd, we dropt in a little more of the ſame ſmoaking Spirit of Nitre, the like ſtrange plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of white Exhalations did preſently enſue, and continue to Circulate a great while in the open Glaſs, the Mixture in the mean while appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reddiſh. Being ſettled, and ſeeming to have been ſo diſcolour'd by a fattiſh ſubſtance, we put to it a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42323:103"/>
little Rain or Diſtill'd Water, and having by Filtration ſeparated it from the <hi>Faeces,</hi> and ſlowly evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the thus Clarified Liquor, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line parts ſhot into Cryſtals much of the ſhape, and croſſing one another much after the manner, of <hi>Stiriae</hi> of Salt-peter; but their colour after a while appear'd Yellow, as if ſome Oyly ſubſtance were yet mix'd with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> Tho on ſeveral occaſions the Spirit of Blood appear'd thus. Oily, yet I remember I had not long ſince ſome Diſtill'd from another parcel of Blood, which after having been kept a year, was limpid and colourleſs like an ordinary Vegetable Spirit.</p>
               <p>Some of the forementioned Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalls being put upon well kindled Charcoals, did preſently melt and burn away with a noiſe not unlike Salt-peter; but the flame ſeem'd not quite ſo halituous, and was more differing in colour, being not at all Blew but very Yellow. After the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42323:103"/>
deflagration was quite paſt, I was curious to ſee if any fixt ſubſtance was left upon the Coals, and found it to be ſomewhat odd; for it was not of a light colour, nor of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent Body, like Aſhes, but a little lump of a dirty colour'd mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which I could not perceive an Alcaliſate taſt, and indeed ſcarce any at all. And this brittle ſubſtance (for ſuch it was) being held in the flame, became red hot, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing deſtroy'd by that Ignition, no more than afterwards it did by being a good while kept upon a glowing Coal.</p>

               <p>HAving reſided for many years laſt paſt, in a place ſo well furniſhed with learned Phyſicians as <hi>London is,</hi> I was careful to decline the occaſions of entrenching upon their profeſſion. And tho that care did not always ſecure me quiet, yet it did it ſo far, as that you, to whom my circumſtances are not unknown, will not I hope expect, that I ſhould ſay much upon my own experience, of the Medicinal Vertues of Spirit of Humane Blood; yet ſince I had ſome few opportunities to get Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als made by practitioners in Phyſick, (who were pleas'd very willingly to make them for me,) that I may
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42323:104"/>
not leave this Subject wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd, I will ſubjoyn what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, either to my Memory, or to my Thoughts, about it.</p>
               <p>When I conſider, that, as far as I have obſerv'd, we do not meet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly with any <hi>Acid</hi> Subſtance, (except perhaps in the <hi>Succus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaticus</hi>) in a ſound Humane Body: For the fixt Salt of Blood does it ſelf much reſemble Sea-ſalt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its Spirit be Acid or no; whereas the ſeveral parts of it, whether <hi>Solid,</hi> as Bones, or <hi>Liquid,</hi> as Blood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford in Diſtillation ſtore of Liquor impregnated with Volatile Salt; I am induc'd to think it probable, that the Spirit of Humane Blood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch a Salt abounds, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is the main and predominant Ingredient, is like to have notable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations upon the Humane Body, and afford Medicines of great Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in many of its Diſeaſes. And, tho againſt moſt of theſe it is to be <hi>internally</hi> given, yet there are ſome
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42323:105"/>
againſt which it may be ſucceſsful, when but <hi>Externally</hi> adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>as</hi> well rectified Spirit of Humane Blood abounds with very ſubtile Particles, which in point of Taſt, Odour, Diffuſiveneſs and Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trancy, do much reſemble thoſe of ſtrong Spirits of Urine, of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, and of Sal-Armoniack; ſo one may very probably expect to find the ſame vertues in the Spirit of Blood, that Experience has manifeſted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thoſe other Spirituous Liquors.</p>
               <p>I have ſeldom, if ever, ſeen any Medicine operate ſo nimbly in Fits of the Mother, as a well dephlegm'd Spirit of Sal-Armoniac; which as I formerly noted is in effect mainly a Spirit of Urine; which it ſelf is granted to be, a Liquor ſeparated from Blood: for this Spirit being held to the Noſes of Hyſterical Women, has often in a trice, to the wonder of the By-ſtanders fetch'd them out of their Fits. Nor is this the conſiderableſt effect that I have
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42323:105"/>
had of this Spirit, for ſometimes it has with a ſtrange quickneſs brought to themſelves Patients that were fallen to the ground, and either real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were, or were judg'd to be, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptical. And even in Agonizing Perſons, where it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, it would frequently for the time, bring them out of their ſwoons, and make them know and underſtand the Aſſiſtants, and perhaps ſpeak to them too: of which, if it were needful I could give more then one inſtance. But I ſhall rather add, that if nature be not quite ſpent, and the caſe wholly deſperate, this may be of great advantage, becauſe it allows the Phyſician ſome (tho perhaps but little) time, and a good opportunity to adminiſter other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which the Patient, unleſs excited and brought to himſelf, would not be made to take. Of which I ſhall give you a memorable inſtance in a Patient of the very learned Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s, who being in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42323:106"/>
the Fitt of an Apoplexy, when he was neceſſitated to go from her out of the Town, and leave her in that Condition, he Committed her to the care of a very Ingenious Phyſician, who (whether by his direction or no, I remember not) came to me to acquaint me with it, complaining that they could not hope for any ſucceſs of their Remedies, in regard ſhe was ſo ſtupid, and had ſhut her mouth ſo, that they could not get any down; whereupon I gave him, and told him the uſe of, a very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirit that I had by me for ſuch caſes, tho I remember not, whether it were of Sal-armoniac, or ſome other Volatile and Liquid Alcaly; by applying which to her Noſe, the Phyſician found he could preſently make her open her Eyes, and in part come to her ſelf; but then ſhe would again, when the Glaſs was remov'd, ſoon relapſe into her former Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore having by thoſe frequent Viciſſitudes gain'd ſome
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42323:106"/>
time, and got a Medicine for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he then held the glaſs to her Noſe for a good while together; by which means ſhe ſo recovered her ſenſes, that ſhe knew the By-ſtanders, and being exhorted to take a Medicine that was offered her, which they told her would do her much good, ſhe underſtood them, and ſwallowed it; and tho afterwards, upon the removal of the Vial, ſhe relaps'd into a ſenſeleſs ſtate, yet by the help of the Urinous Spirit they kept her alive, till the very brisk Medicine ſhe had taken began to act its part, and make a Copious Evacuation, which did not only rouſe her, but little by little relieve her; So that in a ſhort time ſhe happily eſcap'd a danger, that was judg'd to be very hardly, if at all, ſuperable by any Medicines. But here I muſt give you notice, that in ſuch difficult and deſperate Caſes I am not content that a Vial with a ſomewhat long neck be held to the noſe, but ſometimes order that little
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42323:107"/>
Pellets of Lint or Cotton, or of thin rags, be dipt into the Spirit and thruſt up into the Noſtrils. And the ſame thing I would adviſe, if need ſhould require it, in the adminiſtration of Spirit of Humane Blood. And <hi>as,</hi> for external uſes, I make a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Preparation of Spirit of Sal-Armoniac, or of Urine, that is more ſtrong and penetrant, then that which is made the more ordinary way: <hi>So,</hi> if I had been furniſh'd with ſtore of Spirit of Blood, I would have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it in a not very unlike manner. And however with the little I had, I made the following Experiment, for Tryals ſake. We took ſome dry'd Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, (being then better able to ſpare that than Spirit,) and put to it as much Spirit of Nitre, as would juſt ſerve to ſatiate it; and then by Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we obtain'd thence an Anomalous kind of compounded Salt, which afterwards, becauſe we deſired a Medicine in a dry form, we ſublim'd
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42323:107"/>
from a Convenient quantity of a well choſen <hi>fixed Alcaly,</hi> (if I miſtake not, we took an equall weight of <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi>) fit to retain, not only the Phlegmatick parts, but the Oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous too, which oftentimes lye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd in Volatile Salts and Liquors, wherein they do not at all at firſt appear, and unto which the greateſt part of their foetid or offenſive ſmell may probably be imputed. By this means we obtain'd a dry white Salt of a very piercing ſmell. But I had no opportunity to try this ſublim'd Salt upon diſeaſed Perſons: for whoſe ſake, I alſo made uſe of another way to bring over the Saline part of Blood in a <hi>Liquid</hi> form, (which for the uſe of ſmelling I for the moſt part prefer to the <hi>dry</hi>) for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we mix'd two parts of dry'd Humane Blood, with three parts of Lime, and then diſtill'd them with a pretty ſtrong Fire, by which means we obtain'd, as we expected, a pretty deal of Spirit unaccompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any Volatile Salt in a dry
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42323:108"/>
form, which Spirit ſeem'd, even without Rectification, to have a ſtronger ſmell, and a more fiery taſt then other Spirit of Blood, after a Rectification. And I gueſs'd that if we had taken more or ſtronger Lime, we ſhould have had leſs Oyl, and a more piercing Spirit, ſince the Lime would probably have retain'd moſt of the Oyl, and perhaps all the Superfluous Moiſture.</p>
               <p>I have likewiſe often found, that ſlighter Head-aches have been cured in leſs (and perhaps much leſs) time than a quarter of an hour, by the baſe ſmell of ſome of theſe well depurated Volatile Alcalies; and if I miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not, I have been relieved particularly by that of <hi>H. B.</hi>) and I have very rarely for theſe many years us'd, or (thanks be to God) needed any other Medicine to free my ſelf from pains of the Head. And even Violent and durable pains of that part have been, if not quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd yet much leſſen'd, by the ſame remedy often reiterated, which I have
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42323:108"/>
likewiſe obſerv'd to be uſually enough very effectual in faintings, eſpecially thoſe of Hyſterical and Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal Women; which makes it probable, that our Spirit of Humane Blood, which is a Liquor that in many Qualities manifeſtly reſembles other Volatile Alcalies, (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſurpaſſes them,) and which, when well freed from its Oyl, can by few, if by any, be diſtinguiſht from other Urinous Spirits, may by its odour be available in the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Maladies. I expect you ſhould tell me, that the ill ſcent of Spirit of Blood will hinder that ſex from uſeing it externally, to divers of whoſe Diſtempers it is the moſt proper. To this it may be anſwer'd, that moſt of thoſe that find themſelves in pain or danger, would be content to be eas'd or reſcu'd by an unpleaſant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. For we may apply to health, what <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> ſaid of the Tax that was paid him, upon the ſcore of Urine, <hi>Lucri bonus odor ex re qualibet.</hi> And
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42323:109"/>
accordingly we ſee, that Ladies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ordinarily make uſe in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of burnt Feathers, and in theſe and ſome others of <hi>Caſtoreum, Galbanum</hi> and <hi>Aſafoetida,</hi> whoſe ſmells are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive enough to men. But for the more delicate and Nauſeous Patients, one may much leſſen the offenſive odour of our Spirit, by long Digeſtions, or by reiterated, or skilful Rectifications. And if even then they cannot be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to the odour of ſo good a Remedy, that odour may (as was formerly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated on another occaſion) be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by uniting it with a Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of highly rectified Spirit of Wine; by which means it may perhaps (for I am not ſure on't) loſe ſomewhat of its penetrancy, as well as of its Urinous odour, but yet may remain ſubtile and active enough for divers good purpoſes. And if you would not only correct the ſmell of the Spirit of Blood, but make it afford a fragrant one, you may do it by diſſolving in the Spirit of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42323:109"/>
Wine a convenient quantity of ſome Aromatick, or other well ſcented, Chymical Oyl, whoſe proportion may be found by letting it fall drop after drop into the Vial, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaking it to mingle the Liquors well, till you find by your ſmell, That the offenſive odour of the Spirit of Blood is ſufficiently obſcured; or (if you will not only correct it, but perfume the Liquor) that the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſufficiently imbued with the grateful Odour of the Oyl, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you compounded it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add on this occaſion, that, if we aim chiefly at correcting or changing the ſmell of Spirit of Blood, we may uſefully employ a Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Oyl, more mild or temperate than the Aromatick ones of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Cloves. For Tryal purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made has inform'd me, that, if the Oyl of <hi>Rhodium</hi> (which is much eſteem'd by perfumers) be ſincerely and skilfully made, (which I fear it is not over frequently) a very few
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42323:110"/>
drops of it will make an ounce of Alcohole of Wine ſo fragrant, that this Solution being ſhaken together with a convenient quantity (perhaps much leſs than an equal one) of well rectify'd Spirit of Humane Blood, there will emerge a mixture, that I found to have a ſcent brisk enough, and yet to be not only free from ſtink, but imbu'd, tho not ſtrongly, with the Odoriferous Particles of the <hi>Rhodium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt not here omit, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers happy Practitioners, as well Phyſicians as profeſs'd Chymiſts, do highly extol the Oyl of Amber, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Convulſion fits and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Brain and <hi>Genus Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſum</hi>: And indeed Experience has ſo recommended <hi>ſome</hi> Medicines of Amber to me, that in ſome caſes there are few that I more willingly give or take. And beſides the great Character that <hi>Helmont</hi> has left of Amber diſſolv'd in Spirit of Wine, Experience has brought ſuch Credit
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42323:110"/>
to it in divers caſes, (for there are ſome caſes and conſtitutions wherein I ſuſpect it of too much heat) that many Patients, as well Women as Men, had much rather endure the ſmell, than deny themſelves the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Tincture or the Oyl. And if you have any ſuch Patients, perhaps you will not be ill pleas'd to be advertiz'd, that you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the formerly mentioned way, employ the high Tincture of Amber taken with Spirit of Wine; to correct the Odour, and encreaſe (at leaſt in number) the Vertues of Spirit of Humane Blood. And becauſe it requires ſome skill, and not ſeldom a pretty deal of time, to draw this Tincture from Crude Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, tho finely powder'd, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought my ſelf of the following way, to draw ſpeedily a ſtrong Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from the Oyl it ſelf; for, tho this Oyl will not, even by long ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, diſſolve throughly in Spirit of Wine, as the Aromatick and other
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42323:111"/>
Oyls lately mentioned will do; yet I found that by well ſhaking thoſe two Liquors together, and leaving them to ſettle at leiſure; tho they would ſeparate into diſtinct Maſſes, yet the Spirit of Wine would even in the cold extract from the Oyl a fine Tincture of a high Yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, little, if at all, different from that of the Oyl it ſelf. Of which Tincture I afterwards mix'd as much with Spirit of Blood, as ſuffic'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the Urinous ſmell, and make that of the Oyl of Amber ſomewhat predominant, and as we judg'd, more ſubtile and brisk than it was before.</p>
               <p>Three things more I have to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate concerning the external uſe of our Spirit of Blood. The firſt is, that by what has been ſaid of the good effects it may have, when (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has been, by the lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned or other preparations, imbu'd with Chymical Oyls) it is ſmelt to, I would by no means be thought to deny, that it is after theſe changes
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42323:111"/>
fit to be alſo inwardly employ'd, as I ſhall have ere long occaſion more particularly to declare. My ſecond Admonition ſhall be, that, whereas in ſome mixtures it will be hard to hit upon the proportion of the Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Oyl, or other things employ'd to correct the ſmell of the Spirit of Blood, ſo exactly, but that after the mixture has had ſome time to ſettle, a ſeparation of ſome oleaginous parts will be made: The bulk of the mixture may be freed from it, by pouring all into a Glaſs Tunnel ſomewhat ſharp at the bottom, after the manner us'd among Chymiſts to ſeparate Oyls from other Liquors, and then the mixture that will run through before the Oyl, may be kept cloſe ſtopt in a Vial by it ſelf, and the fragrant Oyl (unleſs it be of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Cloves) reſerv'd for other uſes. And whereas frequently, if not moſt commonly, if the Vinous Spirit were ſufficiently Rectified, there will, by the Concoagulation

of the Saline and Urinous Particles, be produc'd a kind of Salt; you may either pour the Liquid part from it into another Vial, and uſe each of them ſeparately without more ado, or elſe without thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating them, you may ſublime with a very gentle warmth, as much as will aſcend from the reſt of the Mixture in a dry form. And this <hi>Sal Volatile Oleoſum</hi> of Spirit of Blood, when it was duly prepar'd, I found to be depriv'd of its former bad ſcent, and perhaps endow'd with a fragrant one, and yet to have an Odour more ſubtile, brisk, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, than I had thought it reaſonable to expect. The third and laſt thing I would advertiſe, is, that beſides thoſe Medicinal uſes, that may be made of the Odours of Spirit of Blood Simple or Compounded, it may have conſiderable Vertues, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in ſubſtance as a Liquor, by way of Fomentation or otherwiſe; which I think the more likely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

the Spirit of Sal-Armoniac has been much commended, for mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſharp pains of the Gout, and is ſaid to have been ſucceſsfully us'd in the <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> And when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that our Liquor is very Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous and Penetrating, and ſo fit to ſtrengthen and reſolve, and alſo of an Alcaliſate nature, which fits it to mortify Acidities, it ſeems very probable, that, by vertue of theſe and other friendly Qualities, it may, by being apply'd in its Liquid form, prove good in divers caſes, where the Chyrurgions or the Phyſicians help is wont to be requir'd.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Have long been prone to think, that 'tis not neceſſary the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſpecifically different <hi>Morbific Matters</hi> (as Phyſicians call <hi>actually noxious Humours</hi> or other ſubſtances) in the Humane Body, ſhould be near ſo great as that of the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> 'tis obnoxious to; and conſequently, that every <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> that has a diſtinct <hi>Name</hi> aſſign'd to it, does not always require a diſtinct ſort of <hi>Peccant Matter</hi> to produce it; but that the ſame hurtful <hi>Humour,</hi> or other <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> may produce ſickneſſes that paſs for differing ones, (and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have diſtinct Denominations) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the ſame <hi>Morbific Agents</hi> bad

To this Opinion I have been led by divers Inducements, that I ſhall not now ſtay to ſet down; eſpecially, ſince the probability of it may be eaſily deduc'd, from what frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough occurs among ſick perſons, of the <hi>Metaſtaſes</hi> of Morbific Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the ſame Acid or Sharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, for inſtance, producing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Colic, ſometimes after that a Palſey, ſometimes a Cough, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Flux of the Belly, ſometimes an <hi>Ophthalmi<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to the hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42323:114"/>
Notion 'tis very agreeable, that one Remedy, by being capable victoriouſly to oppugn one or two of the principal kinds of Morbific Matter, may be able to cure differing Diſeaſes; eſpecially if it be endow'd with any variety of active Vertues. And upon this ground I am apt to think, that the Spirit of Humane Blood, skilfully Prepar'd and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, may be a good Remedy in no ſmall number of Internal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Humane Body. And indeed Volatile Alcalies in general, have been in <hi>England</hi> ſo proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly made uſe of in Phyſick, ſince the year 1656, (about which time I had the good fortune to contribute ſo to introduce them, as to bring them by degrees into requeſt, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging eaſy ways of making them, as well as by declaring their Vertues) that I ſee ſmall cauſe to doubt, but that they will hereafter be more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally eſteem'd and employ'd, than yet they are, and will little by little
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42323:114"/>
invite Phyſicians to prefer them to a great many vulgar Remedies, that for want of better are yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe, tho they clog or weaken the Patient, and want divers advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Qualities that may be found in Volatile Alcalies. For (to apply what has been ſaid to our preſent Subject, as an inſtance that may ſerve for other Urinous Spirits) the Spirit of Humane Blood is endowed with divers Qualities, that are both Active and Medicinal. For it mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies Acid Salts, which are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſeveral Diſeaſes, and, if I miſtake not, of ſome that are not wont to be imputed to them. It is a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent, and on that ſcore fit to open Obſtructions, that produce more than a few Diſeaſes. It is both Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick and Diuretick, and on both theſe accounts fit to aſſiſt Nature, to diſcharge divers Noxious Salts, and expel divers Contagious or Malignant Corpuſcles that offend her. It reſiſts Putrefaction and Coagulation of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42323:115"/>
Blood, gives it a briskneſs and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity that promotes the free Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood, to which it is Congeneal; by which means (tho not perhaps by theſe only) it becomes a good Cordial, and probably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome Poyſons an Antidote. And, which is none of the leaſt, nor leaſt extenſive, Vertues, it is very friendly to the <hi>Genus Nervoſum,</hi> and upon that account is like to be very proper in <hi>Fits of the, Mother</hi> (as they are call'd,) <hi>Convulſions,</hi> ſome ſorts of <hi>Head aches, Palſeys,</hi> Incipient <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies,</hi> ſome ſort of <hi>Aſthmas,</hi> &amp;c. It is alſo <hi>Balſamical</hi> in ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and may have divers other Vertues that have not yet been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. For a Medicine that does not weaken, not cauſe great Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor clog the Stomach, nor is blemiſh'd with the exceſs of any manifeſt Quality, but has in it ſelf a Complex of ſo many uſeful Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may reaſonably be ſuppos'd, likely to be available in more than
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42323:115"/>
a few Diſeaſes; ſince a good part of thoſe that Humane Bodies are lyable to, may be powerfully oppugn'd by ſome of thoſe excellent Qualities, one or more, whoſe Confluence may be found in the Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood.</p>
               <p>I preſume therefore that one may rationally propoſe it, as likely to be a good Remedy in many Diſtempers, eſpecially wherein either Spirit of Urine, or the Urinous Spirit of Sal-Armoniac, have been found ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Medicines; ſuch as Hyſterical Fits, Pleuriſies, Coughs, ſome Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Diſtempers, Convulſions, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexies, ſome kinds of Feavers, Head-aches, the Jaundiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I formerly prepar'd you not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I ſhould ſay much of the Virtues of the Spirit of Humane Blood (inwardly given,) upon my own perſonal experience. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not ſcruple to tell you, that <hi>Helmont</hi> himſelf, as little as he is apt to praiſe other than his own
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42323:116"/>

And a famous Writer about the Hermetick Phyſick (but, if I miſtake not, better vers'd in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other parts of Learning, than in Chymical <hi>Arcana,</hi>) tho he ſo far depretiates Spagyrical Preparations, as to commend the Utility but of a very few of them, is pleas'd to put the Diſtill'd Liquor of Blood into the number of thoſe very few that he vouchſafes a good Character to.</p>
               <p>I am the more inclin'd to give Credit to theſe praiſes of Spirit of Blood, becauſe, as I remember, this was the Medicine that I made uſe of in the following Caſe. A young
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42323:116"/>
Lady, in whoſe family the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption was an hereditary diſeaſe, was moleſted with a Violent and Stubborn Cough, that was judg'd conſumptive, and look'd upon by thoſe that gave her Phyſick, as not to be cured by any other way, then a ſeaſonable remove from <hi>London</hi> into the <hi>French</hi> Air; but ſhe was already ſo far gone and weakened, and there remain'd ſo much of the Winter, that 'twas judg'd ſhe would die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeaſon would make it any way fit for her to undertake ſo long and troubleſome a journey; but if ſhe could be kept alive till the end of the Spring, there would be ſome hopes ſhe might in <hi>France</hi> recover. On this occaſion being ſolicited by ſome friends of hers and mine, to try what I could do to preſerve her, I ſent her ſome Spirit of Humane Blood very carefully prepar'd and rectify'd, (to which I gave ſome name that I do not well remember,) upon the uſe of which ſhe manifeſtly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42323:117"/>
mended, notwithſtanding the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendlineſs of the Seaſon; inſomuch that about the end of <hi>February,</hi> ſhe had gain'd relief and ſtrength enough to venture to croſs the Seas, and make a journey to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> whence in <hi>Autumn</hi> ſhe brought home good looks and recovery. If I much miſremember not, the ſame Spirit of Blood, made very pure and ſubtile by the help of a Lamp Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, was the Medicine that I put into the Hands of an Ingenious and Succeſsful Phyſician, who complain'd to me that he had a Patient, that had quite puzzled him, as well as baffled the endeavours of other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Doctors, whom the difficulty of the caſe had invited at ſeveral times to try their skill upon him. This man was frequently Obnoxious to ſuch violent and tormenting fits of the Head-ach, that he could not endure the light, and was offended with almoſt every noiſe or motion that reach'd his Ears; inſomuch
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42323:117"/>
that he was forc'd to give over his Profeſſion, which was that of a Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor: But upon the conſtant uſe of the before mentioned Spirit of Blood, (for the other Medicines he took were much inferior to it, and had not before been available) he received ſuch relief, as made him with great joy and thankfulneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the exerciſe of his Trade, and the Phyſician, to whom I gave the remedy for him, told me one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, too conſiderable to be here omitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Namely, That the Patient having by our famous <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey's</hi> advice, been us'd to bleed once in two or three Months, the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an counſell'd him, notwithſtanding his recovery, not abruptly to break off his ancient cuſtom, and the Patient thereupon ſent for the ſame Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon that had been formerly wont to let him Blood, and to complain of the great badneſs of his Blood; but when this Chyrurgeon who knew not what had been done to the Patient,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42323:118"/>
came to open a Vein again, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what kind of Blood it afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was ſo ſurpriz'd, that he ſtop'd the operation, and asked the man with wonder, how he came by ſuch Florid Blood, adding, that 'twas pitty to deprive him of ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned a Liquor.</p>
               <p>The Medicinal Vertues hitherto mentioned belong to the Spirit of Humane Blood, as 'tis pure and ſimple: But 'tis not improbable that it may acquire other, and perhaps nobler Faculties; if it be dexterouſly corrected, diverſified, or united with fit Ingredients, that is, in a word, skilfully altered or compounded.</p>
               <p>Theſe things may be performed ſeveral ways. For they may be done either by uniting as well as one can, by long digeſtion, or frequent Cohobations, the Spirit of Humane Blood with the Oyls, Salt, and (if need be) Phlegm, of the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, into ſuch a kind of Mixture as ſome <hi>Chymiſts</hi> call <hi>Clyſſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:42323:118"/>
                  <hi>Or,</hi> 2. <hi>By</hi> uniting the Spirit of Blood with Acids, as with Spirit of Nitre, Spirit of Vinegar, Spirit of Verdegreaſe, Oyl of Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and employing theſe mixtures, either in their Liquid form, or reduced by Evaporation into Chryſtals or other Salts; and making uſe of theſe either as they are, or after a kind of <hi>Analyſis</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or,</hi> 3. <hi>By</hi> uniting our Spirit with Metalline Solutions, as of Gold, Silver, Mercury, and with ſolution of <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> made with Spirit of Vinegar, by mixture of which Liquor with Spirit of Blood, and a ſlow Evaporation of them, I remember I have had pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtore of finely figured Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or,</hi> 4. <hi>By</hi> diſſolving in Spirit of Blood carefully Dephlegm'd Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur opened with Salt of Tartar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or</hi> elſe, <hi>By</hi> diſſolving in it ſome Metalline Bodies, as Copper, Zink, and Iron, which laſt will afford a Martial Liquor, that differing much
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42323:119"/>
from other preparations of Steel, that are wont to be made with Acids, may probably have ſome Vertues, diſtinct from thoſe of the known Remedies made of that Metal.</p>
               <p>But I cannot ſtay to enumerate the ſeveral ways whereby the Spirit of Humane Blood may be made ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Medicinal Art. Yet one Preparation there is, which tho I have already taken notice of in the foregoing Title, and therefore can ſcarce mention without ſome repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet I think I ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ermit it on this occaſion; <hi>partly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whereas it was formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with reſpect only to the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> uſes of it, I ſhall now conſider it with reference to the <hi>inward</hi>; and <hi>partly</hi> becauſe by this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding we may at once correct, diverſifie and compound our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Blood.</p>
               <p>This Operation may be perform'd two ways, whereof the former is more ſimple than the latter. The
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42323:119"/>
firſt is, to add to well Rectify'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Blood, a double weight, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an equal one, (as the Liquors, eſpecially the Volatile Alcaly, are more or leſs ſtrong) of Alcohole of Wine. For theſe Liquors being well ſhaken together, will in very great part coagulate into Salt, which with a very gentle heat will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime in a dry form, + in which I found it to have loſt almoſt all its offenſive ſmell. And tho againſt this way of proceeding I know it may be objected, (as was formerly intimated) that the efficacy of the Medicine may, as well as the Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſmell, be much weakned by this Preparation; <hi>yet</hi> I found this Salt to retain a conſiderable degree of Quickneſs and Penetrancy, which its Volatility kept me from thinking ſtrange. And experience has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me, that divers of theſe <hi>compounded,</hi> or, if I may ſo ſtile them, <hi>Reſulting Salts,</hi> (which <hi>ſome</hi> Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts call <hi>Salia Enixa,</hi> for <hi>all</hi> agree
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42323:120"/>
not in the Senſe of that name) tho they ſeem to have their Activity clog'd, may have conſiderable ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations both in Chymiſtry and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. And why the Emergent Salt we ſpeak of, may not be of that number, I ſee no ſufficient cauſe; (N. B.) eſpecially ſince ſuch a kind of Mixture, tho made with another Urinous Spirit, has had ſuch effects in Feavers, as I thought extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. Nor is the Liquor that our Compounded Salt leaves behind, to be thrown away: ſince if it be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmed, it may afford a not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable Liquor, both for Medical and Mechanical uſes, of which it may here ſuffice to have given you in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral this hint.</p>
               <p>And if the more ſimple way of altering the Spirit of Humane Blood, be carry'd on a little further, by diſſolving in the Alcohole of Wine, before the conjunction of the two Spirits be made, a convenient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion (as perhaps a Twentyeth or
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42323:120"/>
Twenty-fourth part) of an Eſſential Chymical Oyl, as of Cloves, Aniſe-ſeeds, Marjoram, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Volatile Salt that will be ſublim'd from this Mixture, will not only be depriv'd of its ſtink, but endow'd with the ſmell and the Reliſh of the Oyl; which by being thus united with a Salt very ſubtile and friendly to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will leſs overpower and offend the Brain and Stomach, than meer Chymical Oyls are wont to do; and being aſſociated with ſuch Agile and penetrating Corpuſcles, will with them gain admiſſion into the more inward Receſſes of the Body, and there exerciſe the Vertues that belong to the Vegetables that afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Oyls, or at leaſt to the Oyls themſelves. In theſe odoriferous Aromatick Mixtures the Oleaginous Particles are, by the intervention of the Saline ones, brought to mix readily with other Liquors, and even with Aqueous Vehicles, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long enough mix'd, for the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42323:121"/>
Patient to take them commodiouſly. And thus by this one method there may be a multitude of <hi>Salia Volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Oleoſa,</hi> that is, of pleaſing, ſubtile and efficacious Remedies for inward uſes, prepar'd, even as many as the Phyſician or Chymiſt ſhall pleaſe to make Eſſential Oyls, (or others that will diſſolve in Alcohole of Wine;) and if theſe be drawn from Cephalick Plants, as Marjoram, Roſemary, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or from Cephalick Spices, as Nutmegs, Cinnamon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will probably afford very brisk and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Medicines to relieve and comfort the Brain and Spirits; as they may the Heart, Liver, and other <hi>Viſcera,</hi> if in the ſublimation the Saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Blood be aſſociated with thoſe of Oyls, drawn from Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables whoſe Vertues do peculiarly reſpect thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>Other ways might be here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of making Remedies, whereof the Spirit of Blood ſhould be the main ingredient. But I willingly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42323:121"/>
leave that work to your ſelf, and thoſe of your profeſſion, if you think fit to proſecute it; ſince my preſent task does not require that I ſhould write like what I am not, a profeſs'd Phyſician, but like what I endeavour to be, a Diligent Natural Hiſtorian. And for the ſame reaſon I purpoſely forbear, to inſert here ſome Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proceſſes that I have met with of Remedies that admit of Diſtill'd Blood, tho I have alſo declin'd the mention of them for two other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>one,</hi> that the Authors do not recommend them upon their own Experience, and the <hi>other,</hi> that theſe Medicines being much, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded than thoſe I lately propos'd, wherein our Spirit is mingled but with ſome one Chymical Oyl or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diluted with Alcohole of Wine; their preparations are leſs fit for my Deſign; which leads me to conſider the Effects of Humane Blood upon Patients, leſs as they are Sanative, than as they are Signs

                  <p>THe Proportion of the ſubſtances obtainable from dry'd Humane Blood, being as I formerly noted, very difficult, to be determin'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that Difficulty, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Inquiry, I thought fit to employ ſome Blood, that I made a ſhift to collect ſince the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Second Part of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Hiſtory, in making another Experiment, that we may make the nearer and ſafer eſtimate, of the Quantities of the diſtinct ſubſtances ſought after. For this end I caus'd
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42323:125"/>
Twelve Ounces of dry'd Blood to be carefully diſtill'd by an expert La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borant, well admoniſhed of the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of his Task, and the exactneſs he was to aim at in performing it. The Diſtillation being ended, the ſubſtances obtain'd were brought me, with this note of their Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Twelve Ounces of dry'd Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood yielded, of Volatile Salt and Spirit together five Ounces, of which we pour'd off from the wet Salt <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>xiij+. 54. <hi>gr.</hi> So that their remain'd ℥xiij+. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij+. 6. <hi>gr.</hi> Of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt; of foetid Oyl there were two Ounces, of <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> four Ounces, and two Drams. So that in ſpite of all his care there was loſt, by ſticking to the Retorts and other Glaſſes (which I preſum'd, retain'd little elſe than the more viſcous Oyl and phlegm,) and by avolation of ſome more ſubtil parts (eſpecially upon pouring the Liquors from Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to Veſſel,) about Six Drams. The four Ounces and two Drams
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42323:125"/>
of <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> being diligently calcin'd, afforded but Six Drams and a half of Aſhes: Of which very great Decrement, the Accenſion and Conſumption of the more fixed Olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous Part ſeems to be the cauſe. And if it be ſo, we may ſuppoſe, that there is a far greater portion of Oyl, in Humane Blood, than has been hitherto taken notice of. Theſe Aſhes were not white or Gray, as thoſe of other Bodies uſe to be, but of a Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Colour, much like that of Bricks; and yet the watchful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borant affirm'd, he could eaſily know them to be true Aſhes, becauſe that whilſt there remain'd any thing Oily or Combuſtible in the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> it would look like a throughly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Charcoal (which it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do far longer, than one would expect:) But when that Combuſtible ſubſtance was quite waſted, the remaining <hi>Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> would look in the fire like dead and ordinary Aſhes, tho, when they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42323:126"/>
were Cold, they appear'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Red. Theſe Aſhes being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Elixiviated, afforded five Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of White-fixt Salt, beſides a little, which being caſually got into the Contiguous ſand, and thence reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by water, and reduc'd to the like White Salt, amounted to about a Scruple more. So that their remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>Terra damnata</hi> Fourteen Scruples &amp; about a half, that is, a good deal above twice the weight of the Salt, whence it appears, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this <hi>Analyſis,</hi> the pure fixt Salt of Humane Blood is but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 57th and 58th part even of dry'd Blood, and therefore probably amounts but to the 150th or perhaps the 170th part (in weight) of Blood, as it flows from the Vein opened by a lancet: and the Fixt Earth or <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra damnata,</hi> is to the dry'd Blood that affords it, as 19. and about a half to 1.</p>

                  <p>IN regard the foregoing Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and another of the like nature formerly mentioned were made with dried and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable Blood of ſeveral Perſons put together, though I knew it would be ſcarce poſſible, in ſo ſmall a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood, as I could obtain at once from one Perſon, to find out with any accurateneſs, the quantities of the ſeveral ſubſtances, it was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of affording; yet, to be able to make ſome tolerable eſtimate grounded upon experience, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to make a tryal, whoſe ſucceſs, though in one part of it unlucky, was regiſtred as follows.</p>
                  <p>An entire parcel of Humane Blood weighing ten ounces and 73 gr. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlowly diſtilled to dryneſs in a Head and Body on a digeſtive Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,

But there happen'd an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky miſtake about the Salt and Spirit: for after the latter was pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, which weighed but 48. <hi>gr.</hi> the wet Salt which ſtuck in good quantity to the lateral and upper parts of the Receiver, inſtead of have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been waſh'd out, as it ſhould have been, with the phlegm of the ſame Blood, was waſh'd out with diſtill'd water, whence we obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſublimation into the neck of a glaſs Egg, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j+. 5. <hi>gr.</hi> of dry Salt. But by the taſt of the diſtill'd Water whence it was ſublim'd, it appear'd that all the Salt had not been raiſed: which invited me to put to it as much good Spirit of Salt as I ſuppoſed to be at leaſt ſufficient to ſatiate it, with
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42323:127"/>
deſign to try, whether by evaporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Mixture to dryneſs, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liming Salt by the help of an Alcaly, we might not recover all, or almoſt all, the Volatile Salt, that had been ſomewhat fix'd by the Acid Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The Retort being cut, that the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> might be taken out, it was found to weigh <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj+. 12. <hi>gr.</hi> which being carefully calcined yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but two Scruples and four grains of Aſhes, which the Laborant ſaid were Red.

                  <p>TO try ſome ſuſpicions I had about the Saline and Aqueous Parts, that I thought might he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in the Fibrous or Conſiſtent part of Humane Blood, I cauſed ſome of it to be in an open and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Glaſs expoſed to the Air in a Froſty Night, and the next morning found it to be lightly frozen, and the Surface of the Ice prettily figur'd with reſemblances of Combs, with
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42323:135"/>
Teeth on both ſides or edges; on which account theſe Figures did not ill reſemble thoſe, that I have oftentimes obtained, by ſlowly coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating into Salt, a ſolution of Sal-Armoniack made in Common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Second Part</hi> of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Memoirs,</hi> I have not ſaid any thing of the Medicinal Vertues of <hi>Humane Blood</hi> it ſelf, (for thoſe of the Spirit belong to the Fourth Part) and, tho I might now, if I thought fit, ſay ſomething not impertinent to that Subject, in this <hi>Appendix,</hi> both out of ſome Printed Books and my own obſervations, yet I now forbear to do it, not only for a reaſon that 'tis not neceſſary I ſhould here declare, but becauſe four or five Proceſſes that I have met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Humane Blood in <hi>Paracelſus, Burgravius,</hi> (famous for his <hi>Bioly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chnium</hi> made of that Subject) and one or two more, about the Tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42323:135"/>
of Diſeaſes by means of the Patients Blood, are ſuch, as either I do not well underſtand, becauſe of their being (probably on purpoſe) obſcurely pen'd, or ſeem in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unlikely, of which ſort is the <hi>Biolychnium,</hi> or <hi>Lamp</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> in which 'tis pretended that the Blood is ſo prepar'd, that the ſtate of Health of the Perſon whoſe it is, may be diſcover'd by the manner of the burning of the Flame it affords, (tho he be perhaps at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from it,) and his Death by its Extinction. Beſides that, as I have elſewhere noted, ſome Circumſtances relating to the Aſhes of Humane Blood, make me doubt, whether ſome of theſe Proceſſes were not rather the Products of Fancy than Experience. And, tho I think thoſe Medicines leſs improbable, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much deſtroying the Texture of the Blood by Fire, aim at tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſes by its intervention, yet
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42323:136"/>
I thought fit to decline tranſcribing the forementioned Medicines, till Experience ſhall warrant me to do it. And I ſhall alſo at preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſet down my own Tryals, becauſe I have not yet ſeen the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of them. But yet I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you to endeavour with me to prepare two, that, if they ſucceed, may afford, eſpecially the laſt of them, conſiderable Medicines. The firſt Medicine that I attempted, was, by putting to Salt of Tartar Oyl of Humane Blood inſtead of Oyl of Turpentine: and by keeping them long, and ſtirring them frequently, in the open Air, to make ſuch a Sapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Concretion, as is not unknown to many in <hi>London,</hi> by the name of <hi>Matthews</hi>'s <hi>Corrector,</hi> which as he made it with Common Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, tho it ſeem but a ſlight Compoſition, is yet eſteemed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd with good ſucceſs, by ſome Doctors of Phyſick and other Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in <hi>London.</hi> To make the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42323:136"/>
other Medicine, we endeavoured to unite by long Digeſtion, the Salt, Spirit, and Oyl of Humane Blood, into a Mixture, which ſome Chymiſts (for their Terms are not by all of them uſed in the ſame ſenſe) call a <hi>Clyſſus.</hi> But having begun this, without having had time to finiſh it, we ſhall ſay no more of it, but that divers Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts may not improbably look upon this ſort of Compoſitions, as one of the nobleſt ſort of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations that many a Drug is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>

                  <p>HUmane Urine, having firſt (that I know of) by the very ingenious Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by me, been obſerv'd, when frozen, to have on the ſurface of the Ice, figures not ill reſembling Combs or Feathers; the great affinity gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſed to be betwixt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> and the <hi>Serum</hi> of Blood, made me think fit to try at once whether this laſt nam'd Liquor would freeze with ſuch a degree of Cold, as would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet not very eaſily glaciate water, and whether, in caſe it ſhould freeze, the Ice would have a ſurface figur'd like that of frozen Urine.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42323:138"/>
conſecutively, the <hi>Serum</hi> was not found to congeal, tho ſome Grumous parts of the ſame Blood did, as has formerly been noted, yet I ſcarce doubted, but an exceeding hard froſt would have produc'd, at leaſt a thin Plate of Ice upon the ſurface of our Liquor.

               <p>I confeſs, the Defectiveneſs of our Hiſtorical knowledge of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood extravaſated,</hi> has been ſuch, that among the Authors I have had occaſion to peruſe, I have met with ſo few matters of fact deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their own knowledge, that the things I have thought fit to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe out of their Books into this little tract, do ſcarce all of them together amount to half a ſheet of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42323:139"/>

Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I hope that after ſome time the foregoing Scheme of Titles, and the Papers that refer to it, will give occaſion to a great many more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and Obſervations about the Blood, (and perhaps other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors of the Humane Body) than hitherto have been publiſhed by others, or are now imparted by me. Which laſt words I ſet down, becauſe I would not be thought guilty of the vanity of pretending to have near exhauſted the ſubject I have treated
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42323:140"/>
of; ſince beſides other deficiencies, I now perceive that I wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a conſiderable Title which might either have been refer'd to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary ones of the firſt order, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd as a kind of Preliminary to the Secondary Titles of the Hiſtory of the Spirit of Blood.

               <p>Upon this account I thought fit, to diſtil three Portions of dry'd Blood, each with a differing Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. The firſt with a <hi>Mineral Alcaly, Quicklime</hi>: the next with a <hi>Vegetable Alcaly, Calcin'd Tartar:</hi> and the third with a <hi>Sulphureous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,</hi> Oyl of Vitriol. And, tho ſome Accidents kept me from proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Tryals as I deſir'd, yet the firſt having ſucceeded indifferent well, and the two others not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wholly miſcarried, I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42323:140"/>
the Accounts of all three as they were ſet down in my Notes.</p>
               <p>Having obſerved that divers Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when they were Diſtill'd with Quick lime, afforded Liquors differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thoſe they would have yielded, if they had been diſtilled, either <hi>per ſe,</hi> or with ſome Vulgar Additaments; we took ℥v. of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted, but not dry'd Humane Blood, and having mixed it with an equal weight of Quick-lime, (ſuch as I could procure, but not ſo ſtrong as I have often ſeen,) we diſtilled it by degrees of Fire in a Retort placed in Sand, by which means we obtain'd a large Proportion of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Spirituous Liquor, which did not ſeem conſiderably Phlegmatick; together with ſome Oyl, which was but in very ſmall quantity, the reſt being probably kept back, (and perhaps ſome of it deſtroy'd) by the Lime: and of this little Oyl that did come over, there was a ſmall portion that ſunk in the Spirit,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42323:141"/>
the reſt ſwimming upon it.</p>
               <p>The above mentioned Spirit being put into a ſmall Head and Body, was ſet into a Digeſtive Furnace, to Rectify at leiſure with a very gentle heat, and the Receiver was three or four times ſhifted, that we might obſerve what difference, if any, there would be betwixt the ſucceſſively aſcending Portions of Liquor. The firſt Spirit that came over did not ſmell near ſo rank as that is wont to do that is diſtill'd <hi>per ſe.</hi> This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation belongs alſo to the three or four ſucceeding Portions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor: probably, becauſe the Lime had better freed the Spirit of the firſt Diſtillation from the Faetid Oyl, many of whoſe Particles are wont, tho unperceivedly, to mingle with it when it is drawn over without Additament. The Rectify'd Spirit, which was clear and colourleſs, had a taſt much ſtronger than its ſmell; for a ſmall drop of it upon the Tongue, had ſomething of Fiery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42323:141"/>
that was ſurprizing, and laſted longer than one would wiſh; which made me doubt, whether the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous part of the Blood had not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd up with it, ſome of the Fiery parts of the Quick-lime; which doubt, if future Tryals reſolve in the Affirmative, one may expect ſome uncommon effects from ſuch a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which in this caſe would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with a kind of Volatilis'd Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly, a thing much deſir'd by many Chymiſts and Phyſicians. Upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this ſuſpition, we dropt a little of it into a ſtrong ſolution of Sublimate in fair Water, and it ſeemed at the firſt contact to make a Precipitate a little enclining to Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, (as I have obſerved the Saline parts of Quicklime to do in a greater meaſure,) tho afterwards the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate appeared white, like that made with ordinary Volatile Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors of an Urinous Nature.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I expected that our <hi>Alcaliſate Spirit of Blood,</hi> if I may
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42323:142"/>
ſo call it, would have ſome peculiar Qualities, diſcriminating it from the Spirit drawn without addition; I thought fit to make a few Tryals with it, whoſe event juſtify'd my conjectures. For having put into a Glaſs Egg with a ſlender neck, ſome of our well rectify'd Spirit, it did not then afford any Volatile Salt in a dry form: (tho afterwards, if I miſtook not, by another Tryal, we at length obtain'd <hi>a little</hi>) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continued the Tryal ſomewhat obſtinately, we found the Spirit to have by the action of the Fire, loſt its Limpidneſs, and to have been made muddy or troubled.</p>
               <p>Having mingled another portion of it with a highly rectify'd, ardent Spirit, and kept them all night in the cold, no coagulation enſued, nor could we perceive any, after it had been kept divers hours in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate heat. But the Mixture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a Yellow colour, and let fall, ſomewhat to our ſurprize, a pretty
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42323:142"/>
deal of darkiſh Powder, tho not enough to invite us to make any Tryals upon it.</p>
               <p>We put to another parcel of our Spirit ſome good Spirit of Salt, but, tho they ſmok'd much at their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet we obſerv'd no noiſe nor bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles upon their commixture.</p>
               <p>And having mingled another Portion with Oyl of Vitriol, tho there was produc'd a very great ſmoke, and beſides that an intenſe degree of Heat, (the quantity of the matter conſidered,) yet there was no viſible Ebullition, nor any noiſe or bubbles produc'd, but the colour of the Oyl of Vitriol was very much heightned, the mixture growing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt red.</p>
               <p>From theſe, and the like <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> one may gather, that our <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caliſate Spirit of Blood</hi> is in ſeveral things differing from the ſimple. Whether this diſparity will make it a more potent Medicine, or make it, by too much participation of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42323:143"/>
fiery parts of the Lime; a leſs ſafe Remedy, future Experience muſt diſcover. But it ſeems not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that either as a <hi>Medicine,</hi> or as a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> if not in both ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, it may be a not Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Liquor. For which reaſon I have made my account of it the more Circumſtantial.</p>

                  <p>WE tooke ℥ij of Tartar Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined to whiteneſs by equal weight of (kindled) Nitre, and mingled this Alcaly with ℥ij of dry'd and powder'd Humane Blood. This mixture being diſtill'd in a Retort in a Sand Furnace, made it appear by its Productions, that Quicklime on theſe occaſions acts otherwiſe upon the Blood than other Alcalies do. For, whereas the Diſtillation wherein Lime was employ'd, afforded us, as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42323:143"/>
has been noted, a Spirit that before Rectification was very ſtrong, and unaccompanied with dry Salt; the <hi>Calcinatum</hi> of Nitre and Tartar af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us at the very firſt Diſtillation, a Spirit leſs ſtrong; but withal, ſo much Volatile Salt as cover'd almoſt all the inſide of the Receiver, not now to mention the difference of their reſpective <hi>Caput Mortuums.</hi>) And tho the ſtrong Saline Spirit of Blood made with Quicklime, did not, as we lately noted, make an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence with Acid Spirits, yet this Volatile Salt readily did it upon the affuſion of Spirit of Salt.</p>

                  <p>BEſides the fixt Alcaliſate Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with which I diſtill'd the dry'd Blood of Men, I thought fit to add to it a very Acid Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> Oyl of Vitriol; and this
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42323:144"/>
the rather, becauſe I had long ſince found by Tryal, (and, if I miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not, have elſewhere rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that this Liquor being mix'd with ſome other Bodies, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſome belonging to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Kingdom, did in an odd manner mingle its own ſubſtances (for I take it not to be a ſimple body) with them, and notably diverſify the Products of the Diſtillation. We put therefore upon ℥iij. of powder'd Humane Blood, an equal weight of Oyl of Vitriol, and left them for ſome time together, to try if by the action of this Corroſive <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> tho upon a Body not of a Mineral Nature, ſome heat would not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and accordingly we found, that after a while, tho not at the very firſt, the mixture grew ſenſibly warm. Then we removed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort into a Sand Furnace, and diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it by degrees of Fire, we had a Spirit which was preceded by a pretty deal of Phlegmatick Liquor,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42323:144"/>
of an odd ſulphureous ſmell, but ſo ſtrong and laſting, that I could not but wonder at it. The <hi>Caput Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> I was fain to let alone, becauſe I had ſome Inducements to ſuppoſe, that it was of ſo compounded a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that I ſhould not in my preſent Circumſtances have the opportunity to examine it throughly. But it ſeemed remarkable, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great Acidity of Oyl of Vitriol, and the fixative power it exerciſes on many Bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is committed to Diſtillation, our Experiment afforded us a pretty quantity of Volatile matter in the form of a white Salt. But indeed the ſmell and taſt of it were ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that I was troubled I had not then conveniency to examine it carefully; much leſs to try, whether it had any peculiar Vertues or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in Phyſick; tho I had then by me a Glaſs Inſtrument, that I purpoſely provided to obviate the great inconvenience that is uſually
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42323:145"/>
met with, and has been often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of by me as well as others, in the way Chymiſts are wont to imploy, when they are put to make repeated Sublimations of Volatile Salts, whether alone or with Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Inſtrument I cannot now ſtay to give you an account, but if it continue to appear as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as expeditious, I may hereafter do it by preſenting you one ready made.</p>

And this thin Membrane had its <hi>Superficies</hi> ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that looking upon it with Eyes placed Conveniently in reference to it and the Light, it did to me, and other Perſons, that did not at all look on it from the ſame place, appear adorned with vivid Colours of the Rainbow, as Red, Yellow, Blew and Green; and as I remember, in the ſame order that theſe Colours are to be ſeen in the Clouds.</p>

Having therefore placed a ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thermoſcope in an open mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glaſs, furniſhed with as much diſtilled water as would cover the Ball of the Inſtrument, we left it there for a while to bring the internal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor and the external to the ſame degree of Coldneſs.

And then the Glaſs being unſtopt, there did, as was expected, appear a fine Blew ſurface on the confines of the Air and the Liquor, in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of an hour or leſs; and this fine colour extending it ſelf downwards, was in no long time diffus'd through the whole Body of

               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>ANd here, Sir, I ſhall at length diſmiſs a Subject, about which I now perceive I have already entertained you much longer than at firſt I imagined. And yet, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you, your trouble is not quite at an end; ſince I muſt exhort you to take the pains, for your own ſatisfaction and mine, to try over again ſuch of the foregoing Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as you ſhall judge likely to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42323:152"/>
be of a contingent Nature. For, <hi>tho</hi> I hope you'l do me the right to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I have as faithfully as plainly delivered Matters of Fact, without being biaſſed by Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or aiming at Elegance, yet my Exhortation may be reaſonable. For I have obſerv'd Humane Blood to be a thing ſo diverſifyable by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Circumſtances, and eſpecially by the Habitual Conſtitution of the perſon that bleeds, and his preſent condition at the very time of Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy, that I dare not undertake, that every repeater of the like Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments with mine, will always find the Events to be juſt ſuch as I have recited mine to have had. Nay I dare not promiſe my ſelf an exact uniformity of ſucceſſes, even when I my ſelf ſhall reiterate ſome (of the nicer) of my own Tryals; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if I can do it, as I deſire with greater Quantities of Blood than (for want of them) the firſt were made with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:42323:153"/>To the Particulars already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in order to the Hiſtory of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood, I could now, Sir, add ſome others, if Time and Diſcretion would permit me to do it. For, as little cultivated as the Subject has been, I found it not ſo barren, but that, whilſt I was delivering ſome Tryals concerning it, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe, and of the Nature of the thing, ſuggeſted new ones to me. But 'tis high time I ſhould break off an <hi>Appendix,</hi> that, being but a Rhapſody of the Notes and other things, that have occur'd to me ſince the Memoirs were written, may I fear, ſeem already too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe, as well as confuſed. I do not forget, that the two laſt Subordinate Titles of the Fourth Part of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, concern the External and Internal uſe of the Spirit of Blood in Phyſick; and that therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance it may be expected, that I ſhould here add ſome Experiments or Obſervations, relating to thoſe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42323:153"/>
Titles. But I hope the lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Reaſons, and my juſt back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardenſs to part with ſome of them, becauſe they are not yet finiſhed, will make you eaſily excuſe my lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them aſide; which I am like to do long, unleſs you, and your Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friends ſhall peremptorily require them of me, in a fitter ſeaſon than this; in which ſome occaſions, that I cannot diſpenſe with, call me off to other Employments, and oblige me to leave a further inquiry into this Subject to your ſelf, and thoſe able profeſs'd Phyſicians, who have, as well more Obligation, as more Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than I, to purſue it effectually. This I may well hope that you and they will do, ſince upon a curſory review of a part only of what I have written, ſo many things ſprang up even in my thoughts, as <hi>Original Tryals,</hi> if I may ſo call them, or as other things fit to be further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that I perceived 'twould not be difficult to encreaſe the <hi>Appendix,</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:42323:154"/>
by two ſorts of particulars; the one made up of <hi>deſigned Experiments,</hi> that is, ſuch as have not yet been try'd, and yet ſeem worthy to be ſo, (to which 'tis probable our excellent <hi>Verulam</hi> would have given the Title of <hi>Hiſtoria Deſignata:</hi>) the other ſhould conſiſt of ſuch Tryals as I call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Succedaneous Experiments,</hi> that is, ſuch as I intended ſhould be made upon the Blood of Beaſts, in ſuch Caſes and Circumſtances, wherein the Blood of Men, either cannot be had, or ought not to be procured. When I ſhall next have the happineſs to converſe with you, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſight of what I have drawn up of this kind. And, if God ſhall pleaſe to vouchſafe me Health and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, I may perhaps (for I muſt not abſolutely promiſe it) offer you what <hi>Addenda</hi> have occur'd to me, as things not unfit to make way for a more copious, and leſs unaccurate, Scheme of Titles, ſuch as thoſe that in the firſt part (of the Memoirs) are call'd
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42323:154"/>
                  <hi>Titles of the Second Claſſis, or Order:</hi> for which Scheme I was the rather invited to think it fit, Materials ſhould be by ſome body provided, becauſe ſecond thoughts made me ſenſible that the Particulars compil'd in this ſmall Book, come far ſhort, (as I lately acknowledged, and you will eaſily believe,) of comprizing all that ſhould and may be known of ſo noble and uſeful a Subject, as I have ventur'd to treat of. And I will freely confeſs to you on this occaſion, that for my part, in the proſpect I have of the future Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Humane Knowledge, I think moſt of thoſe <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> that now live, muſt content themſelves with the ſatisfaction, of having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd their Intellects on worthy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and of having induſtriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, by promoting uſeful Knowledge, to glorify God and ſerve Mankind. For I preſume, that our enlightned Poſterity will arrive at
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42323:155"/>
ſuch attainments, that the Diſcoveries and Performances, upon which the preſent Age moſt values it ſelf, will appear ſo eaſy, or ſo inconſiderable to them, that they will be tempted to wonder, that things to them ſo obvious, ſhould lye ſo long conceal'd to us, or be ſo much priz'd by us; <hi>whom</hi> they will perhaps look upon with ſome kind of diſdainful Pity, unleſs they have either the equity to conſider, as well the ſmalneſs of our helps, as that of our Attainments; or the generous gratitude to remember the Difficulties this Age ſurmounted, in breaking the Ice, and ſmoothing the way for them, and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to thoſe Advantages, that have enabled them ſo much to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs us. And ſince I ſcruple not to ſay this of thoſe ſhining Wits and happy inquirers, that illuſtrate and ennoble this learned Age, I hope you will not think that I, who own my ſelf to be more fit to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42323:155"/>
than Rival them, would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you from improving and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the ſlight Performances, that are in this little Tract ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your Judgment by,</p>
