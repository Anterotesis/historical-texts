            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We preſent not theſe as any ſtrange ſight or ſpectacle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to your eyes, who have beheld the beſt of Urns, and nobleſt variety of Aſhes; who are your ſelf no ſlender Maſter of Antiquities, and can daily command the view of ſo many Imperial Faces: which raiſeth your thoughts unto old things, and conſideration of Times before you, when even living men were Antiquities; when the living might exceed the dead, and to depart this world could not be properly ſaid to go unto the<note n="f" place="margin">Abiit ad plures.</note> greater number; and ſo runs up your thoughts upon the Ancient of days, the Antiquaries trueſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, unto whom the eldeſt parcels are young, and Earth it ſelf an Infant, and without<note n="g" place="margin">Which makes the world ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years old.</note> 
               <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Account makes but ſmall noiſe in thouſands.</p>
            <p>We were hinted by the occaſion, not catched the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to write of old things, or intrude upon the Antiquary. We are coldly drawn unto diſcourſes of Antiquities, who have ſcarce time before us to comprehend new things, or make out learned Novelties. But ſeeing they aroſe as they lay, almoſt in ſilence among us, at leaſt in ſhort account ſuddenly paſſed over; we were very unwilling they ſhould die again, and be buried twice among us.</p>
            <p>Beſide, to preſerve the living, and make the dead to live, to keep men out of their Urns, and diſcourſe of humane Fragments in them, is not impertinent unto our Profeſſion; whoſe ſtudy is Life and Death, who daily behold examples of Mortality, and of all men leaſt need artificial Memento's, or Coffins by our bed-ſide, to minde us of our Graves.</p>
            <p>'Tis time to obſerve Occurrences, and let nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eſcape us. The Supinity of elder days hath left ſo much in ſilence, or time hath ſo martyred the Records, that the moſt<note n="h" place="margin">Wherein Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> hath excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well endeavoured, and is worthy to be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous  and noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> induſtrious Heads do finde no eaſie work to erect a new <hi>Britannia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis opportune to look back upon old Times, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate our Forefathers. Great examples grow thin, and are to be fetched from the paſſed world. Simplicity flies away, and Iniquity comes at long ſtrides upon us. We have enough to

            <p>In the offer of theſe Antiquities we drive not at ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ſo long out-laſted by them; we are far from erecting your Worth upon the pillars of your Fore-fathers, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits you illuſtrate.

            <p>You have been ſo long out of trite Learning, that 'tis hard to finde a Subject proper for you; and if you have met with a Sheet upon this, we have miſſed our intention. In this multiplicity of writing, bye and barren Themes are beſt fitted for Invention; Subjects ſo often diſcourſed confine the Imagination, and fix our conceptions unto the Notions of Fore-writers. Beſide, ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes allow excurſions, and venially admit of collateral Truths, though at ſome diſtance from their principals. Wherein if we

            <p>That we conjoyn theſe parts of different Subjects, or that this ſhould ſucceed the other, your judgement will admit without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of incongruity; ſince the delightfull World comes after Death, and Paradiſe ſucceeds the Grave; ſince the verdant ſtate of things is the Symbol of the Reſurrection, and to flouriſh in the ſtate of Glory, we muſt firſt be ſown in Corruption.

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103367:7"/>
lay buried for a thouſand years; and a large part of the Earth is ſtill in the Urn unto us.</p>
               <p>Though if <hi>Adam</hi> were made out of an Extract of the Earth, all parts might challenge a Reſtitution; yet few have returned their Bones far lower then they might receive them; not affecting the graves of Giants under hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heavy coverings, but, content with leſs then their own depth, have wiſhed their Bones might lie ſoft, and the earth be light upon them. Even ſuch as hope to riſe again would not be content with central Interrment, or ſo deſperately to place their Reliques as to lie beyond diſcovery, and in no way to be ſeen again: which happy contrivance hath made communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with our Fore-fathers, and left unto our view ſome parts which they never beheld themſelves.</p>
               <p>Though Earth hath ingroſſed the name, yet Water hath proved the ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Grave, which in forty days ſwallowed almoſt Mankinde and the living Creation; Fiſhes not wholly eſcaping, except the ſalt Ocean were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly contempered by a mixture of the freſh Element.</p>
               <p>Many have taken voluminous pains to determine the ſtate of the Soul upon Diſ-union; but men have been moſt phantaſtical in the ſingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of their Corporal diſſolution: whileſt the ſobereſt Nations have reſted in two ways, of ſimple Inhumation, and Burning.</p>
               <p>That carnal Interrment or Burying was of the elder date, the old exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarchs are ſufficient to illuſtrate; and it were without competition, if it could be made out that <hi>Adam</hi> was buried near <hi>Damaſcus</hi> or Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> according to ſome Tradition. God himſelf, that buried but one, was pleaſed to make choice of this way, as is colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctible from Scripture-expreſſion, and the hot Conteſt between Satan and the Arch-angel about diſcovering the Body of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But the practice of Burning was alſo of great Antiquity, and of no ſlender extent. For (not to derive the ſame from <hi>Hercules)</hi> noble deſcriptions there are hereof in the <hi>Graecian</hi> Funerals of <hi>Homer,</hi> in the formal Obſequies of <hi>Patroclus</hi> and <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> and ſomewhat elder in the <hi>Theban</hi> War, and the ſolemn Combuſtion of <hi>Menoeceus</hi> and <hi>Archemorus,</hi> contemporary unto <hi>Jair</hi> the eighth Judge of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Confirmable alſo among the <hi>Trojans,</hi> from the Funeral Pyre of <hi>Hector,</hi> burnt before the gates of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the<note n="b" place="margin">Q.

               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius Sylla</hi> was not the firſt whoſe Body was burned in <hi>Rome,</hi> but of the <hi>Cornelian</hi> Family, which being indifferently, not frequently, uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from that time ſpread and became the prevalent practice; not total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued in the higheſt run of Cremation; for when even Crows were funerally burnt, <hi>Poppaea</hi> the Wife of <hi>Nero</hi> found a peculiar Grave-interr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now as all Cuſtoms were founded upon ſome bottom of Reaſon, ſo there wanted not grounds for this; according to ſeveral apprehenſions of the moſt rational Diſſolution. Some being of the opinion of <hi>Thales,</hi> that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the Original of all things, thought it moſt equal to ſubmit unto the Principle of Putrefaction, and conclude in a moiſt Relentment. Others conceived it moſt natural to end in Fire, as due unto the Maſter-principle in the Compoſition, according to the doctrine of <hi>Heraclitus;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heaped up large Piles, more actively to waft them toward that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby they alſo declined a viſible degeneration into Worms, and left a laſting parcel of their Compoſition.</p>
               <p>Some apprehended a purifying virtue in Fire, refining the groſſer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture, and firing out the Aethereal particles ſo deeply immerſed in it. And ſuch as by Tradition or rational conjecture held any hint of the final Pyre of all things, or that this Element at laſt muſt be too hard for all the reſt, might conceive moſt naturally of the Fiery diſſolution. Others, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending no natural grounds, politickly declined the malice of Enemies upon their buried Bodies. Which conſideration led <hi>Sylla</hi> unto this practice, who having thus ſerved the Body of <hi>Marius,</hi> could not but fear a Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation upon his own; entertained after in the Civil Wars and revengefull Contentions of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as many Nations embraced, and many left it indifferent, ſo others too much affected, or ſtrictly declined this practice. The <hi>Indian Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſeemed too great friends unto Fire, who burnt themſelves alive, and thought it the nobleſt way to end their days in Fire; according to the expreſſion of the <hi>Indian</hi> burning himſelf at <hi>Athens</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his Tomb was made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. <hi>Nic. Damaſc.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> the great Idolaters of Fire, abhorred the Burning of their Carkaſſes, as a pollution of that Deity. The <hi>Perſian Magi</hi> decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it upon the like ſcruple, and being onely ſolicitous about their Bones, expoſed their Fleſh to the prey of Birds and Dogs. And the <hi>Perſees</hi> now
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103367:8"/>
in <hi>India,</hi> which expoſe their Bodies unto Vultures, and endure not ſo much as <hi>Feretra</hi> or Beers of Wood, the proper Fuell of Fire, are led on with ſuch niceties. But whether the ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> who buried their dead, held any ſuch fear to pollute their Deity of <hi>Herthus,</hi> or the Earth, we have no authentick conjecture.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were afraid of Fire, not as a Deity, but a devouring Element, mercileſly conſuming their Bodies, and leaving too little of them; and therefore by precious Embalments, Depoſiture in dry earths, or handſome incloſure in Glaſſes, contrived the notableſt ways of integral Conſervation. And from ſuch <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſcruples imbibed by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> it may be conjectured that <hi>Numa</hi> and the Pythagorical Sect firſt waved the fiery Solution.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scythians,</hi> who ſwore by Winde and Sword, that is, by Life and Death, were ſo far from Burning their Bodies, that they declined all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrment, and made their Graves in the Air: And the <hi>Ichthyophagi,</hi> or fiſh-eating Nations about <hi>Aegypt,</hi> affected the Sea for their Grave; thereby declining viſible corruption, and reſtoring the debt of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Whereas the old Heroes in <hi>Homer</hi> dreaded nothing more then Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Drowning; probably upon the old Opinion of the fiery ſubſtance of the Soul, onely extinguiſhable by that Element: And therefore the Poet emphatically implieth the total deſtruction in this kind of death which happened to <hi>Ajax Oileus</hi>

               <p>Chriſtians abhorred this way of Obſequies, and though they ſtick not to give their Bodies to be burnt in their lives, deteſted that mode after death; affecting rather a Depoſiture then Abſumption, and properly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting unto the ſentence of God, to return, not unto Aſhes, but unto Duſt again; conformable unto the practice of the Patriarchs, the Interr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, though they entertained the old way of Inhumation, yet ſometimes admitted this practice, (for the men of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> burnt the

               <p>But even in times of Subjection and hotteſt uſe they conformed not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Roman</hi> practice of Burning; whereby the Prophecy was ſecured concerning the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that it ſhould <hi>not ſee corruption,</hi> or <hi>a Bone ſhould not be broken;</hi> (which we believe was alſo providentially prevented from the Soludiers Spear, and Nails, that paſt by the little Bones both in his hands and feet: not of ordinary contrivance, that it ſhould not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt on the Croſs, according to the Law of <hi>Roman</hi> Crucifixion) or an hair of his head periſh, though obſervable in <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtoms, to cut the Hairs of Malefactors.</p>
               <p>Nor in their long Co-habitation with the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> crept they into a cuſtome of their exact Embalming, wherein deeply ſlaſhing the Muſcles, and taking out the Brains and Entrails, they had broken the ſubject of ſo entire a Reſurrection, nor fully anſwered the Types of <hi>Enoch, Eliah,</hi> or <hi>Jonah;</hi> which yet to prevent or reſtore was of equal facility unto that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power, able to break the Faſciations and bands of death, to get clear out of the Cere-cloth and an hundred pounds of oyntment, and out of the Sepulchre before the ſtone was rolled from it.</p>
               <p>But though they embraced not this practice of Burning, yet entertained they many Ceremonies agreeable unto <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Obſequies. And he that obſerveth their Funeral-Feaſts, their Lamentations at the Grave, their Muſick and weeping Mourners, how they cloſed the eyes of their Friends, how they waſhed, anointed, and kiſſed the dead; may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude theſe were not mere Pagan Civilities. But whether that mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall burthen and treble calling our after <hi>Abſalom</hi> had any reference to the laſt Conclamation and triple Valediction uſed by other Nations, we hold but a wavering conjecture.</p>

               <p>In a Field of old <hi>Walſingham,</hi> not many months paſt, were digged up between forty and fifty Urns, depoſited in a dry and ſandy ſoil, not a yard deep, not far from one another; not all ſtrictly of one Figure, but moſt anſwering theſe deſcribed; ſome containing two pounds of Bones, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable in Sculls, Ribs, Jaws, Thigh-bones, and Teeth, with freſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their Combuſtion; beſides the extraneous ſubſtances, like pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſmall Boxes, Combs handſomly wrought, Handles of ſmall braſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, brazen Nippers, and in one ſome kinde of <hi>Opale</hi>

               <p>Near the ſame plot of ground, for about ſix yards compaſs were digged up Coals and incinerated ſubſtances; which begat conjecture that this was the <hi>Uſtrina</hi> or place of Burning their Bodies, or ſome Sacrificing-place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Manes,</hi> which was properly below the ſurface of the ground, as the <hi>Arae</hi> and Altars unto the Gods and Heroes above it.</p>
               <p>That theſe were the Urns of <hi>Romans,</hi> from the common cuſtome and place where they were found is no obſcure Conjecture, not far from a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Garriſon, and but five mile from <hi>Brancaſter,</hi> ſet down by ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord under the name of <hi>Brannodunum;</hi> and where the adjoyning Town, containing ſeven Pariſhes, in no very different ſound, but <hi>Saxon</hi> termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtill retains the name of <hi>Burnham:</hi> which being an early Station, it is not improbable the neighbour-parts were filled with Habitations either of <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, or <hi>Britans Romanized,</hi> which obſerved the <hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>Nor is it improbable that the <hi>Romans</hi> early poſſeſſed this Country.

               <p>HOW the <hi>Romans</hi> left ſo many Coyns in Countries of their Conqueſts ſeems of hard reſolution; except we conſider how they buried them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, when upon barbarous Invaſions they were fain to deſert their Habitations in moſt part of their Empire, and the ſtrictneſs of their Laws forbad to transfer them to any other uſes: wherein the<note n="i" place="margin">Plut. <hi>in vila</hi> Lycurg.</note> 
                  <hi>Spartans</hi> were ſingular, who, to make their Copper-money uſeleſs, contempered it with Vinegar. That the <hi>Britans</hi> left any, ſome wonder; ſince their Money was Iron and Iron-rings before <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and thoſe of after-ſtamp by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and but ſmall in bulk and bigneſs: That ſo few of the <hi>Saxons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, becauſe overcome by ſucceeding Conquerours upon the place, their Coyns by degrees paſſed into other Stamps, and the marks of after-Ages.</p>
               <p>Then the time of theſe Urns depoſited, or preciſe Antiquity of theſe Reliques, nothing of more uncertainty. For ſince the Lieutenant of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> ſeems to have the firſt progreſs into theſe parts, ſince <hi>Boadicea</hi> was overthrown by the Forces of <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Agricola</hi> put a full end to theſe Conqueſts; it is not probable the Country was fully garriſoned or planted before; and therefore, how-ever theſe Urns might be of later date, not likely of higher Antiquity.</p>
               <p>And the ſucceeding Emperours deſiſted not from their Conqueſts in theſe and other parts, as is teſtified by Hiſtory and Medall-inſcription yet extant; the Province of <hi>Britain,</hi> in ſo divided a diſtance from <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the faces of many Imperial perſons, and in large account, no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then <hi>Caeſar, Claudius, Britannicus, Veſpaſian, Titus, Adrian, Severus, Commodus, Geta,</hi> and <hi>Caracalla.</hi>
               </p>

                  </note>, which might denote the dates of their Interrments. Obſervable in many Urns, and found in thoſe of <hi>Spittle</hi>-Fields by <hi>London,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Coyns of <hi>Claudius, Veſpaſian, Commodus, Antoninus,</hi> attended with Lacrymatories, Lamps, Bottles of Liquour, and other appurtenances of affectionate Superſtition, which in theſe rural Interrments were wanting.</p>
               <p>Some uncertainty there is from the period or term of Burning, or the ceſſation of that practice. <hi>Macrobius</hi> affirmeth it was diſuſed in his days. But moſt agree, though without authentick Record, that it ceaſed with the <hi>Antonini:</hi> moſt ſafely to be underſtood after the Reign of thoſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which aſſumed the name of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> extending unto <hi>Heliogabalus;</hi> not ſtrictly after <hi>Marcus;</hi> for about fifty years later we finde the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Burning and Conſecration of <hi>Severus.</hi> And if we ſo ſix this period or ceſſation, theſe Urns will challenge above thirteen hundred years.</p>
               <p>But whether this practice was onely then left by Emperours and great perſons, or generally about <hi>Rome,</hi> and not in other Provinces, we hold no authentick account. For after <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the days of <hi>Minucius,</hi> it was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103367:10"/>
obviouſly objected upon Chriſtians, that they condemned the practice of Burning <note n="k" place="margin">Exſecrantur rogos, &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ignium ſcpulturam. <hi>Min.</hi> in Oct.</note>. And we finde a paſſage in <hi>Sidonius</hi>

And perhaps 'twas not fully diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed till Chriſtianity fully eſtabliſhed, which gave the final extinction to theſe Sepulchral Bonefires.</p>
               <p>Whether they were the Bones of Men, or Women, or Children, no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick deciſion from ancient Cuſtome in diſtinct places of Burial. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not improbably conjectured, that the double Sepulture or Burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of <hi>Abraham</hi> had in it ſuch intenſion. But from exility of Bones, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sculls, ſmalneſs of Teeth, Ribs and Thigh-bones, 'tis not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that many there of were perſons of minor age, or Women. Confirmable alſo from things contained in them: In moſt were found ſubſtances reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Combs, Plates like Boxes faſtened with Iron pins, and handſomely over-wrought like the Necks or Bridges of Muſical Inſtruments, long braſs Plates over-wrought like the Handles of neat Implements, brazen Nippers to pul away Hair, &amp; in one a kind of <hi>Opale,</hi> yet maintaining a blewiſh colour.</p>
               <p>NOW that they accuſtomed to burn or bury with them things wherein they excelled, delighted, or which were dear unto them, either as farewells unto all Pleaſure, or vain apprehenſion that they might uſe them in the other world, is teſtified by all Antiquity.

Although if we ſteer by the conjecture of many, and Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint expreſſion, ſome trace thereof may be found even with the ancient <hi>Hebrews,</hi> not onely from the Sepulchral Treaſure of <hi>David,</hi> but the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion-knives which <hi>Joſuah</hi> alſo buried.</p>
               <p>Some men, conſidering the Contents of theſe Urns, laſting pieces and Toys included in them, and the Cuſtome of Burning with many other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, might ſomewhat doubt whether all Urns found among us were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Roman</hi> Reliques, or ſome not belonging unto our <hi>Britiſh, Saxon</hi> or <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fore-fathers.</p>
               <p>In the form of Burial among the ancient <hi>Britans</hi> the large Diſcourſes of <hi>Caeſar, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> are ſilent: For the diſcovery whereof, with other particulars, we much deplore the loſs of that Letter which <hi>Cicero</hi>

expected or received from his Brother <hi>Quintus,</hi> as a reſolution of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Cuſtoms; or the Account which might have been made by <hi>Scribonius Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> the Phyſician, accompanying the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> who might have alſo diſcovered that frugal Bit<note n="o" place="margin">

               <p>But that the <hi>Druids</hi> and ruling Prieſts uſed to burn and bury, is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Pomponius.</hi> That <hi>Bellinus,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Frennus,</hi> and King of <hi>Britans,</hi> was burnt, is acknowledged by <hi>Polydorus,</hi> as alſo by <hi>Amandus Zie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rixenſis</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtoria,</hi> and <hi>Pineda</hi> in his <hi>Univerſa hiſtoria</hi> Spaniſh. That they held that practice in <hi>Gallia, Caeſar</hi> expreſly delivereth. Whether the <hi>Britans</hi> (probably deſcended from them, of like Religion, Language and Manners) did not ſometimes make uſe of Burning, or whether at leaſt ſuch as were after civilized unto the <hi>Roman</hi> life and manners conformed not unto this practice, we have no hiſtorical aſſertion or denial. But ſince from the account of <hi>Tacitus</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> early wrought ſo much Civility up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Stock, that they brought them to build Temples, to wear the Gown, and ſtudy the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws and Language; that they conformed<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Roiſold, Brendetiide,</hi> Ild tiide.</note> alſo unto their Religious Rites and Cuſtoms in Burials ſeems no improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjecture.</p>
               <p>That Burning the dead was uſed in <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> is affirmed by <hi>Gaguinus:</hi> that the <hi>Sueons</hi> and <hi>Gothlanders</hi> uſed to burn their Princes and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is delivered by <hi>Saxo</hi> and <hi>Olaus:</hi> that this was the old <hi>German</hi> practice, is alſo aſſerted by <hi>Tacitus.</hi> And though we are bare in hiſtorical particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of ſuch Obſequies in this Iſland, or that the <hi>Saxons, Jutos</hi> and <hi>Angles</hi> burnt their dead; yet came they from parts where 'twas of ancient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; the <hi>Germans</hi> uſing it, from whom they were deſcended. And even in <hi>Jutland</hi> and <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> in <hi>Anglia Cimbrica,</hi> Urns with Bones were found not many years before us.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Daniſh</hi> and Northern Nations have raiſed an <hi>Aera</hi> or point of Compute from their Cuſtome of Burning their dead; ſome deriving it from <hi>Unguinus,</hi> ſome from <hi>Frotho</hi> the Great, who ordained by Law, that Princes and chief Commanders ſhould be committed unto the Fire, thought the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort had the common Grave-interrment. So <hi>Starkatterus</hi> that old Heroe was burnt, and <hi>Ringo</hi> royally burnt the Body of <hi>Harald</hi> the King ſlain by him.</p>
               <p>What time this Cuſtome generally expired in that Nation, we diſcern no aſſured period: whether it ceaſed before Chriſtianity, or upon their Converſion by <hi>Auſgarius</hi> the <hi>Gaul</hi> in the time of <hi>Ludovicus Plus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, according to good Computes; or whether it might not be uſed by ſome perſons, while for a hundred and eighty years Paganiſm and Chriſtianity were promiſcuouſly embraced among them, there is no aſſured concluſion. About which times the <hi>Danes</hi> were buſie in <hi>England,</hi> and particularly infeſted this Countrey; where many Caſtles and ſtrong Holds were built by them, or againſt them, and a great number of Names
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103367:11"/>
and Families ſtill derived from them. But ſince this Cuſtome was probably diſuſed before their Invaſion or Conqueſt, and the <hi>Romans</hi> confeſſedly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the ſame ſince their poſſeſſion of this Iſland, the moſt aſſured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will fall upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Britans Romanized.</hi>

               <p>However certain it is that Urns, conceived of no <hi>Roman</hi> Original, are often digged up both in <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> handſomely deſcribed and graphically repreſented by the learned Phyſician <hi>Wormius</hi>

onely baked in Oven or Sun; according to the ancient way in many Bricks, Tiles, Pots, and teſtaceous works; and as the word <hi>Teſta</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be taken, when occurring without addition; and chiefly intended by <hi>Pliny,</hi> when he commendeth Bricks and Tiles of two years old, and to make them in the Spring.

               <p>CHriſtians have handſomely gloſſed the deformity of Death, by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſideration of the Body, and civil Rites, which take off brutal ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: and though they conceived all repairable by a Reſurrection, caſt not off all care of Interrment.

Men have loſt their Reaſon in nothing ſo much as their Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Stones and Clouts make Martyrs; and ſince the Religion of one ſeems Madneſs unto another, to afford an account or rational of old Rites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no rigid Reader. That they kindled the Pyre averſely, or turning their face from it, was an handſom Symbole of unwilling Miniſtration. That they waſhed their Bones with Wine and Milk; that the Mother wrapt them in Linen, and dried them in her Boſome, the firſt foſtering part and place of their Nouriſhment; that they opened their eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven before they kindled the Fire, as the place of their hopes or original; were no improper Ceremonies. Their laſt Valediction<note n="f" place="margin">Vale, vale, vale, nos te ordiae quo Natura per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittet ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</note> thrice uttered by the Attendants was alſo very ſolemn, and ſomewhat anſwered by Chriſtians, who thought it too little, if they threw not the earth thrice upon the interred Body. That in ſtrewing their Tombs the <hi>Romans</hi> affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Roſe, the <hi>Greeks Amaranthus</hi> and Myrtle; that the Funeral Pyre conſiſted of ſweet fewel, Cypreſs, Firre, Larix, Yew, and Trees perpetually verdant; lay ſilent expreſſions of their ſurviving Hopes: wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which deck their Coffins with Bays, have found a more elegant Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme. For that Tree, ſeeming dead, will reſtore it ſelf from the Root, and its dry and exſuccous Leaves reſume their verdure again; which, if we miſtake not, we have alſo obſerved in Furze. Whether the planting of Yew in Church-yards hold not its original from ancient Funeral-Rites, or as an Embleme of Reſurrection from its perpetual Verdure, may alſo admit conjecture.</p>
               <p>They made uſe of Muſick to excite or quiet the Affections of their Friends, according to different Harmonies. But the ſecret and ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hint was the Harmonical nature of the Soul, which delivered from the Body went again to enjoy the primitive Harmony of Heaven, from whence it firſt deſcended; which, according to its progreſs traced by Antiquity, came down by <hi>Cancer,</hi> and aſcended by <hi>Capricornus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They burnt not Children before their Teeth appeared, as apprehending their Bodies too tender a morſel for Fire, and that their griſtly Bones would ſcarce leave ſeparable Reliques after the pyral Combuſtion. That they kindled not Fire in their houſes for ſome days after, was a ſtrict me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the late afflicting Fire. And mourning without hope, they had an happy fraud againſt exceſſive Lamentation, by a common opinion, that deep Sorrows diſturbed their Ghoſts <note n="g" place="margin">Tu manes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That they buried their dead on their Backs, or in a ſupine poſition, ſeems agreeable unto profound Sleep and common poſture of dying, contrary to the moſt natural way of Birth; nor unlike our pendulous poſture in the doubtful ſtate of the Womb. <hi>Diogenes</hi> was ſingular, who preferred a prone ſituation in the Grave: and ſome Chriſtians<note n="h" place="margin">Ruſſianus, &amp;c.</note> like neither, who declined the figure of Reſt, and made choice of an erect poſture.</p>
               <p>That they carried them out of the world with their Feet forward, was not inconſonant unto Reaſon; as contrary unto the native poſture of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103367:16"/>
Man, and his production firſt into it; and alſo agreeable unto their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, while they bid adieu unto the world, not to look again upon it: whereas <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who think to return to a delightful life again, are carried forth with their Heads forward, and looking towards their houſes.</p>
               <p>They cloſed their Eyes, as parts which firſt die, or firſt diſcover the ſad effects of Death. But their iterated Clamations to excitate their dying or dead Friends, or revoke them unto life again, was a vanity of Affection; as not preſumably ignorant of the critical Teſts of Death by appoſition of Feathers, Glaſſes, and reflexion of Figures, which dead Eyes repreſent not, which how-ever not ſtrictly verifiable in freſh and warm Cadavers, could hardly elude the Teſt in Corps of four or five days.</p>
               <p>That they ſucked in the laſt Breath of their expiring Friends, was ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a practice of no medical Inſtitution, but a looſe opinion that the Soul paſſed out that way, and a fondneſs of Affection from ſome<note n="*" place="margin">Franceſco Perucei, <hi>Pompe funebri<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>That they poured Oyl upon the Pyre, was a tolerable practice, while the intention reſted in facilitating the Aſcenſion: But to place good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens in the quick and ſpeedy Burning, to ſacrifice unto the Winds for a diſpatch in this office, was a low form of Superſtition.</p>
               <p>The Archimime or Jeſter attending the Funeral Train, and imitating the ſpeeches, geſture and manners of the deceaſed, was too light for ſuch Solemnities, contradicting their funeral Orations, and dolefull Rites of the Grave.</p>
               <p>That they buried a piece of Money with them, as a Fee of the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Ferryman, was a practice full of folly. But the ancient cuſtome of placing Coyns in conſiderable Urns, and the preſent practice of burying Medals in the noble Foundations of <hi>Europe,</hi> are laudable ways of Hiſtorical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in Actions, Perſons, Chronologies; and poſterity will applaud them.</p>
               <p>We examine not the old Laws of Sepulture, exempting certain perſons from Burial or Burning: But hereby we apprehend that theſe were not the Bones of perſons Planet-ſtruck or burnt with fire from Heaven; no Reliques of Traitors to their Countrey, Self-killers, or Sacrilegious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors; perſons in old apprehenſion unworthy of the Earth, condemned unto the <hi>Tartarus</hi> of Hell, and bottomleſs pit of <hi>Pluto,</hi> from whence there was no redemption.</p>
               <p>Nor were onely many Cuſtomes queſtionable in order to their Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, but alſo ſundry Practices, Fictions, and Conceptions, diſcordant or obſcure, of their ſtate and future beings. Whether unto eight or ten Bodies of Men to adde one of a Woman, as being more inflammable, and unctuouſly conſtituted for the better pyrall Combuſtion, were any rational

practice; or whether the complaint of <hi>Periander</hi>'s Wife be tolerable, that wanting her Funeral Burning ſhe ſuffered intolerable cold in Hell, according to the conſtitution of the Infernal houſe of <hi>Pluto,</hi> wherein Cold makes a great part of their Tortures; it cannot paſs without ſome queſtion.</p>
               <p>Why the Female-Ghoſts appear unto <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> before the Heroes and maſculine ſpirits; why the <hi>Pſyche</hi> or Soul of <hi>Tireſias</hi> is of the maſculine gender, who being blinde on Earth ſees more then all the reſt in Hell; why the Funeral Suppers conſiſted of Eggs, Beans, Smallage and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce, ſince the dead are made to eat Aſphodels about the <hi>Elyſian</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; why, ſince there is no Sacrifice acceptable, nor any Propitiation for the Covenant of the Grave, men ſet up the Deity of <hi>Morta,</hi> and fruitleſly adored Divinites without Ears; it cannot eſcape ſome doubt.</p>
               <p>The dead ſeem all alive in the humane <hi>Hades</hi> of <hi>Homer;</hi> yet cannot they ſpeak, propheſie, or know the living, except they drink Bloud, wherein is the Life of man. And therefore the Souls of <hi>Penelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe</hi>'s Paramours conducted by <hi>Mercury</hi> chirped like Bats, and thoſe which followed <hi>Hercules</hi> made a noiſe but like a flock of Birds.</p>
               <p>The departed Spirits know things paſt and to come, yet are ignorant of things preſent. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> foretells what ſhould happen unto <hi>Ulyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> yet ignorantly enquires what is become of his own Son. The Ghoſts are afraid of Swords in <hi>Homer;</hi> yet <hi>Sibylla</hi> tells <hi>Aeneas</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi> the thin habit of Spirits was beyond the force of Weapons. The Spirits put off their Malice with their Bodies, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> accord in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Hell; yet <hi>Ajax</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> endures not a Conference with <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi> And <hi>Deiphobus</hi> appears all mangled in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Ghoſts, yet we meet with perfect Shadows among the wounded Ghoſts of <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since <hi>Charon</hi> in <hi>Lucian</hi> applauds his condition among the dead, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it handſomely ſaid of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that living contemner of Death, that he had rather be a Plowman's ſervant then Emperour of the dead?

The particulars of future Beings muſt needs be dark unto ancient Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which Chriſtian Philoſophy yet determines but in a Cloud of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

               <p>Were the Happineſs of the next World as cloſely apprehended as the Felicities of this, it were a Martyrdome to live; and unto ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider none hereafter, it muſt be more then Death to die: which makes us amazed at thoſe Audacities that durſt be Nothing, and return into their Chaos again. Certainly ſuch ſpirits as could contemn Death when they expected no better Being after, would have ſcorned to live had they known any. And therefore we applaud not the judgement of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel,</hi> that Chriſtianity makes men Cowards, or that with the confidence of bat half dying, the deſpiſed Vertues of Patience and Humility have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed the ſpirits of men, which Pagan Principles exalted; but rather it hath regulated the wildneſs of Audacities in the attempts, grounds, and eternal ſequels of Death, wherein men of the boldeſt ſpirits are often prodigiouſly temerarious. Nor can we extenuate the Valour of ancient Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, who contemned Death in the uncomfortable ſcene of their lives, and in their decrepit Martyrdomes did probably loſe not many months of their days, or parted with Life when it was ſcarce worth the living. For (beſide that long time paſt holds no conſideration unto a ſlender time to come) they had no ſmall diſadvantage from the conſtitution of Old age, which naturally makes men fearfull, and complexionally ſuperannuated from the bold and couragious thoughts of Youth and fervent years. But the contempt of Death from corporal animoſity promoteth not our Felicity. They may ſit in the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi> and nobleſt Seats of Heaven, who have held up ſhaking hands in the Fire, and humanely contended for Glory.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile <hi>Epicurus</hi> lies deep in <hi>Dante</hi>'s Hell, wherein we meet with Tombs encloſing Souls which denied their Immortalities. But whether the vertuous Heathen, who lived better then he ſpake, or erring in the Principles of himſelf, yet lived above Philoſophers of more ſpecious Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes, lie ſo deep as he is placed, at leaſt ſo low as not to riſe againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who, believing or knowing that Truth, have laſtingly denied it in their practice and converſation, were a Quere too ſad to inſiſt on.</p>
               <p>But all or moſt apprehenſions reſted in Opinions of ſome future Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ignorantly or coldly believed beget thoſe perverted Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Ceremonies, Sayings, which Chriſtians pity or laugh at, Happy are they which live not in that diſadvantage of time, when men could ſay little for Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity but from Reaſon; whereby the nobleſt mindes fell often upon doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deaths and melancholick Diſſolutions.

It is the heavieſt ſtone that Melancholy can throw at a man, to tell him he is at the end of his Nature; or that there is no farther State to come, unto which this ſeems progreſſional, and otherwiſe made in vain.

Had they made as good proviſion for their Names as they have done for their Reliques, they had not ſo groſsly erred in the art of Perpetuation. But to ſubſiſt in Bones, and be but pyramidally extant, is a fallacy in Duration. Vain Aſhes, which, in the oblivion of Names, Perſons, Times and Sexes, have found unto themſelves a fruitleſs Continuation, and onely ariſe unto late Poſterity as Emblems of mortal Vanities, Antidotes againſt Pride, Vain-glory, and madding Vices! Pagan Vain-glories, which thought the World might laſt for ever, had encouragement for Ambition, and finding no <hi>Atropos</hi> unto the immortality of their Names, were never dampt with the neceſſity of Oblivion. Even old Ambitions had the advantage of ours in the attempts of their Vain-glories, who acting early, and before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Meridian of Time, have by this time found great accompliſhment of their Deſigns, whereby the ancient Heroes have already out-laſted their Monuments and Mechanical Preſervations.

unto preſent conſiderations ſeems a Vanity almoſt out of date, and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated piece of Folly. We cannot hope to live ſo long in our names as ſome have done in their perſons: one Face of <hi>Janus</hi> holds no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the other. 'Tis too late to be Ambitious. The great Mutations of the World are acted, or time may be too ſhort for our Deſigns. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our Memories by Monuments, whoſe death we daily pray for, and whoſe duration we cannot hope without injury to our expectations in the advent of the laſt Day, were a contradiction to our Beliefs. We, whoſe Generations are ordained in this ſetting part of Time, are providentially taken off from ſuch imaginations; and, being neceſſitated to eye the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining particle of Futurity, are naturally conſtituted unto thoughts of the next World, and cannot excuſably decline the conſideration of that Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which maketh Pyramids Pillars of ſnow, and all that's paſt a Moment.</p>
               <p>Circles and Right lines limit and cloſe all Bodies, and the mortal right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined Circle (<note n="g" place="margin">Θ The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Death.</note>) muſt conclude and ſhut up all. There is no Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Opium</hi> of Time, which temporally conſidereth all things. Our Fathers finde their Graves in our ſhort Memories, and ſadly tell us how we may be buried in our Survivors. Grave-ſtones tell truth ſcarce forty years (<note n="h" place="margin">Old ones being taken up, and other Bodies laid under them.</note>). Generations paſs while ſome Trees ſtand, and old Families laſt not three Oaks. To be read by bare Inſcriptions, like many in <hi>Gruter</hi> (<note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gruteri</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptiones an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquae.</note>), to hope for Eternity by AEnigmatical Epithets or firſt letters of our Names, to be ſtudied by Antiquaries who we were, and have new Names given us like many of the Mummies, are cold Conſolations unto the Students of Perpetuity, even by everlaſting Languages.</p>
               <p>To be content that Times to come ſhould onely know there was ſuch a man, not caring whether they knew more of him, was a frigid Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Cardan</hi> (<note n="k" place="margin">Cuperem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſſc quòd ſim, non opto ut ſciatur qualis ſim. <hi>Card.</hi> in vita propria.</note>), diſparaging his horoſcopal inclination and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf. Who cares to ſubſiſt like <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Patients, or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi>'s Horſes in <hi>Homer,</hi> under naked Nominations, without Deſerts and noble acts, which are the balſame of our Memories, the <hi>Entelechia</hi> and Soul of our Subſiſtences. To be nameleſs in worthy deed exceeds an infamous Hiſtory. The <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> woman lives more happily without a name, then <hi>Herodias</hi> with one. And who had not rather have been the good Thief, then <hi>Pilate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the iniquity of Oblivion blindly ſcattereth her Poppy, and deals with the Memory of men without diſtinction to merit of Perpetuity. Who can but pity the Founder of the Pyramids? <hi>Heroſtratus</hi> lives that burnt the Temple of <hi>Diana;</hi> he is almoſt loſt that built it. Time hath ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Epitaph of <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Horſe, confounded that of himſelf. In vain we compute our Felicities by the advantage of our good Names, ſince bad have equal durations; and <hi>Therſites</hi> is like to live as long as <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> without the favour of the everlaſting Regiſter. Who knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the beſt of men be known? or whether there be not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable perſons forgot, then any that ſtand remembred in the known
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103367:19"/>
account of Time? The firſt man had been as unknown as the laſt, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſelah</hi>'s long life had been his onely Chronicle.</p>
               <p>Oblivion is not to be hired: The greater part muſt be content to be as though they had not been, to be found in the Regiſter of God, not in the Record of Man. Twenty ſeven names make up the firſt Story, and the recorded names ever ſince contain not one living Century. The number of the dead long exceedeth all that ſhall live. The Night of Time far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth the Day, and who knows when was the Aequinox? Every hour adds unto that current Arithmetick, which ſcarce ſtands one moment. And ſince Death muſt be the <hi>Lucina</hi> of Life, and even Pagans could doubt whether thus to live were to die; ſince our longeſt Sun ſets at right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions, and makes but Winter Arches, and therefore it cannot be long before we lie down in Darkneſs, and have our light in Aſhes; ſince the Brother of Death daily haunts us with dying <hi>Memento's,</hi> and Time, that grows old it ſelf, bids us hope no long Duration: Diuturnity is a Dream and folly of expectation.</p>
               <p>Darkneſs and Light divide the courſe of Time, and Oblivion ſhares with Memory a great part even of our living Beings; we ſlightly remember our Felicities, and the ſmarteſt ſtroaks of Affliction leave but ſhort ſmart upon us. Senſe endureth no extremities, and Sorrows deſtroy us or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To weep into Stones are Fables. Afflictions induce calloſities, Miſeries are ſlippery, or fall like Snow upon us, which notwithſtanding is no Stupiditie. To be ignorant of evils to come, and forgetfull of evils paſt, is mercifull proviſion in Nature, whereby we digeſt the mixture of our few and evil days, and our delivered Senſes not relapſing into cutting remembrances, our Sorrows are not kept raw by the edge of repetitions. A great part of Antiquity contented their hopes of ſubſiſtency with a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of their Souls. A good way to continue their Memories, while having the advantage of plural ſucceſſions, they could not but act ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable in ſuch variety of Beings, and enjoying the fame of their paſſed ſelves, make accumulation of glory unto their laſt Durations. Others, rather then be loſt in the uncomfortable night of Nothing, were content to recede into the common Being, and make one particle of the publick Soul of all things, which was no more then to return into their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and divine Original again. <hi>Agyptian</hi> ingenuity was more unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, contriving their Bodies in ſweet Conſiſtences to attend the return of their Souls.

               <p>In vain do Individuals hope for Immortality, or any patent from Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, in preſervations below the Moon: Men have been deceived even in their flatteries above the Sun, and ſtudied conceits to perpetuate their names in Heaven. The various Coſmographie of that part hath already
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103367:20"/>
varied the names of contrived Conſtellations; <hi>Nimrod</hi> is loſt in <hi>Orion,</hi> and <hi>Oſiris</hi> in the Dog-ſtar. While we look for incorruption in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, we finde they are but like the Earth; durable in their main Bodies, alterable in their Parts: whereof, beſide Comets and new Stars, Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives begin to tell tales; and the Spots that wander about the Sun, with <hi>Phaethon</hi>'s favour, would make clear conviction.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſtrictly immortal but Immortality; what-ever hath no Beginning may be confident of no End: (all others have a dependent Being, and within the reach of deſtruction) which is the peculiar of that neceſſary Eſſence that cannot deſtroy it ſelf; and the higheſt ſtrain of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, to be ſo powerfully conſtituted, as not to ſuffer even from the power of it ſelf. But the ſufficiency of Chriſtian Immortality fruſtrates all earthly glory, and the quality of either ſtate after death makes a folly of poſthumous memory. God, who can onely deſtroy our Souls, and hath aſſured our Reſurrection, either of our Bodies or Names hath directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed no duration; wherein there is ſo much of Chance, that the boldeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants have found unhappy fruſtration; and to hold long ſubſiſtence, ſeems but a ſcape in Oblivion. But man is a noble Animal, ſplendid in Aſhes, and pompous in the Grave, ſolemnizing Nativities and Deaths with equal Iuſtre, nor omitting Ceremonies of Bravery in the infamy of his nature.</p>
               <p>Life is a pure Flame, and we live by an inviſible Sun within us. A ſmall Fire ſufficeth for life, great Flames ſeemed too little after death, while men vainly affected precious Pyres, and to burn like <hi>Sardanapalus.</hi> But the wiſedom of Funeral Laws found the folly of prodigal Blazes, and reduced undoing Fires unto the rule of ſober Obſequies, wherein few could be ſo mean as not to provide Wood, Pitch, a Mourner, and an Urn.</p>
               <p>Five Languages ſecured not the Epitaph of <hi>Gordianus.</hi> The man of God lives longer without a Tomb then any by one, inviſibly interred by Angels, and adjudged to obſcurity, though not without ſome marks dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting humane diſcovery. <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> without either Tomb or Burial, in an anomalous ſtate of being, are the great examples of Perpetuity in their long and living Memory, in ſtrict account being ſtill on this ſide Death, and having a late Part yet to act upon this Stage of Earth. If in the decretory term of the world we ſhall not all die, but be changed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to received Tranſlation, the laſt Day will make but few Graves; at leaſt quick Reſurrections will anticipate laſting Sepultures: Some Graves will be opened before they be quite cloſed, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> be no wonder, when many that feared to die ſhall groan that they can die but once. The diſmall ſtate is the ſecond and living Death, when Life puts deſpair on the damned; when men ſhall wiſh the coverings of Mountains, not of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, and Annihilation ſhall be courted.</p>
               <p>While ſome have ſtudied Monuments, others have ſtudiouſly declined them; and ſome have been ſo vainly boiſterous, that they durſt not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

Even <hi>Sylla,</hi> that thought himſelf ſafe in his Urn, could not prevent revenging Tongues, and Stones thrown at his Monument.

               <p>Pyramids, Arches, Obelisks, were but the irregularities of Vain-glory, and wilde enormities of ancient Magnanimity. But the moſt magnanimous reſolution reſts in the Chriſtian Religion, which trampleth upon Pride, and ſits on the neck of Ambition, humbly purſuing that infallible Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto which all others muſt diminiſh their Diameters, and be poorly ſeen in Angles of contingency <note n="n" place="margin">

And if any have been ſo happy as truely to underſtand Chriſtian Annihilation, <hi>Ecſtaſis,</hi> Exſolution, Liquefaction, Transformation, the Kiſs of the Spouſe, Guſtation of God, and Ingreſſion into the Divine ſhadow, they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had an handſome anticipation of Heaven; the glory of the World is ſurely over, and the Earth in Aſhes unto them.</p>
               <p>To ſubſiſt in laſting Monuments, to live in their productions, to exiſt in their Names, and predicament of <hi>Chimera's,</hi> was large ſatisfaction unto old expectations, and made one part of their <hi>Elyziums.</hi> But all this is nothing in the Metaphyſicks of true Belief.

               <p>What Figure the Stones themſelves maintained, Tradition and Scripture are ſilent; yet Lapidaries in precious Stones affect a Table or long Square, and in ſuch proportion, that the two lateral and alſo the three inferiour Tables are equal unto the ſuperiour, and the Angles of the late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tables contain and conſtitute the <hi>Hypotenuſae</hi> or broader ſides ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending.</p>

               <p>Thus hath Nature ranged the Flowers of Santfoyn and French Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckle; and ſomewhat after this manner hath ordered the buſh in <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Beard, or Houſe-leek, which old Superſtition ſet on the tops of houſes as a defenſative againſt Lightning and Thunder. The like in Fenny Seagreen, or the Water-<note n="b" place="margin">Stratiotes.</note> Souldier; which, though a military name from <hi>Greece,</hi> makes out the <hi>Roman</hi> Order.</p>
               <p>A like ordination there is in the favaginous Sockets and Lozenge-ſeeds of the noble Flower of the Sun, wherein in Lozenge-figured Boxes Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhuts up the Seeds and Balſame which is about them.</p>
               <p>But the Firre and Pine-tree from their Fruits do naturally dictate this poſition: the Rhomboidal protuberances in Pine-apples maintaining this Quincuncial Order unto each other, and each <hi>Rhombus</hi> in it ſelf. Thus are alſo diſpoſed the triangular Foliations in the conicall Fruit of the Firre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, orderly ſhadowing and protecting the winged Seeds below them.</p>
               <p>The like ſo often occurreth to the curioſity of Obſervers, eſpecially in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103367:29"/>
ſpicated Seeds and Flowers, that we ſhall not need to take in the ſingle Quincunx of <hi>Fuchſius</hi> in the growth of the male Fern, the ſeedy diſpoſure of <hi>Gramen Iſchaemon,</hi> and the Trunk or neat Reticulate work in the Cod of the Sachell-palm.</p>
               <p>For even in very many round-ſtalked Plants the Leaves are ſet after a quintuple Ordination, the firſt Leaf anſwering the fifth in lateral diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherein the Leaves ſucceſſively rounding the Stalk, in four at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt the Compaſs is abſolved, and the fifth Leaf or Sprout returns to the poſition of the other fifth before it; as in accounting upward is often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in furre-Pelitory, Ragweed, the Sprouts of Oaks, and Thorns upon Pollards, and very remarkable in the regular diſpoſure of the rugged excreſcencies in the yearly Shoots of the Pine.</p>
               <p>But in ſquare-ſtalked Plants the Leaves ſtand reſpectively unto each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either in croſs or decuſſation to thoſe above or below them, ariſing at croſs poſitions; whereby they ſhadow not each other, and better reſiſt the force of Winds, which in a parallel ſituation and upon ſquare Stalks would more forcibly beat upon them.</p>
               <p>And to omit, how Leaves and Sprouts which compaſs not the Stalk are often ſet in a Rhomboides, and, making long and ſhort Diagonals, do ſtand like the Legs of Quadrupedes when they go; nor to urge the thwart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure and furdling of Flowers and Bloſſomes before explication, as in the multiplied Leaves of Pionie; and the <hi>Chiaſmus</hi> in five-leaved Flowers, while one lies wrapt about the ſtaminous Beards, the other four obliquely ſhutting and cloſing upon each other; and how even Flowers which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of four Leaves ſtand not ordinarily in three and one, but two and two croſs-wiſe unto the <hi>Stylus:</hi> even the Autumnal Buds, which await the return of the Sun, do after the Winter Solſtice multiply their calicular Leaves, making little <hi>Rhombus's</hi> and Network-figures, as in the Sycamore and Lilac.</p>
               <p>The like is diſcoverable in the original production of Plants, which firſt putting forth two Leaves, thoſe which ſucceed bear not over each other, but ſhoot obliquely or croſs-wiſe, untill the Stalk appeareth, which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not forth its firſt Leaves without all order unto them: and he that from hence can diſcover in what poſition the two firſt Leaves did ariſe, is no ordinary Obſervator.</p>
               <p>Where, by the way, he that obſerveth the rudimental Spring of Seeds, ſhall find ſtrict rule, although not after this order. How little is required unto effectual Generation, and in what diminutives the Plaſtick Principle lodgeth, is exemplified in Seeds, wherein the greater maſs affords ſo little comproduction. In Beans the Leaf and Root ſprout from the Germen, the main ſides ſplit and lie by; and in ſome pull'd up near the time of Blooming we have found the pulpous ſides intire or little waſted. In Acorns the Neb dilating ſplitteth the two ſides, which ſometimes lie whole when the Oak is ſprouted two handfuls. In Lupins theſe pulpy ſides do
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103367:29"/>
ſometimes ariſe with the Stalk in a reſemblance of two fat Leaves. Wheat and Rie will grow up, if, after they have ſhot ſome tender Roots, the adhering Pulp be taken from them. Beans will proſper though a part be cut away, and ſo much ſet as ſufficeth to contain and keep the Germen cloſe. From this ſuperfluous Pulp, in unkindly and wet years, may ariſe that multiplicity of little Inſects which infeſt the Roots and Sprouts of tender Grains and Pulſes.</p>
               <p>In the little Neb or fructifying principle the motion is regular, and not tranſvertible, as to make that ever the Leaf which Nature intendeth the Root; obſervable from their Converſion untill they attain their right poſition, if Seeds be ſet inverſedly.</p>
               <p>In vain we expect the production of Plants from different parts of the Seed; from the ſame <hi>Corculum</hi> or little original proceed both Germinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and in the power of this ſlender particle lie many Roots, that though the ſame be pull'd away, the generative particle will renew them again, and proceed to a perfect Plant: And Malt may be obſerved to grow, though the Cooms be fallen from it.</p>
               <p>The Seminal Neb hath a defined and ſingle place, and not extended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both extremes. And therefore many too vulgarly conceive that Barley and Oats grow at both ends; for they ariſe from one <hi>punctilio</hi> or genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Neb, and the Spear, ſliding under the Husk, firſt appeareth nigh the top. But in Wheat and Rie, being bare, the Sprouts are ſeen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. If Barley unhulled would grow, both would appear at once. But in this and Oat-meal the Neb is broken away; which makes them the milder food, and leſs apt to raiſe Fermentation in Decoctions.</p>
               <p>Men taking notice of what is outwardly viſible, conceive a ſenſible pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority in the Root. But as they begin from one part, ſo they ſeem to ſtart and ſet out upon one ſignal of Nature. In Beans yet ſoft, in Peaſe while they adhere unto the Cod, the rudimental Leaf and Root are diſcoverable. In the Seeds of Rocket and Muſtard, ſprouting in Glaſſes of water, when the one is manifeſt, the other is alſo perceptible. In muddy waters, apt to breed Duck-weed and Perwinkles, if the firſt and rudimental ſtroaks of Duck-weed be obſerved, the Leaves and Root anticipate not each other. But in the Date-ſtone the firſt Sprout is neither Root nor Leaf diſtinctly, but both together: For the Germination being to paſs through the narrow Navel and hole about the midſt of the Stone, the generative Germ is fain to inlengthen it ſelf, and ſhooting out about an inch, at that diſtance divideth into the aſcending and deſcending portion.</p>
               <p>And though it be generally thought that Seeds will root at that end where they adhere to their Originals, and obſervable it is that the Neb ſits moſt often next the Stalk, as in Grains, Pulſes, and moſt ſmall Seeds; yet is it hardly made out in many greater Plants. For in Acorns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Almonds, Piſtachios, Walnuts, and acuminated Shells, the Germ puts forth at the remoteſt part of the Pulp. And therefore to ſet Seeds in that poſture
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103367:30"/>
wherein the Leaf and Roots may ſhoot right without contortion or forced circumvolution, which might render them ſtrongly rooted and ſtraighter, were a Criticiſm in Agriculture. And Nature ſeems to have made ſome proviſion hereof in many from their Figure, that as they fall from the Tree they may lie in poſitions agreeable to ſuch advantages.</p>
               <p>Beſide the open and viſible Teſticles of Plants, the ſeminal Pores lie ingreat part inviſible, while the Sun finds Polypody in Stone-walls, the little ſtinging Nettle and Nightſhade in barren ſandy High-ways, Scurvy-graſs in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and unknown Plants brought in earth from remote Countreys. Beſide the known longevity of ſome Trees, what is the moſt laſting Herb or Seed ſeems not eaſily determinable. Mandrakes upon known account have lived near an hundred years. Seeds found in Wild-Fowls Gizzards have ſprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the earth. The Seeds of Marjoram and <hi>Stramonium,</hi> careleſly kept, have grown after ſeven years. Even in Garden-plots longfallow, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up, the Seeds of <hi>Blattaria</hi> and yellow Henbane after twelve years bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall have produced themſelves again.</p>
               <p>That Bodies are firſt Spirits <hi>Paracelſus</hi> could affirm, which in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation<note place="margin">In met, cum <hi>Cabeo.</hi>
                  </note> of Seeds and Fruits ſeems obſcurely implied by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when he delivereth that the ſpirituous parts are converted into Water, and the Water into Earth; and atteſted by obſervation in the maturative progreſs of Seeds, wherein at firſt may be diſcerned a flatuous diſtention of the Husk, afterwards a thin Liquour, which longer time digeſteth into a Pulp or Kernell, obſervable in Almonds and large Nuts; and ſomeway anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the progreſſionall perfection of animal Semination, in its ſpermati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call maturation from crude pubeſcency unto perfection. And even that Seeds themſelves in their rudimentall diſcoveries appear in foliaceous Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or Sprouts within their Coverings, in a diaphanous Jellie, before dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per incraſſation, is alſo viſibly verified in Cherries, Acorns, Plums.</p>
               <p>From Seminal conſiderations, either in reference unto one another, or diſtinction from animal production, the Holy Scripture deſcribeth the Vegetable creation; and while it divideth Plants but into Herb and Tree, though it ſeemeth to make but an accidental Diviſion from magnitude, it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly containeth the natural diſtinction of Vegetables obſerved by Herba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts, and comprehending the four kinds. For ſince the moſt natural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is made from the production of Leaf or Stalk, and Plants after the two firſt ſeminal Leaves do either proceed to ſend forth more Leaves, or a Stalk; the folious and ſtalky emiſſion diſtinguiſheth Herbs and Trees, and ſtand authentically differenced but from the accidents of the Stalk.</p>
               <p>The equivocal production of things under undiſcerned Principles makes a large part of Generation, though they ſeem to hold a wide Univocacy in their ſet and certain Originals, while almoſt every Plant breeds its peculiar Inſect, moſt a Butterfly, Moth or Fly; werein the Oak ſeems to contain the largeſt Seminality, while the <hi>Iulus,</hi> Oak-Apple, Dill, woolly Tuft, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raminous Roundles upon the Leaf, and Grapes under ground, make a Fly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103367:30"/>
with ſome difference. The great variety of Flies lies in the variety of their Originals. In the Seeds of Caterpillars or Cankers there lieth not onely a Butterfly or Moth, but, if they be ſteril or untimely caſt, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction is often a Fly; which we have alſo obſerved from corrupted and mouldred Eggs both of Hens and Fiſhes. To omit the generation of Bees out of the Bodies of dead Heifers, or, what is ſtrange, yet well atteſted, the production of Eels in the backs of living Cods and Perches <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The exiguity and ſmalneſs of ſome Seeds extending to large productions is one of the Magnalities of Nature, ſomewhat illuſtrating the work of the Creation, and vaſt production from Nothing. The true (<note n="c" place="margin">Doctiſſim. <hi>Laurenburg.</hi> Hort.</note>) Seeds of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and Rampions are indiſtinguiſhable by old eyes. Of the Seeds of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco a thouſand make not one grain. The diſputed Seeds of Harts-tongue and Maiden-hair require a greater number. From ſuch undiſcernible Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalities ariſe ſpontaneous Productions. He that would diſcern the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimentall ſtroak of a Plant, may behold it in the Original of Duckweed, at the bigneſs of a pin's point, from convenient water in Glaſſes; wherein a watchfull eye may alſo diſcover the puncticular Originals of Perwincles and Gnats.</p>
               <p>That Seeds of ſome Plants are leſs then any Animals ſeems of no clear deciſion. That the biggeſt of Vegetables exceedeth the biggeſt of Animals in full bulk and all dimenſions admits exception in the Whale, which in length and above-ground meaſure will alſo contend with tall Oaks. That the richeſt Odour of Plants ſurpaſſeth that of Animals may ſeem of ſome doubt, ſince animal-Musk ſeems to excell the vegetable, and we finde ſo noble a ſent in the Tulip-Fly and (<note n="d" place="margin">The long and tender green <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornus,</hi> rarely found: we could never meet with but two.</note>) Goat-Beetle.</p>
               <p>Now whether ſeminal Nebs hold any ſure proportion unto ſeminal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, why the form of the Germ doth not anſwer the figure of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing Pulp; why the Neb is ſeated upon the ſolid and not the chanell'd ſide of the Seed, as in Grains; why, ſince we often meet with two Yolks in one Shell, and ſometimes one Egg within another, we do not oftener meet with two Nebs in one diſtinct Seed; why, ſince the Eggs of a Hen laid at one courſe do commonly out-weigh the Bird, and ſome Moths co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of their Caſes, without aſſiſtence of food, will lay ſo many Eggs as to outweigh their Bodies, Trees rarely bear their Fruit in that gravity or proportion; whether in the germination of Seeds, according to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> the lighter part aſcendeth and maketh the Sprout, the heavieſt tending downward frameth the Root, ſince we obſerve that the firſt Shoot of Seeds in water will ſink or bow down at the upper and leafing end; whether it be not more rational Epicuriſm to contrive whole diſhes out of the Neb, and ſpirited particles of Plants, then from the Gallatures and Treddles of Eggs, ſince that part is found to hold no ſeminal ſhare in Oval Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: are Quere's which might enlarge, but muſt conclude this Digreſſion.</p>
               <p>And though not in this Order, yet how Nature delighteth in this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and what conſent and coordination there is in the Leaves and parts of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103367:31"/>
Flowers, it cannot eſcape our obſervation in no ſmall number of Plants. For the calicular or ſupporting and cloſing Leaves do anſwer the number of the Flowers, eſpecially in ſuch as exceed not the number of Swallows Eggs; as in Violets, Stitchwort Bloſſomes: and Flowers of one Leaf have often five diviſions, anſwered by a like number of calicular Leaves; as <hi>Gentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella, Convolvulus,</hi> Bell-flowers. In many the Flowers, Blades, or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Shoots and Leaves are all equally five; as in Cockle, Mullein, and <hi>Blattaria,</hi> wherein the Flowers before explication are pentagonally wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, with ſome reſemblance of the <hi>Blatta</hi> or Moth, from whence it hath its name. But the contrivance of Nature is ſingular in the opening and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Bindeweeds, performed by five inflexures, diſtinguiſhable by py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramidicall figures and alſo different colours.</p>
               <p>The Roſe at firſt is thought to have been of five Leaves, as it yet grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wilde among us; but in the moſt luxuriant the calicular Leaves do ſtill maintain that number. But nothing is more admired then the five Brethren of the Roſe, and the ſtrange diſpoſure of the Appendices or Beards in the calicular Leaves thereof; which, in deſpair of reſolution, is tolerably ſalved from this contrivance, beſt ordered and ſuited for the free cloſure of them before explication. For thoſe two which are ſmooth and of no Beard are contrived to lie undermoſt, as without prominent parts, and fit to be ſmoothly covered; the other two which are beſet with Beards on either ſide ſtand outward and uncovered; but the fifth or half-bearded Leaf is covered on the bare ſide, but on the open ſide ſtands free, and bearded like the other.</p>
               <p>Beſides a large number of Leaves have five diviſions, and may be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed by a Pentagon or figure of five Angles, made by right lines from the extremity of their Leaves; as in Maple, Vine, Fig-Tree. But five-leaved Flowers are commonly diſpoſed circularly about the <hi>Stylus;</hi> according to the higher Geometry of Nature, dividing a Circle by five <hi>Radii,</hi> which concurre not to make Diameters, as in quadrilateral and ſexangular Interſections.</p>
               <p>Now the number of Five is remarkable in every Circle, not onely as the firſt ſpherical Number, but the meaſure of ſpherical Motion. For ſpherical Bodies move by Fives; and every globular Figure, placed upon a Plane, in direct volutation returns to the firſt point of Contaction in the firſt touch, accounting by the Axes of the Diameters or Cardinal Points of the four quarters thereof: and before it arriveth unto the ſame Point again, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth five Circles equal unto it ſelf, in each progreſs from thoſe quarters abſolving an equal Circle.</p>
               <p>By the ſame Number doth Nature divide the Circle of the Sea-ſtar, and in that order and number diſpoſeth thoſe elegant Semi-circles or dental Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and Eggs in the Sea-Hedge-hog. And no mean Obſervation hereof there is in the Mathematicks of the neateſt Retiary Spider, which concluding in forty four Circles, from five Semidiameters beginneth that elegant Texture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:103367:31"/>
And after this manner doth lay the foundation of the circular Branches of the Oak, which being five-cornered in the tender annual Sprouts, and manifeſting upon inciſion the ſignature of a Star, is after made circular, and ſwell'd into a round Body. Which practice of Nature is become a point of Art, and makes two Problems in <hi>Euclide.</hi> But the Briar, which ſends<note place="margin">Elem. li. <hi>4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

To omit the five ſmall Buttons dividing the Circle of the Ivy-berry, and the five characters in the Winter-ſtalk of the Wall-nut, with many other Obſervables, which cannot eſcape the eyes of ſignal Diſcerners; ſuch as know where to finde <hi>Ajax</hi> his name in <hi>Gallitricum,</hi> or <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Mitre in Henbane.</p>
               <p>Quincuncial forms and Ordinations are alſo obſervable in Animal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations. For to omit the <hi>Hyoïdes</hi> or Throat-bone of Animals; the <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi> or Merry-thought in Birds, which ſupporteth the <hi>Scapulae,</hi> affording a paſſage for the Winde-pipe and the Gullet; the Wings of Flies, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of their Legs in their firſt formation from Maggots, and the poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Horns, Wings and Legs in their <hi>Aurelian</hi> Caſes and Swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-clouts: the back of the <hi>Cimex arboreus,</hi> found often upon Trees and leſſer Plants, doth elegantly diſcover the <hi>Burgundian</hi> Decuſſation. And the like is obſervable in the Belly of the <hi>Notonecton</hi> or Water-Beetle, which ſwimmeth on its back; and the handſome <hi>Rhombus'es</hi> of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poult or Werrell, on either ſide the Spine.</p>
               <p>The ſexangular Cells in the Honey-combs of Bees are diſpoſed after this Order. Much there is not of wonder in the confuſed Houſes of Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires, though much in their buſie life and actions: more in the edificial Palaces of Bees thoſe Monarchical ſpirits, who make their Combs ſix-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner'd, declining a Circle, whereof many ſtand not cloſe together, and compleatly fill the <hi>Area</hi> of the place; but rather affecting a ſix-ſided Figure, whereby every Cell affords a common ſide unto ſix more, and alſo a fit receptacle for the Bee it ſelf, which, gathering into a Cylindrical Figure, aptly enters its ſexangular houſe, more nearly approaching a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Figure then either doth the Square or Triangle. And the Combs themſelves are ſo regularly contrived, that their mutual Interſections make three Lozenges at the bottom of every Cell; which ſeverally regarded make three Rows of neat Rhomboîdal Figures, connected at the Angles, and ſo continue three ſeveral Chains throughout the whole Comb.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Favago</hi> found commonly on the Sea-ſhoar, though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from an Honey-comb, it but rudely makes out the reſemblance, and better agrees with the round Cells of Humble-bees. He that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly diſcern the ſhop of a Bee's mouth needs obſerving eyes, and good augmenting-Glaſſes, wherein is diſcoverable one of the neateſt pieces in Nature; and muſt have a more piercing eye then mine, who findes out the ſhape of Bull's heads in the Guts of Drones preſſed out behinde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>A reſemblance hereof there is in the orderly and rarely-diſpoſed Cells made by Flies and Inſects, which we have often found faſtened about ſmall Sprigs; and in thoſe cottonary and woolly pillows which ſometimes we meet with faſtened unto Leaves, there is included an elegant Net-work Texture, out of which come many ſmall Flies. And ſome reſemblance there is of this Order in the Eggs of ſome Butterflies and Moths, as they ſtick upon Leaves and other ſubſtances; which being dropped from behinde, nor directed by the eye, doth neatly declare how Nature Geometrizeth, and obſerveth Order in all things.</p>
               <p>A like correſpondency in Figure is found in the Skins and outward Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Animals, whereof a regardable part are beautifull by this Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As the Backs of ſeveral Snakes and Serpents, elegantly remarkable in the <hi>Aſpis</hi> and the Dart-ſnake, in the <hi>Chiaſmus</hi> and larger Decuſſations upon the Back of the Rattle-ſnake, and in the cloſe and finer Texture of the <hi>Mater formicarum,</hi> or Snake that delights in Ant-hils; whereby, upon approach of outward injuries, they can raiſe a thicker Phalanx on their Backs, and handſomely contrive themſelves into all kindes of Flexures: whereas their Bellies are commonly covered with ſmooth ſemicircular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, as beſt accommodable unto their quick and gliding mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This way is followed by Nature in the peculiar and remarkable Tail of the Bever, wherein the ſcaly particles are diſpoſed ſomewhat after this order; which is the plaineſt reſolution of the wonder of <hi>Bellonius,</hi> while he ſaith, with incredible Artifice hath Nature framed the Tail or Oar of the Bever. Where by the way we cannot but wiſh a model of their Houſes, ſo much extolled by ſome Deſcribers: wherein ſince they are ſo bold as to venture upon three Stages, we might examine their Artifice in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignations, the rule and order in the Compartitions; or whether that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified Structure be any more then a rude rectangular Pile or meer Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-building.</p>

               <p>This Reticulate or Net-work was alſo conſiderable in the inward parts of Man, not onely from the firſt <hi>Subtegmen</hi> or Warp of his formation, but in the netty Fibres of the Veins and Veſſels of life; wherein, according to common Anatomie, the right and tranſverſe Fibres are decuſſated by the oblique Fibres, and ſo muſt frame a Reticulate and Quincuncial Figure by their Obliquations, emphatically extending that Elegant expreſſion of Scripture, <hi>Thou haſt curiouſly embroidered me, thou haſt wrought me up after the fineſt way of Texture, and as it were with a Needle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is the ſame obſervable onely in ſome Parts, but in the whole Body of Man, which upon the extenſion of Arms and Legs doth make out a Square, whoſe Interſection is at the Genitals. To omit the phantaſtical Quincunx in <hi>Plato</hi> of the firſt Hermaphrodite or Double man, united at the Loins, which <hi>Jupiter</hi> after divided.</p>
               <p>A rudimental reſemblance hereof there is in the cruciated and rugged folds of the <hi>Reticulum</hi> or Net-like Ventricle of ruminating horned Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which is the ſecond in order, culinarily called the Honey-comb: for many diviſions there are in the Stomack of ſeveral Animals. What number they maintain in the <hi>Scurus</hi> and ruminating Fiſh, common deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or our own experiment hath made no diſcovery. But in the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of <hi>Porpuſſes</hi> there are three diviſions; in many Birds a Crop, Giz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and little Receptacle before it. But in Cornigerous Animals, which chew the Cud, there are no leſs then four of diſtinct poſition and office.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reticulum</hi> by theſe croſſed Cells makes a farther Digeſtion in the dry and exſuccous part of the Aliment received from the firſt Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle. For at the bottome of the Gallet there is a double Orifice: What is firſt received at the Mouth deſcendeth into the firſt and greater Stomack, from whence it is returned into the Mouth again; and after a fuller Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication and ſalivous mixture, what part thereof deſcendeth again in a moiſt and ſucculent body, it ſlides down the ſofter and more permeable Orifice into the <hi>Omaſus</hi> or third Stomack; and from thence conveyed into the fourth, receives its laſt Digeſtion. The other dry and exſuccous part, after Rumination by the larger and ſtronger Orifice, beareth into the firſt Stomack, from thence into the <hi>Reticulum,</hi> and ſo progreſſively
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103367:33"/>
into the other diviſions. And therefore in Calves newly calved there is little or no uſe of the two firſt Ventricles, for the milk and liquid ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſlippeth down the ſofter Orifice into the third Stomack; where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king little or no ſtay, it paſſeth into the fourth, the ſeat of the <hi>Coagulum</hi> or Runnet, or that diviſion of Stomack which ſeems to bear the name of the whole in the <hi>Greek</hi> tranſlation of the Prieſt's Fee in the Sacrifice of Peace-offerings.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe Rhomboidal Figures made by the Cartilagineous parts of the Wezon in the Lungs of great Fiſhes and other Animals, as <hi>Rondeleti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> diſcovered, we have not found them ſo to anſwer our Figure as to be drawn into illuſtration. Something we expected in the more diſcernable texture of the Lungs of Frogs, which notwithſtanding being but two cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Bladders, not weighting above a grain, we found interwoven with Veins, not obſerving any juſt order. More orderly ſituated are thoſe cretaceous and chalky Concretions found ſometimes in the bigneſs of a ſmall Vetch on either ſide their Spine; which being not agreeable unto our order, nor yet obſerved by any, we ſhall not here diſcourſe on.</p>
               <p>But had we found a better account and tolerable Anatomy of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Jowl of the<note n="e" place="margin">1652. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in our <hi>Pſeudo-Epidem.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Sperma-Ceti</hi>-Whale, then queſtuary operation or the ſtench of the laſt caſt upon our Shoar permitted; we might have perhaps diſcovered ſome handſome order in thoſe Net-like Seats and Sockets, made like Honey-combs, containing that medicall matter.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Inceſſion or Local motion of Animals is made with ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy unto this Figure, by decuſſative Diametrals, Quincuncial Lines and Angles. For, to omit the enquiry how Butterflies and Breezes move their four Wings, how Birds and Fiſhes in aire and water move by joynt ſtroaks of oppoſite Wings and Fins, and how ſalient Animals in jumping forward ſeem to ariſe and fall upon a ſquare Baſe; as the Station of moſt Quadrupedes is made upon a long Square, ſo in their Motion they make a Rhomboides, their common Progreſſion being performed diametrally by Decuſſation and croſs advancement of their Legs; which not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, begot that remarkable abſurdity in the poſition of the Legs of <hi>Caſtor</hi>'s Horſe in the Capitol. The Snake, which moveth circularly, makes his Spires in like order, the convex and concave Spirals anſwering each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at alternate diſtances. In the motion of Man the Arms and Legs obſerve this thwarting poſition; but the Legs alone do move Quincunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by ſingle Angles, with ſome reſemblance of an V, meaſured by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive advancement from each Foot, and the Angle of Indenture great or leſs, according to the extent or brevity of the Stride.</p>
               <p>Studious Obſervators may diſcover more Analogies in the orderly Book of Nature, and cannot eſcape the Elegancy of her hand in other Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies.

               <p>Right lines and Circles make out the bulk of Plants: In the parts thereof we finde Helicall or ſpiral Roundles, Voluta's, conicall Sections, circular Pyramids and Fruſtums of <hi>Archimedes;</hi> and cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the orderly hand of Nature, in the alternate ſucceſſion of the flat and narrower ſides in the tender Shoots of the Aſh, or the regular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of bigneſs in the five-leaved Flowers of Henbane, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like in the calicular Leaves of <hi>Tutſan:</hi> How the Spots of <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caria</hi> do manifeſt themſelves between the ſixth and tenth Rib; how the triangular Cap in the Stem or <hi>Stylus</hi> of Tulips doth conſtantly point at three outward Leaves; that ſpicated Flowers do open firſt at the Stalk; that white Flowers have yellow Thrums or Knops; that the Nebs of Beans and Peaſe do all look downward, and ſo preſs not upon each other; and how the Seeds of many pappous or downy Flowers lockt up in Sockets, after a Gomphoſis or <hi>mortis</hi>-articulation diffuſe themſelves circularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Branches of rare order, obſervable in <hi>Tragopogon</hi> or Goat's-beard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Spider's web, and the <hi>Radii</hi> in like manner telarly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven.</p>
               <p>And how in Animal natures even Colours hold correſpondencies and mutual correlations. That the colour of the Caterpillar will ſhew again in the Butterfly, with ſome latitude is allowable. Though the regular Spots in their Wings ſeem but a mealie adheſion, and ſuch as may be wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; yet ſince they come in this variety out of their Caſes, there muſt be regular Pores in thoſe parts and Membranes defining ſuch Exudations.</p>

Whether after the like method medicall conjecture may not be raiſed upon Parts inwardly affected, ſince parts about the Lips are the criticall ſeats of Puſtules diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in Agues, and ſcrophulous Tumours about the Neck do ſo often ſpeak the like about the Meſentery; may alſo be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The ruſſet Neck in young Lambs ſeems but adventitious, and may owe its tincture to ſome contaction in the Womb: But that if Sheep have

any black or deep Ruſſet in their Faces, they want not the ſame about their Legs and Feet; that black Hounds have mealy Mouths and Feet; that black Cows, which have any white in their Tails, ſhould not miſs of ſome in their Bellies; and if all white in their Bodies, yet if black-mouth'd, their Ears and Feet maintain the ſame colour: are correſpondent Tinctures not ordinarily failing in Nature, which eaſily unites the accidents of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, ſince in ſome Generations ſhe tranſmutes the Parts themſelves, while in the <hi>Aurelian Metamorphoſis</hi> the Head of the Canker becomes the Tail of the Butterfly. Which is in ſome way not beyond the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Art, in Submerſions and Inlays inverting the extremes of the Plant, and fetching the Root from the Top; and alſo imitated in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Columnary work, in the inverſion of the extremes, wherein the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitle and the Baſe hold ſuch near correſpondency.</p>
               <p>In the Motive parts of Animals may be diſcovered mutual proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; not onely in thoſe of Quadrupedes, but in the Thigh-bone, Leg, Foot-bone, and Claws of Birds. The Legs of Spiders are made after a ſeſquitertian proportion, and the long Legs of ſome Locuſts double un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome others. But the internodial parts of Vegetables, or ſpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Joynts, are contrived with more uncertainty; though the Joynts themſelves in many Plants maintain a regular Number.</p>
               <p>In Vegetable Compoſure the unition of prominent parts ſeems moſt to anſwer the <hi>Apophyſes</hi> or Proceſſes of Animal Bones, whereof they are the produced parts or prominent Explantations. And though in the parts of Plants which are not ordained for Motion we do not expect correſpondent Articulations; yet in the ſetting on of ſome Flowers and Seeds in their Sockets, and the lineal commiſſure of the Pulp of ſeveral Seeds, may be obſerved ſome ſhadow of the Harmony, ſome ſhow of the <hi>Gomphoſis</hi> or <hi>mortis</hi>-articulation.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Diarthroſis</hi> or motive Articulation, there is expected little Analogy: though long-ſtalked Leaves do move by long lines, and have obſervable Motions; yet are they made by outward impulſion, like the motion of pendulous Bodies, while the parts themſelves are united by ſome kinde of <hi>Symphyſis</hi> unto the Stock.</p>
               <p>But ſtanding Vegetables, void of motive Articulations, are not without many Motions. For beſide the motion of Vegetation upward, and of Radiation unto all quarters, that of Contraction, Dilatation, Inclination and Contortion, is diſcoverable in many Plants. To omit the Roſe of <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> the ear of Rie which moves with change of weather, and the Magical Spit, made of no rare Plants, which windes before the fire, and roſts the Bird without turning.</p>
               <p>Even Animals near the Claſſis of Plants ſeem to have the moſt reſtleſs Motions. The Summer-worm of Ponds and Plaſhes makes a long waving Motion; the Hair-worm ſeldom lies ſtill.

               <p>AS for the Delights, Commodities, Myſteries, with other concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Order, we are unwilling to fly them over in the ſhort deliveries of <hi>Virgil, Varro,</hi> or others, and ſhall therefore enlarge with additional ampliations.</p>
               <p>By this Poſition they had a juſt proportion of Earth to ſupply an equality of Nouriſhment; the Diſtance being ordered, thick or thin, according to the magnitude or vigorous attraction of the Plant, the goodneſs, leanneſs, or propriety of the Soil; and therefore the rule of <hi>Solon</hi> concerning the Territory of <hi>Athens</hi> not extendible unto all, allowing the diſtance of ſix foot unto common Trees, and nine for the Fig and Olive.</p>
               <p>They had a due diffuſion of their Roots on all or both ſides, whereby they maintained ſome proportion to their height in Trees of large radicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For that they ſtrictly make good their profundeur or depth unto their height, according to common conceit, and that expreſſion of<note n="a" place="margin">Quantum vertice ad au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras Aethere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, tantum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice ad tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra tendit.</note> 
                  <hi>Virgil,</hi> though confirmable from the Plane-tree in <hi>Pliny,</hi> and ſome few examples, is not to be expected from the generation of Trees almoſt in any kinde, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſide-ſpreading or tap-roots; except we meaſure them by lateral and oppoſite diffuſions; nor commonly to be found in <hi>minor</hi> or herby Plants, if we except Sea-holly, Liquoriſh, Sea-ruſh, and ſome others.</p>
               <p>They had a commodious radiation in their growth, and a due expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Branches for ſhadow or delight. For Trees thickly plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted do run up in height and branch with no expanſion, ſhooting unequally, or ſhort and thin, upon the neighbouring ſide. And therefore Trees are inwardly bare, and ſpring and leaf from the outward and Sunny ſide of their Branches.</p>
               <p>Whereby they alſo avoided the perill of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or one Tree pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing with another, as it happeneth ofttimes from the ſick <hi>Effluviums</hi> or entanglements of Roots, falling foul with each other; obſervable in Elmes ſet in Hedges, where if one dieth, the neighbouring Tree proſpereth not long after.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, divided into many intervalls, and open unto ſix paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they had the advantage of a fair perflation from windes, bruſhing and cleanſing their ſurfaces, relaxing and cloſing their Pores unto due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. For that they afford large <hi>Effluviums,</hi> perceptible from Odours diffuſed at great diſtances, is obſervable from Onions out of the Earth, which though dry, and kept untill the Spring, as they ſhoot forth large and many Leaves, do notably abate of their weight: and Mint growing in Glaſſes of water, untill it arriveth unto the weight of an ounce, in a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy place, will ſometimes exhauſt a pound of water.</p>
               <p>And as they ſend forth much, ſo may they receive ſomewhat in: For
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103367:35"/>
beſide the common way and road of reception by the Root, there may be a refection and imbibition from without; for gentle Showrs refreſh Plants, though they enter not their Roots, and the good and bad <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums</hi> of Vegetables promote or debilitate each other. So <hi>Epithymum</hi> and Dodder, rootleſs and out of the ground, maintain themſelves upon Thyme, Savory, and Plants whereon they hang. And Ivy divided from the Root, we have obſerved to live ſome years by the cirrous parts, commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived but as tenacles and hold-faſts unto it. The Stalks of Mint cropt from the Root ſtripped from the Leaves, and ſet in Glaſſes with the Root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end upward, and out of the water, we have obſerved to ſend forth Sprouts and Leaves without the aid of Roots; and <hi>Scordium</hi> to grow in like manner, the Leaves ſet downward in water. To omit ſeverall Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants, which grow on ſingle Roots from ſtones, although in very many there are Side-ſhoots and Fibres beſide the faſtening Root.</p>
               <p>By this open Poſition they were fairly expoſed unto the rays of Moon and Sun, ſo conſiderable in the growth of Vegetables. For though Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars, Willows, and ſeverall Trees, be made to grow about the brinks of <hi>Acheron</hi> and dark habitations of the Dead; though ſome Plants are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to grow in obſcure Wells, wherein alſo old Elme-pumps afford ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times long buſhy Sprouts, not obſervable in any above ground; and large fields of Vegetables are able to maintain their Verdure at the bottome and ſhady part of the Sea: yet the greateſt number are not content without the actual rays of the Sun, but bend, incline, and follow them; as large lifts of Soliſequous and Sun-following Plants. And ſome obſerve the method of its motion in their own growth and converſion, twining towards the Weſt by the South, as Briony, Hops, Woodbine, and ſeverall kindes of Bindeweed; which we ſhall more admire, when any can tell us they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve another Motion and Twiſt by the North at the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> The ſame Plants rooted againſt an erect North-wall full of holes will finde a way through them to look upon the Sun. And in tender Plants, from Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed ſown in the Winter, and in a plot of earth placed inwardly againſt a South-window, the tender Stalks of two Leaves aroſe not erect, but ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towards the Window, nor looking much higher then the Meridian Sun. And if the Pot were turned, they would work themſelves into their former declinations, making their converſion by the Eaſt. That the Leaves of the Olive and ſome other Trees ſolſtitially turn, and preciſely tell us when the Sun is entred <hi>Cancer,</hi> is ſcarce expectable in any Climate; and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> warily obſerves it: Yet ſomewhat thereof is obſervable in our own, in the Leaves of Willows and Sallows, ſome weeks after the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. But the great <hi>Convolvulus</hi> or white-flowered Bindweed obſerves both motions of the Sun; while the Flower twiſts Aequinoctially from the left hand to the right, according to the Daily revolution, the Stalk twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Ecliptically, from the right to the left, according to the Annual converſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:103367:35"/>
Some commend the expoſure of theſe orders unto the Weſtern gales, as the moſt generative and fructifying breath of Heaven. But we applaud the Husbandry of <hi>Solomon,</hi> whereto agreeth the doctrine of <hi>Theophraſtus, Ariſe, O North-winde, and blow thou South, upon my Garden, that the Spices thereof may flow out:</hi> For the North-winde cloſing the Pores and ſhutting up the <hi>Effluviums,</hi> when the South doth after open and relax them, the Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Gums do drop, and ſweet Odours fly actively from them. And if his Garden had the ſame ſituation which Maps and Charts afford it, on the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and having the wall on the Weſt; theſe were the Winds unto which it was well expoſed.</p>
               <p>By this way of Plantation they encreaſed the number of their Trees, which they loſt in <hi>Quaternio's</hi> and Square-orders; which is a commodity inſiſted on by <hi>Varro,</hi> and one great intent of Nature, in this poſition of Flowers and Seeds in the elegant formation of Plants, and the former Rules obſerved in natural and artificial Figurations.</p>
               <p>Whether in this order, and one Tree in ſome meaſure breaking the cold and pinching guſts of Winds from the other, Trees will not better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their inward Circles, and either eſcape or moderate their excentrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may alſo be conſidered. For the Circles in Trees are naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricall, parallel unto the Bark and unto each other, till Froſt and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Winds contract and cloſe them on the weather-ſide, the oppoſite Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle widely enlarging, and at a comely diſtance; which hindereth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the beauty and roundneſs of Trees, and makes the Timber leſs ſerviceable, whiles the aſcending Juyce, not readily paſſing, ſettles in Knots and Inequalities. And therefore it is no new courſe of Agriculture, to obſerve the native poſition of Trees according to North and South in their Tranſplantations.</p>
               <p>The ſame is alſo obſervable under ground in the Circinations and ſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal rounds of Onions, wherein the Circles of the Orbs are ofttimes lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Meridional lines ſtand wider upon one ſide then the other. And where the largeneſs will make up the number of planetical Orbs, that of <hi>Luna</hi> and the lower Planets exceed the dimenſions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and the higher. Whether the like be not verified in the Circles of the large Roots of Briony and Mandrakes, or why in the Knots of Deal or Firre the Circles are often eccentrical, although not in a plane, but vertical and right poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; deſerves a farther enquiry.</p>
               <p>Whether there be not ſome irregularity of Roundneſs in moſt Plants according to their poſition; whether ſome ſmall compreſſion of Pores be not perceptible in parts which ſtand againſt the current of waters, as in Reeds, Bull-ruſhes, and other Vegetables, toward the ſtreaming quarter, may alſo be obſerved; and therefore ſuch as are long and weak are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly contrived into a Roundneſs of Figure, whereby the water preſſeth leſs, and ſlippeth more ſmoothly from them: and even in Flags or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured Leaves, the greater part obvert their ſharper ſides unto the Current in Ditches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:103367:36"/>
But whether Plants which float upon the ſurface of the water be for the moſt part of cooling qualities, thoſe which ſhoot above it of heating vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and why; whether <hi>Sargaſſo</hi> for many miles floating upon the Weſtern Ocean, or Sea-Lettuce and <hi>Phaſganium</hi> at the bottome of our Seas, make good the like qualities; why Fenny waters afford the hotteſt and ſweeteſt Plants, as <hi>Calamus, Cyperus,</hi> and Crowfoot, and Mud caſt out of Ditches moſt naturally produceth Arſe-ſmart; why Plants ſo greedy of Water ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard Oil; why, ſince many Seeds contain much Oil within them, they endure it not well without, either in their growth or production; why, ſince Seeds ſhoot commonly under ground and out of the air, thoſe which are let fall in ſhallow Glaſſes, upon the ſurface of the water, will ſooner ſprout then thoſe at the bottom, and if the water be covered with Oil, thoſe at the bottom will hardly ſprout at all; we have not room to conjecture.</p>
               <p>Whether Ivy would not leſs offend the Trees in this clean Ordination and well-kept paths, might perhaps deſerve the queſtion.

               <p>The like concerning the growth of Miſcletoe, which dependeth not onely of the <hi>Species</hi> or kinde of Tree, but much alſo of the Soil; and therefore is common in ſome places, not readily found in others; frequent in <hi>France,</hi> not ſo common in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſcarce at all in the Territory of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> nor eaſily to be found where it is moſt required upon Oaks, leſs on Trees continually verdant. Although in ſome places the Olive eſcapes it not, requiting its detriment in the delightfull view of its read Berries; as <hi>Cluſius</hi> obſerved in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Bellonius</hi> about <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> But this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitical Plant ſuffers nothing to grow upon it by any way of art, nor could we ever make it grow where Nature had not planted it; as we have in vain attempted by Inoculation and Inſition upon its native or forein Stock: and though there ſeem nothing improbable in the Seed, it hath not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by Sation in any manner of ground; wherein we had no reaſon<note place="margin">Linſchoten.</note> to deſpair, ſince we read of vegetable Horns, and how Rams-horns will root about <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides theſe rural Commodities, it cannot be meanly detectable in the variety of Figures which theſe Orders open and cloſed do make: whileſt every Incloſure makes a <hi>Rhombus,</hi> the Figures obliquely taken a <hi>Rhomboides;</hi> the Intervalls bounded with parallel lines, and each Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection built upon a Square, affording two Triangles or Pyramids vertically conjoyned, which in the ſtrict Quincuncial Order do oppoſitely make acute and blunt Angles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:103367:36"/>
And though therein we meet not with right Angles, yet every <hi>Rhom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> containing four Angles equal unto two right, it virtually contains two right in every one. Nor is this ſtrange unto ſuch as obſerve the natural Lines of Trees, and parts diſpoſed in them. For neither in the Root doth nature affect this Angle, which ſhooting downward for the ſtability of the Plant doth beſt effect the ſame by Figures of Inclination; nor in the Branches and ſtalky Leaves, which grow moſt at acute Angles, as decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from their Head the Root, and diminiſhing their Angles with their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: Verified alſo in leſſer Plants, whereby they better ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and bear not ſo heavily upon the Stalk; ſo that while near the Root they often make an Angle of ſeventy parts, the Sprouts near the top will often come ſhort of thirty. Even in the Nerves and Maſter-veins of the Leaves the acute Angle ruleth; the obtuſe is but ſeldom found, and in the backward part of the Leaf, reflecting and arching about the Stalk. But why ofttimes one ſide of the Leaf is unequal unto the other, as in Hazell and Oaks; why on either ſide the Maſter-vein the leſſer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivative Chanels are not directly oppoſite, nor at equal Angles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively unto the adverſe ſide, but thoſe of one part do often exceed the other, as the Wallnut and many more; deſerves another enquiry.</p>
               <p>Now if for this Order we affect coniferous and tapering Trees, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Cypreſs, which grows in a conical Figure, we have found a Tree not onely of great Ornament, but in its Eſſentials of affinity unto this Order; a ſolid <hi>Rhombus</hi> being made by the converſion of two Aequicru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cones, as <hi>Archimedes</hi> hath defined. And theſe were the common Trees about <hi>Babylon</hi> and the Eaſt, whereof the Ark was made; and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> found no Trees ſo accommodable to build his Navy. And this we rather think to be the Tree mentioned in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> which ſtricter Botanology will hardly allow to be Camphire.</p>
               <p>And if Delight or ornamental view invite a comely Diſpoſure by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Amputations, as is elegantly performed in Haw-thorns, then will they anſwer the Figures made by the converſion of <hi>Rhombus,</hi> which maketh two concentrical Circles; the greater Circumference being made by the leſſer Angles, the leſſer by the greater.</p>
               <p>The Cylindrical Figure of Trees is virtually contained and latent in this Order: a Cylinder, or long Round, being made by the converſion or turning of a Parallelogram, and moſt handſomely by a long Square, which makes an equal, ſtrong and laſting Figure in Trees, agreeable unto the Body and motive parts of Animals, the greateſt number of Plants, and almoſt all Roots, though their Stalks be angular, and of many Corners, which ſeem not to follow the Figure of their Seeds; ſince many angular Seeds ſend forth round Stalks, and ſpherical Seeds ariſe from angular Spindles, and many rather conform unto their Roots, as the round Stalks of bulbous Roots, and in tuberous Roots Stemms of like figure. But why, ſince the largeſt number of Plants maintain a circular Figure, there are ſo few
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103367:37"/>
with teretous or long-round Leaves; why coniferous Trees are tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folious or narrow-leafed; why Plants of few or no Joynts have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round Stalks; why the greateſt number of hollow Stalks are round Stalks; or why in this variety of angular Stalks the quadrangular moſt exceedeth; were too long a ſpeculation. Meanwhile obvious experience may finde, that in Plants of divided Leaves above, Nature often begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth circularly in the two firſt Leaves below; while in the ſingular Plant of Ivy ſhe exerciſeth a contrary Geometry, and beginning with angular Leaves below, rounds them in the upper Branches.</p>
               <p>Nor can the Rows in this Order want delight, as carrying an aſpect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto the <hi>dipteros hypaethra,</hi> or double order of Columns open above; the oppoſite Ranks of Trees ſtanding like Pillars in the <hi>Cavedia</hi> of the Courts of famous Buildings, and <hi>Portico's</hi> of the <hi>Templa ſubdialia</hi> of old; ſomewhat imitating the <hi>Periſtylia</hi> or Cloiſter-buildings, and the <hi>Exedrae</hi> of the Ancients, wherein men diſcourſed, walked and exerciſed. For that they derived the rule of Columns from Trees, eſpecially in their proportional diminutions, is illuſtrated by <hi>Vitruvius</hi> from the Shafts of Firre and Pine. And though the Inter-arboration do imitate the <hi>Araeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtylos,</hi> or thin order, not ſtrictly anſwering the proportion of Intercolum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations; yet in many Trees they will not exceed the intermiſſion of the Columns in the Court of the Tabernacle, which being an hundred cubits long, and made up by twenty Pillars, will afford no leſs then Intervalls of five cubits.</p>
               <p>Beſide, in this kinde of Aſpect the Sight being not diffuſed, but circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed between long Parallels and the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and adumbration from the Branches, it frameth a Penthouſe over the Eye, and maketh a quiet viſion: and therefore in diffuſed and open Aſpects men hollow their Hand above their Eye, and make an artificial Brow, whereby they direct the diſperſed rays of Sight, and by this ſhade preſerve a moderate light in the chamber of the Eye, keeping the <hi>Pupilla</hi> plump and fair, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted or ſhrunk as in light and vagrant viſion.</p>
               <p>And therefore Providence hath arched and paved the great Houſe of the World with Colours of Mediocrity, that is, blew and green, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and below the Sight, moderately terminating the <hi>Acies</hi> of the Eye. For moſt Plants, though green above-ground, maintain their original white below it, according to the candour of their ſeminal Pulp, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimental Leaves do firſt appear in that colour; obſervable in Seeds ſprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in water upon their firſt Foliation. Green ſeeming to be the firſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervenient or above-ground complexion of Vegetables, ſeparable in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon ligature or inhumation, as Succory, Endive, Artichoaks; and which is alſo loſt upon fading in the Autumn.</p>
               <p>And this is alſo agreeable unto Water it ſelf, the alimental Vehicle of Plants, which firſt altereth into this Colour, and containing many vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Seminalities, revealeth their Seeds by Greenneſs; and therefore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103367:37"/>
ſooneſt expected in rain or ſtanding Water, not eaſily found in diſtilled or Water ſtrongly boiled, wherein the Seeds are extinguiſhed by Fire and Decoction, and therefore laſt long and pure without ſuch alteration, affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding neither uliginous Coats, Gnat-worms, <hi>Acari,</hi> Hair-worms, like crude and common water: and therefore that is moſt fit for wholeſome Beverage, and with Malt makes Ale and Beer without boiling. What large Water-drinkers ſome Plants are, the Canary-tree and Birches in ſome Northern Countries, drenching the fields about them, do ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate. How Water it ſelf is able to maintain the growth of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and without extinction of their generative or medicall virtues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the experiment of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Tree, we have found in ſome which have lived ſix years in Glaſſes. The Seeds of Scurvy-graſs growing in Water-pots have been fruitfull in the Land; and <hi>Aſarum</hi> after a year's ſpace, and once caſting its Leaves in water, in the ſecond Leaves hath handſomely performed its vomiting operation.</p>
               <p>Nor are onely dark and green Colours, but Shades and Shadows contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through the great Volume of Nature, and Trees ordained not onely to protect and ſhadow others, but by their Shades and ſhadowing parts to preſerve and cheriſh themſelves; the whole Radiation or Branchings ſhadowing the Stock and the Root, the Leaves, the Branches and Fruit, too much expoſed to the Winds and ſcorching Sun. The calicular Leaves incloſe the tender Flowers, and the Flowers themſelves lie wrapt about the Seeds in their rudiment and firſt formations, which being advanced the Flowers fall away, and are therefore contrived in variety of Figures beſt ſatisfying the intention; handſomely obſervable in hooded and gaping Flowers, and the Butterfly-blooms of leguminous Plants, the lower Leaf cloſely involving the rudimental Cod, and the alary or wingy diviſions em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing or hanging over it.</p>
               <p>But Seeds themſelves do lie in perpetual Shades, either under the Leaf, or ſhut up in Coverings; and ſuch as lie bareſt have their Husks, Skins and Pulps about them, wherein the Neb and generative particle lieth moiſt and ſecured from the injury of Air and Sun.

               <p>Light, that makes things ſeen, makes ſome things inviſible. Were it not for Darkneſs and the Shadow of the Earth, the nobleſt part of the Creation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103367:38"/>
had remained unſeen, and the Stars in Heaven as inviſible as on the fourth day, when they were created above the Horizon with the Sun, or there was not an Eye to behold them. The greateſt Myſtery of Religion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by Adumbration, and in the nobleſt parts of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Types we finde the Cherubims ſhadowing the Mercy-ſeat: Life it ſelf is but the Shadow of Death, and Souls departed but the Shadows of the living: all things fall under this name. The Sun it ſelf is but the dark <hi>Simulachrum,</hi> and Light but the Shadow of God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is no wonder that this Quincunciall Order was firſt and ſtill affected as gratefull unto the Eye; for all things are ſeen Quincuncially: For at the Eye the Pyramidall Rays from the Object receive a Decuſſation, and ſo ſtrike a ſecond Baſe upon the <hi>Retina</hi> or hinder Coat, the proper or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of Viſion, wherein the Pictures from Objects are repreſented, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Paper or Wall in the dark Chamber, after the Decuſſation of the Rays at the hole of the Horny Coat; and their Refraction upon the Cryſtalline Humour anſwering the <hi>Foramen</hi> of the Window, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex or Burning-glaſſes which refract the Rays that enter it. And if anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Anatomy would hold, a like diſpoſure there was of the Optick or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Nerves in the Brain, wherein Antiquity conceived a concurrence by Decuſſation. And this is not onely obſervable in the Laws of direct Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in ſome part alſo verified in the reflected Rays of ſight. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Angle of Incidence equal to that of Reflexion, the Viſual ray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth Quincuncially, and after the form of an V; and the line of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion being continued unto the place of Viſion, there ariſeth a Semi-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſation, which makes the Object ſeen in a perpendicular unto it ſelf, and as far below the reflectent as it is from it above; obſervable in the Sun and Moon beheld in water.</p>
               <p>And this is alſo the Law of Reflexion in moved Bodies and Sounds, which, though not made by Decuſſation, obſerve the rule of equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Incidence and Reflexion, whereby whiſpering places are framed by Ellipticall Arches laid ſide-wiſe; where the voice being delivered at the <hi>Focus</hi> of one extremity, obſerving an equality unto the Angle of Incidence, it will reflect unto the <hi>Focus</hi> of the other end, and ſo eſcape the Ears of the ſtanders in the middle.</p>
               <p>A like rule is obſerved in the Reflexion of the vocal and ſonorous line in Echoes, which cannot therefore be heard in all ſtations: but happening in Woody plantations by Waters, and able to return ſome words, if reach'd by a pleaſant and well-dividing voice, there may be heard the ſofteſt Notes in nature.</p>
               <p>And this is not onely verified in the way of Senſe, but in animal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual receptions; things entring upon the Intellect by a Pyramid from without, and thence into the Memory by another from within, the common Decuſſation being in the Underſtanding, as is delivered by<note n="f" place="margin">Car.

diſpoſed, but magnified, diminiſhed, diſtorted, and ill-placed in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks of ſome Brains, whereby they have irregular apprehenſions of things, perverted Notions, Conceptions, and incurable Hallucinations, were no unpleaſant ſpeculation.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Philoſophy may obtain, the Scale of Influences was thus diſpoſed, and the genial Spirits of both Worlds do trace their way in aſcending and deſcending Pyramids, myſtically apprehended in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter X, and the open Bill and ſtraddling Legs of a Stork, which was imitated by that Character.</p>
               <p>Of this Figure <hi>Plato</hi> made choice to illuſtrate the Motion of the Soul both of the World and Man; while he delivered that God divided the whole Conjunction length-wiſe, according to the Figure of a <hi>Greek</hi> x, and then turning it about reflected it into a Circle: by the Circle imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uniform Motion of the firſt Orb, and by the Right lines, the plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and various Motions within it. And this alſo with application unto the Soul of man, which hath a double aſpect, one right, whereby it behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Body and Objects without; another circular and reciprocal, whereby it beholdeth it ſelf. The Circle declaring the Motion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible Soul, ſimple, according to the divinity of its nature, and returning into it ſelf; the Right lines reſpecting the Motion pertaining unto Senſe and Vegetation; and the central Decuſſation, the wondrous connexion of the ſeverall Faculties conjointly in one Subſtance. And ſo he conjoyned the Unity and Duality of the Soul, and made out the three Subſtances ſo much conſidered by him; that is, the indiviſible or Divine, the diviſible or Corporeal, and that third was the <hi>Syſtaſis</hi> or Harmony of thoſe two in the myſtical Decuſſation.</p>
               <p>And if that were clearly made out which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> took for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this Figure hath had the honour to characterize and notifie our Bleſſed Saviour, as he delivereth in that borrowed expreſſion from <hi>Plato, Decuſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit eum in univerſo:</hi> the hint whereof he would have <hi>Plato</hi> derive from the Figure of the Brazen Serpent, and to have miſtaken the Letter X for T; whereas it is not improbable he learned theſe and other myſtical expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his learned Obſervations of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where he might obviouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Characters, the handed Croſſes, and other Myſteries not throughly underſtood in the ſacred Letter X, which being derivative from the Stork, one of the ten ſacred Animals, might be originally <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian,</hi> and brought into <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Cadmus</hi> of that Country.</p>

If any ſhall look upon this as a ſtable number, and fitly appropriable unto Trees, as Bodies of Reſt and Station, he hath herein a great Foundation in Nature, who, obſerving much variety in Legs and motive Organs of Animals, as two, four, ſix, eight, twelve, fourteen, and more, hath paſſed over five and ten, and aſſigned them unto none, or very few, as the <hi>Phalangium monſtroſum Braſilianum Cluſii, &amp; Jac. de Laet Cur. poſter.

And for the Stability of this Number, he ſhall not want the Sphericity of its nature, which multiplied in it ſelf will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into its own denomination, and bring up the rear of the account. Which is alſo one of the Numbers that makes up the Myſticall Name of God, which conſiſting of Letters denoting all the ſphericall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ten, five, and ſix, emphatically ſets forth the Notion of <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> and that intelligible Sphear which is the Nature of God.</p>
               <p>Many Expreſſions by this Number occurr in holy Scripture, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unjuſtly laden with Myſticall Expoſitions, and little concerning our Order. That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were forbidden to eat the fruit of their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103367:40"/>
new-planted Trees before the fifth year, was very agreeable unto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Rules of Husbandry; Fruits being unwholeſome and laſh before the fourth or fifth year. In the ſecond day, or Feminine part of five, there was added no approbation: For in the third, or Maſculine day, the ſame is twice repeated; and a double Benediction incloſed both Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereof the one in ſome part was but an accompliſhment of the other. That the Treſpaſſer was to pay a fifth part above the head or principal, makes no ſecret in this Number, and implied no more then one part above the principal; which being conſidered in four parts, the additional forfeit muſt bear the name of a fifth. The five golden Mice had plainly their determination from the number of the Princes. That five ſhould put to flight an hundred might have nothing myſtically implied, conſidering a rank of Souldiers could ſcarce conſiſt of a leſſer number. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had rather ſpeak five words in a known then ten thouſand in an unknown tongue; that is, as little as could well be ſpoken; a ſimple Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition conſiſting of three words, and a complexed one not ordinarily ſhort of five.</p>
               <p>More conſiderable things there are in this myſticall account, which we muſt not inſiſt on. And therefore why the radicall Letters in the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch ſhould equal the number of the Souldiery of the Tribes; why our Saviour in the Wilderneſs fed five thouſand perſons with five Barley Loaves, and again, but four thouſand with no leſs then ſeven of Wheat; why <hi>Joſeph</hi> deſigned five changes of Rayment unto <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> took juſt five Pebbles out of the Brook againſt the Pagan Champion;<note place="margin">
