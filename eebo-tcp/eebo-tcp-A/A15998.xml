            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

nations paying Iuda a ſubſidie to returne: and our Lordes mediation from the Goſpell: this being done Daniels matters wilbe all knowen vnto vs. The tongues which he vſeth may ſomewhat trouble vs: why he should write the greater part of his booke
<pb facs="tcp:7125:5"/>
in Chaldie, and the ſame matter againe in Ebrew: and why his Ebrew hath affected peculiaritie of phraſes: yet reaſons ſenſible may ſoone be rendred. The Chaldie tongue was both knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; should ſoone be their vſuall, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had loſt their owne in Babylon. Beſides the North, Eaſt, South Dialectes, Syriaque, Arabique, Aethiopian were neare the Chaldie: ſo that with a little paynes they might learne it. Now it was fit for Dauids throne ruling all the world, to be penned into the largest language of the world, and then most florishing. So he sheweth: that God ſetteth vp kingdomes, and putteth down kingdomes: and how a kingdome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth for euer. This he teacheth in Chaldie: as alſo the ſtate of the world to come: neuer shewed ſo clearely before. He declareth how the faithles ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants perish for euer: and Iuda raigneth by Chriſt: as by him alſo all nations do. VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his viſions name the oppreſſours: and his nation the oppreſſed, then he writeth in Ebrew, and prophetique phraſes knowen onely to his learned brethren. The ſumme of him is this: and his phraſe is thus. I thinke my commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon him ſomewhat profitable to the good of our ſtate.

All muſt graunt that this hath bene long hid. For ſcant any of the world marke our Lords right line, from the text. Yet a few words might open it fully. Onely many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the truth, cauſe griefe, and thereupon ſome more difficulty: otherwiſe all here requiſite might be ſoone knowne. For the matter is the eaſieſt, ſtanding vpon a plaine ſtorie: and the principles are ſo few, that a child might write them. They are often handled, that ſuch as care for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be inſtructed many wayes. The next matter of darkeneſſe ariſeth touching the nations oppreſſors and oppreſſed. The doubt ſprang, for that Daniel in his Chaldy viſions nameth neither. The ſolution is eaſie. In his Ebrew viſions he nameth both the one and the other: and they can containe no other matters then the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Therefore the nations in all are doubtleſſe. And ſeeing Cha. 8. in a viſion vpon Babels fall, <hi>Elam</hi> firſt, next <hi>Iauan</hi> haue all the dealings vnto the ende of wrath: the laſt dealer muſt be <hi>Iauan.</hi> Alſo the afflicted in the laſt dealings are termed <hi>Daniels</hi> people, and the holy people: and they are afflicted for the holy coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Where any may ſee of what times he was to ſpeake. For who knoweth not, that the laſt afflictions that the holy Iewes had, with looſing their lands reuenues, was vnder <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes.</hi> Now the nations being knowne, the places wil be known. And for vndoubted certenty the land <hi>Tzeby</hi> on the holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is named, The ſoyle of the afflicted. The middle ſea and
<pb facs="tcp:7125:6"/>
dead ſea haue it betwixt them: and <hi>Tzeby</hi> is in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hute of Iudaea. And the places of the viſions are the fitteſt for theſe poincts. At <hi>Eular</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi> the plaine ſights were ſhewed. Which ſhould import dealings from Kings of thoſe quarters. All this while nothing bringeth in the Romanes. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to greater harmes. And ſuch as bring them into <hi>Daniel,</hi> where they are not blamed, diſturbe learning as much as they diſturbe the world. But <hi>Daniel</hi> is not to blame. He giueth no cauſe why men ſhould ſo deceiue themſelues. And thus theſe parcels the moſt in difficulty are made eaſie. Another is no leſſe vniuſtly blamed: the time which he hath moſt cleare, &amp; telleth plainly. Yea onely he telleth when the firſt captiuitie began: &amp; how he was of it. The end is moſt famous in him. And the phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for our Lords death time, would make a learned <hi>Varro</hi> ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: The ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty <hi>Hebdomades.</hi> We haue here greater matters the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how he at 84. had written ſeuenty <hi>Habdomades</hi> of books. And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any could be plainer then he in that. If we will not beleeue him, but heathen forged ſtudies, we ſhould try particulars. So true heathen would beare record vnto <hi>Daniel.</hi> Now, heathen 2000. yeares haue filled all Libraries full of lyes: with forged <hi>Olympiades,</hi> forged <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> forged <hi>Atchontes</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Conſuls,</hi> that the vnſtayed and vnlearned now adayes can triumph to ſee, what ſtore of leaſings can be brought againſt <hi>Daniel.</hi> But the ſame wil not ſee, how all the millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Iudah,</hi> &amp; of Chriſtians vpon the other captiuitie writings, checke the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. So againe <hi>Daniel</hi> is cleared. One poinct remaineth, his tongues: where any may ſee, that in the <hi>Chaldy</hi> he ſtudied for plainneſſe: writing in the moſt generall tongue, yet neare Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique, and ſo as moſt generall yet. For his Hebrew, the learned may not complaine: for to them it is eaſie. And all ſhould be ſenſleſſe, if in plaine matters, and matters of daunger, he might not haue leaue to hide his minde from the wicked. Further dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties we haue not in him: after the conſideration of <hi>Dauids</hi> throne and two families, <hi>Salomons</hi> falling, <hi>Nathans</hi> ſtanding for euer: of the nations oppreſſed, long kept cloſe for ſafetie, in his later ſpeeches named for certaintie: of the oppreſſors likewiſe and of their countreys: and laſt of his times and tongues. The difficulties of which being ſoftened, none can tell what to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine hard. And to mollifie the readers labour, I will contriue into matter following, introductions to his whole ſumme and Graces: and ioyne the kings and Pictures for him: pictures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet in another booke: which coming foorth, greater with greater, lendeth <hi>Daniel</hi> the former willingly.

            <p>HEnce, vnto the end of Daniel, the viſions are penned in the language ſpoken onely in Daniels owne nation. Moreouer the ſpeaches be full of artificiall tearmes, knowen onely to the Iewes: and ſome neuer ſpoken afore: yet by their compoſition eaſie. This was needefull to be done. For the Perſians would hate the Iewes, yf the prophecie of their fall by the Greekes, had been publiſhed in the tongue knowen ouer the Eaſt. Alſo, the Greekes would haue raged much more; yf their ſhame had been written in a common language. And none could abide the Iewes to clayme onely to be the nation onely good: or yet to be capable of heauenly matters, to be ſo familiarly tolde, as Daniel had taught them. Therefore he was not to giue ſuch pearles to Hogges: but to write them in the holy tongue: which the Heathen ſtudied not.</p>

So that the confeſſion of Aben Ezra, and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many our learned, that Seleucidae are meant by Gog in Ezekiel, may well be conſidered here, touching the king of the North. And ſpecially Gods goodneſſe: how by the ſtate of the time, all the world might know, when Chriſt was to come into the world: and be acquainted with one tongue wherein the Apoſtles might write.

For all this, Polybius booke 16. is cited of Ioſephus, that the heathen ſtil may be iudges of Daniel. Alſo he recordeth the placing of his daughter Cleopatra to Ptolemy Epiphanes: yeelding vnto him Coele Syria, Samaria, Iudea &amp; Phoenice, in the name of a dowrie.

He would (ſaith Polybius) ſometimes ſteale out of the Court from his ſeruants, into any part of the citie, and be a ſecond or a third in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: often found in golddſmithes ſhops, and a companion with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort, and the baſeſt ſtrangers that came to towne: &amp; when he ſhould perceiue any youths minding a drinking together, he would ſteale vpon them, with his pot and Muſique: that the moſt part would for the ſtrangeneſſe leaue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Alſo oftentimes caſting off his royall robes, he would walke in a gowne in the courtes, crauing an office, and taking one by the hand, embracing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would deſire them to giue him a voyce: ſometimes that he might be Steward of the market: ſometimes Shiriffe: and obtaining his office he would ſit in an iuorie chaire, after the Romanes maner, and heare the market bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains with great ſadneſſe: wherby the better ſort could not tell what to thinke of him: ſome thought him verie ſimple: ſome others ſtarke mad. Likewiſe in his gifts he was no wiſer. He would giue ſome, diſe, ſome, dates, ſome gold: &amp; meeting ſome whom he neuer ſaw afore, he would beſtow vpon them vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped rewards: in ſacrifices and honouring the God, he paſſed all that haue reigned. The Olympeion of Athens, and the huge image at Delos altar ſhew that. He vſed to waſh him in the common bathes, full of the baſeſt ſortes: and had tankards of the deareſt ointments caried in for him. Where when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine man ſayd: Happy are you Kings, which vſe ſuch ſweete ſentes: he ſayd nothing then, but on the morow, as the other was bathing him ſelfe, he came vpon him, and cauſed a verie great pot of the deareſt ointment ſtacte, to be powred on his head, that all ſtanding by tombled in ointment: &amp; ſome falling downe for the ſlipperineſſe cauſed laughter, as did the King him ſelfe. What infinite thouſandes of poundes he beſtowed on a Triumph, hauing heard of Paulus Aemylius the Romane Generall, it would be too long to tell. That fell out when he had ſpoyled Aegypt, in his laſt voyage. And this of Polybius will ſerue, to ſhew his ſpoiling nature here touched. How he came by his kingdom, and was able to ouerflow. Appian aboue ſhewed that, euen by two wealthie kings helpes. His pretence of right was the ſociety made with his brother: who (I thinke) is here named the Prince of the couenant, or agreement. To meane it of Ptolemy Philometor who reigned firſt ſixe yeares after him, it may be thought ſomewhat harder. The ſpoiling and robbing of his owne countrey, may well be vnderſtood to be for Attalus and Eumenes armies that made him king againſt the ſtates will: who denied him the honor of the kingdomes. He began to reigne in. 137 of the Greeks. 1. Mach.

For if Claudius Ptolemie ſay true, that from the firſt of Nabonaſſar 424. Alexander dyed, &amp; the ſeuenth of Philometor is thence 574. The firſt of Philometor being at 142. after Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders death, his ſeuenth ſhould be at Antiochus his firſt, and ſo he could not be ſet vpon by Antiochus. This ſheweth what vncertaintie heathen haue in their ſuppoſed exquiſite particulars. And herein Codoman deſerueth prayſes for amending the common errour from Greekes: as we expounde them.

                     <p>When the Eternall Angell Iehouah, the God of Abraham, Iſaak and Iacob conteineth in deſcribing of him ſelfe the gift of life to thoſe Patriarches, by reaſon that he is the God of the liuing and not of the dead, the doctrine of life Eternall is ſure: but ſo taught that prophane Epicures cannot reach ſo far as to reply once againſt it. Likewiſe where God ſaith Deut. 32. I kill and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the order of the ſpeech conteineth the reſurrection: and the beſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that can be grounded by Religion and proprietie vpon Gods words, that is the right meaning. The Ebrewes vpon Leuiticus 26. render a great reaſon why Moſes neuer nameth life Eternal, nor death Eternal plainly: but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall terme LIFE ſignifieth the one: and ſo by death meaneth the other: and for keeping the law, promiſeth, corne, wine, peace, victories, many children: and conteineth not life eternal but vnder a couering, thus: My tabernacle ſhalbe amongeſt you: and I will be your God: Likewiſe why for breaking the law he propoundeth but outward puniſhments, and with addition: Of his Face being againſt them: weightie matter doe they bring of Moſes counſell. When the law was giuen ſcant any were in the world who beleeued that God was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; made the world, and ruled it. Where if open ſpeeches of Eternal ſtate after this world had bene told: their vnbeliefe therein would haue kept them from all ſearching touching the preſent world his gouernement, and of God his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vnitie. Therefore by open things he prouoketh them vnto the vnuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cloſly. The Prophets did the like, alluring by outward bleſſings vnto the Eternal, and by outward ſorowes, as weeping, gnaſhing of teeth, fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone Topheth and ſuch, betokening Eternall miſerie. But for the time when the holy Iewes were to loſe land and life, then plainly the reſurrection is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, euen here.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the former: And the holy Ghoſt in the Epiſtle to the Ebrewes handleth this place moſt properly, as one ſpoken for the comfort of the Iewes that liued in Antiochus perſecutions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ebrewes. 11.35.

Strabo noteth that the Riuers name is an arrow in the Medes tongue: and ſo it is by Curtius in the Perſian. And both nations ſeeme to haue the ſame language either wholly or neare. The name and fame of the Riuer is ancient. In Adams Paradiſe it was one of the foure: that, with it, as the firſt of Ebrew ſtories began: ſo the laſt in the Ebrew Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes ſhould end. God tendereth in all points mans weakeneſſe: to contriue much into a little roome, to be eaſier learned &amp; remembred. There Babel did ſet vp a Tyrannie, at the towres building: and Nemrod of the yongeſt houſe began rebellious dealings. There Elam ſonne of Sem wanne the ſuperioritie from Senear and Nemrod: thence they and two more come againſt Abraham, and fall. And as Aegypt in Pharaoh after Babel troubled the Church, ſo in theſe dealings they do: that by admonition of place all might be better wayed. Full many be the like reuolutions for places and times in the Ebrew ſtories: which obſeruation will helpe much. The Angels demaund is like Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes of Chriſt, for his Diſciples ſureneſſe, not for his owne doubt. The matter was ſhewed to Daniel Chapter 7.

Moreouer the geſture of ſtanding vpon the waters importeth that of the Pſalme: how as God calmeth the waters, ſo he calmeth the waues of nations. And this viſion anſwereth vnto Iobs ſpeach: that God walketh vpon the high waues of the ſeas. The metaphors and viſions of the Scripture haue a cleare reſemblance of that which is taught for mens affaires. Beſides, the geſture and oth calleth into minde, Deut. 32. a comfort euen for theſe times. I kill and make aliue, I ſtrike and I make whole: and none can take away from my hand. When I lift mine hand vnto heauen, and ſay, as I liue for euer, if I whet the blade of my ſword, and my hand lay hold on iudgement, I will requite vengeance vnto my aduerſaries, &amp; pay my foes. I wil make drunke my arrowes with bloud: and my ſword ſhall eate fleſh: from bloud of ſlaine and captiue: from the head of vengeance vpon the enemy. Reioyce ô heathen with his people.

The wordes of Moſes begin their execution in this place, and hold on vnto the full calling of the heathen. So the geſture of lifting vp the hand and ſwearing calleth all this vnto Daniels minde. The ſumme of the matter here conteineth two things: the rage of Gods enemies, and the puniſhment. The rage is for three yeares and an halfe. So the terme, Time, by ſynecdoche in Dan. 4. as I told was taken: and Greekes commonly at this day: call an yeare a Time, and three yeares three <gap reason="foreign">

The Iewes teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie ſhould be ſtrong againſt them ſelues &amp; good for our ſureneſſe, for fame of matter here told. Thus Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bam writeth in his firſt Tome in Megilah &amp; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucha Perek 3. Tremellius nameth his worke Talmud.

And Iſrael was in great diſtreſſe through them, which oppreſſed greatly, vntill the God of our fathers pitied them, and ſaued them out of the others hand, and deliuered them, and the Chaſhmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naim (The Machabees) the high Prieſts kild them, and ſaued Iſrael from their hand: &amp; ſet vp a king of the Priſts more then 200. yeares afore the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

Thus the goodneſſe of God forced them to keepe a famous memorie of their deliuerance from their perſecution. Vpon which ſtorie, they ſhould looke into the Prophecie: which none can denie to be for a vehement perſecution: and common reaſon would tell them that the firſt which fell out in the vehemency here told, muſt needes be meant by this. The conſideration of this ſtorie with the Prophecie, would haue taught them of the perſon, the teller of the time: the high ſacrificer: who would himſelfe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in like ſort, three yeares &amp; an halfe, all gaine ſaying of ſinners: teaching that which theſe viſions declared.

Moreouer by reaſon that the bruſing of the hand plaguing the holy Ebrewes was here ioyned, and he might well thinke that it ſhould not fall out preſently with the recouerie of the temple, he was to require a further explication. The Lord doth anſwere, and firſt acquainteth him further with the whole matter: ſhewing that as the Angel bad him cloſe vp and ſeale the words, that pearles ſhould not be caſt before hogs, nor holie things before dogges: ſo theſe matters were to be ſpoken in ſuch ſort that vntil the age of their execution, the particulars ſhould not be euident.

And theſe were the points which were fit for to be reuealed in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, the reſtoring of the ſacrifice, &amp; the tyrants death.

            <p>Thus Daniel had a ſufficient Cathechiſme for all the world: bringing the heauens downe vnto the earth, that the earth might be exalted vnto heauen, Daniel would teach heathen to ſeaſon their humane ſtories with diuinitie. Strabo knew that Nebuchadnezar was an Hercules &amp; reached vnto Spaine,

and brought a Colonie vnto Pontus: But Daniel was to tell him who gaue the Lion ſuch wings: Diodorus thought the Chaldea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s great Philoſophers: but Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel telleth what deceiuers they were: &amp; recordeth their own kings cenſure: and how yong Ebrewes were found ten times better then they: how corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; leaſing was their practiſe: how whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king had forgotten his dreame, they promiſe an expoſition, when he forgot it not, but told them, they could ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: how a matter written from heauen on the wall chap. 5. paſſed their skill. Hence Diodorus might haue bene wiſed. Likewiſe Abydenus who recordeth Nauocodroſors trau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, might by Daniel haue ſeene it clearer. And ſo Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus might haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more hearers in Olympia, if to Cyrus ſurpriſing of Babel he could haue ioyned Daniels 5. chap. The ſame text would haue made Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Muſes more Attique, ſhewing how in ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quetting the Chaldea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> king was kild. Athenaeus with his Beroſus and Cteſias for the ſame feaſt might ſee God ſerue with ſauce. So for Cyrus death Herodotus might haue learned the cauſe: with learning Daniels faſting. And the writers of Suſan, the Citie of Darius Hyſtaſpis, made the glory of Perſia, might ſee in Daniels viſions chap. 8. Suſans honours confirme his booke. Aeſchylus &amp; Herodotus might haue penned the one his Tragoedy, the other his ſtory, more plentifully then they did of Gods ſtroke in Xerxes fall, if they had looked into Daniel: much they marked, but might more. Diodorus again with Arrianus, for Alexander might haue ſeene all told in Daniel. And Diodorus might haue marked, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what curſe Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Captaines made ſuch a ſlaughter among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues.

               </gap> made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous the mariage beginning betwixt the two legges. Appian and Iuſtin might haue made, not Polybius &amp; Trogus, but Daniel their author: &amp; Polybius in the pleading for Syria, might haue beheld Iudah caſt as a bone betwixt two dogs. Here Liuy had for him, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it fell out, that Antiochus came into the Weſt with a camp of nations ſcant heard of in Italy, Medes, Caduſians, &amp; ſuch many names ſtrange in Weſt eares: by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antiochus wanted counſell, that he was ſoone brought to loſſe of almoſt all: his death in Strabo &amp; Iuſtin, ſhould haue bin referred to Gods counſell in Daniel, &amp; Iaſon of Syren that noted Church robbing in Seleucus, ſhould haue noted the text in Daniel. And in Antiochus Epiphanes his comming vp into Syria, his 3. voyages into Aegypt: his croſſing of Ebrewes lawes, his death, his vile nature, Polybius, Liuie Athenaeus, Florus, Appian, all might know theſe dealings foretold. Alſo Tully that termed Iudahs Religion a Barbarous ſuperſtition, and the people a nation borne to bondage, might gueſſe by Daniel that the iudge on the fierie throne, the ſtander vp for Daniels people, would haue his tongue pricked for thoſe ſpeeches. And the ſame orator might haue gueſſed by skill in Daniel, why the Romanes feared to

helpe Aegypt the clay legs by their faigned Sybilles, was heard by ſome Iewes counſell, who would tell that when the legges were broken from God, all aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of them ſhould be as reſiſters of God. So Brennus of our nation with his great campe, was plagued as a reſiſter while the legges were iron, and Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus that droue his company out of Aſia, was ſyrnamed Soteria Sauiour. And therein Pauſanias might haue ſeene the counſell of God.

                  </gap>,</hi> he might haue ſeene how God called nations from the riſing of the ſunne vnto the going downe to behold the breaking of Daniels image: &amp; to thinke of a child comming from heauen: as Vergil peruerſly heard. By Daniel, not Venus, Neptune, Minerua nor Actius Apollo ſhould haue bene the giuer of victorie, but the God of heauen. Daniel muſt needes be holden a ſtately authour, that hath all theſe ſo much belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to him, and the goodlieſt part of all Vergils wit, that, in Auguſtus triumph licking the duſt of the toes of Daniels image. Yea &amp; former Romane affaires of Pompey and Iulius Caeſar: the one kild in Aegypt, for helping the king the Piper out of the duſt: the other for Cleopatra: thoſe duly looked vnto, would iuſtifie the firie throne of Daniel. Yea all the ſtories of the Romanes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp, being here yet, not as enemies to Gods holy couenant, but men rewarded for plaguing the legges, all commenteth vpon Daniel. Beſides Auguſtus ieſt in Macrobius, how it was better to be Herodes hog then his ſonne: that iuſtifieth the ſtorie of perſecution at our Lordes comming from the cloudes to make a tabernacle among vs. Ouer and beſides all this, the ſpeech of wicked Tacitus againſt Chriſt crucified vnder Pontius Pilate, and of Chriſtian Religion, theſe haue a good vſe for Daniel, and all the declaration of the Iewes calamities in the laſt deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ieruſalem, or euer ſince: writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by prophane heathen, all ſerue Daniel alike. And the matters are ſo plaine that if men would but grope, they might haue found Chriſt in Daniel: where the pompous of this world be fanned as chaf: the wicked, as beaſtes burne in fire vnquenched, and the humble may finde iuſtice Eternal, to ſhine like the ſunne in the kingdome of the Father.</p>
