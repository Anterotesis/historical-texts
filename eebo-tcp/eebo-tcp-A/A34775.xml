         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>III: The Reciprocal <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> with Infallable means to Preſerve Peace in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by avoiding Diſſentions that may ariſe from Jealouſie, or any other Cauſe whatever.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>OF all the Diſeaſes of the Mind, Jealouſie is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, the moſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and of moſt Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Cure; for thoſe that are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented therewith, are not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to confeſs it, but even their moſt familiar Friends, from whom, if any, by their Advice they may expect Relief, are aſham'd to be partakers with them in ſuch Converſation.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, there are Perſons too too obvious to be found, that though they have lived in a Conjugal Eſtate perhaps Forty Years, yet are not verſed in the Obligations of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, but live in a continual
<pb facs="tcp:109007:3"/>
warfare without ever penetrating the Cauſe of their Evil, or being able to perceive the Means to Eſtabliſh Peace between them.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration whereof has Created a Beleif, that this Treatiſe, wherein ſuch Perſons may learn the Duties of Matrimony, ſince they may thereby perceive the Venome of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, the ſad effect which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, and withall, the undoubted Remedy thereof, may be of ſingular <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe in the World. And the rather, that containing throughout, nothing but Maxims Authorized with all that is moſt Sacred in the Laws both of Nature and Religion, it is no other, as you may hereafter ſee, than a pure and ſimple Inſtrument of Truth.</p>
            <p>So that no great Queſtion is to be made of its acceptance in the World, conſidering that there are very few who will not be glad to have eaſie Rules Preſcribed for the performance duly of the moſt important of their Obligations, and on which in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:109007:3"/>
manner all other depend. For as Marriage is the Foundation of all Civil Policy, it is very apparant that he cannot be a good Citizen, who is an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>uworthy Husband; nor can he be expected to live competently in a Political Society, that is not capable of Domeſtick Converſe, which is the Principle and Abridgment of it.</p>
            <p>This is therefore the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Duty of Perſons in this World, and at the ſame time, the accompliſhment of the deſign the Author has herein propoſed to himſelf. For conſidering that all the Actions of Perſons whatſoever, as Secular, may be reduced to Three Eſtates; the Firſt, when a Man enters into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the World, the Second, when he enters upon any Profeſſion; and the Third, when he enters into Marriage; he has endeavoured to ſhew the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Duties of theſe Three Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Conditions in Three Diſtinct Tracts.</p>

            <p>The firſt is that of the <hi>Rules of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,</hi> which he has divided into two Parts, of which the firſt gives the Maxims of Converſe with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Civil deportment, the ſecond Treats of <hi>the Points of Honour,</hi> or the Method of Demeaning ones ſelf with uncivil Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> how far a Man muſt ſupport Injuries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Derogating from his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and in the mean time give no Offence himſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is that which Treats of <hi>Idleneſs, or the Art of Employing the time well, every one according to his Vocation in this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Third is this <hi>Treatiſe of Jealouſie, or the means to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Peace in the State of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;</hi> all three very ſuccinctly direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in what Obligation or Duty ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may attend a Secular Life, and which, by conſequence, have ſuch a mutual Relation amongſt themſelves, that one cannot well be without the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109007:5"/>To return to that of Jealouſie, we thought good to give this Proemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that it being a Paſſion, we were Obliged in this Treatiſe, as it is in the ſecond Chapter, to give ſome Notions of the Paſſions of the Mind in general, but breifly, and in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement, not only becauſe the handling this Subject, will procure a Curious and Diſtinct <hi>Idaea</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Parts of Man; but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is an indiſpenſable neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Eſtabliſhing ſuch Principles as may ſerve for Proofs to the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deduced in the Proſecution.</p>
            <p>But ſince it is not always Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to performe ſimply that which is a Mans Task, without having a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per added reſpect to the Humour of thoſe for whom his work is intended, we have taken care to diſpoſe the work ſo, that thoſe that have already gain'd a Sufficient knowledg of, or thoſe that are not Curious, or care not for the Study of the Paſſions, may Omit the ſecond Chapter, in which it is almoſt
<pb facs="tcp:109007:6"/>
only Treated of them, and paſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from the firſt to the third, without breaking the Series of the Diſcourſe, this being only a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulum, or a neceſſary Adjunct.</p>

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:109007:25"/>
It is alſo from this ſtrait Conjunction that, as we ſee, if we have once Joyn'd any Corporal Action with any diſtinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> Inclinations of the Spirits, or other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Organs, than the Will we have to give them this Motion; as it falls out, for Example, When a Man would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Eyes to View an Object at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for then the Pupil of the Eye enlarges it ſelf, rather becauſe of this Action, to which the Eyes are Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by this Organ, then for that we would that it ſhould be enlarged.</p>
               <p>It is this Repugnance in Nature, that<note place="margin">The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spirit and Fleſh.</note> has given place to believe, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour part of the Soul ſhould War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Superiour; when as this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance ariſeth only from hence, That the Body on one ſide, by means of the Spirits, and the Soul on the other, by its Will, endeavour at the ſame time to excite different Motions in this Organ And indeed, all that contradicts Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comes from the Body, and not at all

from the Soul. It is then theſe Two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Impulſes, that are made together on this Organ, that cauſes this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: For Example, The Spirits ſtrive to puſh this Organ we ſpeak of, ſo as to excite the Deſire of any thing in the Soul; and the Soul ſtrives again to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that Motion, by the Will it has to avoid the ſame thing: If it gets the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand, it remains Victorious; if not, the Spirits preſently reſume their firſt courſe, becauſe of the diſpoſition that has proceeded in the Nerves, in the Heart, and in the Blood, and then the Soul ceaſing its Endeavours, finds it ſelf preſt to Deſire, and not to Deſire, one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Lo here the Warfare between the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Fleſh, which is ſo Violent, that no Humane Prudence is capable to reſiſt it. It is therefore certain, that the Soul cannot in an inſtant overcome the Paſſions: For they are accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch Commotions, excited in the Heart, and by conſequence, in the whole Maſs of Blood and Spirits, that the Paſſion remains always preſent with our Thoughts, till this Commotion have ceaſed; in the ſame manner, as Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects are always preſent, during
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109007:26"/>
the time they Act on the Organs of Senſe. But I mean here, the ſtronger Paſſions, which do indeed conſtrain us to confeſs, That we are not at all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of our primary Motions.</p>
               <p>The Soul has then a neceſſity of<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Soul over the Body.</note> Powerful Helps, for the obtaining the Victory; which is no other than Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that Seconds it in this Combat: For this Prudence is no more than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelf, illuminated with the Lights of Morality and Experience, whoſe principal uſe is to preſcribe Rules for the Regulating of Paſſions, making known to the Soul the quality and real uſage of them; She undeceives it in the Errours of Senſe and Imagination; She gives it to know what is really Good, or really Evil; in one word, She teacheth the Soul to put a right eſteem upon things, and what is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, or inconvenient to Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And indeed, the greateſt Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of Paſſions cannot avail againſt us, without the Inward Commotions of the Soul. It is upon this, that our Good or our Evil depend: For the Commotions of the Soul have much more Power over us, than the Paſſions themſelves, From whence it is, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109007:26"/>
ſeeing the Soul may have always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whereon to relie and ſatisfie it ſelf, all the Troubles that can acrew thereto, from any other thing, have no power to hurt it; which does evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate its Perfection.

But in the laſt place, If the Paſſion, agitating the Soul, do make ſo violent an Aſſault upon it, that it gives no time to deliberate; the Soul then makes a Couter Aſſault upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſtays, at leaſt, the greateſt part of the Motions, to which that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or the Organ, diſpoſed the Body, as, for Example, That of the Hand, which Anger had cauſed to be lifted up to ſtrike withal.</p>

Indeed, look by how much a particular Family preceeds a Civil Society, and is more neceſſary than it, becauſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular families compoſe it; ſo much is the Society of Marriage, in Law of Nature, to be preferred before all other Societies, ſince it ſerves to continue the Species, to which all Animals have a greater proclivity, then to any other thing, and which is the ultimate end of of all Societies whatever <note n="a" place="margin">

Submiſſion and a compliance full of Love, and with all true Love, has neither will nor deſire, but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Perſon loved; and ſince on the other hand Jealouſie, is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Anguiſh which is nouriſhed with Suſpitions, Diſtruſt, Rage, and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and which declares it ſelf in heats of Paſſion, Obſtinacy, Controlings, and capricious Humours, as it ſpeaks for it ſelf, where then I pray ſhall we place it?

but Vertue and things that excel in real Beauty, and have therein a reſemblance of things Coeleſtial: Or to expreſs it in<note place="margin">Des cart. tr. de paſſ.</note> the words of the Philoſopher of this Age; true or reaſonable Love is like that of a Father towards his Children, who deſires to receive nothing from them, or to poſſeſs them otherwiſe than he does, or to be more nearly conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them than he is; but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as his other ſelves, he ſeeks after their good as his own, or rather with greater care, becauſe repreſenting to himſelf that he and they together make up but one entire, and of which he cannot be the better Part, he prefers their Intereſt to his own, and fears not to caſt himſelf away to ſave them, on the contrary, Brutal Love, regards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the poſſeſſion of the Object of this Paſſion, and not the Object it ſelf, that is, a Man loves the thing for his own Intereſt, and not for the ſake of the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>From this Love, Earthy and Carnal, it is that Jealouſie proceeds; by this Love it is we pretend to Love others, when indeed we Love only our ſelves; by this we have a falſe Joy for the good of our Friends, and a falſe Sorrow for their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109007:36"/>
Evils, for they proceed only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the peculiar Intereſt we have in the one, or in the other: by this we have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, and yeild obedience to their Wills indeed, but they are only feign'd and diſſembled, to the end we may draw them to ours: by this Love we fear the loſs of the thing loved, but it is becauſe of the good we hope for from it. <note n="a" place="margin">Sunt qui utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micitiis ſpectant, ut epicurei, deſpicabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les &amp; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digni ut qui ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, ſed ſeipſos. <hi>Viv. de off. mat.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reckon it not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to be Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note>

               <p>The thing being ſo then, it muſt be certainly true, that if a Man Love not his Wife, or is not Jealous of her upon any other grounds then this of ſelf Love, as he cannot be Jealous of her on any other, his Jealouſie does only ſignalize his Brutality inſtead of demonſtrating his Love; It muſt be true that if a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in like manner, Love not her Husband, or is not Jealous of him but by this Principle of Love of her ſelf; if ſhe Love him for no other end than to ſatisfie her Paſſion, ſhe does thereby on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly render her Senſuality publick and manifeſt; ſo far is this Jealouſie from gaining Eſteem, as ſome pretend. So that to ſpeak after the faſhion of the World, we grant that Jealouſie is a mark of extraordinary Love, yet it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Love of ones ſelf, that it is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109007:37"/>
an exceſs of Love, yet it is an exceſs of Concupiſcence: That it is the ſupream Degree of Senſuality, and therefore there can be nothing that diſhonours a Man more than Jealouſie, that would have himſelf believed to be guided by the uſe of right Reaſon; nor can a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that would be accounted Modeſt or Prudent, render her ſelf more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or procure a greater contempt of her ſelf by any thing than by being Jealous.</p>

               <p>In ſhort, could the Love, which<note place="margin">Of the force of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>inion of Marriage.</note> ought to be the Band of Marriage, be better expreſſed, or more efficaciouſly enjoyn'd, than when God ſays, the Man ſhall leave his Father and Mother to cleave to his Wife, and to be one Fleſh with her, and that this is a Conjunction made by the hand of God, which no Man ought to break; <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 19. 4.</note> Likewiſe a famous Divine explaining this Paſſage, <note n="b" place="margin">Jauſen. in concord.

This is indeed the Natural conſequence of theſe Words, <hi>he ſhall eleave to his Wife, and they two ſhall be one Fleſh:</hi> The Man ſhall cleave (ſaith God) that is, by Love, in loving her as his own proper Body, and by the Nuptial Bed, whoſe Bands are not to be unlooſed. What is it, in effect, to quit ones Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cleave to his Wife, but to Love her with that affection that ſurpaſſes all other? Even that, that Naturally Unites the Hearts of Children to their Parents, which is the ſtrongeſt and tendereſt of all other affections beſides.</p>

Who can be able to give a right Idea, in Words, of the Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Marriage, when, for Example, the Power of a Husband falls into the Hands of a Man Diſtracted with this Brutal Jealouſie, with that Jealouſie ſo Blind and Enraged, that even the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it ſelf, of the Perſon Beloved, Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and Excites it?

But what is yet more deplorable in theſe Perſons then in the very Beaſts; theſe that are moſt in lightned with Natural underſtanding do ſuffer themſelves to be tranſported with this Paſſion more than any other if they be ſenſual; For as their Wit is quick and piercing, ſo it is Suſpitious their Diſtruſt ariſing from that very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their Apprehenſion, whereby they underſtand, or at leaſt believe they underſtand the moſt abſtruce and hidden things.

               <p>The Body of the Woman is ſubject to ſundry Infirmities, from which the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Man is Exempt.

Now theſe Infirmities in Nature, cauſing by neceſſary Conſequence, a Debility or Weakneſs in Women, it follows, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109007:60"/>
Men, as well as the Males of moſt part of Animals, as we ſaid in another place, have more Strength and Vigor, than Women, or other Females. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews it plainly enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any neceſſity of words to prove it: And Reaſon it ſelf lets us ſee, that it can not be otherwiſe, ſince there is Reaſon to expect more Vigor, more force, and more Performance, in any thing, from a Body that is Sound, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>It being ſo, as without doubt it muſt be, ſince the very finger of Nature ſhews it, it is Obvious, to conclude, that the Two Sexes are not Equal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves.

               <p>There is therefore a Manifeſt and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inequality between the Sexes: and which is indeed with reaſon, ſince<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> the Author of Nature himſelf, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely Ordain'd it in the Creation of Man and Woman.

Moreover, that which is meet, agreeing, or convenient to any

thing, is not equal to it, according to the Rules of Geometry, as we ſhall preſently ſhew. And for as much, as by Nature and by the words of God himſelf, Man and Woman are not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, between themſelves; it follows, that Man has a Natural Prerogative o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Woman. So that, ſince Nature will have the leſs, to give place to the greater, and that which is more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to that which is more perfect, it is an undeniable Truth, that the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity belongs to the Man, by Natural Right. This concluſion holds, without any difficulty, in the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and uncorrupted Nature; and as for the State of Sin, after the Fall of Man, the Authority of the Man is not only Authentickly confirm'd, but the Submiſſion of the Woman is enjoin'd by Command; <hi>Thou ſhalt be Subject to thy</hi>

               <p>Now, in like manner, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Maxims, which are univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received amongſt Men, deduce their Original with Nature it ſelf, we ſee that the Prerogative of the Man over the Woman has been always, in all places, generally Eſtabliſh'd, ſince the Creation
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109007:62"/>
of the World. In ſuch ſort, that it is ſo far from being true, to ſay, that Men do herein Uſurp a Power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the Prejudice of the Woman; that, on the contrary, they only main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Right, of which they have had the Poſſeſſion, ſince the beginning of Time.</p>
               <p>To ſay then that Men and Women, ſo compared together by their Sexes, are Equal, were to offend Nature, to run Counter from Truth, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World with a Sophiſm. For there is great difference between ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (ſpeaking in the general) that Men and Women are Equal, in an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and true Equality, and to ſay, they are ſo, in proportional Equality, or, if you will, in an Equality of Requiſites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Firſt, which Excludes all Authority, or Superiority, is not at all true, for the Reaſons alledged; the Second is true.</p>
               <p>A Child, for Example, is like to a Man, becauſe he is of the ſame Nature with him, and of the ſame Form that he is of, and ſpeaks as he does. He is even equal with him too, in this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Equality; for he has as many Parts, and as many Members, as a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109007:63"/>
Man has, in the ſame manner, as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Circle has as many degrees as the largeſt: But it is a Sophiſm, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence, that an Infant and a Man are Equal; for they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unequal in an abſolute Equality, whether you reſpect the Body, or the Mind. The thing declares it ſelf ſo; for the Weakneſs of the Body, and alſo of the Mind, becauſe of the Infirmity of the Body, renders the Child inferiour to a Man, and uncapable of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of a Man, in reſpect either of the Body, or of the Soul.</p>
               <p>As therefore it would be Abſur'd to ſay, without any reſtriction, that a Child and a Man are Equal, becauſe they are ſo in this proportional and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Inequality; ſo it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to pretend, becauſe of this imperfect Equality, a Man has, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of Nature, no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative or Superiority over a Child, for this Superiority is very viſible and plain.</p>
               <p>Now as this Preheminence or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of a Man over a Child, comes, becauſe of the Feebleneſs of the Child, it follows from hence, this Feebleneſs or Infirmity, is the Poſitive or Phyſical

Principle of the Inequality of differing Species.

and by conſequence, the Subjects are as neceſſary as the King himſelf, to the forming of an Eſtate, or Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, therefore the Subjects muſt not be Subordinate to their King: So it would be as great an Abſurdity, to conclude, that the Woman is Equal, and ought not to give Submiſſion to her Husband, becauſe ſhe is of Equal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity with him, for the producing and continuing the Species.</p>
               <p>Now after this manner, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to be made between the Sexes, and from ſuch compariſons are our concluſions to be drawn; and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for indubitable Maxims, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences drawn from particular Actions; ſince it is a very uncertain and falſe way of reaſoning, to draw general concluſions from particular propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now, admitting the Example of the <hi>Amazons</hi> to be true, yet this only lets us ſee how much their Enterpriſes were repugnant to Nature, and the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Sex; for it behoved them in their Infancy to Burn off one of their Breaſts, to make them capable of the Exerciſes they were to perform; and were likewiſe forced to leave their Warlike Exerciſes, from time to time, to join
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109007:64"/>
themſelves with the Men of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, that thereby they might be recruited. So that this may be properly look'd upon as no more than a Tragy-Comedy, the Sex would for once Gratifie the World withal. And although they have ſometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Men, nevertheleſs, the Victory that the Men obtain'd at laſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, ſo far, as to leave only a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>light and confuſed Remembrance of them, has decided the Preheminency of the Sex.</p>
               <p>The reſt of their Inſtances are much of the ſame force. And though they may produce Examples of Women that have excelled in the Sublimeſt Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, yet that Eſtabliſhes nothing in ſavour of the Female Sex, and leſs yet, as we have already ſhewed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Maſculine Sex.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe their Inſtances of thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men that have been rendered Famous, by their Prudent Governing their States, are of no greater Efficacy: For if we compare theſe with others, that have but badly Acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Provinces, by following the Natural Tendency of their Sex, I know not which Ballance would be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109007:65"/>
found lighteſt; and as to that of the Deſcent of Crowns on Females, it is grounded on Policy, and takes only place where Males are deſtitute. For Policy and Experience do Teach the World, that nothing can be more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to a Monarchical State, than Election, and by conſequence, that, it is better to give way to the Succeſſion of this Sex, than to hazard an entire Ruin, for by this means, they avoid all the Evil conſequences of Contentious Elections; eſpecially, if this ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commandreſs be Married, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoon after.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, it may be, that ſome People that have highly eſteemed Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and affected them for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; but it is as likely; that the Emulation and Ambition of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees amongſt themſelves, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, has put them upon this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, rather than any other Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and being withal, Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Barbarous People <note n="a" place="margin">Pieraſ<expan>

And it will be ſufficient to ſhew us once for all, the Preheminency he has given to Man, in that he was made Man, and not a Woman. Now, ſince he Died for both Sexes, and has Enrich'd them both, without diſtinction, with his Grace; we muſt conclude from hence, that, as Grace ſeparates its ſelf from the Dictates of Nature, ſo likewiſe the Life of Grace which we lead in this World, is the beginning of the Life of Glory, in which Men and Women ſhall both Rejoyce in Heaven; but as our Saviour ſaid, <hi>They neither Marry, nor are given in Marriage: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they Die any more: For they are equal unto the Angels, and are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, being the Children of the Reſurrection</hi>

               <p>Now, though it may be ſaid, that Chriſt has Raiſed ſome Women to the Honour of Martyrs; yet it cannot be ſaid, that they have been admitted into the Apoſtleſhip, which is a degree far more Excellent; no nor to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Church; inſomuch, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids them to ſpeak in the Aſſembly of the Faithful. <hi>Let your Women keep ſilence in the Churches:</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,) <hi>for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak; but they are Commanded to be under Obedience, as alſo ſaith the Law</hi>

whatſoever advantage of Endowment a Wife may have above her Husband, that ſhe obtains thereby this Prerogative we ſpeak of.

               <p>The ſame things may be ſaid to the Objection ſtarted, from the Bands that tie the Man and Woman in Marriage. It would be but a bad Inference to ſay, that becauſe the Husband and Wife are under an equal Obligation, as to what

She Deplores her Unhappineſs to one of her Familiar Friends, but which was a Woman of Underſtanding, ſhe gives an Account to her of the ill-conduct, between her and her Husband, and their continual Warfare, ſaying withal, as moſt do to Excuſe, as they think, their Actings herein; <hi>Since he takes no Care of me, I ſhall take no Care of him neither.</hi> The Honeſt Wife endeavours to raiſe better Thoughts in her; ſhe Repreſents to her, that in all Conteſtations, one of the Two muſt of neceſſity yeild, and good Order will have it to be the Wife in Marriage: That a Husband, let him be never ſo Bad, yet he remains ſtill the Husband, and can not be caſt off, but by Death: That there is no Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band at all but has his Faults; and though we muſt diſapprove theſe Vices,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109007:80"/>
yet we muſt uot hate the Perſon in any kind of Friendſhip, much leſs in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: That it is better to ſuffer her Husband, ſeeing the Meekneſs of the Wife may render him more conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but her Reproofs will certainly make him worſe: That Amity in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is Nouriſhed by the Repute of the Wife join'd with her Meekneſs, that which is ſetled on Beauty, being only a Paſſenger: This Meekneſs is chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, in having an extream care to pleaſe the Husband in every thing, and to diſpleaſe him in nothing; in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Bent and Inclinations, that ſhe may Love the Perſon that he Loves, and Obſerve the Times and Things that are moſt agreeable to him.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, ſays ſhe, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her ſelf for Example,) I forget nothing that appertains to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aright the Houſe within Doors, which is the Duty, under her Husband, of a Married Wife: I take the greateſt Care imaginable, that all things, though of the leaſt moment, may be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Husbands Humour, and I conform my ſelf entirely to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; if I ſee him Sad, I ſpeak not to him at all, and put on a Sad Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109007:80"/>
my ſelf: If I ſee him Angry, I endeavour to Pacifie him by ſweet Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: If I ſee him tranſported with Anger, I hold my peace: If he have Drunk too much, I ſay nothing to him but pleaſant Diſcourſes to perſwade him to Bed: If he have done any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But, continues this Divine Wife, if the thing in Queſtion be of very great concern, I have heard ſay, that the Wife ought rather to Employ another to ſpeak to her Husband, then to ſpeak to him thereof her ſelf, and that rather to Employ the Relations of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, than her own. I know, adds ſhe, a Gentlewoman, that coming to know of an Engagement that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had made with the Daughter of a Poor Woman, did her ſelf, but under a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:109007:81"/>

               <p>Another in like manner, a little grown in Years, Obſerving that a Young Woman drew her Husband eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day to her Lodgings, provided a Lodging for her in her own Houſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining her with the greateſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comneſs imaginable, to the end ſhe might keep her Husband at home; and if at any time he might Sup abroad with this Young Woman, ſhe would be ſure to ſend them her beſt Meſs, and wiſh them to make Merry: which Submiſſion at laſt, had the ſame Effect on this Husband, that we related of the other.</p>

               <p>And by this Vertue, attended with Meekneſs and Condeſcention, the Wife ſhall aſſuredly Reduce and Reform an Enormous Husband, either ſooner or later. I mean, if it be not a Feigned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And indeed it is moſt certainly true,<note place="margin">The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain effects of theſe Counſels.</note> that a Woman beſet with Jealouſie, yet practiſing Vertue, and keeping her Paſſion in Subjection to Reaſon, and to the Precepts which Nature, Juſtice, and God himſelf have Preſcribed to her, by injoyning her, as we have ſaid,

It is this that gives a Woman the height of Renown in the World (<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 11. 16.</note>). And it is by this that ſhe truly Merits the qualification of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Wife. And laſtly, it is in this moſt humble and moſt prudent manner on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a Woman muſt be Jealous to gain Reputation, and not in following the Dictates of corrupted Nature, as too-too many People of the World do.</p>

We have (I ſuppoſe) ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhown, that theſe Diſtruſts, theſe ſecret Contrivances, theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, and theſe Heats of Paſſion which Jealouſie ſuggeſt, are ſo far from being capable to prevent or cure the Evil that's fear'd, that on the contrary they only ſtir it up, and bring a ſcandal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it over and above.</p>

And, in ſhort, it only ſerves to Diſgrace themſelves, by diſcovering thoſe Sordid Paſſions that Agitate their Souls. For, as every one Contemns a Man, (ſaith our <note n="b" place="margin">Des Cart.

And indeed, it is an evident Teſtimony, that he does not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109007:83"/>
Love his Wife as he ought to do, and that he has an ill opinion, either of her, or of himſelf. For if he had a real Love for her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would have no Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Diſtruſt her. But it is not her directly that he Loves, it is only the Poſſeſſion of her; and he fears the leſs thereof, becauſe, either he knows himſelf to be unworthy of it, or that ſhe is Unfaithful.</p>
               <p>To all this we may add, That Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie<note place="margin">Jealouſie is Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> is a means, by ſo much the leſs capable to produce the effect deſired, in that it is a Contagious Evil, which Communicates it ſelf, and Infects with the ſame Diſtemper the other Party, which before was altogether free from it; ſo that thereby, inſtead of One, there are Two, found Diſeaſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſome ſmall hopes of Peace, which was before, there ariſes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, and irreconcileable, Warfare, the mildeſt Remedy whereof muſt be a Separation.</p>
