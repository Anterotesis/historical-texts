            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Theſe are the entrances of Hell into thy ſoul, upon the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings of God and ſpirituall conſolations; without which the ſoul languiſheth, as the body fainteth upon a decay of the animall, or vitall ſpirits: this muſt thou look for after the continuance in any known, and preſumptuous ſin, but if thou find it not, thy condition is dangerous, for the obduration, or hardening of the heart is the threſhold of Hell: look quickly then and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly into thy ſoul; labour to get a ſight of thy ſins in

the Book of Conſcience, whiles they may be blotted out; pray earneſtly to God for a true ſenſe of them, (for prayer is the Key of Heaven;) conſider often of Death, Judgement, Heaven, and Hell; think how odious the ſin of ingratitude is between man and man, and that unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Blood of Chriſt is the higheſt of that kinde: think of the ſhortneſs of mans life, and the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to be done in that little life: that thy ſhort life is poſting to an end; O the folly, and madneſs of ſin! it is a continuall acting againſt reaſon, a treaſuring up of wrath with the God of all power, a providing for the ſociety of Devils, and damned ſouls, who will be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Maker, and one another to all eternity; 'tis that which only is diſhonourable to man, a diſturbance to Commonwealths; it is the ſatisfaction of Devils (if they could have any,) the trouble of Angels, and bleſſed ſouls, nay the grieving of the holy Ghoſt, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall murthering of the Son of God. I have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in this ſhort Diſcourſe, but the Glory of God, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſouls, and the diſcharging of my own Conſcience, by teſtifying to as many as I can, the deteſtation of my former life, that ſo the ill conſequences of my example may be in ſome meaſure repaired by this publication of my ſelf: and therefore wiſh to that end that all may ſee this, that ſaw my debauchery: and I beſeech God to give me boldneſs in the confeſſion of my faults, and to make me only ſhamefull of recommitting them. Above all things I adviſe men to beware of immoderate drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which duls the underſtanding, and makes the ſoul impatient of contemplation: it diſpoſeth vehemently to the pleaſures of ſenſe, and to a gigling impertinent mirth; it precipitateth to the acts of uncleanneſs, and exciteth all the Paſſions, expoſing men to many and daily ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards

both of ſoul, and body, and rendring them unfit for any employment either in Eccleſiaſticall, or Civill affairs. And ſince it is ſo, that ſome mens bodies by their temperament do require ſtrong drinks more than others, it is not a totall abſtinence but a moderate uſe of it which is expected: for which end I think it a very good rule by which to ſet ſome obſervable bounds to drinking; that men would drink ſo far as to cheriſh the ſtomack, but not to the leaſt elevation of the brain; and the ſtomack is ſatisfied with a ſmall quantity, unleſs a man lye under the cheat of a habit: but when the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the wine, or any ſtrong liquor, begin to mount up to the brain, from whence the ſoul doth principally, and moſt immediately act; the contemplative power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be diſquieted, and unfixt, and the ſoul now to fluctuating, as it were, and wavering in her motion, (her beſt, and ſteady operations being hindred) pleaſes her ſelf with being converſant about outward things, and triviall objects, and lyes more expoſ'd to the danger of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent temptations: this which I ſpeak of is but the firſt change of the brain, when it is altered from its uſuall tone and compoſure; and although a man may drink to this pitch, and yet carry civility about him, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable correſpondence with men, becauſe his tongue doth not falter, neither is his underſtanding ſo obſcu'rd, as to fail, at leaſt in matters of common converſe; yet this perſon who hath done nothing unacceptable to the world, hath ſo chang'd the Scene within himſelf, that he is now more at the command of his ſenſuall appetite, than before, and his noble faculties begin to lean towards the world, and ſtagger in the ſight of God, though his legs ſtand firm before the eyes of them that ſee him: I appeal to the conſciences of any ſuch plauſible drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

whether they do not find themſelves more cold in acts of devotion, more fond of outward pleaſures, more affected with the thoughts of temporall honours, and the favour of great men, more than the love of Jeſus. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contemplation of eternity and the eſtate of their ſouls in reference to that being, doth ſo well reliſh with them at that time? If they did ſo, why do they not wave a Stage-play, and go to publick prayers, which are at that time? Why, inſtead of going to a wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Gaming-houſe, do they not ſtudy the game of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that they may beat that experienc'd Gameſter the Devil, and win their ſouls, which lye continually at ſtake, and are in eminent danger of being loſt? What a ſad thing is it that ſo noble a creature as man, ſhould reſt in, and be contented with trifles, for whom are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd the glories of eternity, if here he will take upon him the eaſie yoke, and light burden of Chriſt? Now although many men that drink not, may, and do often theſe things, and far worſe; yet drink betrays them more eaſily to vanities, and idle paſtimes: therefore be carefull to avoid this degree of drinking, and thou wilt then be ſecure from the ſcandalous ſin of viſible drunkenneſs, which is the beaſtly conſummation of the former: I do not ſpeak this to perſwade men from ſociety, and chearfulneſs; as if Religion, and mirth were things inconſiſtent; ſince I know that true mirth is found no where elſe: but we do for the moſt part miſtake mirth the moſt of any thing: account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it conſiſts in laughter only; whereas properly a man may be moſt truly merry when he laugheth leaſt: for none laugh more than Ideots, and men of weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſenſualiſts; while men advanc'd in knowledge, and quieted in mind, by ſerious and due reflections on themſelves, do it but ſeldome: but none will deny but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39058:4"/>
the latter ſort, have the greater cauſe for mirth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt needs be more truly merry; for true mirth is a complacency of the mind, ariſing from the apprehenſion of our perſonall happineſs; yet while we are in the body, laughter is naturall, and if it be kept within its bounds, and plac't upon right ſubjects, is both allowable, and conducing to health; but is not tyed to the Glaſs, or Bowl: This caution againſt drinking, concerns thoſe chiefly whoſe bodies require ſtrong drinks in ſome ſmall proportion, (for none do much) ſince thoſe who are of another temperament, will abſtain without any mans counſell, or any vertue of their own, which is only ſeen where there are propenſities to the contrary; though ſome men of this ſort may contract habits to themſelves, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the firſt requiſites of nature. I cannot methinks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men enough from this ſin, becauſe I have ſo often drawn others into it, and therefore hope to make ſome repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the ſpirituall hurt I may have done them who are yet living, whiles for thoſe of my aſſociates who are depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this life, I hope the mercies of God did overtake them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I wiſh from my ſoul that the ſpirituall dangers which I have experimented, and do know to be in that which we call good fellowſhip, or a chirping Cup (two ſeducing terms) and the great ſcandall, beſides the ſin it ſelf, which is in ſtaggering drunkenneſs, may have ſuch an influence upon thoſe who have no account to make for any thing that they have yet done as to this ſin, that they may never commit it; and for thoſe who have, and do yet continue in it, that conſidering the great dangers attending upon it, which (though now drown'd in the lavours of the Grape) will one day riſe up and ſhew themſelves to their terrour, they may ſtart from it with as terrible apprehenſions, while they may prevent the danger, as the reprobate will do at Hell when time is paſt,

and he cannot eſcape it. For my own particular, I have habituated my ſelf to this vice from my youth, and of later years have continued in it upon a miſapprehenſion, that the predominancy of my temperament being Melancholy, which is cold, and dry, it did require the ſupply of ſome acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall heat to correct it: but I do now think I have miſtaken my ſelf all this while, ſince looking back upon my beginning, I do not find I was ſo when I was under tutelage; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do impute it to a habit contracted ſince, and ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening cauſes of diſcontent: but ſince it is ſo eaſie a thing to be cheated into an ill cuſtome, and ſo dangerous to be under it, it behoves us to be very vigilant againſt this adverſary, which comes in the ſhape of nature, and hath ſuch great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages upon us. Cuſtome hath an intereſt in the actions of the whole world; in good men it diſpoſeth them to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though the firſt principle that moves in them is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace; but when the ſanctified ſoul hath made ſome progreſs in a good life, cuſtome comes in, and promotes it, and facilitates our perſeverance: in bad men likewiſe it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, and enclines them the more ſtrongly to vice; and you ſhall finde, that men who accuſtome themſelves to a conſtant afternoons-draught in the Week dayes, ſeldomeſt go to an afternoons Sermon upon the Sunday, if they go at all; becauſe the ill habit prevails ſo ſtrongly, that the vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtomack muſt have its falſe wants ſupplied, though the ſoul miſs of her ſpirituall repaſt.</p>
            <p>To prevent the contracting of this habit upon ſuch as are yet free, and to ſet thoſe at liberty who are enſlav'd by it, I ſhall propoſe this generall remedy; Be alwaies employ'd in lawfull exerciſes: It is an Epidemicall diſeaſe amongſt the Nobility and Gentry of this Nation, to be ſick of their time; which is ſuch a burden to them, that being tir'd with the tediouſneſs of the day, they muſt either drink or trifle
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39058:5"/>
it away to avoid a ſurfeit; this as it is a diſparagement to their judgements, ſo it is an exceeding detriment to their ſouls; for ſince man hath a ſoul which muſt be eternally ſav'd or damn'd, he is a fool that thinks he wants employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he doth every minute draw neerer to the ruin of himſelf; therefore let none of us ever pretend that we want buſineſs: If I have no accounts to take concerning my eſtate; no Law-ſuits to follow; though I am not a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or a Divine, though I have no Office at Court, though I have the Gout and cannot walk; though I am blind, or ſhut up in a dungeon from converſing either with men or Books, or whatſoever can befall me, yet ſtill I have a ſoul which is in her militant eſtate, and in the worſt of theſe conditions I can do acts of repentance, reflecting with ſorrow and deteſtation upon my ſins paſt, and renewing my purpoſes of amendment: I can meditate upon Gods Mercies and all his Attributes; I can perform acts of Praiſe to him: and for thoſe publike actions which I cannot do if I am denied the liberty of my body, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men, yet I can have them in <hi>voto,</hi> and deſiring to do what I am denied, and ſo I can keep on my journey to Heaven, though I lie ſheckel'd in a dungeon. But indeed employment is as generally miſtaken as mirth; for moſt men think they want it, if their time be not ſpent in ſome bodily exerciſe, or upon ſome ſlight or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubject; but for meditation upon God and the ſoul, the concernments of it, that's accounted a ſymptome of Melancholly, and reading, writing, or diſcourſing of any thing that is ſerious, or profitable, which comes the neereſt to it. A great cauſe of this evil ariſeth, either from the careleſneſs of Parents in not giving their Children a literate education, or their own neglect of improving it, when they

are at liberty from their Tutors, or Parents, or whoever had the charge of them: for as the principles of Learning and Knowledge do wear out, ſo the delight in ſuperficiall things grows more ſtrong and prevalent; becauſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any one thing, and the delight in it, alwayes go, and come together; ſince we cannot take pleaſure in any thing which we are ignorant of: therefore Hawking, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Horſe-matches, Gaming, Stage-plays, and the like, are made the buſineſs of our time, in which our delights do terminate, which ſhould only be uſ'd to unbend the mind, and give it relief after ſerious employments; and to exerciſe the body for the preſervation of health, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubordinate to greater ends; and this is one reaſon why Taverns are ſo much frequented; becauſe Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes are out of requeſt, and holy, learned, or ſerious communications do not reliſh with us: but this is not ſufficient to excuſe them: for though men either want education, or ſtifle it, yet they cannot extinguiſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and loſe the principles of Religion, which they have in their Catechiſmes, in their Bibles, and by Preaching; and therefore upon that account it is expected by God, that they yeeld obedience to him proportionably to this common, and generall Knowledge; which if any man fails to do, want of education will not be a ſufficient plea, becauſe it will be found to be an act of his will, running contrary to theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Knowledge: if any man ſhall ſay at the Tribunal of Chriſt, that he ſpent his time in drinking, and idle pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, becauſe he was not brought up to Learning, what will that avail him, who did live under the means of Grace, which were ſufficient for his ſalvation? for though he had no knowledge in Tongues, and Sciences, yet he knew the Commandements of God, and could not plead ignorance in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39058:6"/>
preſumptuous ſins; and though he that cannot read and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Greek, or Latin, yet if he can read Engliſh, let him ſpend a part of his time in reading the Bible, and other good Books, and though he cannot diſcourſe in Naturall or Morall Philoſophy, or in the Metaphyſicks, nor much in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall Divinity, yet let him ſpeak within the limits of his knowledge, let him reprove common ſins, and give all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the generals of a holy life, both by word and example: and if he be ſooner tir'd with diſcourſe, than men of greater knowledge would be; then let him betake himſelf (as I adviſ'd before) to ſome honeſt divertiſements; but not to any thing that hath the leaſt appearance of evil in it; the reſult of this is, that whether a man be literate, or illiterate, he may ſerve God: and thoſe Gentlemen of our Nation that are not members of the Commonwealth of Learning, may yet be members of the Myſticall Body of Chriſt: and though their delight in great Studies, in Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall diſcourſes and Meditations are loſt, proportionably to the decay of their Knowledge, yet their time may be the more ſpent in the <hi>Agenda</hi> of Religion, and they may be allow'd a more frequent uſe of lawfull recreations, but not of drinking though but to good-fellowſhip; which though the word ſounds finely, a man can hardly do it and ſecure his innocence: but ſince the remedy of continuall employment is not ſufficient for an accuſtomed drinker, he muſt unravell the habit by little and little, to which the ſhunning of idleneſs will very much help him. To conclude, Let us be carefull to reſiſt all the ſpecies and kindes of ſin whatſoever, for it is only ſin which can deprive us of the favour of God, which if once we are excluded from, we are eternally loſt; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſin of Drinking, which is the unhappy Parent of all other ſins: and therefore the more carefully to be withſtood;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39058:7"/>
which care if this ſhort Admonition may but ſtir up in one ſoul, I ſhould more rejoyce to know than to have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honour of the Nation confer'd upon me. <hi>Now to God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Ghost, be all honour, glory, praiſe and adoration, given by me, and by all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from hence forth to all eternity.</hi>
