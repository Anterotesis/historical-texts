         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
EXHORTATION
TO ALL
FRIENDS,
Who are of Late
Convinced of the Way of the Everlaſting God,
And have a True BREATHING to walk in True OBEDIENCE
Unto Him.</head>
            <p>DEar Friends, in the Everlaſting Love of God dwell,
and keep your Minds ſtayed upon the Lord, and the
Lord will not be wanting to all who are of an upright
heart and a contrite Spirit. The Lord was never wanting to
any that dwelt in his true fear, nor never will be, Bleſſed be his
Name forever; for he hath been near at hand to help all thoſe
who deſire after him, and them he will preſerve as they wait
upon him: Therefore Dear Friends, who are convinced of
the way of the Everlaſting God, in that all dwell, and by his
Power you will be preſerved; for out of the Power there is
no Satisfaction to the Immortal Soul; therefore keep in the
Mighty Power of God which will preſerve you all, and if it
be the Pure will of God to try any of you, to give up to the
Lord, who will preſerve you all whoever you are. For this
I can truly ſay, that the Lord God was not wanting to me, nor
to the reſt of my Friends and Companions who were exiled for
the Truth of the Everlaſting God, Bleſſed be his Name forever,
who was not wanting unto us, and his mighty Power preſerved
us, Bleſſed be his Name forever. So all Dear Friends, keep near
to the Lord God, and the Lord will preſerve you all whoſe
mindes are truly ſtayed upon him, for it is a Bleſſed thing
for the mind to be ſtayed upon the Lord, ſuch will the Lord
keep in perfect peace: And the Lord did never forſake the
Righteous, but was and is alwayes a God near at hand to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
all who truly hunger and thirſt after him, ſuch the
Lord will ſatisfy with the Riches of his Love, which hath not
been wanting, nor never will be wanting to thoſe who keep
their minds truly ſtayed upon him. So all Dear Friends mind
the way of the Everlaſting God, and if any of you be under any
Servitude to Maſter or Dame, ſee that you Diſcharge a good
Conſcience to them, as you may read in <hi>Peter Chap. 2. ver.</hi>
12. and have your Converſations honeſt among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
that they which ſpeak Evil of you, as of Evil doers, may by your
Good Works which they ſhall ſee, glorifie God in the Day of
your Viſitation; and ſhew forth a meek and a quiet Spirit, for
that is it that will overcome all thats contrary to the Will
of God. So Dear Friends be Faithful in your Places, and the
Lord God will bleſs and proſper you, and it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of the Lord's Faithful Servants that you might be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Power of God, and it is the Labour and Travel
of Gods Servants that all that have taſted how good the Lord
hath been in any meaſure, might be preſerved in the ſame all
your dayes, whether they be few or many the Lord he knows.
So Dear Friends keep in the way of the Everlaſting God, for
the nearer you are to the Lord, the greater will be your joy
and comfort; for the Lord he is the true comfort, and he was the
preſerver of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the keeper of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſees and beholds
all things, and nothing can be hid from him; for he is the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the heart, and knows the ſecret intents thereof, and it is
a pretious thing to have a true Love in your hearts for the Lord
God; for I know the Lord God will give a true reward to ſuch
who ſeek after the way of Righteouſneſs the Lord will ſatisfie.
And Dear Friends, if any thing doth ariſe which doth tend to
the Diſhonour of God's Truth, be careful and watchful, that
you never give way to any ſuch thing that ſhall bring diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the pure way of God; but conſider how it was with <hi>Joſeph</hi>
when he was Tempted, he having a true ſight that he ſhould
ſin againſt God, if he yielded thereunto; ſo his Eye was unto the
Lord, and he was preſerved out of the Temptation; for the truth
of God hath many Enemies, and great are the Tryals of the
righteous both inwardly and outwardly, but the Lord doth deli-them
over them all, as he did for <hi>Job,</hi> for the Lord found him
upright and juſt, one that feared God, and Eſchewed Evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
he held and kept his Integrity, though great was his Tryal,
yet the Lord delivered him over them all. So Dear Friends,
keep your minds ſtayed within the Bounds of Gods Love, and
be diligent to wait upon him to know more of his pure will,
for there is no End of his Love; for the more you have known
of it, the more you may know of it, for there is no end of his
Love; therefore Dear Friends, priſe the Love of God forever,
for the Lord hath done much for you in that he hath made
himſelf known unto you, and gave you a true Sight of his Love.
I cannot but Exhort you all to wait upon him forever, and that
it may never be ſaid by any that your Waiting was in Vain, nor
to ſit down ſhort of the Reſt which the Lord hath prepared for
all thoſe that are true Followers of him, for the Lord will Crown
all that are Faithfull unto him, and the Redeemed of the Lord
ſhall return and come with joy unto <hi>Sion,</hi> and everlaſting joy
ſhall be upon the heads of all thoſe who truſt in the Name of
the Lord. They ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſorrow
and mourning ſhall fly away, and none ſhall make them afraid
whoſe truſt is in the Lord.—And this is the deſire of him
who has a true Love in his Heart for all who draw near unto
the Lord in this the Day of his Mighty Power. And Friends,
be carefull, and look not out, but keep your minds ſtayed upon
the Lord God; for if the mind be out, abroad, then careleſneſs
will be ready to enter, and that will hinder your growth in
the Lords Truth: So be diligent, and keep Watchful conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
over the mind, that it may not lead you into any thing
which may tend to the diſhonour of the pure Way of the Lord
God, which many of the Lords Servants have been true Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in, who ſought not their own Glory, but the Glory of God,
and the good of your Immortal Souls; therefore priſe the Love
of God above all things, for there is nothing to be compared
to it. Therefore dear Friends, walk in the pure fear of the Lord
God, and it will be well with you when time ſhall be no more.
<hi>The Juſt ſhall Live by Faith, but if any one draw back, my Soul ſhall
have no pleaſure in him, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
