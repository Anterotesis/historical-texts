         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LOVING SALUTATION To all FRIENDS every where, in this great Day of Tryal, to ſtand Faithful unto God, over all Sufferings whatſoever.</head>
            <p>YOu dear and tender Children of my Fathers family, Sheep and Lambs of his Fold, my Brethren, Siſters and Friends which are near and dear unto me in the living Virtue of the Life of the Lambs Power, which I behold in the clear Light of that clear Day, that hath dawned and ſhined from on high, which hath viſited us, and whence the ſtreams of the Father's Love, which runneth from his pure and clean Fountain into every part of that Body, of which Chriſt is the head, which is ſo ſweet and exceeding delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and refreſhing of Soul, Body, and Spirit, in which you are exceeding precious unto me, and the moſt amiableſt and comelieſt Family amongſt all the Families in the whole Earth; for you are the moſt bleſſed of the Lord, you I mean, that are <hi>Choſen, Called,</hi> and <hi>Faithful,</hi> and are begotten by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Word of the Power of the Infinit God, and are brought forth from the Everlaſting Womb of Eternity, and from the Boſome from whence all glorious Vertue doth flow and iſſue: Who can demonſtrate the Nobleneſs of that Off-ſpring from whence your Beauty doth ariſe? It hath been upon my heart when in the ſweet Repoſe of the Streams of my Father's Love and Life, by which my heart, ſoul and ſpirit hath been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, to viſit you with a loving <hi>Salutation</hi> from the place of my outward Bonds and Impriſonment, for the Goſpel ſake, which is the Power of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94875:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>O right Dear and Precious Ones, which are united to that which is but one in all, in which alone the right Dearneſs and Preciouſneſs doth conſiſt, the glorious Virtue and Power of the Eternal Son of God, <hi>CHRIST JESUS</hi> our Lord, which we witneſs alone, our Saviour and Anoint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d of the Father, who hath taken his Throne in our ſouls, hearts, ſpirits and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to rule in us over all that is contrary to him. O come, my dear Lambs and dear Babes, it is a time for us to flock together into our Father's Fold, and to get into his Tent of Safety, and to lie down in the Arms of his dear Love, and to be covered with the Wing of his Power; now the wild Boar of the Foreſt is abroad to make his prey, and the Wolviſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers are ſeeking to ſcatter the Sheep of the Lord's Paſture: O let us feel and know the ſafe Harbour, in which alone is Safety, whilſt the boiſterous Storms and Tempeſts are all about us, and the foaming rage of the troubled Seas are caſting up their waves one after another, and their mire and dirt upon us, as if they would devour us; and alſo the many Rocks, Shelves and dangerous Sands are ſeen, which will ſplit all that fall thereupon, who are not wiſe and skilful to avoid them, and know not a Refuge near to fly unto, till the Indignation, Storm and Guſt is overpaſt, and hath accompliſhed its end for which it was ſent and appointed.</p>
            <p>Oh! what if we be the Mark for all wild Hunters to ſhoot at? <hi>Eſau</hi> the rough ſpirit, which is cunning in hunting for that which periſheth and muſt die of himſelf, and ſlights that noble Birthright, to be an Heir of the Promife, which <hi>Jacob</hi> the plain and ſmooth man prizes more than the meſs of Pottage. Oh dear Lambs and Babes of God, our Rock is ſure and ſtedfaſt, our Refuge and Harbour ſafe and unmovable, and our Pilot wiſe and exceeding skilfull; there is not a danger near, that can attend us in our Voyage to our everlaſting Land of Reſt, but he doth foreſee, and knows right well how to avoid them all. Therefore it is now our Work and Buſineſs in this the Great Day of Tryal, that we put our whole truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him, and to give up all we have and are unto him; and he never failed any that truſted in him, and in the Arm of his Salvation: and he will make all his to feel, know and

witneſs, that we cannot add one cubit unto our ſtature, by all that we can do and not in his Spirit and Life. O bleſſed is his Name for evermore, that hath made his Arm bare for us, which hath brought in, and is bringing in Everlaſting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs into our ſouls, and is breaking down all Man's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and Righteouſneſs, and is ſetting up the Horn of his Anointed, and hath cauſed it to bud, even the Horn of his Salvation, the Eternal Power, which ſhall break to pieces all the Potſherds of the Earth, even the Corrupt Powers of the whole World, and ſhall reign over all for ever and ever. </p>
            <p>Oh! my heart, ſoul and ſpirit rejoyceth in the conſideration of the ſame, &amp; of the great Work which God hath wrought, and is a working, and therfore I am not at all amazed nor ſtartled at what the Enemies are a working in this their time and hour of the power of Darkneſs; But this my ſoul deſireth, that I and all that know him, may not by the ſubtilty of the wiſdom and cunning of the Serpent, be in the leaſt ſhy of the Truth, nor in the leaſt ſtand aloof off from owning of it in the open face of all, where ever they are caſt by the hand of the Lord's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, becauſe of the furious rage of the Enemy, which is and may be exceeding great, but that we may all wait upon the God of our Salvation, to receive the Virtue, Life and Power of him, by which we may endure unto the end of our race, and undergo all the fiery Darts of the Devil, which he ſhooteth at us by the moſt fierceſt of his Inſtruments, which may be let looſe upon us, to drive us from our Ground and Rock, upon which we are built, but that we may all <hi>ſtand faſt, and quit our ſelves like men, and be ſtrong in the Power of his might,</hi> which will caſt out all thoſe fears which cauſe torment, and he wil aid &amp; aſſiſt all ſuch as are in a godly fear &amp; jealouſie, which may be upon the hearts of many in this the day of Trial, knowing that the fleſhly part is weak and cannot ſtand in the Trial. But this I know and am perſwaded of, in the holy fear of God, that the ſtrength of the Lord God will be made manifeſt in weakneſs, that his Power may be magnified over all: For this I know aſuredly, God doth not regard the ſtrength, wiſdom and parts nor abilities of none of the Sons of men, but the weakeſt and feebleſt of his own he hath an eye unto, to hold forth his hand
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94875:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of power to help the helpleſs, and this I am perſwaded, and in his fear and counſel, that the ſimplicity and lowlineſs of his own Seed, he hath a ſpecial regard unto; which lowlineſs and ſimplicity brings into uprightneſs with the Lord, and to wait upon him in all faithfulneſs with the eye ſingle unto him; and that man and woman ſhall not want ſtrength in the time of need, to witneſs for God, if it be required of them even to lay down their dear lives for a Teſtimony to the Truth, which they witneſs God hath made them partakers of, let their meaſure be never ſo ſmal, for that is it which the Lord looks at, the gift of his own Seed. Though it be but as a grain of muſtard ſeed; I ſay, that is it which the Lord God looks at, be it leſs or more in each particular, the gift of himſelf: but where <hi>much is given, much is required</hi>; and ſo little being given, no more is required but faithfulneſs to that: And therefore dear Lambs &amp; Babes of God, in your own ſtand faſt, which is given of God, &amp; which you have rceived from him, that no man nor thing take your Crown from you; and the deſire of my heart is, that you, the <hi>little one,</hi> may be as <hi>David, and David as the Angel of God.</hi> So dear Lambs feel with me a little where your ſtrength lies; is it not with you when your minds are ſtaied and fixed in the meaſure of the gift of God, in which you feel the Power which quieteth all, which brings into calmneſs, ſtilneſs, and coldneſs? then do not you find a ſecret hand of Power to ariſe up in your hearts, which girds up the loyns of your minds, and girts you about with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtrength? And then, are not your hearts opened, and your underſtandings cleared, and your minds bent &amp; ſtaied upon the Lord? Then, do not you behold the Beloved of your ſouls, and is he not then unto you <hi>the cheifeſt of ten thouſands?</hi> And then, cannot you truſt in him, and in the Arm of his Power revealed in you? yea I know you can. Then, do you feel <hi>his Banner of Love to be over you</hi>? then, do you feel <hi>his Right hand imbracing of you,</hi> and filling your ſouls with his ſwetneſs of Love and Life, which is <hi>better than Wine,</hi> and all Spices? Then, doth he reveal unto, and give you of his ſweet Counſel, and open the Myſtery of his Kingdom, and gives you to underſtand the working of his Power? And then, can you ſay one unto another, <hi>Did not our hearts burn while he talked with us?</hi> O the precious frame of ſpirit
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94875:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that is felt when the mind in the pure Power of the Lord God is gathered up unto him, in waiting to receive of his Liberal Bounty the freeneſs of his Grace &amp; Love, the Life to ſpring up over all the death and darkneſs, and the will of man overcome and ſubjected, delighting to ſtand in the Will and Counſel of God, that it may take place in all things, over all to Reign, the Righteous Power to be above all. <hi>This makes glad the hearts of the upright.</hi> Oh my heart is full, and my cup doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow to you, much more then words can utter at this time, in writing unto you the Beloved of God, and of my ſoul, becauſe of it! O let us all ſit down in the Manſion-houſe of God, and at the banqueting Table of him! for truly it is often with me, that I behold in the Light of the Lamb, that all you the Children of the moſt high God, ſiting as Children at one Table, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Order and Beauty, every one according to the Father's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, where he comes to take a view of you all, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute, and that you may receive a portion of his pure Bread and <hi>Water of Life,</hi> and of the Milk and Wine which he hath mingled, and that each particular Babe may have his lot and portion ſutable unto his nature and growth in the Myſtery of his Kingdom, and according to the working of his divine Power in them, that there may be no complaining in his houſe, where there is bread enough; and this is known unto ſuch whoſe minds are not without, but inwardly ſtaid, feeling their own gift from God, and ſo are ſatisfied with their portion, which he doth give and renew in due ſeaſon; So that the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and the diſcontented part may be ſhut out, and the quiet and contented mind may be known; for <hi>Godlineſs with Content is great gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh dear Lambs! we have a great Portion; for I can ſay in the ſecrets of my Soul, <hi>The Lord is my Portion,</hi> and hath been and is yours alſo, which have waited for him, and in whom is your delight; Oh! Do you not delight to be in his Preſence which is Life unto your Souls? Oh! Is there any other thing that can take away your hearts? Nay, I know you that have, and do enjoy and witneſs, Is Life your Love, when at any time that the heart is upon any thing that is worldly? You can ſay, It is not Life unto you, but death: Oh
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94875:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the pretious Life which God hath manifeſted in us, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Light, it only can magnifie the Lord, and ſuffer for him and his Son, who is our Life, All in All to us; Oh! my Soul doth bow down before him, who is the everlaſting ſtrength of all his People: Oh! let us fight valiantly under his Banner of Love, who hath lifted up his Standard in this our day, and we have a glorious and victorious Captain, which is gone and going before us, to lead us to an everlaſting and heavenly Reſt, that he hath prepared for us in his everlaſting Kingdom; there is the Wine prepared, which he doth drink with his Children: Oh my Friends, we may drink, and that abundantly; Oh! we may ſuck and draw from thoſe Breaſts and Paps from whence our nouriſhment comes; Oh feel the Oyl of gladneſs daily poured down, which comes from the true Olive Tree, which is full of fatneſs, and drink of that Wine which comes from that Vine, which is only full of ſweetneſs, that from the ſtrength of which, you may be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and bring forth fruit unto God. Oh! in the Love and Life of the Lamb, look over all weakneſs in one another, as God doth look over all the weakneſs in every one of us, and doth love us for his own Seed ſake, which is the object of his Love, that overcomes all the contrary; and that is the object which our Love is unto in each other, which will in time overcome all evil; for it is the only good thing by which all evil is overcome. And in ſo doing, peace will abound in our borders, and it will flow forth amongſt us like a River, and it will keep out jars, ſtrifes, and contentions from us, and ſo we ſhall be kept as a beautiful and amiable Family; and in the order of God, that ſo the fame of it may ſound abroad, that others that are ſcattered from it, may be brought home, that ſo there may be a rejoycing in their return from their Prodigal Eſtate, and that will manifeſt us to be in the good order of God, and to be merciful as he is merciful, and to love the Good, and thereby to eſchew the Evil, and it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in the patience and long-ſuffering, and this leadeth to repentance and amendment of life.</p>
            <p>So my dear Friends of the Living God, feel me near unto you in that which is beyond all words, for my Life lies not in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94875:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
words, but only in that which was before words, which is the Word of his eternal Power, in which is my Love and Life for evermore; in which I dearly ſalute you all, and in it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your eternal welfare, and your daily growth in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power of an endleſs Life, and in the Living Vertue of him, in whom all our freſh ſprings are to be found: So the Lord God Almighty be with you, all dear Babes and Children of my heavenly Father, that all our ſtrong <hi>Groans, Cries,</hi> and <hi>Tears,</hi> may meet at his heavenly Throne, in the fervency of his own Life, and we may feel and know aſſuredly, that we find acceptation with him, and an anſwer returned into our boſoms from the boſom of his Love, in which we may dwell and abide for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Theſe few Lines do manifeſt ſomething that was upon my heart towards you, in the feeling of my Fathers Love, as I lay in my Bed in the night ſeaſon, this 11th of the 9th Month, 1662, from him that travels in Spirit, till the Seed of God is ſet up to Reign over all, for evermore, Amen.</p>
