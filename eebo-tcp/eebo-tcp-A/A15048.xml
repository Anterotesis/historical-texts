            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>To whome ſhe gaue as in reward, a pleaſaunt note or ſound:</l>
               <l>Their carkes and cares to dryue away, wherby much eaſe was found.</l>
               <l>Whereof in children proofe is had, whome nurſes haue in charge:</l>
               <l>How ſoone they ſtop and ſtay their cry, when ſhe doeth ſound at large.</l>
               <l>The Plowman eke, and Carter both, with eaſe doeth paſſe away:</l>
               <l>In ſingyng of ſome mery note, their tranayle all the day.</l>
               <l>Wherefore to Lady Nature I, doe render prayſe and wyll:</l>
               <l>By whome not onely man alone, but byrdes in ſong hath ſkyll.</l>
               <l>The Poetes fayne that <hi>Amphion,</hi> who buylded Thebes towne:</l>
               <l>Did fyrſt inuent the pleaſaunt note, whereby he got renowne.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Dioniſius</hi> ſome the name, and ſome contrary wyſe:</l>
               <l>To <hi>Zephus,</hi> who <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſayth, the ſame dyd firſt deuyſe.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Solinus</hi> ſayth that men of Crete, by ryng and ſound of braſſe:</l>
               <l>By <hi>Thacbadianes</hi> doeth <hi>Polibius</hi> ſay, inuented firſt it was.</l>
               <l>In déede I thinke ſoone after that, dame Nature made the ſound:</l>
               <l>That Reaſon did the meaſure make, the concord and the ground.</l>
               <l>And then in <hi>Mercury</hi> firſt it wrought, as auctour of the ſame:</l>
               <l>The which euen hée (as worthy prayſe) did publiſh and proclame.</l>
               <l>Then Reaſon, as one not full ſuffyſde, did ſeeke for to deuyſe:</l>
               <l>Some inſtrument to geue a ſound, by whome there did aryſe</l>
               <l>A foreward wit in <hi>Mercury,</hi> for to inuent the ſame:</l>
               <l>Who made a Harpe of fyſhes bone, a <hi>Tortes</hi> cald by name.</l>
               <l>Which hée by <hi>Nilus</hi> ryuer found, the fyſh was dryde away:</l>
               <l>And nothyng but thrée ſinowes left, whereon he ſought to play.</l>
               <l>But when they gaue a ſound agayne, thus doe the Poetes fayne:</l>
               <l>He made a Harpe much lyke that bone, by thinuent of his brayne.</l>
               <l>Thrée ſtrynges to it did he apply, a Treble Baſe and Meane:</l>
               <l>The which he made for to accord, in Muſickes pleaſaunt vayne.</l>
               <l>Then he it to <hi>Apollo</hi> gaue, as gyft of wonderous weyght:</l>
               <l>And he the ſame to <hi>Orpheus</hi> handes, made redeliuery ſtreyght.</l>
               <l>Some thinke <hi>Amphion</hi> firſt it found, and ſome to that ſay no:</l>
               <l>And ſome in <hi>Tuball</hi> thinke the lyke, but that can not be ſo.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Pan</hi> the Pype, <hi>Apollo</hi> eke, the Shalme he did inuent:</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Dauid</hi> Regalles ſought to make, by Reaſones whole conſent.</l>
               <l>And <hi>Orphen</hi> firſt, with <hi>Linus</hi> nexte, and <hi>Arion</hi> alſ by name:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Timarias,</hi> and <hi>Trezenius</hi> both, thereby did purchaſe ſame.</l>
               <l>Nor <hi>Cibell</hi> yet, with <hi>Piſes</hi> too, their labour ought did ceaſe:</l>
               <l>But in the ſame did ſore apply, their cunnyng too encreaſe.</l>
               <l>Thus haue we proued by Poetes lore, how auncient Muſicke is:</l>
               <l>And now I meane by Scripture playne, to proue the lykeiwis.</l>
               <l>We read how <hi>Dauid</hi> daunct and ſoung, before the Arke of God:</l>
               <l>And how his wyfe which flowted him, was by the Lorde forbode</l>
               <l>For hauyng chyldren any more, but barren ſhould ſhe be:</l>
               <l>Whereby I proue that God is pleaſde, with ſuch lyke armony.</l>
               <l>When <hi>MirIam</hi> with the Iſraelites, the red ſea déepe had paſt:</l>
               <l>And Pharaos hoſte were drowned all, who did purſue them faſt,</l>
               <l>Then tooke they Timbrelles in their handes, and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſang prayſe</l>
               <l>For that he was their ayde and ſhyeld, to paſſe the daungerouſe ſeas.</l>
               <l>The Shepherdes eke, and Angelles both, we read how they reioyſt:</l>
               <l>When they once heard and vnderſtoode, the byrth of Ieſus Chriſt.</l>
               <l>We ſée by this what Muſicke is, we néede no better proofe:</l>
               <l>The Scripture is a buckeler good, in Muſickes right behoofe.</l>
               <l>In <hi>Fucſius,</hi> and in <hi>Galen</hi> both, who lyſt to looke ſhall fynd:</l>
               <l>How much that Muſicke doeth appeaſe, the dolours of the mynd.</l>
               <l>You know what tauntes <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> in banket did ſuſtayne:</l>
               <l>When he good muſicke did diſprayſe, accoumptyng it but vayne.</l>
               <l>They iudged his learnyng much the worſe, becauſe he did defye</l>
               <l>That, which all men did much eſtéeme, regard and eke ſet bye.</l>
               <l>I pray you was not <hi>Socrates,</hi> whome crooked age had caught:</l>
               <l>With Muſickes ſkyll and armony, as one with Cupid fraught?</l>
               <l>And ſayd that concord was the ground, and eke the ſure ſtay:</l>
               <l>Without the which nothing is good, this could that wyſe man ſay.</l>
               <l>And meaſure is a mery meane, and meane who doeth embrace:</l>
               <l>Of euery vertue hath the ground, which bryngeth man to grace.</l>
               <l>This haue I doen in Muſickes cauſe, my pen now wyll I reſt:</l>
               <l>Syth that I haue that worthy ſcience, as famouſe once profeſt.</l>
               <l>And who that ſéekes the loſſe of it, néedes muſt I ſpeake my mynd:</l>
               <l>A great diſprayſe is to his wit, his wordes are coumpted wynd.</l>
