            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
EPISTLE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THis Poem was deſign'd for an <hi>Epſode</hi> to that called the
<hi>DAENEIDS;</hi> as that of <hi>Dido</hi> is to the <hi>AENEIDS;</hi>
but being long, 'twas thought by ſome, if it was joyn'd
with the other, it wou'd give too great an interruption to
that ſhort Story, and ſwell it too large for this Age, which ſeems to
have loſt its taſte of Poetry; and muſt be dealt with, as ſick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are, have a little at a time given 'em, of what we wou'd
have 'em ſwallow. This Poem therefore is Printed by it ſelf, which
it will very well bear, being in it ſelf an intire Story; but there
are ſeveral Lines in this and the other, which will help to joyn 'em
together, if the Reader pleaſes. Both of 'em are a kind of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque,
directly contrary to that of <hi>Virgil</hi> Traveſtie, for that makes
a <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Heroine</hi> talk like <hi>Higlers</hi> or <hi>Coſtardmongers,</hi> and
this repreſents <hi>Prieſts, Chanters</hi> and <hi>Vergers,</hi> like <hi>Gods</hi> and
<hi>Heroes.</hi> I have in ſome places burleſqu'd ſome parts of <hi>Virgil,</hi> in
others endeavour'd to imitate him, and elſewhere to tranſlate him.
<pb facs="tcp:48489:3"/>
But I am no ſervile Tranſlator. I care not what the Laws of
Tranſlation are; I am a Free-born Subject of <hi>England,</hi> and will
not be put in Fetters, but by the Laws of the Kingdom. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſay any man chain himſelf to an Author, without ſpoiling
both their meens. Two men cannot row like Galley-Slaves, lock'd
together, with a very good Grace. I have alſo in this and the other
Poem, made bold with the <hi>Dean, Quire, Vergers,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Nôtre-Dame.</hi> I have put the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dreſs, and
<hi>Pews</hi> into that Popiſh Church for the hearing of Sermons, where
perhaps none are preach'd; but I have reaſon for this Confidence;
<hi>French men</hi> are our King's Subjects, and ought to obey our Cuſtoms;
that Cathedral too was built by <hi>Engliſh,</hi> therefore we have a right
to <hi>Pews</hi> there, and I hope we ſhall have the Poſſeſſion o' ſome,
by the help of our King's Valour and Conduct. It would be hard,
if we might not manage how we will for our Diverſion, the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of a few <hi>French</hi> Prieſts: <hi>France</hi> long Govern'd our <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and <hi>Miniſters of State,</hi> and made our whole <hi>Nation</hi> a Jeſt.</p>
            <p>This little Poem being part o' the <hi>DAENEIDS,</hi> humbly
flies for Refuge to the ſame great Perſon whither the other is gone.
And I take this opportunity of Addreſſing while the <hi>State</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
him to be at leiſure for theſe Trifles, which ſure will not be
long, in this Age ſo barren of great Men. And how much ſo
ever he may love Repoſe, he may venture on Buſineſs, ſince he
has an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding to make all things eaſy to him.</p>
