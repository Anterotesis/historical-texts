            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have received your Letter and your <hi>Quaere's,</hi> which you say make a deepe impression in many, of whose honestie and publique Affections I have a very good esteeme; and that they are made by one who hath a great desire to receive ease and satisfaction himselfe, as being of a nature very undelighted and passive in these Distractions. The first (how strange soever it seemes to Reason) I must believe, especially when I find your selfe whom I have often knowne very easily to master more difficult Contentions, brought to some pause, as if somewhat were said to you, you could not well get from; no doubt many others of lesse subtile understandings, and it may be hurt by the necessary pressures, and provoked by unwarrantable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies of the Kings Souldiers, are, or seeme to be really puzzled. But for the Author of those <hi>Quaere</hi>'s, you must pardon me if I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be a man of so innocent a nature as you would imply; doubtlesse these scruples never sprung from a minde in labour to find out Truth; but are contrived by a Person very well able to answer his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96559:3"/>
owne Objections; and having pretended Conscience against his owne understanding, hath found these little excuses to make a Party against weaker men.</p>
            <p>The first scruple seems to be a tendernesse of the act for continuance of this Parliament, which that Gentleman would apprehend to be broken by His Maesties not consenting to all the Counsells now given Him by both Houses; If I thought this Obiection to be of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you, I should give your understanding for lost, and expect your cure onely by that which mis-led you, Successe: But I must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to you the uningenuity of your honest man, who would make the People beleive that by His Maiesties consenting to passe that Act, that Assembly were authourized to command, and His Maiesty obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obey whatever they prescribed; when that Gentleman well knowes nothing is enacted by that law, but that this Parliament shall not be disolved but by Act of Parliament. You well remember in what Condition things stood at the passing of that Law, two Armies in the Bowells of the Kingdome at 80000l. the Moneth so much to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for support of them, and a much greater summe to Disband them; all this mony was to be borrowed, and upon the security as mony in those happy dayes used to be lent, for the new merry security of the publike faith, by a Vote of both Houses was not then currant enough to be obtruded to the people the credit of many worthy persons was to be used for the procuring this supply and it seemed no unreasonable wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of those who exposed themselves and their fortunes to this hazard, to desire that the body, at whose instance they undertooke those En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, might not be dissolved, before it had taken some course to secure such undertakings, and provision should be made for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity of those who had submitted to such burthens. This Reason, and this alone prevailed with His Maiesty to agree that this Parliament should not be dissolved without their consent, who seemed voluntarily to engage themselves for the Peace &amp; benefit of the Kingdome, How this continuance of the Parliament should now give both Houses the Prerogative they have assumed, I cannot understand, and themselves have publikely acknowledged in their Declarations, that they were to blame if they undertook any thing which they would not undertake if it were in His Ma. power to dissolve them to morrow. Think now with your selfe if the King should argue with both Houses upon their ground that the Trust being broken, the power may be reassumed immediatly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96559:3"/>
into the hands which reposed that Trust, might he not iustly say that they had betrayed and forfeited that Trust, by using the meanes which was given them to disburthen the Common-wealth of a debt which was then thought insuportable, only to plunge it irrecoverably into a great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, and to ruine the Kingdome to prefer halfe a score men. And if the People should follow their Logique, he tryed only by the Equity of the Law, might they not charge them with the breach of Trust, in changing the whole frame of the Governement of the Kingdome, and subiecting them to so unlimited an Arbitrary power, that no man can know at the setling of the Houses, what he shall be worth at their rising? Did they intend, when they let these men into that Assembly, that they should shut the Door, and keepe those that sent them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from those councells? Did the King intend that they should rob, depose and murther him? And did the people intend that their fellowes and Companions should imprison, Plunder and destroy them? and if the abused King, and iniured People should now declare this Act to be void, and in it selfe against the Fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome, and so this Parliament to be disso<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

You are one of the oldest Parliament men I know, and however you may have since changed your mind; have to me seemed the most scandalized at the indignities offered to the very being of <hi>Parliament,</hi> by the wildnesse and fury of this. Did not you passonately reprehend the pert Burgesse of your own Towne for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the Kings negative voice, because then it may fall out that the Common-wealth might be ruined for want of a supplementall Law, which the perversnesse of one man would not confent to? Did you not then (after you had shewed the impossibility and madnesse of such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and that from the beginning of this Monarchy to this day no inconvenience had hapned of that kind) say that you were perswded in your Conscience that the Lawes of the Kingdome were so compleat, in order to the Government of the Kingdome that if there should never more be made so the old were faithfully observed the Kingdome would be at least without any diminution of its happinesse?</p>
            <p>On the other side, if the Kings Consent were not necessary you said all those Bills which had heretofore passed both Houses, and for want of the Royall Assent had been layed by, would now rise up as so many Lawes to as great a confusion as these Ordinances have made? Did you not then say that when <hi>Parliaments</hi> left their modestie, they w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

lose their reputation, and when they walked in any other path then of their known Presidents, and iudged by any other Rule then the known Laws they would advance a tyranny more insupportable then ever <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Greece</hi> endured? your Priviledges which are freedom of speech, and freedom from Imprisonment, (except where the Law sayes you may be imprisoned where are they? how violated? and by whom, but by your selves: How many men chosen and sent by their Countries, have you turned out of the House or not concurring with you in opinion? How monstrous is it that the King may not commit a Member who attempts to kill him without your leave; and you may commit another, for but desiring to kisse His hand? And whilest you would not suffer His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, without breach of Priviledge, to commit Traytors and Fellons, because they are Members of either House you are content that Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Pennington</hi> or any of the City Captaines commit those who sit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, and you have not the courage to reprehend them. Do you think the people of <hi>England</hi> can look long upon sixscore or sevenscore men (for both Houses doe not containe a greater number) as upon the high Court of of <hi>Parliament</hi>? when a great part of those two are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of such desperate fortunes, and contemptible undertakings, as off from those Benches were never thought fit for sober and honest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. You may break what Iests you please upon the King and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, and say, that if He were in His owne Power, He would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returne to His <hi>Parliament,</hi> but truely the Court here hath so much Charity to beleeve, if both Houses were at liberty to doe according to their Consciences, this publique fire would be quickly quenched. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it no sober man looks upon you under any other Notion, then as men besieged by the desperate common Councell of <hi>London,</hi> and their Adherents, who awe and fright you to their wicked and damnable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions: Nay, the close Committee it selfe is a greater breach of the Priviledge of <hi>Parliament</hi> then the Kings comming to the House, and the taking the five Members from thence could have beene. I am as little pleased with the perpetuity of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> as I have beene with the untimely breaking of others; and let me tell you, all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of <hi>Parliament</hi> from the beginning of them to this time, hath not done halfe that mischiefe as the continuance of this hath done; and yet since it hath the countenance of a Law, I wish it may never be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved but by a Law. What Designes have these men even upon <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments</hi> themselves, is too evident, whereas if the King prevailes: <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96559:4"/>
are againe restored to their full lustre: You have read his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations solemnly made in the presence of God for defence of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of <hi>Parliaments</hi>; He is too iust and too pious a Prince to break those promises and to reproach himselfe with His owne Declarations; but if He should enquire, whether the Persons about Him, even the Officers of his Army are like to concurre with him in those ends? I am perswaded it would be more in his power to imploy his Army to the destruction of the Law, then you once thought it was to raise one for His preservation. In a word as you esteeme and reverence reall <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abhorre these men who would use the word <hi>Parliament</hi> onely as a stalking Horse to destroy all Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi>; there cannot be a more irreverent mention of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> then to call the fanatique acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a few desperate, seditious Persons the Proceedings of <hi>Parliament.</hi> A <hi>Parliament</hi> is the great Councell of the Kingdome graciously cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his Maiesties Writ, confidently to present the grievances of the People, and humlby to offer their advice and Councels so Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if they come unsent for, irregularly call that a grievance that the Law allowes, and insolently command in stead of modestly advising the Royall Power by whose Authority they come together, they doe as much as in them lies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dissolve the <hi>Parliament</hi> by proceeding against the nature of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>

Tell your selfe without blushing, who you thinke are meant by Delinquents: is it not visible to all the world, that you intend all such who are not or will not be Traitors to the knowne Lawes, to be Delinquents to both Houses? and 'tis a notable breach of priviledge that his Maiesty will protect these Delinquents from you; looke over your owne votes and see if all men who do not assist you in your pious work of murthering the King, and destroying the Common-wealth (for you have faithfully requited the lazy Gentlemen who desired to be lookers on) are not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the number of Delinquents: What was Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> for denying His Maiestie admittance into his owne Towne of <hi>Hull?</hi> A pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged Person and an upright Patriot: what were they who attended His Maiesty when he presumed desperatly and rebelliously to offer to go thither? Delinquents: And yet his Maiesty will not suffer those who kept Him out, to iudge those who should have gon in with him; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull breach of Priviledge, and protecting of Delinquents! If we cannot recover Law againe, for Gods sake let us have sense restored to us and not grow Beasts in our understanding as well as in our Liberty; it will make us love mankind the worse, to see men with sad browes, as if they believed themselves, seriously urge things in publique which in privat would make friends quarrell, for the scorne and Indignity offered to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son such is all your discourse of Priviledges and Delinquents.</p>

If there bee nothing in it but what before was the duty of every man, there needs no Argument from the Protestation; the truth is, though I like not the use hath beene made of it to poyson and mislead simple people, nor the irregularity (to call it no worse) of compelling men to take it when no law requires it, I know nothing promised or underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that Protestation which every honest man doth not, and alwayes did hold absolutely to be his duty, no man being obliged by it to doe any thing, but as farre as lawfully he may. And would not a stander by think a man mad, that should sweare to defend the Kings Person, and to maintaine the Priviledges of Parliament, and immediately draw His sword upon the King whose Person he knew, in the behalfe of somwhat he is told is Priviledge of Parliament? we are gotten againe into the old circle of folly and madnesse.</p>
            <p>Your last Scruple I will be serious with you in, 'tis that (however throwne among the people malitiously, and indeed against the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Contrivers) which I know startles many well meaning, and well-wishing men, you are afraid of the Papists, and that if the King prevailes, that Religion will have too great a countenance and growth, to the scandall of ours; Indeed if this feare were well grounded, you would have so many Partners with you in your trouble, that you would even be satisfied in your company, and by that think your selfe secure against your feares; what makes you doubt this, an inclination in the King himselfe? Let His Life be examined, His continued pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Acts of Devotion, (examples indeed for a through Reformation;) His understanding the differences betweene the Church of Rome and us; and so not onely utterly dissenting from them, but knowing why he doth so, and he will be found above the reach of Envie or Malice, and indeed above your owne feares and iealousies: Take a list and survey of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96559:6"/>
His servants and Counsellors, who are suspected to have the least inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in His favours and inclinations, you will not find a man under the least taint that way and most of them (till your dishonest uncharitable distinction of Popish and popishly affected was throwne among the people) thought eminent advancers of the true Protestant Religion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished. And let me tell you, if there should be a breach made upon that Religion these men would stand in the Gap, when halfe your Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots would submit to an Alteration, if it brought any satisfaction to their worldly Ambition. But you say the Queene is of that Religion, and She hath a great interest and power over his Affections, and you think it an un-Kingly thing to be a good Husband; and whilst your selves are guided and swayed by other mens Wives, (for 'tis not Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men you are angry with, you allow them whole sharers with you in your mischiefes) you cannot endure He should so much as advise with His own; indeed I cannot blame you to desire to keep Him from any conversation with one you have used so ill. But how comes this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly upon you now? Is She more a Catholique now then She was fifteen yeares since? Why did not these Feares and Iealousies break out into Rebellion when he was first married? before the Nation knew any thing of Her, but Her Religion? After the experience of so many yeares; after the enriching the Kingdome with so hopefull and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous an Issue; after the obliging all sorts of people with Her favours, without dis-obliging any body that I have heard of; after fifteene yeares living here with great expressions of Love and Affection to the English Nation, without any other activity in Religion, then to live well, and wish well to Her owne, with equall esteeme of those who are not of the same Profession, to desire to break and interrupt that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Harmony in Affections, is an ingratitude, an impiety worthy the contrivers of these bloody distempers: Looke into the Persons who have received the greatest testimony and evidences of Her favours, you will not find them to be Popish or Popishly affected, but in the list of your own Religious Men and godly Women; If you will convert Her, Let your Charity and Humility, the Principles of true Religion, let your Obedience and Loyalty, the effects of true Religion, be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to Her that yours is the right; the course you take, will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fright good people from any, then invite them to yours: She is a Lady too well understands Her owne share, and Her owne adventure in the publique distractions, not to endeavour with Her soule a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation

            <p>But oh, the great Army of Papists! if that were disbanded your feares and iealousies would infinitely abate: that's well; pray observe how these Papists come together. Remember <hi>Nottingham</hi> when you had a formed Army of 10000. men, and His Maiesty not 800. Muskets at his Command in all His Dominions? If you had then fallen upon Him and destroyed Him (as if Your Pride had not been greater then your Loyalty you had done; you meant to strip Him by Votes and Ordinances of all Succours and assistance, that He should be compelled to put himselfe into your hands for Protection, and so confesse your Army to be raised for his defence.) Wou d not now all Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have thought His Maiesty guilty of His owne undoing, who would not suffer Himselfe to receive Ayd from any of his owne Subiects, though they were Papists? You tell me the Author of those Queries is learned in the Lawes pray get him to shew you one Law, whereby the Papists are inhibited to serve their Soveraign against a Rebellion; because Papists may not come neere the Court without the Kings leave, or weare Armes, may not a Papist ride post to tell the King of a Designe to murther Him? or being present, take away a sword from that man who atempts to kill Him? Sure there is no law hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the Allegiance of the Papists, and because they will not come to Church, forbid them to be Subiects. If a Fleet arived from France or Spaine to invade us, were it not lawfull for a Papist to endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy that Fleet? and must he sit still in a Rebellion, and see his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and the Lawes of the Land (in which he hath an equall interest with any other Subiect) in imminent visible danger to be destroyed, and must not assist either? Yet observe now (how much soever you seeme to be scandalized at it) what you your selves have done towards the raising this Army of Papists, and indeed if there be such an Army, whether your selves have not raised it (without breaking your owne Iest, and saying 'tis raised by the power of both Houses, as yours is by the Kings Authority) you seize upon all the Papists estates, plunder
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96559:7"/>
their Houses, imprison their persons, without the least colour of Law, leaving them no place to breath in but under shelter of the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and thence you would have the King drive them to, for being Papists.</p>
            <p>You suffer Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> to raise a Troop of that Religion for your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and when they cashiere their Captain, and come in to his Maiestie, you would have him disband them because they are Papists. For Gods sake get one one of your Orators to make a Speech for the King to a Papist, who shall say to him; Sir, I have lived modestly and dutifully at my owne house without assuming to my selfe any Licence which the Law gave me not; I have humbly submitted to the penalties imposed on me, and contented my selfe with what the Law hath left me, I am driven from thence by force of Armes, my Estate taken from me my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty endeavored to be so to, I am your Subiect you are my King vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe me the Protection you owe me. What answer shall he make: Sir, you are a Papist, and you shall not come neere me; or Sir I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you shall be under the shelter and security of my Forces, but upon your life use no weapon bear no Arms, help them not though they are in danger to be cut in pieces before your face. Let a sober man find a way to get out here, to be a King and not protect them. And after all this what a goodly Army of Papists hath his Maiestie got together? not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with you, for you say 'tis no matter what number of Papists you have, because there are no feares and iealousies of your favouring of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I am confident, and I have my Information from no ill hands, that in all his Maiesties Armies the Papists cannot make one good Regiment. Get but the honest sober true Protestants once of your mind, and my life upon it, you shall not see the Papists grow above the reach of the Law.</p>
            <p>Here is an end of your Author a word now to your owne Letter I find you much transported with the apprehension of Gods wonderfull Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings upon the proceedings of both Houses, that their progresse and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse hitherto hath not beene lesse then miraculous; Indeed there are negative Miracles, as well as affirmative for God to forbeare what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Iustice and goodnesse, and other attributes We might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him by the way of punishment &amp; revenge, is a miracle of his mercy in this sence, the world which hath seene your Treason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion your Acts of Iniustice, Cruelty and Inhumanity, your Lying and Blasphemy, your profannesse and Sacriledge (if your Divines have

Are you not shrunke from the honour and reverence due to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> to the Imputation of a vile crowd of meane, guilty seditious persons? Doe not your friends e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day forsake you, and those persons of quality whom you mislead, with more bitternes fall from you, then your first Delinquents? Are not your own Weapons turned upon you, and are not you afraid of those Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, whom with so much skill and Industry you taught to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is not your owne Army, raised and maintained by your selves, growne so undevoted to you, that some Commanders every day leave you, and others are committed by you for feare they will do so too? Are you not brought to that strait as to feare a Mutiny for want of pay, and not to dare to pay for feare of a Disbanding? Have you not by blood and Rapine, with the curses of all good men gotten the treasure of the Kingdome into your hands, and wasted it so that your wants are as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious as your Crimes? Lastly, are you not so iealous, so divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst your selves, that if your Army prevailed to morrow, you were as far from compassing your own ends, as when you began your despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate undertaking; your principall Commanders being as far from their ends who conzened them into this Rebellion, as the prime Cavaliers in the Kings Army, excepting only their affection to the Kings Person.—</p>
            <p>There is the Miracle on your parts; see now what God hath done for his Anointed? Call back your memory to the 10. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> look upon Him driven furiously from <hi>Whit-hall,</hi> with his Wife and Children, for feare of His life, whilest His owne Servants for their security durst not be neere him; looke upon him at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, scornfully accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of levying Warre against himselfe, and the Sheriffes and Constables appointed to disperse his Army; Remember Him at <hi>Windsor</hi> without

Beleeve it Sir, His Maiesty hath not so great a Iourney to the conquest of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as he had from <hi>Nottingham</hi> to <hi>Brainceford.</hi> If you cannot suddenly find how this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was raised, enquire how it hath been kept together; a fit of Loyalty and Affection, a litle dislike and indignation to see a good King ill used, might procure a present supply, but that this Army raised without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and Armed without weapons, should live and grow six moneths together, that no Souldiers should starve for want of Meat, or murmur for want of pay, that the King should have a Magazine, and you want Armes that the King should pay his Souldiers, and you have no Mony, is such an instance of the power and presence of the Almighty that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such Argument were currant with you, your principall Members would no longer have tempted God in this Kingdome but have sought him in a strange Land. Improve all these instances by your own obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and tell me sadly on whose side the Miracles have appeared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:96559:8"/>You would know my opinion what the Burgesse of <hi>D.</hi> should doe, and you tell me, his Honour will not suffer him too apparantly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from those with whom he hath kept so much company. I know not what Counsell to give you upon that principle, If his Honour and his Innocence have not a care of each other, neither can be safe; Me thinks the King himself hath given you a rare pattern of Modesty in that point; he did not satisfy himself with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>senting to new laws, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged passed errors. Reparation is as soveraign a thing as bounty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be this Ingenuity, Reformation can never be perfect; you say he doubts what he hath done formerly will be more remembred then what he hath since done or shall doe for the future; Hee is too blame, He hath not a generous nor a Christian mind, who thinks ill services may not bee throughly repaired by future duty. I am so farre from that opinion as though his mistakes have been of as ill consequence to the publike as most mens, I beleeve he hath so good an opportunity by some eminent service to repaire himselfe, that he may even lay an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Gratitude upon the King, not only to forgive but reward his Affection. There is no such way to have what he now does, not valued as by Iustifiing what he hath done so contrary to this; 'tis no scandall to be deceived, lesse to confesse he was so. Let him take the same pain to oppose and suppresse unreasonable Persons as he doth to perswade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to consent to what himselfe thinks unreasonable, and the worke is done. As he hath a taske to doe somewhat that is noble, so he hath a faire game before him having done it.</p>
            <p>I know nothing of yours unanswered, you must give me leave here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after not to beleive you, if you stumble any more at these strawes rather consider what he is to answere to God, the King, his Country and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, that sits Idle without resisting the violence and indignity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to all foure, that is content to see this pretious game of Religion, Liberty and Honour played at other mens Charges, and possibly in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being lost for want of his assistance; Consider whether you and the rest who first excercised the <hi>Militia</hi> in <hi>Gloucester-shire,</hi> &amp; so discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Government, and first taught the People a new obedience, have not to Answere for all the miseries, and pressures which have since befallen that poore Country. Let those who have contributed to the raising and maintaining of that Rebellious Army, think sadly, whether they are not guilty of all the blood-shed on either side, &amp; in this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that vertuous Lord, (who had long since been starved but for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96559:9"/>
Kings meat, and bin naked, but for His clothes) may find himselfe guilty of the murther of his Father; Remember the blessed condition we were in 18, Moneths since and be proud if you can of the State you have now brought us to Think of the firm stable happines our Auncestors enjoyed, and resolve there cannot be security but by the same Rule. 'Tis not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Arms makes a Peace, but such a Vnion of affections, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party unpleasantly remembers the way to it. If King or People be enforced to give away that which properly belongs to them, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce rather rest then peace, and the memory therof will be so grievous to the loser, that perpetuall Iealousies and discontents will be between them: Insist upon your Rights; let all doubts which may concern Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Libertie and Propertie be cleared and secured; let <hi>Parliaments</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their good old Priviledges, these are all our Birthrights, and hath bin that which hath made the happines and freedom of the English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion loved and envied through Christendome; We will not part with a tittle of them, but when they shall be in danger, will ioyne with you in their defence. But let us rest here, press not the King to part with what properly helongs to Him, 'tis our right to see that He enioyes His; the houre that he growes lesse a King, we have lost a part of our freedome: if the power of Subiects be once inlarged, we are losers by it, and affect an Authority will destroy us. Do not think the Kings love of Peace can invite Him to part with the benefits of Peace; what would the World think of him, if after the taking up Arms for the defence of his own, he should upon condition he might lay them down againe, part with that for the maintenance of which he took them up? Would he not iustifie what hath bin done against him, if he yeelded that now, which if he had 8. months since all this confusion they will say might have bin preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and will he not leave an excellent Encouragement to Posterity to tread in their Fathers steps, and to follow the example of their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wickednesse?</p>
            <p>Doe not think a Iewell plucked out of the Royall Diadem can keep its brightnesse and lustre in any other place; 'tis a losse to the Nation which cannot be repaired by an access of Power to private hands. If this be Reason; Let not the folly and madnesse of other people make you quit it: Warre it selfe is not halfe so grievous, as the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of these men who would have you resigne your understanding to their fury and madnesse.
