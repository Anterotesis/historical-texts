            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi>
hiſtories, that
<hi>Mithridates</hi> a Pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante
king of <hi>Pontus</hi>
&amp; <hi>Bithinia,</hi> for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Romaines</hi>
in <hi>Aſia</hi> to bee ſlaine,
and the <hi>Proconſul
Oppius</hi> to bee caſt in
priſon, was aſſaulted by <hi>Silla,</hi> diſcomfited by
<hi>Lucullus,</hi> and laſtly vtterly vanquiſhed by
<hi>Pompey</hi> the great: and when this valiaunte
king perceiued himſelfe to be ouercome, and
that he was to be taken of his enemies: firſt
he deſtroyde his wyfe &amp; daughters with poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and then tooke the ſame poyſon, deſiring
rather ſo to dye, then as a captiue to fal into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
hands of his enemyes: But hauing dronken
much of the poyſon, could not dye therewith,
and then cauſed his ſeruant <hi>Biſtocus</hi> a french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(as it is written) to kill him with a
ſword. Such was the magnanimity of this
mighty king to eſcape the hands of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi>
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might not bee caried to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8698:3"/>
and in captiue maner be ſhewed in triumph.
For this noble king was not only valiante in
warre, but alſo in phiſicall matters very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,
had the knowledg of many hearbes, and
making tryall of ſundry ſimples that doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
poyſon in men condemned to dye, as <hi>Galen</hi>
writeth in his firſt booke <hi>de Antidotis,</hi> and
finding ſome to remedy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poyſon of Spiders,
ſome of Scorpions, ſome to doe good againſt
the byting of Vipers, others of mad Dogs,
many to remedy the poiſon of hearbes, and ſo
ſundry others to help the venime of ſundry
poiſons: he endeuoured to make a mixture
of diuerſe ſimples, hoping thereby to haue a
ready remedy againſt all kindes of poiſon, &amp;
the ſame was termed after his name <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datium:</hi>
wherein he was nothing deceiued.
For this noble king in his life time vſed much
and often y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medicine. And (as it is written) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſubdued by the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and making
choiſe rather to dye then to be led captiue to
<hi>Rome,</hi> attempting to kill him ſelfe with poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and taking of it great quantity, tooke no
harme thereof, for that his body (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſaith) by vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medicine altered, &amp; reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
the action of the poiſon. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his wife and two daughters dyed before
his face wich the ſame poiſon. Since that
<pb facs="tcp:8698:3"/>
time, the efficacy and ſtrength of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medicine,
hath in all ages (euen vnto theſe our dayes)
bene confirmed. For after that <hi>Pompey</hi> the
great had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered this valiante king, ſearch
made in his Cloſets, amongſt ſundry Iuels,
many ſecret medicines to expell diuerſe poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and to cure other internall diſeaſes,
were founde: where alſo was the deſcription
of this medicine. And albeit <hi>Pompey,</hi> as a
martiall man, had greateſt care of other
matters, yet aduertiſed what goodnes might
come by ſuch ſecret medicines, commaunded
one <hi>Pompeius Lineus</hi> his libertine, well
ſeene in ſciences, to conuert all thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
written in the <hi>Pontike</hi> tongue, into la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.
And it doth appeare by the hiſtory, that
many volumes of phiſicall maters were there
founde, which peruſed and conſidered of by
<hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> in thoſe dayes a famous phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Rome,</hi> were by him commended, and at
his petition tranſlated into latine, whereof
<hi>Pliny</hi> writeth in his 25. booke. Of ſo many
excellent medicines left by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> none
was ſo highly eſteemed, &amp; ſo well accompted
of in all reſpectes, as that termed <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datium:</hi>
whoſe excellent vertues againſt poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
were firſt approued in <hi>Mithridates</hi> owne
body, and after confirmed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Romaines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8698:4"/>
In trueth a man may iuſtly blame the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryographers,
which in deſcribing the noble
actes of <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, doe ſo ſlenderly
paſſe ouer this his facte, in tranſlating of this
medicine experienced of this noble king. For
in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t things iuſtly weighed, none
of all <hi>Pompeyes</hi> valiante feates of armes, no
not the royall triumph made at <hi>Rome</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the victory in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quering king <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
hath ſo largely aduaunced his name,
as the making knowen to the world of this
medicine. For the profit of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> victory came on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the triumph and praiſe for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſame done at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time in <hi>Rome:</hi> But the profit
of this medicine hath bene by his meanes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation
and praiſe for the ſame, is iuſtly to be yeelded
from all the world in all ages and times: So
that as all the world is greater then <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;
all times more then one age, ſo doubtleſſe
more renowne is due vnto <hi>Pompey</hi> for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulging
of this medicine, then by the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this king, or by the triumph for the
ſame. Although in the Emperoure <hi>Nero</hi> his
time, ſucceeded a learned phiſition called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachus,</hi>
who to the imitation of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
compounded an other, adding to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of <hi>Mithridatium</hi> the fleſh of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<pb facs="tcp:8698:4"/>
and ſome other ſimples, which medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
he called <hi>Theriaca,</hi> of the Greeke worde
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which doth ſignifie a wilde and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
beaſt, whereof the Viper is one. Yet
this ought not to imbaſe any praiſe due to
<hi>Mithridates</hi> for compounding of <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</hi>
For all men doe know that it is eaſier
to adde to a thing done, then to finde out the
ſame, and greateſt praiſe is to be geuen to the
firſt inuentor. So that the diſhonour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came
to <hi>Mithridates</hi> by <hi>Pompey</hi> his victory was
not ſo great, as the praiſe and commendation
for the inuenting and compounding of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium.</hi>
And his calamity to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
is greatly eaſied, his ignomy to be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered after a ſorte aduaunced, that by the
ſame this medicine was diuulged, which
happely would not haue bene performed, at
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt ſo generally, had he dyed otherwayes,
and not bene by <hi>Pompey</hi> ouercommed. For
had not <hi>Mithridates</hi> in him felfe approoued
the excellency of the medicine, purpoſing to
haue killed him ſelfe rather then to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the handes of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> ſurely the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vertues of the medicine would not ſo
well haue bene belieued. And had not this
king in that his miſerable eſtate made triall
in his owne body, who would haue belieued
<pb facs="tcp:8698:5"/>
that a mans body might by any meanes be
brought ſo ſtrongly to reſiſt poiſon? Who but
one in ſo deſperate a caſe, would attempt to
take ſtrong poiſon vpon the credit of any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine?
Great good therefore to the whole
world this ouerthrowe of <hi>Mithridates</hi> did
breede: And great renoume thereby came,
not to the conqueroure onely, but to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered:
to the one for inuenting, to the other
for diuulging of ſo great a medicine, which
for theſe two thouſand yeares hath bene of all
men in all ages had in great eſtimation, not
in <hi>Pontus</hi> onely &amp; <hi>Bithinia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Greece</hi> adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the ſame, but in all other nations and
countryes where any learning is, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by all writers, <hi>Grecians, Arabians,</hi> and
<hi>Latiniſts.</hi> And what greater aſſurance can
there be of the notable vertues of this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
then the confirmation of the ſame from
<hi>Mithridates</hi> to this our time, then that all
phiſitions of the world in all ages, times, and
places, in <hi>Greece,</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> in <hi>Italia,</hi> in all
partes of <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spayn,</hi> in
<hi>Portingal,</hi> in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in
<hi>Scotland, Moſcouia, Tartaria, Sueuia,</hi> yee
in all partes of <hi>Aſia, Aphrica,</hi> and <hi>Europa,</hi>
euen amongeſt the ſaluage and barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
hath and doth greatly eſteeme of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8698:5"/>
and ſo of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> and ſeeke
and prouide for them to ſerue their countryes

rulers, hath &amp; doth take order for the well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
of theſe medicines. Doubtles had
not experience confirmed their excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyties,
the eſtimation would not haue ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares continued: but longe before this
our age, would haue bene diminiſhed, and by
this time come to nothing. Great therefore
are theſe medicines, and in a heigh degree to
be eſteemed. And albeit great prayſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
is due to both medicines (I meane
<hi>Mithridatium</hi> and <hi>Theriacle)</hi> yet greateſt
praiſe is to be geuen to <hi>Mithridatium.</hi> Firſt
becauſe of his antiquytie, which was of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
inuented, &amp; approued many yeares
before <hi>Theriacle</hi> was compounded. For long

chaunged ſome of the ſimples,

and leauing out ſome ſimples vſed of <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>

to make an other medicine in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
more perfite, in which no want might
be found, and ſo he addreſſed the ſame, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it <hi>Theriaca.</hi> Whereby no doubt ſome
good time after, <hi>Mithridatium</hi> was leſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed,
and the credit thereof much imbaſed,
vntill time by longe experience had ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared, wherein <hi>Theriacle</hi> doth excell
<hi>Mithridatium,</hi> and in what poynts <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
is not onely not inferiour to <hi>Theriacle,</hi>
but of more efficacy then it.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Galen</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>de Antidot.</hi>
writeth. <hi>Becauſe of the fleſh of Vipers in <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacle,</hi>
it is much better in the byting of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
then <hi>Mithridatium.</hi> But in all other effects,
<hi>Theriacle</hi> can not onely not doe more then <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium,</hi>
but is inferiour.</hi> The ſame <hi>Galen</hi>
in 2. <hi>de Antidot.</hi> writeth in like ſorte. <hi>We will
begin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the deſcription of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium,</hi>
for it is ſtronger againſt many poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:8698:6"/>
then <hi>Theriacle,</hi> though this be better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the byting of the Viper.</hi> Whereby we
may gather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where <hi>Andromachus</hi> endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to make a more perfit medicine, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
lefte of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> did in ſome part accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
his purpoſe, leauing a medicine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the other in one particular thing, but not
of like efficacy generally. It happened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this caſe (if a man may compare na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
actions to arte) as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> framing of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who doth in all actions exceede all creatures,
yet not ſo generally, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſome one action
ſome one beaſt doth excel man, as we reade y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the <hi>Aegle</hi> hath perfiter ſighte then man, the
Dogge doth paſſe man in ſmelling, the Ape
in agility, the Tiger in ſwiftneſſe. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
will with reaſon conferre all actions,
he ſhall find in all together, that man paſſeth
all creatures, for ſuch is his conſtitution and
temperature, that moe and perfiter actions
doe proceede from man the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any one creature.
So it came to paſſe, that <hi>Andromachus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoring
to make a medicine of greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
then <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> obtayned that in
one thing his medicine excelled, but in many
other was inferiour to <hi>Mithridatium.</hi> For a
man may gather the vertues of theſe two me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
at large diſplaied in <hi>Galens</hi> workes,
<pb facs="tcp:8698:7"/>
into three orders. Firſt that they are good
againſt the byting and ſtinging of venemous
beaſtes, be they Serpentes, Scorpions, mad
Dogges, or others. Secondly they ſerue to
cure all kinde of poyſons taken into the body.
Thirdly to remedy other inwarde diſeaſes.
Now it is certaine, and long experience hath
confirmed, that both theſe medicines haue
ſtrong and mighty vertues to remedy al three
kindes of effectes: yet no doubt one of them
is in ſome effectes of more power then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As <hi>Galen</hi> writeth that <hi>Theriacle</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
byting of Vipers, is ſtronger then <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium:</hi>
In other it doth exceede <hi>Theriacle.</hi>
So we may iuſtly conclude with <hi>Galen,</hi> that
againſt the byting &amp; ſtinging of beaſtes, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacle</hi>
hath more force: But for inward poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
&amp; inward diſeaſes, truly <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
is of more might. Wherefore albeit both me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
are noble, &amp; greatly to be deſired, yet
<hi>Mithridatium</hi> is to be accompted of greater
price, as hauing more generally ſtronger ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and ſeruing to moe purpoſes.</p>
            <p>And it may be obiected, that in <hi>Theriacle</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
by <hi>Andromachus</hi> are many ſimples ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which haue great vertue againſt diuerſe
kindes of poyſons, and happely are therein of
more efficacy, then thoſe in <hi>Mithridatium,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8698:7"/>
left out by <hi>Andromachus</hi> in his <hi>Theriacle.</hi>
Whereby it may be coniectured, that <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>
making choyſe of the ſimples, ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſuch as were of greateſt force to remedy
poiſons, &amp; omitted the weaker, adding in their
place, ſome other of more ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth: ſo it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Theriacle</hi> ſo compiled, is of greater
myght in all kinde of poyſons. But <hi>Galen</hi> in
his workes declareth, that experience in his
time did ſhewe the contrary, and reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
the ſame. For let the ſimples in <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacle</hi>
be in number moe, and in qualytie of
greater efficacy, yet it muſt be remembred,
that it is certayn, that when in compoſitions
ſome one ſimple is ſet as the baſe and ground
of that medicine, that that ſimple doth drawe
the force and ſtrength of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
and action, and ſo euery ſuch compound
is ſpecially good in that one thinge for which
it was deuiſed. Now when <hi>Andromachus</hi>
did make the fleſh of vipers as the baſe and
grounde of his <hi>Theriacle,</hi> it foloweth that the
ſame doth drawe to it the qualities and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of all the ſimples in <hi>Theriacle:</hi> ſo it doth
come to paſſe, that <hi>Theriacle</hi> is far better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> againſt the bytinge of vipers
and ſuch venemous beaſts. And for that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſimples in it, are caried by the fleſh of the
<pb facs="tcp:8698:8"/>
vipers, to exercyſe their force ſtrongly therin,
they haue the leſſe power to remedy other poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
When no ſuch thinge was intended in
the compoſition of <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable
to reaſon that the ſimples in it eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one retayneth his owne power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and ſo one ſuch quality or forme doth
reſulte by the myxture, of great ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all poyſons. Moreouer it is certayne
that in the compoſition of <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> are
fewer ſimples in number then are in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> then it followeth that
when like quantity of both is taken, as for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample,
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j,</hi> ſurely a greater portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery
one ſimple is taken in <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> and
leſſer in <hi>Theriacle,</hi> the leſſer quantity muſt
needes haue leſſer ſtrength in remedyinge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poyſons, ſaue that, to the which the baſe
or grounde doth call them. So it remayneth
fyrme that <hi>Galen</hi> writeth, as obſerued in his
time, that <hi>Theriacle</hi> is in deede better then
<hi>Mithridatium</hi> in bytinge of vypers and like
beaſtes, and that <hi>Mithridatium</hi> exceadeth
th'other in remedying all other poiſons taken
into the body and inward diſeaſes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this our countrey where no ſuch perill
and danger is of vipers, <hi>Mithridatium</hi> by
good reaſon ought to be reputed of greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtunation
then <hi>Theriacle.</hi>

that they do not in one ſorte deſcribe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
of the ſame. But almoſt euery authore
hath a ſeuerall deſcription, differinge in the
number of the ſimples, and alſo in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and quantities. In time paſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
in making of <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> folowed
moſt the deſcription of <hi>Nicolaus Praepoſitus,</hi>
of <hi>Auicenna,</hi> and of <hi>Nicolaus Mirepſicus,</hi>
ſome of <hi>Aetius,</hi> ſome of <hi>Paulus.</hi> The former
deſcriptions contayninge aboue one hundred
ſimples, were long and laborious, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
many ſupplyes, for ſimples vnknowen.
Wherefore in theſe our later daies, in which
learned men haue examined euery thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly,
the moſt part haue commended one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
three compoſitions expreſſed by <hi>Galen</hi> in 2. <hi>de
Antid.</hi> of the which, two were taken (as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
wryteth) out of the bookes of <hi>Androma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
The firſt found without name is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb facs="tcp:8698:9"/>
to <hi>Andromachus,</hi> as compounded by
him, of others ſuppoſed the very ſame, which
was found in the cloſets of kinge <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
&amp; after tranſcribed in the workes of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachus.</hi>
The ſecond deſcription is alſo
recyted out of <hi>Andromachus</hi> bookes, vnder
the names of <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Cleophantes.</hi>
The thyrd is referred to <hi>Damocrates:</hi> It doth
not appeare by any thing written by <hi>Galen,</hi>
which of theſe three compoſitions is beſt to be
folowed. And ſo of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> learned men of our time,
ſome hath vſed the one, and ſome the other.
Many doe beſt like of the firſt deſcription at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to <hi>Andromachus,</hi> both for that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachus</hi>
by the opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> and of all
other auncient wryters, was adiudged very
ſkilfull in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounding of medicines, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
did farre excell all phiſitions of his time,
and alſo becauſe it may bee iuſtly gathered,
that that deſcription is the very ſame, which
<hi>Mithridates</hi> vſed. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Andromachus</hi>
was phiſition to <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour of
<hi>Rome,</hi> it appeareth that he obtayned to ſee
and to conſider, of all the bookes which
found in <hi>Mithridates</hi> cloſet, were tranſlated
into latine by <hi>Lineus</hi> the grammarian, and
brought to <hi>Rome.</hi> And it is not agreable to
reaſon, that <hi>Andromachus</hi> ſtudying to make
<pb facs="tcp:8698:9"/>
a more perfit medicine then that which came
vnder the name of <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> woulde
alſo inuent an other vnder the ſame name.
But it is very probable that <hi>Andromachus</hi>
with diligence peruſinge the recept of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium,</hi>
vſed of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> would leaue
it in ſuch forme as <hi>Mithridates</hi> compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
it, and deuiſe an other by the ſame, which hee
meant to make more perfite. <hi>Andromachus</hi>
therefore not alteringe the deſcription of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium,</hi>
but leauing it in the ſame forme
as it was founde, confected an other, which he
called <hi>Theriaca.</hi> And where we doe reade in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
2. <hi>de Antid.</hi> of <hi>Galen,</hi> an other recept ſet
downe vnder the name of <hi>Theriaca Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datis,</hi>

                  <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
which was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the cloſet of that king. For
all writers doe confeſſe, that <hi>Andromachus</hi>
long after added to that recept of <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
the fleſh of vipers: ſo that <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
compounded by <hi>Mithridates</hi> had not in it the
fleſh of vipers, and that <hi>Theriacle</hi> which <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>

                  </gap>
finde it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimples not much differing from
<hi>Theriaca Andromachi,</hi> and many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
twyſe in diuers clauſes doth argue an
imperfection: that <hi>Galen</hi> may be thought in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

hee affirmeth it to be the ſame which <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
vſed, being in deede farre different
from that medicine. Wherefore we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
conclude, that the firſt recept tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by <hi>Galen</hi> in 2. <hi>de Antid.</hi> out of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachus</hi>
workes, is in truth the ſelfe ſame
that <hi>Mithridates</hi> vſed, and in mine opinion,
in that reſpect the better to be liked, and the
rather to be followed. For what better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
can we haue of the true and perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of this medicine, then that which was
deliuered by <hi>Mithridates?</hi> and what deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
can more aſſure vs of the effects of this
medicine, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> compoſition which <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
followed, who firſt gaue ſo notable
proofe of the medicine, and thereby the firſt
credite to the ſame? So that if by diſcourſe of
reaſon it may be proued, that an other deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
is more artificiall and more agreable
to the rules of confection of medicines: yet in
mine opinion this deſcription, being the ſame
that <hi>Mithridates</hi> vſed, ſet downe happely by
<pb facs="tcp:8698:10"/>
the king, more according to experience then
art, is rather to be folowed then any other,
thought more cunningly addreſſed. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it is not to be deemed that kinge <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
was altogether vnſkylfull, when
many volumes concerning phiſike were found
in his cloſet, &amp; tranſlated into latine, brought
to <hi>Rome.</hi> And it appeareth that he taking
delight in medicinall matters, had about him
dyuerſe phiſitions, who mighte artificially
diſpence the ſimples in <hi>Mithridatium.</hi> And
<hi>Galen</hi> in the ſayd booke <hi>de Antid.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
the diſcription of <hi>Mithridatium</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to <hi>Andromachus:</hi> whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that this deſcription of <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
is not addreſſed altogether without arte. For
which cauſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> learned of our time, haue great
reaſon to preferre that deſcription of <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datium</hi>
before others. Albeit ſome do more
eſteeme the compoſition of <hi>Damocrates,</hi> as
with more arte and more cunning diſpenſed.
Notwithſtanding becauſe it is very likely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the precept attributed to <hi>Andromachus,</hi> as
found in his bookes, is the ſelfe ſame that
<hi>Mithridates</hi> vſed, and hath of many, in this
our countrey, of late yeares bene folowed: I
thought beſt in this place to expreſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame,
as I doe finde it in <hi>Galen,</hi> in 2. <hi>de Antid.</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:8698:11"/>
is in many antidotary bookes allowed, which
is as foloweth.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
and taken for a truth,
that medicines compounded
haue their vertues, and doe
their effectes according to the
nature of the ſimples whereof
they are compounded. So it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
that <hi>Mithridatium</hi> compounded of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſimples, hath diuers &amp; ſundry properties, &amp;
thoſe agreable to the ingredience. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in <hi>Mithridatium</hi> are ſimples differing in
quality, ſome hauing power to heate, ſome
other to coole, yet the greateſt number are in
quality whot and dry. And albeit theſe being
contrary, and repugnant, do make alteration
the one with the other: notwithſtanding it
muſt needes follow, that thoſe reactions not
being infinite, at the laſt one forme and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
muſt reſult in the compound, agreable to
the natures of thoſe ſimples, which doe beare
and cary dominion. Now whereas in <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>atium</hi>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt ſimples haue quality to heate
and dry: it followeth that <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
hath a whot and dryinge power. And as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
muſt haue a time of fermentation, and
rypening (for the reactions of the ſimples are
not perfited in a moment) So the quality or
forme which doth aryſe by the workinge of
<pb facs="tcp:8698:13"/>
one ſimple with an other, hath not his perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
preſently after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mixture, but a certayne
ſpace of time muſt be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before we can iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expect the true action of the medicine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
as proceeding from the forme of the
medicine, which doth reſulte by fermentation
of the working of the ſimples in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> compound.
So that before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> due time, we may not loke for
the vertues aunſwerable to the compoſition,
but that ſome one ſimple aboue the reſt may
ſhew his quality, that the compound medicine
may do an effect aunſwerable to that ſimple,
and not as proceeding from the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In which reſpect, <hi>Galen</hi> wryteth that
<hi>Theriacle</hi> newly made, doth greately prouoke
ſleepe, by reaſon that <hi>Opium</hi> (that is the ioyce
of <hi>Poppy</hi> prepared) myngled in it, being of
greater force then other ſimples, before fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
doth exerciſe his quality more then
the reſt: and after that his quality is by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
with other ſimples broken, he can
not ſo ſtrongly do his operation. So <hi>Theriacle</hi>
after the iuſt time of fermentation doth not ſo
mightely prouoke ſleepe, as newe <hi>Theriacle</hi>
doth. The ſame is obſerued in <hi>Mithridati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
and all other compounds, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after myxture, the qualities of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are ſtrongeſt, and ſhewe their powers
<pb facs="tcp:8698:14"/>
beſt. But certaine it is, that after due time of
working, when the compound is fully rype, no
one ſimple doth worke in it according to his
owne nature, but by the reactions one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
nature doth reſult, which cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to any one or moe ſimples, but may
be truely ſayd a common nature aryſinge out
of all the ingredience, and from that forme the
actions of the compound do proceede. Which
forme is to vs not certainely knowen, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effects
are beſt learned by experience. Wherfore it is
very wyſely wrytten of <hi>Ioannes de ſancto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando</hi>
in his expoſition vpon the antitodary of
<hi>Nicolaus,</hi> that it is better alwaye to vſe a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
compound exerciſed, then one lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
whereof we haue no experience. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we may by diſcourſe of reaſon gather
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> compound, as <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> is whot,
and dry, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimples wherof it is made,
are the moſt part whot and dry, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
doth confirme this coniecture: yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
qualities of <hi>Mithridatium</hi> and of other
compounds are not ſo eaſely knowen by any
diſcourſe or method, but chiefly learned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon forme from whence
many ſecrete vertues doe procede, is not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
by any learning or methode. So it muſt
needes follow, that the actions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame forme
<pb facs="tcp:8698:14"/>
are not learned by methode or doctrine, but
chiefly by experience. In which reſpect alſo,
we haue reaſon to retaine the deſcription deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

for that in <hi>Theriacle</hi> a greater quantity of
<hi>Opium</hi> (that is the ioyce of <hi>Poppy</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
is, then in <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> whoſe cooling
power doth much abate the heating qualities
of other medicines. This argument in theſe
<pb facs="tcp:8698:15"/>
two medicines newly made, before ferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is perfite, may take place. For then in deede
euery ſimple retayning his owne vertue, <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
may remitte the whot qualities of the reſt:
at what time neither of theſe medicines is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to be vſed, but for ſome ſpeciall point,
as <hi>Galen</hi> to prouoke ſleepe, doth counſell new
<hi>Theriacle.</hi> But after fermentation is perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
all the ſimples one altering the other, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one hath qualities ſo broken, that not one
retayneth his owne nature: then ſurely the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
forme reſulting, doth follow the ſimples
which doe beare dominion, and they in both
theſe medicines are whot and dry, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whot
and dry ſimples in <hi>Theriacle</hi> are moe in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and of greater force, then in <hi>Mithridali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi>
as may appeare to him that will compare
both confections. Whereby it followeth that
the common quality aryſinge in <hi>Theriacle,</hi>
doth heate more then that in <hi>Mithridatium.</hi>
Neyther the increaſe of <hi>Opium</hi> doth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
aunſwere the ſtrength of heating in it:
neither hath it any ſuch force ſo greately to
contemper the ſimples, as theſe men doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
For although <hi>Opium</hi> hath ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
aboue other medicines to induce ſleepe,
yet his cooling quality (of many writers) is not
accompted ſo great, for it hath ſo ſtrong bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
<pb facs="tcp:8698:15"/>
that many doe ſuppoſe that it hath a myxt
nature, conſiſting of many whot partes: if it
be true that <hi>Galen</hi> wryteth in his 5. booke of
ſimples, that all bitter thinges are whot, and
being certaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Opium</hi> doth ſtupefy, &amp; ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cauſe ſleepe, it is of ſome inferred y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
doth rather proceede of a property of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce,
then altogether depend of his cooling
quality. Wherefore it is not without reaſon
affyrmed by learned men wryting hereof, that
<hi>Mithridatium</hi> doth not ſo ſtrongly heate as
<hi>Theriacle:</hi> and experience doth alſo confirme
the ſame. For who ſo vſeth theſe medicines,
doubtles he ſhall finde that <hi>Theriacle</hi> rightly
compounded after <hi>Andromachus</hi> deſcription
(which is in all this treatiſe to be vnderſtood,
and is in theſe dayes of the Apothecaries moſt
commonly made, and ſo of the wyſer ſort in
moſt vulgare vſe) doth heate more then <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium,</hi>
which is confeſſed of the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
commenting vpon the antidotary of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus,</hi>
and in this our age of many learned
men affyrmed. For which cauſe, many in theſe

when neede requireth. In ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer time, &amp; whot
ſeaſons, very few and ſeldome <hi>Theriacle.</hi> And
<hi>Galen</hi> doth expreſly forbyd to gieue <hi>Theriacle</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:8698:16"/>
                  <hi>Mithridatium</hi> then of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> not onely in

ſome infection of <hi>Opium,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome effecte
declining to his nature, doth alſo proceede,
and the more, if that ſtupefying and dormitory
power in <hi>Opium,</hi> doth depend rather of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of ſubſtance, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of manifeſt cooling qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as ſome do argue. For the properties of
ſubſtance in medicines, haue not like alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by fermentation, as the manifeſt qualities
haue by reaction: we may therefore feare the
common and often vſe of <hi>Theriacle</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of <hi>Opium</hi> in it. For like reaſon, often vſe
of <hi>Theriacle</hi> may be ſuſpected, becauſe of the
fleſh of vipers added to it, as the baſe &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
of the medicine. For notwithſtanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great
care of the place, of the time, of the kinde ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
in taking and chooſing of the viper, the
diligence in preparing, the care of myxture
with other things, for the better correction of
the malignity of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſt, which hapely might
remaine in the fleſh: yet a man may doubt of
ſome errour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſo dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous a caſe.
<pb facs="tcp:8698:16"/>
And though all thinges therein bee ryghtely
done, yet ſome little quality of the nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
beaſt will remayne, that a man may ſuſpect
often to vſe the medicine. And where kinge
<hi>Mithridates</hi> was expert in phiſicall matters,
it is not to be adiudged but that he did aſwell
know the nature of the fleſh of vipers, as hee
knewe the venime of the beaſt: ſo it is very
likely that he purpoſing to compounde a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycine
to be often taken for his ſafty againſt
poiſon, did of purpoſe make it without the
fleſhe of vipers, knowing that if he ſhold haue
added that, he myght not with like ſafty haue
dayly vſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. And what learned men doe
ſo often in theſe dayes counſell <hi>Theriacle,</hi> as
do <hi>Mithridatium?</hi> and we doe in this our time
with leſſe danger and more ſecurity, for the
meaſels, the ſmale pockes, the wormes, and for
internal diſeaſes in children, geue <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
then <hi>Theriacle.</hi> We may therefore in

is a medicine more generally to be vſed,
&amp; may oftener and with more ſafty be geauen
then <hi>Theriacle.</hi>

before they be brought
to vſe: this place requireth that
we doe declare the tyme, when <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
is ſufficiently fermented and come to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<hi>Galen</hi> in his bookes <hi>de Theriaca</hi> doth
write exactly of the time of fermentation of
<hi>Theriacle,</hi> affirming that it is throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
in xii yeares, not denying but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath
concoction in ſhorter time, as in 5. and in 7.
yeares, ſo that we are to iudge that <hi>Theriacle</hi>
is not ſufficiently ripe to bee vſed before fiue
yeares, and in 7 yeares is better digeſted, &amp; in
xij yeares hath his full fermentation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

doe meaſure the concoction of <hi>Theriacle</hi> in
ſhorter time. For <hi>Aetius</hi> ſayth that <hi>Theriacle</hi>
is fermented in xij monethes, and that it may
be vſed after one moneth in ſome caſes, and ſo
affirmeth that it endureth to thirty yeares.
Where <hi>Paulus</hi> appointeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> age of <hi>Theriacle</hi>
to be twenty yeares, therein he doth not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
differ from <hi>Aetius:</hi> for hee making the
terme of <hi>Theriacle</hi> to be 30 yeares, doth alſo
ſay that then it is good in light diſeaſes. So
that by <hi>Aetius, Theriacle</hi> may be vſed after xij
<pb facs="tcp:8698:17"/>
monethes, and continueth in good perfection to
20. yeares, and after declineth, that at 30. yeares
it is aged, yet may it be vſed in deſeaſes which
are not very great. Our later writers doe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
better allowe of <hi>Aetius</hi> &amp; <hi>Paulus</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for the age of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> then of <hi>Galens:</hi>
and ſome ſuppoſe an errour or fault in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place
in <hi>Galen:</hi> and ſo they doe affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Theriacle</hi>
is fully concocted in the ſpace of xij monethes,
and then may bee ſold of the Apothecary: and
that the ſame being well kepte, will continue
in good ſtrength 20. yeares, and after doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
and waxe weaker, and yet may be vſed
when it is 30. yeares olde, but it is then as an
old man decayed, and weake of ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Mithridatium</hi> the former writers haue
ſet downe no time of concoction, leauing to a
wyſe man to determyne of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which is written
accordingly of <hi>Theriacle.</hi> For bycauſe theſe
two medicines are confected of many ſimples,
not greatly differring, they haue many things
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon: ſo as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one affirmed, may
bee applied to the other. Notwithſtanding as
in the number &amp; nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimples, they doe
not in all poynts agree: ſo no doubt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> age of
theſe medicines ſome difference is to be allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
yet ſuch, as a man exerciſed in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
may eaſely ſupplye. For in that <hi>Theria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8698:18"/>
hath in it the fleſh of vipers, and a greater
portion of <hi>Opium,</hi> then is in <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> it
is certaine that <hi>Theriacle</hi> requireth a longer
time to his concoction: for the fleſh of vipers
muſt haue perfect fermentation with the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for his correction. In like ſorte <hi>Opium</hi>
doth aſke a long time of fermentation, &amp; for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
cauſe <hi>Galen. 12. de Method. Medend.</hi> ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <hi>Philonium</hi> is not to bee vſed in a yeare after
it is compounded, and that the vſe of it after
ij. iij. or iiij. yeares, is more without daunger.
Whereby hee geueth vs to vnderſtande, that
medicines which doe receaue <hi>Opium,</hi> require
longe time of fermentation: ſo that <hi>Theria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
receauing a greater portion of <hi>Opium</hi>
then <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> ought to haue a larger
ſpace to be concocted, then it. Now if <hi>Theria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
hath his perfection in one yeare, ſurely
<hi>Mithridatium</hi> is throughly fermented in ſixe
monethes, and may be kept in good ſtrength,
not only as ſome haue writen to three, or fours
yeares, but to x or xij yeares: and except we
ſhall to ſuch time proroge his olde age, there
will be no proportion in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> times. For if <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacle</hi>
being cocted in one yeare, doth laſt to 20.
yeares before it doth waxe olde, ſuerly by the
lyke proportion, <hi>Mithridatium</hi> not well fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
vnder ſix monethes, may iuſtly be ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:8698:18"/>
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in good efficacy to 10. or 12. yeares.
And as <hi>Theriacle</hi> after 20. yeares waxeth old &amp;
feeble: ſo <hi>Mithridatium</hi> after 10. or 12. yeares
doth decline, that being 20. yeares old, is then
decayed and of litle force. As we may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
determine theſe times, ſo there can be no
certainty ſet to leade vs to the time. For if the
ſimples be not in good perfection, or the ſame
orderly and well according to art compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded,
or otherwayes the medicine not well kept:
then it will ſooner wax old, &amp; loſe his ſtrength.
But as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth, to theſe great medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
great care muſt be had of the choiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſimples, that they may be had in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> readieſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
And like dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce muſt be gieuen, that
the confectioner may in all pointes doe his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not in making only, but alſo in keeping y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
medicine. And therefore princes are greatly to
bee commended, which doe by theyr authority
prouide, that theſe medicines myght be well
ordered. And for that many doe in theſe dayes
procure <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> to haue it in their
houſes ready to vſe, it is good to know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is
beſt kept in veſſels of glaſſe, of ſiluer, and of
gold, and that it is not ſo good to keepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
in Tinne veſſels, for that they are often cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with ledde, and gather a ceruſe matter,
as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth in his firſt booke <hi>de Antid.</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:8698:19"/>
wiſh therefore that the marchaunts may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
be admoniſhed, which doe commonly bryng
<hi>Theriacle</hi> from <hi>Venice,</hi> in veſſels of ledde,
wherby no ſmall dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger may grow in ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

muſt not fill the veſſell to the toppe, as we ſay
brime full, but leaue ſome reaſonable ſpace,
for the medicine to worke, to exhale, &amp; breath:
and for that cauſe, <hi>Galen</hi> counſayleth to open

moſt thinges ſo concurre, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame which is

therefore in conſiſtence of ſubſtance, if <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datium</hi>
be well and artificially compounded,
it ought to haue an equality of ſubſtance, not
drie nor ouer liquide, and moyſte, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe

coherent, equall, and ſmooth. In ſmell
it muſt reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble the ſimples whereof it is made,
and yet not to offer to the noſe, the ſmell of any

               <p>In like ſort, the taſte muſt not expreſſe any one
ſimple, but be as a common ſapore, reſulting of

                  <pb facs="tcp:8698:20"/>
you may manifeſtly diſcerne or diſcry
any one ſimple in it, ſurely that <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
is not well confected. Therefore it may not
haue in it any exceſſe of vngratefull bitternes,
which doth ſometimes happen, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioner
doth either take hony ouerold, or
boyle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ouermuch. So it may not ſhew
to the taſte any ſowrenes, which happeneth if
the wyne vſed be not well choſen, or not well
handled in the compounding.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth that <hi>Andromachus</hi> in his <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacle</hi>
had a great care of the coloure of it, and
for that cauſe only (as ſome do write) did adde
vitreoll prepared, to yelde to it an exact black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
But <hi>Mithridates</hi> attending rather the
goodnes, then by coloure to pleaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eye, had
no ſuch care of the coloure, and ſo is thought
to put nothing into <hi>Mithridatium</hi> to gieue it
any freſher coloure then the ſimples woulde
yeelde. Notwithſtanding <hi>Mithridatium</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the ſimples, which ought to be a little rednes
declining to yealowneſſe, which coloure, after
due fermentation, doth appeare with ſome
freſhenes, &amp; by time in keeping, the ſame doth
decline to an obſcure darknes. Although at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

by theſe ſignes, yet after a man

is exerciſed in often vewing, taſting, and ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> his ſauoure, coloure, &amp;

               <p>For better certainty of the perfection and
goodneſſe of <hi>Theriacle, Galen</hi> doth mention
of certaine experiments to be made for triall
thereof: as to gieue the ſame to ſuch as haue
ben either hurt externally by ſome venimous
beaſte, or haue taken inwardly ſome poiſon.
Whereof princes haue made trial in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
perſons, caſting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vipers, or gieuing
vnto them ſome ſtrong poyſon, &amp; after cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them to take of <hi>Theriacle</hi> the quantity
of a nutte: and experience declared, that
ſuch as tooke <hi>Theriacle</hi> eſcaped the venime
of the poyſon, and they which tooke it not, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Which proofe experienced in <hi>Theriacle,</hi>
may alſo be applied to the triall of <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
and in that by all auncient writers <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium</hi>
is reputed of greater force then
<hi>Theriacle,</hi> in curing all poyſons inwardly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
<pb facs="tcp:8698:21"/>
It followeth, that if it be good and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made, it muſt remedy ſuch as haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
poiſon into the body. And becauſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
perſons haue not like oportunity to make this
experiment in men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, as princes haue:
therefore we may in other beaſts (as in dogs,
in cokes and hennes, being domeſticall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
experience the ſame, geuing to theſe
beaſts ſome poiſon, and after <hi>Mithridatium:</hi>
and if the beaſt doe take no harme by the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
we may be aſſured of the goodneſſe of the
medicine. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like is to be expected, if you
gieue the remedy before the poyſon be taken.
For the medicine doth not onely defend the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
from the venime of the poiſon, after it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
but alſo preſerue, if it be firſt vſed: as we
read of king <hi>Mithridates.</hi> In like maner <hi>Aeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
biddeth vs to gieue to a doue, to a henne, or
to a dogge, the quantity of two ſcruples of
<hi>Opium,</hi> and ſtraight after to miniſter to the
ſame, <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> diſſolued in ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quore,
and if it be good and pure, the beaſte
ſhall ſuſtaine no harme by the <hi>Opium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> deliuereth as a certaine ſigne of the
perfect goodnes of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> to gieue it to
one that hath taken a purgatiue medicine.
For (ſaith he) if it be perfect good, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
will not purge at all: if after the taking
<pb facs="tcp:8698:21"/>
of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medicine doth his operation, &amp;
purge neuertheleſſe: ſurely then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Theriacle</hi>
is vnperfect, &amp; not good. We do not read this
ſigne applied to <hi>Mithridatium:</hi> yet I ſee no
cauſe but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may proceede in like maner to
try y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodnes of it. For it is certaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no one
ſimple is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition of <hi>Theriacle</hi> (which
may be ſayd to ſtay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> working of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purgatiue
medicine) which is not in <hi>Mitrhridatiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For
where <hi>Theriacle</hi> doth abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
put as the baſe of the medicine, no wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath attributed to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> parcell any ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.
The like may be ſayd, if you diſcourſe
through all the ſimples added to this confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> and not in <hi>Mithridatium.</hi>
Therefore it ſeemeth moſt agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that the property to ſtay the working of a
purgation, doth proceede from the common
forme of <hi>Theriacle:</hi> and ſo we may with like
reaſon expect the ſame effect in <hi>Mithridati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datium,</hi>
and rather in <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> becauſe
all writers doe confeſſe that it is of greater
force for inwarde poiſons, and inward affects,
then <hi>Theriacle.</hi> Therefore I may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that
<hi>Mithridatium</hi> gieuen after a purgatiue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
will better ſtay or diminiſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> working
thereof, then <hi>Theriacle:</hi> and our experience
in common practiſe, doth confirme the ſame.
<pb facs="tcp:8698:22"/>
For in this our age, who doth after purgatiue
medicines (to bridle their ouerworking) ſo
often gieue <hi>Theriacle,</hi> as <hi>Mithridatium?</hi>
Wherfore no doubt we may make triall of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
perfection and goodnes of <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> in
like ſorte as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> that
is to ſay, to miniſter to one a purgatiue medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
and after to gieue to the ſame man a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
quantity of <hi>Mithridatium:</hi> and if the
medicine doth not worke according to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or that his operation be leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ought
to be, ſurely that <hi>Mithridatium</hi> is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and good. Otherwyſe, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medicine doth
proceede in his action to purge, and the ſame
appeareth not diminiſhed by the taking of
<hi>Mithridatium,</hi> then we may greatly doubt of
the goodnes of the <hi>Mithridatium.</hi>

               <p>I am not ignorant that diuers later writers
do conſtantly affirme that in this our time we
cannot make either good <hi>Theriacle</hi> or good
<hi>Mithridatium,</hi> for that they ſay we do lacke
many ſimples going into their compoſitions,
and muſt vſe others to ſupply, and ſo may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doubt whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupplies doe in all points
<pb facs="tcp:8698:22"/>
aunſwere the true ſimples, and they which we
haue are brought from farre cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tryes, long
iournies, ſome by la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſome by ſea, eſpecially, to
vs in <hi>England,</hi> whereby they may be thought
greatly weakned, and to looſe much of their
ſtrength and vertues, before we haue them.
So they conclude, that we cannot by any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
meanes, make theſe medicines in that
perfection as the auncient writers did, and ſo
we may not ſo exactly looke for the effects of
theſe medicines promiſed by the olde writers.
Whereto it may bee ſayd, that in parte this
allegation is true, and in deede a fewe yeares
paſt, when this fault was found, it was more
truer then now it is. For in truth when good
learning began to ſpring after barbariſme,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in deede great was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of true ſimples,
not in theſe two medicines only, but in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moe. But now in this our time all things
are called to a better examination, and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that few ſimples are now ſacking, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> making of <hi>Mithridatium:</hi> and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
euident y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the care of phiſitions and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries
(I meane of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better ſort) is ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

<pb facs="tcp:8698:23"/>
that the ſame may in thoſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of conuenient places, in due times and

into forrain dominions (more in theſe
our dayes vſed, then of longe time before vs)
doe gieue ſo good oportunity to haue true and
good ſimples, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to ſay truly what I do thinke
of this our age, I doe verily belieue that we
haue as true and as good ſimples, as <hi>Galen</hi>
had in his time: eſpecially ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to the making of <hi>Mithridatium.</hi> For
we do reade what a dooe <hi>Galen</hi> made to haue
pure and good Cinnamum, and made it an
Emperoures worke to procure the ſame, and
in lacke of Cinnamum did ſometimes ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

with diligence examine the ſackes of Canella,
brought from the new found cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries in great

kindes of Cinnamum, agreable to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old wryters: &amp; alſo the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.
We may alſo vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how in old time
things were ſophiſticated by the monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of
old writers. And who doth not now perceaue

Wherefore it is true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> now in this age things

               <p>SOme haue ben of opinion, that <hi>Theriacle</hi> &amp;

if things be rightly weighed, this allegation
is not true. For the partes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the

which do not ſpring in <hi>England,</hi> required to
the compoſition of <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> and many

do go into the compoſition of <hi>Mithridatium.</hi>
It is alſo well knowen, that ſtraunge herbes
tranſplanted hither, and ſome of ſeedes ſowen,
doe very kindely ſpring in <hi>England,</hi> which is

that they which doe growe here, are moſt

and ſhall be vncertaine how long we may

if we doe truely weigh in the ballance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that which I haue here written) and yet
much more may in this matter be ſayd) ſurely
we ſhall not onely confeſſe that none of theſe

eſteemed, as thoſe which are made at home in

<pb facs="tcp:8698:26"/>
are luſtly puniſhed in expending our money v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

a falſe &amp; naughty kinde of <hi>Mithridati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>

at a lowe price, for iij. d. or iiij. d. a pound, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
great hurt of Her Maieſties ſubiects, and no

               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridatium</hi> is next in qualitye and vertue
to <hi>Theriacle,</hi> and doth little differ from it,
ſaue that <hi>Theriacle</hi> is in temperament hoat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſtronger againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biting of ſerpents.
Concerning other properties of <hi>Mithridati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
confueſly numbred in theſe bookes,
it will not be amyſſe to reduce them to a
methode and order: So we may affirme
that the effects and vertues of <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
doe conſiſt in two ſpeciall points. Firſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
from infirmities, then to cure diſeaſes.
For as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth, this medicine doth not
onely cure affects which are ingendred, and
helpe to remedy poiſon taken: but vſed before,
doth ſo defend, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> poiſon gieuen after ſhall doe
no harme, as happened to king <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
when he would haue poiſoned himſelfe, Who
ſo vſeth <hi>Mithridatium</hi> in health, ſhall in ſuch
ſorte make his body ſtrong, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither poiſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor
other diſeaſe ſhall eaſely harme him. And as
man conſiſteth of body and ſoule, ſo <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>
doth in both exerciſe his vertues. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
are ſuch, that it quickeneth the ſenſes,
cleareth the minde, and ſharpeneth the
witte. Which actiones it perfourmeth
by clenſing the inſtrumentes which doe
<pb facs="tcp:8698:28"/>
ſerue to theſe fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctions, from groſſe and thick
vapours. And where oftentimes many fumes
doe aſcend, by the which the animal ſpirits
are obſcured, the vſe of <hi>Mithridatium</hi> doth
diſſipate, extenuate, &amp; conſume the ſame: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
theſe animal facultyes &amp; powers are clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and ſo a perfite minde is preſerued in a
whole body. For <hi>Mithridatium</hi> maketh
ſtrong all parts which doe ſerue for nutrition,
increaſeth naturall heate, openeth obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
expelleth ſuperfluity, wherby the naturall
faculties of the body doe perfectly performe
their functions, the ſtomacke in good order de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
and digeſteth alimentes, the liuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
good and perfit bloud, and ech parte put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
from him his excrementes in conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
order and time. So the hart receiuing
pure bloud, maketh good ſpirits fit for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which he orderly ſendeth to the animal
partes, &amp; to other members of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all the principall partes being in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
doe euery way well diſpence through
the body, that it remayneth in good order to
performe all actions. And whereas ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to many caſualties, <hi>Mithridatium</hi> vſed as
is ſayd, ſo defendeth the body, that no poiſon
ſhall eaſely harme it. Whereof <hi>Mithridates</hi>
gaue proofe, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> by longe vſe of this medicine.
<pb facs="tcp:8698:28"/>
ſo altered the conſtitution of his body, that no
poiſon could annoye it.</p>
               <p>In peſtilentiall ſeaſons, it preſerueth ſuch
as do vſe it: where of we haue examples, not
only in auncient writers, but alſo in our daily
experience.</p>
               <p>Now concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parte curatiue, though
the ſame may be gathered by that which is
already written in preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet it is better
for order ſake to repeate one thing often, then
to be thought inſufficient by omitting any
thing. Wherfore we may ſay with the olde au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
(which proofe alſo confirmeth) that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium</hi>
remedyeth diſeaſes of the minde,
taketh away ſtraunge imaginations, helpeth
melancholy phantaſies &amp; paſſions, which
drawe men often to deſperation. This it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
by altering the bloud, opening the
ſplene, by chaunging and diſſipating the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pores
arriſing of the melancholy humore,
and yeelding to the animall ſpirits pure and
good exhalations, and by comforting the
hart. And where oftentimes colde and groſſe
fumes do aſcend ſo plentifully, that the wittes
are dulled, the ſenſes and diſcourſe of reaſon
either greatly impaired or cleane taken away,
the iudgment and memory hurt or aboliſhed:
<hi>Mithridatium</hi> by his ſweete brethings quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth
<pb facs="tcp:8698:29"/>
the ſame, reduceth the braine to his
temperament, altereth, conſumeth, &amp; ſpendeth
thoſe vapoures, and bringeth man to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ſtate, and when it is newe, it induceth
ſleepe, and remedieth the furyouſnes of many
madmen.</p>
               <p>No man needeth to doubt of the mighty
power of <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> in curing all kind of
poiſons either outwardly receaued or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
taken, being to that purpoſe chefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
and of long time experienced to be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
of great force. Although for the biting and
ſtinging of venemous beaſtes, it is ſuppoſed of
leſſe might then <hi>Theriacle:</hi> yet it is of all men
confeſſed much ſtronger to cure poiſons, taken
into the body by potion, or otherwayſe. So his
might is great to heale all peſtilent (all and
malignante diſeaſes, cureth the plage, feauers
which depend of naughty and malignant cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
helpeth the french pocks, the ſmall
pocks, the meaſels: and in all other inward
diſeaſes which are great, and ſuch as other
medicines can not remedy, <hi>Mithridatium</hi> is
found to haue a ſpeciall grace to cure them.
And in ſuch deſperate diſeaſes &amp; caſes, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remedies will not ſerue, then we ought to
flye to <hi>Mithridatium,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> writeth of
<hi>Theriacle.)</hi> For being a noble medicine of
<pb facs="tcp:8698:29"/>
great powre, it is not to be vſed in euery af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of little moment.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is written that <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
cureth all infermities of the head in men, and
women, if the ſame doe come of a cold cauſe:
namely it helpeth the melancholy madnes, the
Falilng ſicknes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hemicrane or meagrame, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
paines in the eyelids and browes, the watring
of the eyes, the paines of the eares, of the teeth,
of the mouth, of the iawes, the ſquinancy,
the appoplexy, the litargie, and ſuch other cold
diſeaſes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head: in which caſes it is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dronken, &amp; alſo outwardly applyed, ſprede
in the forme of an emplaſtre: it comforteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
hart, &amp; doth good in the paſſions of the ſame.</p>
               <p>It helpeth the diſeaſed of the breaſt, cureth
the cough, ſhortnes of breath, ſpitting of
bloud, the pleuriſy and ſtiches of the ſide, the
phthiſike &amp; other inward diſeaſes of the breaſt
and lou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs. In theſe later cauſes, eſpecially for
ſtiches, it is applyed outwardly, ſpred empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
waies, and in the chough and ſuch other
diſeaſes, it is inwardly miniſtred with ſome
conuenient liquor: for ſo it cutteth the groſnes
of the phlegme, and maketh it eaſy to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,
openeth the pipes, and enlargeth all thoſe
parts which doe ſerue for breathing.</p>
               <p>To proceede to the affects of the ſtomake, it
<pb facs="tcp:8698:30"/>
prouoketh appetite, remedieth ouer much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to eat, termed <hi>Canina appetentia:</hi> for it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſuperfluous, &amp; reſolueth &amp; correcteth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte
humores: it helpeth concoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of naturall heate, cureth euill belks, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation
of the ſtomacke: for it breaketh winde,
and will not ſuffer any thing to corrupt in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtomacke: it ſtayeth vomiting by ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſtomacke: by keeping the ſtomacke
cleane from winde, ſuperfluous, and euill
humores, it taketh away the abhorring of
meate.</p>
               <p>It doth great good in all diſeaſes of the
belly, paynes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> guts, called the <hi>Iliaca paſſio,</hi>
the bluddy flix, and all other fluxes gieuen
with the decoction of the flowers of the pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate
called <hi>Balauſtia.</hi> In the colike of the
belly it is very good, and to eaſe the paynes of
the belly after a purgatiue medicine, it hath a
ſpeciall vertue. For it taketh away the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of the medicine, breaketh winde, and doth
ſtrengthen parts wekened by the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
medicine. It nouriſheth diſeaſes &amp; paynes
in the ſydes and about the mydriffe, it helpeth
the infirmities of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kidnes, and of the bladder,
breaketh the ſtone, remedieth the paſſions of
the matrix, prouoketh the naturall courſes in
women, and ſtoppeth the ſame if they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.
<pb facs="tcp:8698:30"/>
For it openeth the paſſages by extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
that which by groſnes doth ſtoppe the
wayes: and by making nature ſtronge, ſtaieth
fluxes, which commonly do grow immoderate
by weaknes. It diminiſheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwellings &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matrix, &amp; of other parts, it doth reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barrennes in women, &amp; maketh them fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till.
<hi>Mithridatiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> is accompted a ſpeciall good
remedy againſt the payne of the ioynts, to cure
the goute and the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> for that it drieth ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
humores, ſtayeth the reume, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
all parts ſtronge. But it muſt be gieuen,
not at the firſt, when the payn beginneth, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
when the rage of the paine is paſt, and the
body ought firſt to be purged before you gieue
<hi>Mithridatium.</hi> And it vſed before the fits of
the goutes, maketh greatly for preſeruation,
to keepe one from often acceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goute. It
helpeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſeaſes of the ſineues, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſolution, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

to all men, in all times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in all diſeaſes.
And the better to finde out the iuſt quantity,
wee are to remember, that <hi>Galen</hi> in the ſayd
booke mentioneth of two quantityes gieuen
of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> the one referred to a haſell nut,
the other to a beane of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And for that he
alſo affirmeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſtrong diſeaſes the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quantity is to be gieuen, and the leſſer in
light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſeaſes, and ſo in great infirmities hee
<pb facs="tcp:8698:31"/>
miniſtreth the quantity of an haſell nut, and in
diſeaſes of leſſe force, vſeth the portion of the
beane of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> it is euident that the haſell
nut importeth the greater quantity, and the
beane the leſſer. So that by <hi>Galen</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity to be gieuen of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
by an haſell nut, and the leaſt by a beane

vſeth to expreſſe theſe quantities, in my
iudgement doth importe the bigneſſe, and not
the weight of the things. For <hi>Galen</hi> in euery
place writeth <hi>ad magnitudinem fabae aegyptiae,</hi> &amp;
ſo <hi>ad magnitudinem nucis auellanae,</hi> to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelty
or bignes of a beane of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of an haſel nut. Which maner of ſpech hath
relation to the bignes &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weight. We are
therefore to conſtrue <hi>Galen,</hi> that in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
<hi>Theriacle</hi> is to be miniſtred, that his
bulke may bee equall with the bignes of an
haſell nut, and in other diſeaſes, of a beane of
<hi>Aegypt. Maſſarius</hi> in his booke <hi>de ponderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
reducing theſe things to weight, ſaith that

that is, halfe a <hi>drachine:</hi> and that <hi>nux auellana</hi>
ſignifieth a <hi>drachine.</hi> So if we will by weight
meaſure the quantities, the greateſt which is

it may be gieuen in like quantity. And becauſe
it is more gentle, and not in quality ſo whot as
<hi>Theriacle,</hi> and not receiuing the fleſh of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,

more ſafe medicine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ſo may be gieue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quantity, that wee neede not be bounde to
an haſell nut, nor to a beane of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but
may as cauſe ſhall require exceede both. For
which cauſe the writers of our antidatory
bookes, not without reaſon doe affirme, that
<hi>Mithridatium</hi> may bee miniſtred to foure
<hi>Drachines,</hi> that is halfe an ownce. And <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes</hi>
in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentary vpon <hi>Luminare Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius</hi>
bringing the quantity of a nut, and of a

an ounce, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beane of <hi>Aegypt</hi> halfe
a ſcruple, and becauſe the one proportion is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great, the other ouer litle: therefore he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his ſenſure, that an haſell nut containeth
<hi>ij. Drachines,</hi> or iiij. <hi>Drachines</hi> at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt. And
the beane of <hi>Aegypt</hi> one <hi>Drachine,</hi> or ij. <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi>
at the moſt. So that by his opinion we
may miniſter <hi>Theriacle</hi> to ij. or iij. <hi>Drachines,</hi>
when the diſeaſe and the caſe ſo requireth.
Wherefore wee neede not greatly to feare to
gieue <hi>Mithridatium</hi> in ſo large a quantity as
is preſcribed in our antidotaryes, that is, to
<pb facs="tcp:8698:32"/>
miniſter it to halfe an ounce. Neuertheleſſe
in theſe dayes wee doe very ſeldome miniſter
<hi>Mithridatium</hi> ſo largely: for moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly
we follow the preſcript of <hi>Galen,</hi> and gieue of
it the quantity of a beane, or of an haſell nut.
In meaſure wee preſcribe the halfe a <hi>drachine</hi> and
two <hi>ſcruples,</hi> and in mighty diſeaſes, and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
cauſes we offerre one <hi>drachine,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeldome doe procede to a greater quantity:
which proportions in my iudgement are moſt
vſually to be kept. Yet by this diſcourſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are not ſo to be reſtrained to theſe
quantities, but that we may vpon occaſions
gieue a greater quantity, if the patient, the
diſeaſe, &amp; other circumſtances doe ſo require.
And hereby alſo it appeareth, that we cannot
ſo determine the quantity of this medicine,
nor of any other, that the ſame may alway be
obſerued: but the certaine appointment of the
ſame muſt bee left to the diſcretion of him
which doth miniſter the medicine, to preſcribe
the quantity according to the circumſtances
of the preſent caſe. And therefore it ſhall not
be amiſſe here to conſider more particularly of
the circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, whereby we may the better
attaine to coniecture the iuſt quantity to bee
gieuen in the preſent caſe. Firſt therefore wee
are to conſider the countrey where the party
<pb facs="tcp:8698:33"/>
which is to take the medicine, doth inhabite, &amp;
here alſo the time of yeare. And as <hi>Galen</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> that in the Eaſt partes &amp; in
hoate cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tryes, in ſommer and hoate ſeaſons
it is not to be miniſtred: ſo we may affirme
of <hi>Mithridatiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in hoate cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tryes &amp; ſeaſons
we ought to refraine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much geiuing of it.
Wherefore when occaſion is to gieue in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
we muſt preſcribe a leſſer quantity then
in winter, and in the ſpring time. So we may
gieue a bigger quantity in theſe north parts,
then in hoater countreyes. The like reſpect
is to be had of the liquore in which wee gieue
it, that in hoate places &amp; ſeaſons it be mingled
with a cold liquor, as with water: and in cold
countries and times with a whot liquore, as
with wyne.</p>
               <p>The like conſideration is to bee had of the
temperament of the body, and of the age. In
which reſpect <hi>Galen</hi> doth forbid cholerike &amp;
hoate conſtitutions to take <hi>Theriacle.</hi> And
ſuch muſt with more warineſſe vſe <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
and in leſſer quantity and mingled with
ſome conuenient liquore, moderate the heate
of the medicine.</p>
               <p>Concerning age, <hi>Galen</hi> doth forbid the gie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of <hi>Theriacle</hi> to children, for (ſaith he) the
mightines of the medicine doth exceede the
<pb facs="tcp:8698:33"/>
ſtrength of children, and diſſolueth their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
and telleth an hiſtory of a childe deſtroide
by taking of <hi>Theriacle.</hi> We may therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhe
phiſitions of theſe dayes, which doe
often &amp; boldly gieue <hi>Theriacle</hi> to yonge chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
for the wormes: let them conſider what
warrant they haue ſo to doe: it is to be feared
leſt they endaunger thereby ſo tender bodyes.
And we are to be circumſpect in gieuing <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium</hi>
to children, and to be very wary
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſtring of it, leſt we do harme therin.
And yet I do thinke we may with more ſafety
miniſter <hi>Mithridatium</hi> then <hi>Theriacle.</hi> To
yong men &amp; ſuch as haue much natural heate,
we may gieue this medicine: but neither ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
nor in great quantity, &amp; in water rather then
wine. To me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of yeres which are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> declining
age, in greater quantity, and in wyne. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the diſeaſe we are ſo to meaſure the
quantity of the medicine, that in a mighty and
a ſtrong diſeaſe, we gieue a greater quantity.
Therefore as <hi>Galen</hi> wryteth of <hi>Theriacle,</hi> ſo
we may determine of <hi>Mithridatium.</hi> In ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
poyſon, and to ſuch as are bitten and ſtinged
with virulent beaſtes or mad dogs, we gieue a
greater quantity: in other diſeaſes the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the medicine ought to be according to
the greatnes of the ſicknes. So when there is
<pb facs="tcp:8698:34"/>
time to digeſt the medicine, we may appoynt

that the ſpirites comforted, might the better

then it is conuenient to gieue <hi>Mithridatium</hi>
in drie ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. When intention is to remedy
diſeaſes in more inward parts of the body, in
all venimous, peſtilential and malignant cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
we gieue the medicine diſſolued with ſome
liquore. And as we reade in <hi>Galen,</hi> that hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
not alway one liquore, ſo he maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe, of water of <hi>Mulſa,</hi> that is water &amp;
hony, which we do cal meade or meath, of <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi>
that is wyne and hony mingled, of <hi>acetum

that is water &amp; vineger, of certaine decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made of hearbs, rootes, and ſeedes. And
it is to bee ſeene by <hi>Galens</hi> diſcourſe, that hee
made choiſe of the liquores by indication taken
of the countrey, of the time of the yeare, of the
age and complexion of the patient, and of the
nature and diſpoſition of the diſeaſe. So that
he gaue a hoat liquore, as wine or wine or wine &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in cold countryes and times, in aged men, &amp;
ſuch as were not of hoate complexions, and
<pb facs="tcp:8698:35"/>
had not much naturall heate, &amp; in diſeaſes not
ouer hoate, &amp; in ſtrong poyſons. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe
in hoate regions, in ſommer time, in ſuch as
were in the flower of their age, and had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerike
and hoat conſtitutions, dry bodies, and
did abound with naturall heate, in hoate
cholerike ſikneſſes, in great feauers, he made
choiſe of a colde liquore hauinge regarde
that the liquore might contemper and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
in ſome part the quality of the medicine.
Which inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions applied to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gieuing of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium,</hi>
it wil be eaſy to chooſe a fit li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when we are to miniſter the ſame in it.
For the ſame circumſtances will ſoone induce
vs to make choiſe of a conuenient liquore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
wee may alſo learne by <hi>Galen,</hi> that as the
circumſtnunces are to leade vs to appoyncte
the quality of the liquore, as is aforeſayde:
So the diſpoſition of the diſeaſe will teach
vs to apt a conuenient liquore in ſubſtaunce:
for it is agreable to reaſon, that ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quore
bee gieuen, which may not only miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the quality of the medicine, but with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
alſo property to doe good in that diſeaſe,
may further the action of the medicine. So by
good reaſon in peſtilentiall agues, in mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
diſeaſes, the pockes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaſels, we doe
gieue <hi>Mithridatium</hi> with the diſſolued water
<pb facs="tcp:8698:35"/>
of <hi>Dragon,</hi> or of <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> or in
ſome like decoction, and we doe in ſuch caſes
