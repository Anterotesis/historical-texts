            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Apology for the preſent Publication of these Things.</head>
            <p>WE are ſorry that we ſhould have occaſion to publiſh ſuch Account of things, in the open View of all who may read the following Account, or hear of it, that may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Grief to many, eſpecially who had better Thoughts of ſome here-away, than the ſaid Account doth give of them, and it is too probable, the Enemies of Truth and of all true Religion, will ſeek to take Advantage there-from, and think themſelves greatly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified thereby, ſo as to rejoyce the more in their Iniquity, and glory over the ſincere Lovers and Profeſſors of Truth. But as on the one hand, we have been deeply afflicted with Sorrow, to find ſome ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretending to Truth, and to the inward and immediate Teachings and Leadings of the Spirit of Truth, which they have greatly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſome of them have Preached for ſome years, ſo very Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unsound in ſome of the Chief and Fundamental Principles of the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and ſo reſolute and confident in their Ignorance and Errour, that they have from time to time refuſed and rejected good and ſeaſonable Information, and means of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that have been in Love held forth unto them, partly in publick Teſtimonies, and partly in private Meetings and Conferences. So after our great and deep Affliction of Sorrow on their account, and for the ſake of many ſimple people that owned them as Miniſters of Chriſt, whom we ſaw to be greatly hurt, blinded and darkened with them, but not further enlightned by means of them, notwithſtanding of their <hi>great</hi> and <hi>high pretences</hi> to <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and to <hi>the Spirit and Power of God inwardly revealed</hi>; we can and do ſincerely ſay, on the other hand, God hath greatly comforted us, and we have great Joy and Conſolation in the ſence of his Love, revealed and ſealed to us by his holy Spirit in our hearts, being perſwaded by the ſame, that according to his Soveraign Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power, and great Faithfulneſs, he will make theſe very things, to wit, the Diſcoveries that ſome men have lately given of themſelves, to work for good to many; and we may ſincerely and uprightly ſay, They, and not We, have diſcovered and made publick theſe things; for when they heard
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99300:3"/>
true and ſound Doctrin preached, cencerning <hi>Chriſt and the true Faith in him, &amp;c.</hi> they have whiſpered againſt it, and publickly rejected it, which yet hath been greatly refreſhing and edifying to us, and to many others, having felt the Power of Chriſt accompanying that Doctrine, and ſealing to the Truth of it in our hearts; ſo that not only we have owned, and do own the Doctrin that hath been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us of late Times, by divers that God hath raiſed up in a zealous Teſtimony to the Truth of theſe Things (<hi>Denied by ſome,</hi> and <hi>Rejected by others,</hi> and <hi>meanly eſteemed</hi> by <hi>too many,</hi> as not Neceſſary, but Indifferent Matters to Salvation, to be believed, though true) but alſo, we have owned, and do own the Spirit by which that Doctrine hath been zealouſly delivered unto us, being perſwaded, it was of God; and we do not judge ſo raſhly and uncharitably as ſome do, calling that ſincere and godly Zeal, that hath appeared in ſome among us in publick Teſtimonies, <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi>: But it is no new thing to hear <hi>Light</hi> called <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> as well as <hi>Darkneſs</hi> called <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Good, Evil</hi> and <hi>Evil, Good</hi>: We believe and are perſwaded, that as to the main, it hath been, and is a ſincere godly Zeal, that hath been of God's raiſing in ſome of our Brethren, both to preach in publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies this Doctrine, ſo much of late <hi>contradicted by ſome, and ſlighted by others,</hi> and to defend it with great freedom and boldneſs in private Conferences and Meetings, and at ſome Monthly Meetings, notwithſtanding of what humane Weakneſſes (as to Circumſtances) might at times, on great Provocations, attend ſome, that we believe God hath forgiven, which have been far greater on their ſide, than on ours, wherein ſome of them have exceeded all bounds of Chriſtian Moderation, to the pronouncing <hi>Dreadful Woes</hi> againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent (which none of us have done) and giving bad Names to ſuch who did not deſerve it; thus putting the Sheep of Chriſt into <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Bear-skins,</hi> to render them odious, and to be the Object of <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Heart-Perſecution,</hi> which too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in this part of the World, although by the Mercy of God, and the good Laws of the Country, Perſecution by Violence of the Hands, is reſtrained.</p>
            <p>Now that theſe men have been the Diſcoverers of their own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Error and Unbelief, is very apparent, becauſe they not only dared to whiſper againſt ſound Doctrine in private, but only in Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings appointed to hear theſe <hi>Differences,</hi> and even at Monthly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they have been ſo bold as to reſiſt ſound Doctrine, and ſhew their Unbelief, and the Nature of our Meetings being ſuch, eſpecially
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99300:3"/>
our Monthly Meetings, that too many come to them, and ſit in them, hearing all things there ſaid, that are not qualified, either with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Knowledge or Prudence, or indeed with humane Diſcretion, as men, to conceal things that are not always ſeaſonable to be publiſhed, inſomuch that ſcarce any thing hath been ſaid or done in a Monthly Meeting for a long time paſt, but it is ſoon after publickly known: And we deſire to reverence the Providence of God, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his powerful Hand, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and great Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>this Diſcovery</hi>; for we are well ſatisfied, it is far better that the <hi>hidden things</hi> of <hi>Eſau</hi> be ſearched and found out, than to remain hid; for when <hi>Achan</hi> had Tranſgreſſed in the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had hid the accurſed thing, the <hi>Anger of the Lord was kindled againſt them,</hi> until he was diſcovered, and <hi>Judgment executed againſt him.</hi> And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo, that many <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>hurtful Opinions,</hi> that are as <hi>poyſonous Weeds,</hi> have had too much place among us, but have ſo ſecretly lurked under Ground, and yet have brought forth bad Fruit above Ground; for it is the Nature of Errors in Doctrine to produce Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Practice, and evil Converſation of Life, that we did not know that ſuch bad Fruits did ſpring from ſuch bad Principles of Doctrine that were held by them, but we did rather impute them to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, than to Ignorance or Error in Judgment.</p>
            <p>We have great cauſe to rejoyce and bleſs God, that his Light hath made <hi>this Diſcovery among us</hi>; for the Light diſcovereth Darkneſs, as well of Errour and Unbelief, in relation to Doctrine, as in matters of bad Converſation: And we are fully perſwaded, that it is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſign of that approching Glory of God's bleſſed Day that is more abundantly to be revealed among us, and in us, which many of our faithful Friends have fore-told, as nigh at hand, and all the Faithful have much longed and waited for, and continually pray for. And it will have a ſervice to bring many to Truth, that have ſtood at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, becauſe of Offences and Stumbling-blocks that have been laid in their way, through the Ignorance of many, eſpecially who have profeſſed the Truth with us, after ſome ſort, but have not received the true and ſound Knowledge of it; and too many that have preſumed to preach and pray in our Meetings, their way both of preaching &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath been very offenſive to many tender-hearted people, by their pretending greatly to the Spirit's Leadings and Movings, when they have expreſſed very unſound and unſavoury words, and have greatly diſcovered their unskilfulneſs in the <hi>Myſtery of Chriſt,</hi> both outwardly as he came in the Fleſh, died, and roſe again and is aſcended, and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99300:4"/>
great benefit of his outward Coming to men, as ſo known and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them, and as inwardly revealed; ſo that many who have come to our Meetings have been as a hungry Child that greatly needed the Breaſt, and thirſted for the ſincere Milk of the Word, having heard a great Noiſe of it, but when they came to ſuck, they did not find that which anſwered their deſire, and went away diſſatisfied, and the Breaſt it ſelf was ſo daubed over with what was unpleaſant to them, as Muſtard or Chimney-Sout is to the Mouth or Taſte of a Sucking Child. But God having ſo ordered it by his great Love, that by his marvellous Providence <hi>diſcovering theſe things,</hi> that hath been a long and great hurt and hindrance to the prevailing of Truth among us, and cauſing his Light to ſpring up more clearly among us, that Chriſt and the Faith of him, both without us, and within us, is ſincerely and powerfully preached by ſome of God's raiſing up among us, more clearly and fully than many have formerly known, although the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is the ſame in matter and ſubſtance, that the moſt faithful and foundeſt Friends and Brethren have all along held from the beginning; and we are infallibly aſſured, this preſent Exerciſe that is at preſent ſo heavy and grievous to many honeſt hearted, for want of a through diſcerning and underſtanding the Mind and Counſel of God therein, and his bleſſed Purpoſe, for the advancement of his Truth, ſhall greatly tend to their Comfort in due time, and to the Comfort of many, to raiſe them up to give Glory to God, with high Praiſes in their Hearts and Mouths, for what he hath begun to do, and will finiſh and perfect in his own time, for the Exaltation of his own Name, and the Name of his dear Son, that the Myſtery of him, <hi>even that great Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſt come in the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> even in that <hi>Body of Fleſh, through Death, to reconcile us unto God,</hi> with the bleſſed Effects and Fruits of it, inwardly witneſſed by the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him in us, may be yet more gloriouſly revealed, that the Souls and Hearts of many may be affected with the ſame, and overcome therewith, to love him, and live to him, who died for them, and roſe again, and to love God, and live to God, through him, in all holy Obedience, who gave him freely unto them. And though the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of Truth may for a ſmall time rejoyce a little, and ſeem to be gratified and ſtrengthned in their Enmity againſt Truth, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Lovers and Profeſſors of it, ſo as even to ſeem to glory over them, yet after a little time their joy will be turned into ſorrow, and their great glorying and ſeeming gratifyings, into Diſcontents and Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, when they ſhall be made to ſee and acknowledge the Hand of

(ſome that were preſent that were not in the Profeſſion of Truth, removing at the deſire of Friends) did give a unanimous Judgment concerning <hi>T.</hi>— a true Copy whereof here after followeth.

And by this it plainly appeareth, the Breach was on their ſide; for there is no Equity or Reaſon why they having denied us to be a Meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we ſhould own them, ſeeing we were really a Meeting, <hi>lawfully adjourned,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of at leaſt <hi>Sixty Perſons,</hi> moſt of which uſed to keep Monthly Meetings, and owned to be Friends in the ſame Profeſſion with them.</p>

And this Judgment alſo given by the Meeting, being refuſed by a Party in the Quarterly Meeting, to let it be entred in the Monthly Meeting Book, gave us juſt Offence, becauſe in ſo doing, they refuſed us to be a Monthly Meeting, and denied our Judgments, which we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in our Conſciences, by the Spirit of Truth, was a juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning theſe Men, and we could do no leſs, both for the Peace of our Conſciences, and the honour of Chriſt Jeſus, and alſo for the Credit of our Profeſſion, in all parts of the World, where ſuch a Profeſſion is made, than to give ſuch a Judgment concerning theſe Men.

One Reaſon was, <hi>That a Monthly Meeting could not</hi> Adjourn, <hi>and there was no</hi> Preſident <hi>for it</hi>: But to this the Clerk of the Meeting anſwered, <hi>That he had Minu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w, a Monthly Meeting had formerly</hi> Adjourned; and why could not a Monthly Meeting, upon a weighty occaſion <hi>Adjourn,</hi> as well as any other Meeting? Another Reaſon was, <hi>That the</hi> Clerk <hi>and the Monthly Meeting Book was gone</hi>: But to this it was anſwered, The Monthly Meeting could make or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlitute a <hi>Clerk</hi> as other Meetings have done; for it is the Meeting that makes the <hi>Clerk,</hi> and it is not the <hi>Clerk</hi> that makes the Meeting. A third Reaſon was, <hi>There are few of the Friends of the Miniſtry, or Elder Friends and Brethren that were preſent at the</hi> Adourning, <hi>or at the Meeting</hi> Adjourned. To this it was anſwered, That there were more, both Friends of the Miniſtry, and Elder Friends and Brethren at that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that did <hi>Adjourn,</hi> and met when <hi>Adjourned,</hi> than hath been at many Monthly Meetings here, that have been approved. And a 4th Reaſon was, <hi>That the matter of Difference being a matter of Doctrine, and betwixt Friends of the Miniſtry, a Monthly Meeting could not be proper Judges of it.</hi> To this it was anſwered, That the Difference being a matter of Fact, (and not a matter of Doctrine that could be called in Queſtion by any Judicious <hi>Chriſtian</hi>;) and the Accuſation being made to the Monthly Meeting they were proper Judges of it; and if the Difference had been a matter of Doctrine, we did, and do aſſert, That the Monthly Meeting, to wit, conſiſting of a conſiderable Number of Friends of the Miniſtry; and other Judicious Friends were proper Jueges of it; but to lodge the Judgment wholly in Friends of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and to deny all other Friends to have a ſhare in the Judgment, even when the Difference is in a Matter of Doctrine, we judge is an Encroachment upon our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and ſavours too much of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>; as alſo that other caſe preſſed too indiſcreetly at the Quarterly Meeting, when ſome that were known to be Parties againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> did require of him his Submiſſion to the Judgment of the Meeting; he anſwered (as we judge ſoberly and <hi>Chriſtianly</hi>) <hi>That he would ſubmit to the Judgment of the Spirit of Truth in Friends</hi>; but to give an abſolute Submiſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he could not, to any Society of Men whatſoever: for abſolute Submiſſion implyeth abſolute Infallibility, that no Society of Men pretendeth unto but the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and therefore, to introduce it among us, would be <hi>Rank Popery</hi>;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99300:8"/>
at which ſome prejudiced againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> were greatly diſſatisfied, and one took out his Pocket Book, and writ down ſome words of <hi>G. K.</hi> to that effect before he had finiſhed the full Sentence, which we judge was very unfair, as well as unuſual.</p>
            <p>But whereas ſome from this would infer, as if <hi>G. K.</hi> denied any <hi>poſitive Power of Judgment to a true Church, or Meeting of true Chriſtians, met together in the Name of Chriſt, where he is preſent in the midſt of them. G. K.</hi> gave no Ground for any ſuch inference; for he doth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant, That a true Chriſtian Aſſembly hath a poſitive Power of Judgment, when met together in his Name, and that he is preſent in the midſt of them, and is felt and witneſſed to guide them in true Judgment. But we all know, that it is poſſible at times, that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, ond Prejudice, and Annimoſities may prevail in Meetings, that may pretend to meet in the Name of Chriſt, and alſo to have him preſent in the midſt of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet, where ſuch things prevail, Chriſt is not in the midſt known to give true Judgment, or to guide Men to give it, as Friends Letter to us from <hi>London</hi> expreſly declareth. And therefore we judge, That no <hi>abſolute Submiſſion</hi> ſhould be required of any Member, to the Judgment of that Society he belongeth unto in a matter of Truth, or Chriſtian Doctrine, or wherein the Conſcience is concerned; for it is time enough to ſubmit to the Judgment of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when a Man hath heard it, and has brought it to the Ballance and Teſt of that which giveth true Judgment in every Particular that is in a quallified Frame to underſtand it, even as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>As I hear, I judge,</hi> John 5.30. And if any be ſtiff and Refractory to the true Judgment of the Chriſtian Society he belongeth unto, they may freely proceed to put into Practice, Goſpel Diſcipline againſt him, without requiring his Submiſſion, as it is in Worldly Judicatories.</p>
            <p>But if any ſay, <hi>At leaſt it was yielded in the Quarterly Meeting, that the Adjourned Meeting in the School-houſe was a true Meeting, but an Appeal was made from that Monthly Meeting to the Quarterly Meeting, and the Quarterly Meeting offering to give a new Judgment in the Caſe, and in order thereto, ordered</hi> G. K. <hi>to withdraw; he refuſing ſo to do, hindered that no Judgment could be given.</hi> But to this it was, and is anſwered, That there could be no Appeal from that Monthly Meeting, to the Quarterly Meeting, becauſe moſt of the Quarterly Meeting did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of the Friends that gave the Judgment at the Monthly Meeting; and ſuch as were over, were but a few in compariſon, except ſome Country Friends that did not care to meddle in that matter, and ſo to appeal from the Monthly Meeting to the Quarterly Meeting, was in

K.</hi> did well not to go forth, ſo as to ſubmit to the Judgment of theſe Men, who had ſufficiently ſhown their Partiality againſt him, and ſome of which had unjuſtly accuſed him, as can be well proved. Beſides, things being duly conſidered, there was no reaſon that <hi>G. K.</hi> ſhould have gone ſorth, either at that Meeting, or any other; for <hi>G. K.</hi> was no otherwiſe concerned in that Difference with <hi>W. S.</hi> and <hi>T. F.</hi> than all faithful Friends, and the whole Meeting ought to have been concerned, to wit, to defend one of the greateſt <hi>Principles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who was Crucified, did riſe from the Dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is now in being,</hi> And <hi>that Faith in him is neceſſary to make Men true Chriſtians</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore not <hi>G. K.</hi> alone, nor princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, but Chriſt himſelf, and all his faithful Followers are concerned in the ſame; and in none of theſe Meetings was any Charge of any Treſpaſs proved againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> nor ſo much as brought under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Body of the Meeting, only one or two particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons falſly accuſed him, but the thing was never brought to any due Tryal. And here let it be noted, That both the Meeting of Friends of the Miniſtry at <hi>R. E.</hi>'s refuſing to anſwer <hi>G. K</hi>'s Complaint againſt the diſhonour done to Chriſt Jeſus, that <hi>W. S.</hi> was guilty of, ſo as to bring him to any Conviction or Condemnation of his Error, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Meetings at the Houſe of <hi>S. C.</hi> and <hi>A.

S.</hi> to Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Condemnation of his Error, altho' at the laſt of ſix Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it was declared, <hi>That</hi> G. K.'s <hi>Doctrine concerning Chriſt within, and Chriſt without to be One Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was true, and that therefore</hi> W. S. <hi>was blame worthy</hi>; and yet after all this <hi>W. S.</hi> perſiſted in his falſe Charge againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> and hath been greatly excuſed and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99300:9"/>
by many, that this hath given ſuch deep Ground of Offence, to all of us, with other things concurring, that becauſe to this day nothing hath been done (it being now above a Year ſince Complaint was made againſt <hi>W. S.</hi>) by theſe of the other ſide, who meet in a Separation from us, either to bring <hi>W. S.</hi> or <hi>T. F.</hi> to Condemnation, but ſuffer them to continue to Preach and Pray in their Meetings; therefore we do juſtly judge, That the <hi>whole Meeting</hi> that meet in a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from us, that owneth theſe Men, and tollerateth them in their great Error and Treſpaſſes, are guilty with them, and accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their Errors; and therefore according to Chriſts Command, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the holy Scripture, we ought to be separate from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' (as hath been ſufficiently proved) they began the Separation; and they having begun it, we cannot in Conſcience unite in Meetings with them here at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> until they give ſatisfaction to Truth in theſe weighty things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Separation</hi> (which alſo we lay at their Door) is, That whereas in the Monthly Meeting in the firſt Month laſt, a Propoſition being made to change the Meetings, both at the Centre, and in the Town; and ſome being for the ſaid Change, and others againſt it, and having good Reaſons why they were againſt the ſaid Change; yet a Party in the Meeting, contrary to our declared Mind and Aſſent, aſſumed a Power over them that diſſented, to change the ſaid Meetings; a thing we have not known formerly allowed by Friends any where in their Monthly Meetings, that one Party (ſuppoſe equal, or greater in Number than the reſt) ſhould aſſume a Power to appoint or change Places and Times of Meetings, without the Conſent of their Brethren; for things, of that Nature eſpecially, uſe always to be done with unanimous Conſent, and not by Plurality of Votes, which is not the way of Truth; and becauſe we were not free to ſtand to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and raſh Determination, as to that Change, therefore we met at the ordinary Meeting-place as formerly practiſed, and they began the Separation, in keeping a publick Meeting in the Afternoon at the Bank, contrary to our declared Senſe and Mind, only ſome of us met at a private Family Meeting in the Evening, at the Houſe of <hi>G. K.</hi> that could be counted no ſeperate Meeting for that day. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, we finding they were reſolved to continue in their way of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and that ſome had endeavoured to <hi>lock us out from Meeting</hi> at the Bank in the Forenoon, this put us upon ſeeking a new place to meet in, in caſe we had been diſappointed of the other; and tho' ſome of us did declare our ſincere Intention and Senſe, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99300:9"/>
it were good but to have one Publick Meeting on firſt Days, to end about the ſecond hour, and the remaining part to be uſed for private Meetings in Families, yet their keeping up their publick Afternoons Meeting, hath given us juſt occaſion at preſent to have a Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoons Meeting, as well as they; for we hope they ſhall not have any cauſe to ſay againſt us, that we are ſhort of them in our Zeal for good Meetings.</p>
            <p>Things being thus far advanced, and the Separation being begun, and carried on ſo far by them, and juſtly chargeable upon them, ſome of them having deſired us to make ſome Propoſals, or Expedients for healing the Breach, and uniting again as formerly; after ſome time we ſent ſome Propoſals to them, that we were ſatisfied in our Conſciences were moſt equal and juſt, and ſuch as the Truth required of us; but they are ſo far from being ſatisfied with moſt of them, that they have the more blamed us: ſome inſinuating, as if we had tranſgreſſed the Law; but we are not afraid of any ſuch thing, provided true Liberty of Conſcience, according to the juſt and due bounds of it, be allowed to us; and for our part, we are ſo well ſatisfied, that all our Propoſals to them (in that Paper ſigned by Fifteen of us) are juſt and equal, that if they pleaſe, we ſhall freely conſent to their Printing of them, The ſum of which Propoſals doth principally conſiſt in theſe two things; firſt, <hi>That all ſuch of the Miniſtry among them, whom we can prove Guilty of the Preaching falſe Doctrine, or of falſly accuſing the Innocent, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing and defending the Guilty, and contending againſt ſome ſound Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Truth, in Meetings appointed for hearing theſe Differences, may be brought to Cnviction and Acknowledgment of their Error and Treſpaſſes:</hi> And 2dly, <hi>Seeing (by a marvelous Providence that hath diſcovered it) that our Monthly Meetings bere-away have conſisted of a mixt Number of ſome Believers, and ſome Unbelievers, or of ſome Men , unſound in the Chriſtian Faith, that we agree together to put</hi> Robert Barclay's <hi>Doctrine</hi> (<hi>well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the beſt of our Friends in</hi> England, <hi>and particularly by</hi> G. F. <hi>and</hi> G. W.) <hi>into Practice in his Book, called,</hi> The Anarchy of the Ranters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> see §. 4. p. 32, 33. and § 6. p. 48, 49<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>which is, To declare our Faith and Perſwaſion in certain Fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion, that by the ſame, as well as by a good Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, it may be known who are quallified to be Members of our Church; and that every one owned to be a Member of our Church, declare his Faith and Perſwaſion in every one of theſe Fundamentals, which is a ſecondary Bond of our Union, the Spirit being the principal, which may be eaſily done by anſwering to ſome plain Queſtions, with</hi> Yea <hi>or</hi> Nay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:99300:10"/>And now a <hi>Third</hi> and main <hi>Reaſon</hi> that we give for this <hi>Separation,</hi> well warranted both by Scripture Teſtimony, and command of Chriſt, Recorded in Scripture, and the truth of it ſealed to us, by the Spirit of Truth in our Hearts, that whereas there are divers of them guilty of <hi>moſt groſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Unchriſtian Errors,</hi> againſt the <hi>Fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> who are Publick Preachers among them, and whole Miniſtry they ſit under, and ſome encourage them, others tollerate and ſuffer them; and that others, even of their <hi>Preachers</hi> are guilty of other <hi>groſs Errors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and other <hi>Treſpaſſes,</hi> that render them altogether unqualified for the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and to uphold or tollerate them, is to bring <hi>Reproach</hi> to <hi>Truth,</hi> and our <hi>Holy Proſeſſion,</hi> and to the Body of our faithful <hi>Friends,</hi> with all whom we remain in dear <hi>Unity,</hi> in all parts of the <hi>World,</hi> hoping that Faithful <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> that have an impartial account and information of us, and do rightly and duely conſider and examin the Righteouſneſs of our Cauſe, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us therein, to the Diſappointment of ſuch who affirm the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; but we being principally ſupported and encouraged by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth in our Hearts, that as ſuch <hi>Men</hi> immediately guilty of theſe <hi>vile Errors,</hi> ſome of which, no <hi>Proteſtant Chriſtian Society</hi> would to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate, neither <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian</hi> nor <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> are to be turned away, and ſeperated from; ſo <hi>that Society</hi> is to be turned away from, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be that doth uphold and tollerate them, and bring them not to due Conviction and Condemnation, after due and ſufficient notice is given unto them, as there hath been a long time, from one Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another, as concerning ſome of them, now many Months ſince paſt, and nothing done effectually to bring them to any Conviction, but that it ſeemeth they are reſolved ſtill to ſupport or tollerate them. Now the Scriptures that warrant us in this <hi>Separation</hi> (altho' as is ſaid firſt made by them) are theſe following, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16, 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6, 3, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, 14, 15, 20. and the ſame is expreſly confirmed by the Doctrine delivered by <hi>R. Barclay</hi> in his ſaid Book, well approved by good Friends, who expreſly ſaith, p. 52. <hi>We do ſafely conclude, that where a People are gathered into a Belief of the Principles and Doctrines of the Goſpel of Chriſt, if any of that People go from their Principles, and aſſert things falſe and contrary to what they have already received, ſuch as ſtand, and abide firm in the Faith, have Power, by the Spirit of God, after they have uſed Chriſtian endeavours to convince and reclaim them, upon their Obſtinacy to Seperate from ſuch,</hi> §. 6. p. 52. and §. 4. p. 33. he ſaith,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99300:10"/>
               <hi>The Eſcapes, Faults, and Errors of ſuch who own, believe and profeſs the ſame Doctrine and Principles of Faith with us, and go under the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and Denomination, may by our Adverſaries, juſtly be imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, if not ſeaſonably and Chriſtianly reproved, reclaimed or condemned.</hi> And therefore we judge, that we have equal Ground and Cauſe of <hi>Seperation,</hi> as well from that <hi>whole Society</hi> that doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn theſe Men for their <hi>groſs Errors</hi> in <hi>Fundamental Doctrines,</hi> as we have to ſeperate from theſe particular Men, ſeeing they who tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate them, both by Scripture and <hi>R. B</hi>'s Book, are guilty with them, and the <hi>Errors</hi> of theſe Men may be juſtly imputed to them. <hi>Note,</hi> That whereas it hath been ſaid by ſome, <hi>That they would have dealt with theſe Men who have been guilty of thoſe Errors, but that</hi> G. K. <hi>would not go forth, being deſired to withdraw at the Meeting at</hi> R. E<hi>'s, and at the Quarterly Meeting:</hi> To this it is anſwered, That <hi>G. K.</hi> had good reaſon not to withdraw at both theſe times, becauſe at both theſe times, theſe who did take upon them to be Judges, were his manifeſt Parties againſt him, and ſo could not be in Juſtice his Judges; but at the Yearly Meeting he did withdraw at the Meeting's Deſire, and yet they did nothing to bring <hi>W. S.</hi> to Conviction; beſides, it was not <hi>G. K.</hi> but the Truth it ſelf, that the Difference was concerning; and they have had ſufficient time ſince to have done it, but nothing that we can hear of is done.</p>
            <p>But it is very ſtrange, what ſome have ſaid, <hi>That no Error in Doctrin or Treſpaſs whatſoever of particular Perſons, though tollerated by a Society, that we were joyned with in the Poſſeſſion of Truth, can be any juſt cauſe of Seperation,</hi> doth equally blame all our Friends in their Seperation from the reſpective Societies they were formerly joyned in Profeſſion with, as ſome in their Seperation from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> others from the <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> others from the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and doth equally blame the Separation of the faithful Martyrs in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, from the <hi>Popiſh Worſhip</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> yet well approved generally by our Friends. And ſurely for People of contrary Principles and Spirits, and having a contrary Faith and Perſwaſion in <hi>Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> to be united together in one Worſhip, would make the greateſt Confuſion imaginable, and be incomparably more like <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> than the <hi>true Church of Chriſt</hi>; and ſo to affirm, is contrary to all common Senſe of any that hath the leaſt true Notion of a Church, that ought to be as a Field or Garden, as clean of Weeds as poſſible; for tho' the Tares are to be ſuffered to grow in the Field of the World, yet they are not to remain in the Church, according to Chriſt's Doctrine.

But at this rate, the Weeds ſhall remain with the good Corn and Herbs in the ſame Garden, yea, and exceed them, that cannot but greatly hurt the good Corn and Herbs. Beſides, how can the Gardner delight in ſuch a Garden that is full of Weeds, and no care to ſeperate the good Herbs from the Weeds. And tho' it hath been ſaid by ſome, <hi>That as the Faithful ſtand in the Power of God, they ſhall have Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Unfaithful</hi>: But we find no warrant or promiſe, that God will give them Dominion, if they obey not his Command, which is <hi>To Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,</hi> and <hi>withdraw from ſuch,</hi> and not to remain in Fellowſhip with them; <hi>for what part hath a Believer with an Infidel</hi>? 2 Cor. 6.15.17.</p>
