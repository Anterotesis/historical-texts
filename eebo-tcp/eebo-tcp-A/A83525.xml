            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>What</hi> a ſtrange <hi>time are we in, that a few</hi> impudent malicious <hi>(to give them no worſe terme) men ſhould caſt ſuch a ſtrange miſt of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour before the</hi> eyes of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>as that they either cannot, or</hi> will not <hi>ſee how manifeſtly they injure themſelves, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining theſe viſible</hi> untruths?</p>
               <p>In the Kings Declar: of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 12. 1642.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We were able to diſcover that—there was, ſtill a</hi> faction of a few ambitious, diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſeditious perſons, <hi>who under pretence of being enemies to Arbitrary power, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards thoſe, who out of tenderneſſe of Conſcience could not ſubmit to ſome things enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or commended in the Government of the Church, had in truth a deſire (and had entred
<pb facs="tcp:113663:4"/>
into a Combination to that purpoſe) to</hi> alter the Government both of Church <hi>and</hi> State.</p>
               <p>The former Declaration begins thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tis more then time now after ſo many injuries and indignities offered to our Royall perſon—to vindicate our Selfe from thoſe wicked and damnable Combinations and Conſpiracies which the implacable malice and</hi> inſatiable ambition of ſome perſons <hi>have contrived againſt us.</hi>

               <p>In the Concluſion of that Declaration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our quarrell is not againſt the Parliament, but againſt</hi> particular men, <hi>who firſt made the wounds, and will not now ſuffer them to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but make them deeper, and wider, by contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, foſtering, and fomenting miſtakes and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies betwixt body and head, us and our two Houſes of Parliament; whom we</hi> name, <hi>and are ready to prove them guilty of high Treaſon.</hi>

We ſhall never [and we hope our people will never] account the contrivance of a few factious, ſeditious perſons, (a Malignant partie who would conſecrate the Common-wealth to their owne fury and ambition) the wiſdome of Parliamen.</hi> The Honourable Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> in their late <hi>famous Declaration, of the 17. of Aprill, have diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that there are ſtill the ſame ſpirits ſtirring, and humours working though under other diſguiſes and upon other grounds.</hi> Since this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, theſe ſpirits doe not bluſh to proceed according to the firſt beginnings, and to reflect the like crimes on the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> under the perſons of ſome <hi>particular Members,</hi> and this done by men profeſſing great <hi>Zeale</hi> for you, and that <hi>now</hi> after
<pb facs="tcp:113663:5"/>
you have almoſt brought this Kingdome (by the good hand of God upon you) to feaſt upon the remembrance of the fore-paſſed <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>wormewood,</hi> and to ſatiate it ſelfe with the fat of ſecuritie, Truth and Peace. But (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>a Foole is never ſo troubleſome as when he is filled with meat;</hi> even ſo now, Ingratitude hath taken the Ballance into her hand, and <hi>Fancy</hi> ſits upon the beame, and judgeth that the Talents of precious mercies which by you (Noble Senatours) we enjoy, are light in reſpect of ſome ſtill wanting: neither can all you have done be pawne enough of adding them hereafter; no nor any thing you can ſay though never ſo ſolemnly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot obtaine the <hi>Credit,</hi> much leſſe the <hi>Obedience:</hi> as to have your <hi>Declaration</hi> in that kind publiſhed; and becauſe they deſpaire in a way of duty to obtaine their deſires, have <hi>now</hi> borrowed the pen of Inſolency out of the hands of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and as theſe formerly ſtiled you <hi>Rebels, Traitors,</hi> Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques, &amp;c. and another Party acted to a frenzie of zeale, wrote you, <hi>Antichriſtian, Popiſh,</hi> tyrannous: So theſe here ſpoken of expreſſe themſelves of you, as <hi>Fautors</hi> of <hi>Errour, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, Anarchy, intolerable Toleration:</hi> unleſſe you put life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and take it from what they point you to.</p>
            <p>Now this ſheet of paper hath humbly preſented to your Honours, the <hi>Deſigne</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>theſe in Parallel</hi> with the <hi>former,</hi> aſperſing the <hi>Honour</hi> and enervating the <hi>Authority</hi> of Parliament under the Notion of accuſing ſome particular Members; and that done with expreſſions ſo high and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, whether reſpect be had to the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of the people <hi>over awed,</hi> or to the <hi>ſafety</hi> of the <hi>State at this time,</hi> eſpecially, <hi>thereby</hi> imperilled: that hence there ſeemes naturally to iſſue (by your Wiſdomes to be conſidered) the fore-mentioned DILEMMA.</p>
            <p>For though he lay it on <hi>ſome Members</hi> onely, and grants that <note place="margin">The proofe of the reſult of the <hi>Dilemma</hi> from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes.</note> the <hi>Parliament hath ordained,</hi> &amp;c. yet whileſt he addes, <hi>that all things are carried with a high hand contrary, and perſons dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> to Church and State, <hi>Sectaries, &amp;c. countenanced, and preferred in All</hi> places and to <hi>All</hi> kind of Offices, and that the Parliament <hi>profeſſeth one thing, yet the quite contrary in all things,
<pb facs="tcp:113663:6"/>
in Citie and Country,</hi> ſeeing this could not be done but by the <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>connivence</hi> of the Parliament, what doth he but plainly inſinuate what before he labour'd covertly to hide? That this is the <hi>Authors</hi> true meaning, you may pleaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> before the firſt part of his <hi>Gangraena</hi> to both <hi>Houſes of the Parliament;</hi> particularly, in the <hi>fift page,</hi> where what he here chargeth upon <hi>particular Members,</hi> he there layes upon <hi>both Houſes,</hi> as in theſe words; <hi>You have moſt Noble Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours done worthily againſt Papiſts, Prelates, ſcandalous Miniſters, Images, Altars, Crucifixes, Ceremonies, &amp;c. But what have you done againſt other kinds of growing evills, Hereſie, Schiſme, diſorder, Seekers, Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, Browniſts, Libertines, and other Sects?</hi> in the ſeventh page thus. <hi>Now Right Honourable, though you have made Ordinances againſt Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, other Sects,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and upon complaint have troubled ſome Sectaries,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet notwithſtanding there is a ſtrange and unheard of bearing with them, as I beleeve all things conſidered never was the like under any Orthodox, Chriſtian Magiſtrate and State;</hi> p. 9. <hi>Yet I doe not ſay your Honours have done theſe things, for there are matters of this nature you heare not of: and upon complaints that have come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to your Houſes, there hath been ſome redreſſe; yet ſuch things are done by Committees, or perſons under your power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and no effectuall wayes taken to prevent, diſcover or reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy theſe things. Now I humbly ſubmit to your deep Judgement, whether God account not men guilty of that which is committed by others under them.</hi> [Nay to take off all ſcruple touching his meaning, his next words faſten the charge upon your ſelves] <hi>as alſo whether it will not be interpreted by men, that there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly great countenance and favour above, or elſe perſons below durſt not doe as they doe.</hi> So page 10. <hi>Reformed Churches abroad ſay, why may not the King as lawfully tolerate Papists one falſe Religion, as the Parliament ſuffer all Sects to grow?</hi> And laſtly, page 11. <hi>Know God is a righteous God, and will require it at your hands, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit and be avenged for theſe things. Let no man flatter you with your great proſperity and ſucceſſe,</hi> &amp;c. where the very charge and threatning that he denounces in his <hi>ſecond part</hi> againſt ſome <hi>particular Members,</hi> is charged upon <hi>both Houſes joyntly.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:113663:6"/>
why now he ſhould endeavour to caſt that <hi>odium</hi> upon <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Members</hi> which he before charged upon the <hi>whole,</hi> (though this alſo fall upon the whole) the Reaſon may be to make the <hi>Deſigne</hi> at once both more <hi>dangerous</hi> and more <hi>feeble;</hi> for whil'ſt it was in <hi>generall</hi> the reverence of ſo <hi>great a Court</hi> might juſtly awe the People, whereas now ſome <hi>particulars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſingled out, he might with more <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>poſſibility</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, and ſtir up the people to appeare againſt them. Now for this to be done not by any <hi>conſiderable number</hi> of men by way of <hi>humble Petition,</hi> upon <hi>indiſpenſable neceſſity,</hi> but by a <hi>private</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that not in a Petition <hi>firſt</hi> preſented unto you, that your Wiſdomes might have judged whether it were fit for <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> view, but in a <hi>Book</hi> written purpoſely for the branding of <hi>Sectaries, Hereticks,</hi> and the <hi>worſt</hi> of men; and that without <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe</hi> in a thing of ſo <hi>high a nature.</hi> There ſeems neceſſarily to ariſe from hence the double evill expreſſed in the latter mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> an unlawfull <hi>breach of Parliamentary Priviledge;</hi> and a moſt perilous Introduction to the ruine of the <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſelfe by raiſing the <hi>people</hi> to <hi>ſedition</hi> againſt it. For as the King upon the <hi>like diſtinction</hi> of ſome Members from the reſt, demanded ſix of your Honourable Members to Juſtice, as a Prologue to the Tragedy. If now the <hi>People</hi> ſhould by ſuch a <hi>peſtilent Booke,</hi> be <hi>Alarm'd</hi> on <hi>groundleſſe miſpriſions</hi> to declare againſt certaine of your <hi>Members</hi> as inſufferable in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes; though under notion of Petitioning againſt them, it may be doubted whether afterward firſt <hi>ſix,</hi> and then <hi>ſixteen,</hi> and after that ſixty ſhall not be demanded, yet with pretence held out before the people of all honour and obedience to the Parliament.</p>
