            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have chose you to be the Patron of

is to prove, That <hi>there is more ease in</hi>
Vertue <hi>then in</hi> Vice. And seing to

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S these Spyes deserved ill of
the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Camp,<note place="margin">Numb. 13</note> who
having inflamed their breasts
with desires of conquering
<hi>Canaan,</hi> by presenting them of it's
Vines, whose each Cluster was a
Vintage, and each Grape a Bottle;
did thereafter, by a cruel paricide, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
these same inclinations which
they had begot, by telling those their
hopeful Brethren, that the Countrey
was as unconquerable, as pleasant;
And that it's men were Giants, as
well as it's fruits. So by the same
measures we have reason to fear, that
these Divines &amp; Moralists, are unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
guides to us poor Mortals, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have edged our inclinations for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93165:4"/>
Vertue, as the most satisfying of all
objects, do thereafter assure us, that
it is attended with as much difficulty,
as it is furnisht with pleasure: And
that like some coy Lady, it possesses
charms, not to satisfie, but to exact
our longings. This infortunat error
hath in all probability, sprung ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the vanity of these Bastard
Philosophers, who having cheated
the people into an esteem for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as Vertuous, resolved by a
second Artifice, to highten that
esteem, by perswading these their
admirers, that Vertue was a work of
as much difficulty, as it met with
praise. Or else from the zeal of some
Preachers, who, to make us ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
our Repentance, resolved to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us, that Faith and these other
Spiritual Vertues, could not but be
hardly attainable (as certainly they
are) when Moral Vertue, which is
a lower Story of perfection, was of so
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93165:4"/>
difficult an ascent. Or (which is
yet most probable) our laziness,
and Vitious habits being called to an
account for these misfortunes, which
they occasion, have run themselves
under the protection of this defence,
that Vertue is most difficult and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,
and is destitute of both plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and advantage: By which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
many are diswaded in this age,
from undertaking a resolution of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vertuous, though otherwise they
much honour it; and wickedness is
not only furnish'd by this, with an
excuse to detain such as it hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
overtaken, but with charmes to
intangle these who are yet stated in
an indifferency for either. And though
the heat of zeal in Preachers, should
not be too much disproved in this age,
where in the coldnesse of their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
charity, needs those warmer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
and though they may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to bend our crooked humours
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93165:5"/>
to the contrary side of what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to, of design to bring them to
a desired straightness. Yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that infallible Theology delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by our Saviour, we may find,
that he invited his Disciples, by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
them, <hi>that his yoke was easie,
and his burden very light,</hi> and by up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding
them, for <hi>wearying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their sins,</hi> and for <hi>troubling
themselves about many things.</hi> And
since the former Artifice, hath either
by being too familiarly preached, lost
its operation, with such as love cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,
or by being too severely prest,
discouraged too much these who love
too well their own flesh and blood, to
welcome any Doctrine that stands so
opposite to it: I wish these same
Preachers would now endeavour to
reclaim mankind, by assuring them,
that Vertue is much easier, and much
more advantagious then Vice. Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
in this their great Master, who,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93165:5"/>
after his Disciples had wearied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with catching no Fish all the
night over, did, by perswading them
to throw out their Nets upon the
other side of their Boat, put them
upon the way of catching more at one
draught, then they had catcht in their
former whole nights fishing. But
leaving (with much resignation) my
Ghostly Fathers to manage the course
of our Devotion, as their knowledge
and piety shall judge most fit; I shall
endeavour to clear from reason and
experience, that <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> is of
lesse fatigue, and suits better with
our natural inclinations, then Vice, or
Passion doth. And although I fail
in an undertaking which is too noble
an enterprize, to receive its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
from so weak a hand, yet
if I shall excite others, out of pity to
me, or glory because of the subject,
to defend what I could not, or to love
that Vertue which I recommend, I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93165:6"/>
shall rest satisfied with a return, which
because it will be above my merit, I
have already placed above my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation;
and so I may meet with a
foil, but cannot with a disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>All creaturs design ease,<note place="margin">Ease com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> and for
this, not only Bruits do toil, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animat
things likewise show; for it
so much of inclination, that they
will destroy all intermediat objects,
that hinders them from joyning to
their center, to which they have no
other tendency, but because there
they find that ease, which is desired
by their nature: and because all things
find ease in it, therefore all things
flee thither, as to the loveliest of
all stations. And that happiness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in ease, is clear from this, that
either we want that we need as
the accomplishment of our nature,
and then nature most move towards
the acquisition of what it wants; or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93165:6"/>
else we want nothing, and then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will enjoy it self without any
further motion, <hi>nam natura nihil
agit frustra;</hi> and it were most frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
for nature, to seek what it
wants not: From which we may
conclude, when we see any creature
restlesse, and in motion, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it either wants something to
which it moves, or is opprest by a
surcharge of somewhat, from which
it flies. This hath made Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
conclude, that all motion
tends to some rest; Lawiers, that all
debates respect some decision; States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that all War is made in order to
Peace; Physitians, that all fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and boiling of the blood or
humours, betokens some dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the part affected; (And to
show how much happinesse they place
in ease, they term all sickness dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases)
which imports nothing more,
then the absence of ease, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93165:7"/>
of States, and root of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
and that Divinity may sing
a part in this <hi>requiem,</hi> Scripture tells
us, that GOD hallowed the seventh
day, because upon it he rested from
his creation, and that Heaven is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an eternal Sabbath, because there
we shall find ease from all our labours,
there GOD is said, when well pleas'd,
<hi>to have savour'd a sweet savour of
rest,</hi> and he recommends his own
Gospel as a burthen that is easie.
That then wherewith I shall task my
self in this discourse, shall be to
prove, <hi>that Vertue is more easie then
Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For clearing whereof,<note place="margin">Vitious persons most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble Vertue, which is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culter then to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</note> consider,
that all men who design either hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
riches, or to live happily in the
World, do either intend to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
or at least pretend it; these
who resolve to destroy the liberties
of the people, will stile themselves
keepers of their liberties; and such as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93165:7"/>
laugh at all Religion, will have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
beleeved to be reformers; and
of these two, the pretenders have the
difficultest part, for they must not
only be at all that pains, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit
in being vertuous, but they
must superadde to these, all the
troubles that dissimulation requires,
which certainly is a new and greater
task then the other; and not only so,
but these most over act Vertue, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
design to take off that jealousie,
which because they are conscious to
themselves to deserve, they therefore
vex themselves to remove: <hi>Moses</hi> the
first, and amongst the best of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
was the meikest man upon
the face of the earth; But <hi>Iehu</hi> who
was but a counterfit <hi>Zelot,</hi> drove fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
and called up the By-standers
to see, what else he knew they had
reason not to beleeve; and the just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all <hi>Israels</hi> Chair-men, took
not so much pains to execut justice,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93165:8"/>
as <hi>Absolon,</hi> who is said to have staid
as long in the gates of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as
the Sun stay'd above them, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself of all persons and affairs,
though with as little design to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
their wrongs, as he shewd
much inclination to know them; and
all this, that the people might be
gained to be the instruments of his
unnatural Rebellion; and such is the
laboriousnesse of these seeming cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers
of Vertue, that in our ordinar
conversation, we are still jealous of
such as are too studious to appear ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
though we have no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to doubt their sincerity, but what
arrises from their too great pains,
from which we may conclude, that
these who intend to be vertuous, have
a much easier task then these pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
have, because they have not their
own conscience, nor the jealousness of
others to wrestle against; and which
is yet worse, these want that habit of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93165:8"/>
Vertue, which renders all the pains
of such as are really vertuous easie to
them, and what is more difficult,
then for these to act against customs,
which time renders a second nature;
and which, as shall be said hereafter,
is so prevalent, as to facilitat to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
persons the hardest part of
what Vertue commands: Besides
this, these dissemblers have a difficult
part to act, seing they act against
their own inclinations, which is to
offer violence to nature, and the
working not only without the help
of that strongest of all seconds, but
the toiling against it, and all the
assistance it can give: which how
great a torment it proves, appears
from this, that such as have as much
generosity, as may intitle them to
the name of Man, will rather wearie
out the rage of torture, then injure
their own inclinations. I imagine that
<hi>Haman</hi> was much distrest, by being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93165:9"/>
put to lead <hi>Mordecai's</hi> horse in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with his Masters commands;
and one who is obliged by that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
which makes him dissemble to
counterfit a kindness for one whom
he hates, or emit an applause of what
he undervalues, is certainly by that
necessity more cruciat by a thousand
stages, then such as intend upon a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
account to love the person, and
really to praise that in him, which
they are forc'd to commend; which
is so far from being a torment, when
it is truly vertuous, that that real
love makes him who has it, hungry of
an occasion to shew it, and to pursue
all means for hightning that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
which torments the other
consider what difficulty we find in
going one way, whil'st we look an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and with what hazard of
stumbling that attempt is attended,
and ye will find both much difficulty
and hazard to wait on dissimulation,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93165:9"/>
wherein we are tyed to a double task,
for we must do what we intend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of our inclinations, and what we
pretend, because of our professions;
and if we fail in either, which is more
probable, then where simplicity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is profest, (two tasks being difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then one,) then the world laughs at
us, for failing in what we propos'd:
And we fret at our selves, for failing
in what was privatly design'd; and
not only does dissimulation tye us to
a double, but it obliges us to two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
tasks, for we needed not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
if what we intend, be not
contrary to what we pretend; and
thus men in dissimulation do but (like
<hi>Penelope,</hi>) undoe in the night, what
they were forc'd to do in the day time.</p>
            <p>Dissimulation makes Vice like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the more difficult, in that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers
are never able to recover the
losse they sustain by one escape, for if
they be catcht in their dissimulation,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93165:10"/>
or dogg'd out to be impostors (which
they cannot misse, but by a more
watchful attendance, then any that
Vertue requires) then they of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are most hated, not only by
these whom they intended to
cheat, but by all others, though
inconcerned in the crime, and both
the one and the other do yet
hate it, as what striks at the root
of all humane society: and for this
cause, murther under trust, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
so impious and sacrilegious a
breach of friendship, that Lawiers
have hightned its punishment, from
that of ordinar murther, to that of
treason; and the grossest of Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
have confest this dissimulation to
be so horrid a crime, that it was not
to be committed for a lesse hire then
that of a Kingdom: Whereas ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
persons have their escapes, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
pitied then punished, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these escapes are imputed to no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93165:10"/>
abiding habit, and because it is not to
be feared that they will offend for the
future, seing what they last failed in,
was not the effect of any innate and
permanent quality, but was a transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and designless frailty.</p>
            <p>Dissimulation is from this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
more painful then the Vertue
which it emulats, that the Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
is oblidged not only so to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
as that these whom he intends
to cheat, may believe him serious;
but so likewise, as that others may
understand that he is not serious:
Thus I have my self seen a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who dissembled a love and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for one whom he was oblidged
to perswade that she was his Mistriss,
act so ccovertly that perfidious part,
that his real Mistriss, was really jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
that he dissembled with her, and
not with the other: And to remove
this, put the Gallant to as much new
pains as his former cheat had cost him.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93165:11"/>
And I have heard of the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
though in different actions;
As of a Rebel, who counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Loyalty so, that his Complices
did really distrust his fixedness to
these damn'd Principles which he still
retained. And in ordinary conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ye will often find, that in dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
with the one party, ye lose still
the other; and it is impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
them who are so lost, but by a
shamefull discovery of the former
cheat: and after all that losse, this
doubt is still left, How can I know
but this man dissembles with me,
who is so exquisite in that Art, as
even to have made me jealous, that
his dissimulation was not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit?<note place="margin">Vertue requires fewer instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then vice</note>
            </p>
            <p>Let us a little consider how few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
Vertue requires, and we
will find it easie to be Vertuous: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
no Arms, Exchequer, Guards,
nor Garrison; It is all these to it self,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93165:11"/>
in every sense wherein it needs them:
whereas Vice is a burden to its vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as well in the abundance of those
attendants which it requires, as in the
difficulty of those attainments which
it proposes. And this is that happy
Topick, from which our wise Saviour
reproved <hi>Martha,</hi> when he told her,
<hi>that she wearied her self about many
things, whereas there was one thing
necessary.</hi> By which, seing he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
Devotion, I may well press
from it the excellency of Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
The ambitious man is obliged
to have his House planted with a
Wood of Partizans, as well to secure
that condition which so many envy
and rival, as to magnifie himself by
so unequall'd attendance. This desire
to command, made <hi>Hannibal</hi> force a
passage through the Rocky Alps;
<hi>Cesar</hi> to commit himself to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a stormy Sea, and so many wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Journeys. This obliged <hi>Xerxes</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93165:12"/>
to entertain vast Navies. And <hi>Darius</hi>
such Armies, as reduced all mankind
into one Incorporation. And so much
doth Ambition tie its dependers,
to depend upon such numbers, that
though that Armies of Laquays
which attend them, signifies no more
then so many following Ciphers; yet
the substracting of any one of these,
doth by so much lessen the value of
what they follow. Doth not Pride
require Flatterers? and these Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
Salaries, and the provision of
these Salaries, much pains and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
Doth it not require precedency,
a suitable estate and applause? And
are not these inattainable, without
more toil and fatigue, then any thing
that Vertue enjoynes? Covetousness
requires Assiduous Drudgery, and
Mines as bottomless as the desires
which craves them: It craves every
thing which others have, and every
thing which it self can imagine. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93165:12"/>
seeks only after what is unusual,
and what is rare. It must in <hi>Apicius,</hi>
crave food from the <hi>Indies,</hi> fetcht to
<hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Heliogablus</hi> Fishes when far
from the Sea, and more for one belly,
then might enrich thousands of Nob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Creatures. Lust requires plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Women, abundance of strength,
numbers of Pimps, and much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Whereas Vertue craves only
what is fit, and perswades us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that only to be fit, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And the Philosopher going by well
and rich furnish'd Shops, could cry out
with pleasure, Oh! How many things
are there, of which I stand not in need?
Not only are these many Instruments
troublesome, because they are super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
but likewise, because by their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93165:13"/>
number they add to these natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
under which even Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men are weighted, as long as they
are men. These who have so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Families, cannot remove
when their necessity calls them, but
they must expect till their retinue be
ready, and when these are prepared,
it is no easie clogg to draw so many
after them; or when any misfortune
overtakes any of these many, they
must suffer in these, as oft as each of
these suffers in themselves; and their
miseries are augmented by every new
Increment that is added to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
A great Treasure is not only an

or betrayed, but is likewise
uneasie to be transported: And <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
many Baggs are overtaken, when
Moneyless <hi>Solon</hi> escapes with safety.
I shall then conclude, that Vertue is
easier then Vice, because it requires
fewer Instruments.</p>

cause it cannot find them at home.
Covetousnesse must scorch in the
<hi>Indies</hi> its suiters; it must freez them
in <hi>Nova Zembla;</hi> it terrifies them at
Sea, and Shipwracks them upon the
Shore. Whilst Vertue recommends
to us, to seek our happiness in no
forraign pleasures: And <hi>Diogenes</hi>
finds without danger in his Tubb,
what these Sailers pursue in their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Bottoms. But Vice might
plead it self less guilty, if its designs
were only difficult, but difficulty is
not all, for Vice either requires what
is impossible, or what by not being
bounded, may very easily become so.
Covetousness makes nothing enough,
and proposes not only what may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie,
but what may be acquired.
Ambition likewise will have every
man to be highest, which is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
because there cannot be many
highests; and the first attainer leaves
nothing to his implacable rivals, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93165:14"/>
the impatience of being disappointed,
which not only disquiets their present
ease, but begets in them projects of
attaquing him by whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves vanquisht. And
these designs being formed, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whose judgements is much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
by interest (which like fir'd
Powder, flees out, not alwayes where
it should, but where it may) and
against persons already secured, by
Power, Fame, Law, and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
they ripen into no other
issue, then a last ruine to these, who
were so foolish, as not to satisfie their
present humour with their present
fortune.</p>
            <p>Philosophers have divided all
Vices into these,<note place="margin">Vice in defect and in excesse are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually uneasie.</note> which consist in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and these which imply a defect,
the one shooting as far over the mark
as the other comes short of it; and if
we compare Vertue with either of
these, we will find it more easie then
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93165:14"/>
either, for as to these which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach
Vertue, they must be as much
more uneasie then it, as they exceed
it; for having all in them which that
Vertue possesses which they exceed,
they must require either in acquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or maintenance, all the pains that
the exceeded Vertue exacts. Thus
prodigality requires all the spending,
and pains that liberality needs, and
running equally with it all it's length;
it begins to require more pains and
travel where it out-shoots the other,
and thus prodigality bestowes not
only enough as liberality does, but
it lavishes out more then is fit, taking
for the standard of it's bounty, all that
it hath to bestow, and not either
what it self can spare, or what it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
needs: Jealousie pains it self
more, then true love, with all those
extravagancies, which are so unsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the party loved, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
to the lover himself, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93165:15"/>
Physitians have accounted this a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and the Law hath made it a
crime. As to these Vices, which by
being placed in defect, seem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
as much lesse trouble then the
Vice they fall short of, as the others
require more, because of their excess;
yet so uneasie is Vice, that even these
though they exceed not vertue in their
measures, do yet exceed it in their toil:
For nature designs accomplishment
in all it's productions, and therefore
frets, and is disquieted at these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature
effects; and is as much more
wounded by these, then by vertuous
productions, as the grafts are by being
spoiled of their greener fruits, or as a
women is by her too early birth.
We see a miser more cruciat by his
scanting penuriousnesse, then a noble
person by his generous liberality, for
these are oblieged to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of these occasions of spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(a task great enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93165:15"/>
men endeavour, both out of envy, and
out of humour and sport, to draw
them unto these snares) and when
they are within their own circle, they
are forced by that restlesse Vice, to
descend to thousand of tricks, which
are as wearieing, as unhandsome.
I have seen some so careful of their
estates, that they brook'd better to
have their names and souls burden'd
then these, and to preserve which
they were at more trouble then any
can have the faith to beleeve, besides
these who had the humour to do so:
If to hold or draw with our full force
be a trouble, both these are the
posturs of covetousnesse, where-with
it is kept upon constant guard, and in
continual employment; and if at any
time they remit any thing of that
anxiety, they repine at their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence,
and imagine that they lost
as much as they hoped once to have
gain'd. Fear is the defect of courage,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93165:16"/>
but yet it is more uneasie then cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and really this alone has more
uneasienesse, then all the fraterny of
Vertues, for Vertue is at worst bussied
about, what is; but fear bogls at
what is not,<note place="margin">Vices oppose one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, whereas each Vertue assists its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</note> equally with what is.</p>
            <p>Vice likewise is therefore lesse
easie then Vertue, because it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
only an aime, which is fixt
and stable, whil'st vice and fancy
leavs us to an indetermination, that is
uneasie as well as dangerous, when it
hath prest us, to make Armies fall as
sacrificed to the idol of our Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for humouring of that passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to bring Cities as well as Men
level with the ground: Then it will
in the next thought perswade us,
even to laugh at our Ambition, and
to exchange it for love to a Mistriss
or Companionrie as it once serv'd
the otherwise <hi>Great Alexander.</hi>

such amongst themselves, that not
only they interfeer not with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
but the exercise likewise of the
one, facilitats the practice of the
others; thus whilst we practice tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
we learn to be just, because
temperance is the just measure of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying,
and using all contingents;
and we learn by it to be patient, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
being a temperance in grief,
sorrow or affliction: Patience is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the exercise of fortitude, and
fortitude is a just proportion of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and a temperat exercise of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And this occasion'd the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
to terme this noble alliance,
the <hi>golden chain of Vertue,</hi> each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
linkt with, and depending upon
it's fellow. But if we turn the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
we will find that though dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be a special Vice so character'd,
yet all Vices, have somewhat of that
ill natur'd humour in them; and
agree in nothing, besides that each of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93165:17"/>
them disagree with each other,
which makes the practice of them
both tedious and disagreeable, for all
of them consisting, the one in excess,
the other in defect; they cannot but
disagree, excess and defect being in
themselves most contrary: thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality
opposes avarice, cowardlieness
courage, and fondnesse hatred; and as
vertuous persons have a kindness for
one another, because the object of
their love requires, as well as admitts
rivals, so Vice endeavouring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse
what it pursues, makes rivals
altogether unsupportable. Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pouses on each of it's dependers to
be chiefe, and yet allows only one of
these many to enjoy, what it makes
all of them desire. Thus avaric's
task is to impropriat the possession of
what was created, and is necessary to
be distribute amongst many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands:
And envy will not only have
its Master to be full of applause, but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93165:17"/>
will likewise starve the desires, and
merits of others, judging that it self
cannot be happy if others be. Vice
then must be less easie then Vertue,
because it hath moe enemies then
Vertue; and because the Vertues are
more harmonious amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
then Vices are.</p>
            <p>Vices not only make enemies to
themselves,<note place="margin">Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists vice</note> but by a Civil War (as
a just judgement upon them) they
destroy one another, providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
thereby, to hinder the
growth of what, though it prosper
not well, yet is already too noxious to
mankind; and upon the same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of kindness to what bears his
image, GOD Almighty, and His
Providence, do design the unsucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Vice, as being obstructive
of his glory, as well as destructive to
his creatures, being equally thereto
engaged, by a love to his own honour
and service, and by a hatred as well
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93165:18"/>
to these who commit Vice, as to
the Vice which is committed. Thus
GOD confounded those Tongues who
had spoke so much blasphemy against
him, whilst they were endeavouring
to raise a Tower as high as their sins.
And when <hi>David</hi> intended to spill
<hi>Nabals</hi> blood, GOD is said to have
stopt him from being an unjust Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,
whom he intended to make
a most just Judge. And since <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi>
Asse opened its mouth to speak
this truth, they must be more stupid
then Asses, who will not believe it.</p>
            <p>The Law likewise by its punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">The Law makes Vice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie.</note>
contributes all its endeavours
to crush Vice, and to arrest its success,
forbidding by its Edicts, any person
to assist it, and making not only as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
but counsel; not only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
but connivance; not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance,
but concealment of it, to
be in most cases so criminal, that all
the honours which Vice promiseth,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93165:18"/>
or the treasures it gives, cannot be
able to redeem those who are found to
have slighted this prohibition. Must
it not then be difficult to be vitious?
where Assistants and Counsellours are
so over-aw'd, and the intenders so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
that few will ingage as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
and these who do, are so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
by fear, that vitious projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
are as little to expect success, as
vertuous persons are to wish it for
them. And to evidence how much
opposition the Law intends for Vice,
it not only punishes Vice with what it
presently inflicts, but it presumes
it still guilty for the future, <hi>semel
malus, semper praesumitur malus;</hi> and
upon that prsumption many vitious
persons have suffered for that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they were otherwayes innocent.
Though Rebellion hath promising
charms, to allure the Idolaters of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and Fame, yet the Law doth
so far stand against it, that few will

concur with the contrivers, except
such fools as have not the wit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it, or some desperat persons,
with whom few will joyn, because they
are known to be discontent, &amp; though
revenge relishes blood with a pleasing
smack; yet the severity of excellent
Laws cools much of that inhumane
heat, and lessens the pleasure, by
sharpening the punishment. Vice
then must be uneasie, seing the Law
opposes it, and renders its Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
dangerous,<note place="margin">Men are in inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to oppose Vice and so it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie</note> as well as odious.</p>

though the pressure of a present
temptation, overcomes them so far
as to commit what they dissallow,
yet they do it but infrequently and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93165:19"/>
with so many cheks from within, as
that it's commission cannot be
thought easie: Consider, how
amongst men, we hate even these
Vices in others, which we are guilty
of our selves, and how we even hate
these Vices in others, by which we
our selves reap no small advantage.

that much pains and discourse will
not perswade us to beleeve one who
uses to lye, whil'st we will soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve

who uses not to abuse our trust; few

with how much art and pains,
such as are guilty of Vice, endeavour
to shun all discourses, that can renew
to them the least reflection upon
their former failings, and how they
most often times disobliege their
own envy and malice, in not daring
to vent or reproach others with that
guilt, which might be easily retorted;
and thus vitious men have as many
masters, as their vices have witnesses:
and though they are bold enough to
commit vice, yet they often times
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93165:21"/>
want the courage to own it; and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
if conscious to these crimes,
become thereby necessar to their
masters, nor do wicked and vitious
persons fear only such as do, but
(which is more extensive) such as
may know their Vices, and tremble at
'tis memory, as if the Sun or Moon
would divulge their secrets, and
by accident they have oft confest
crimes upon mistakes, and have made
apologies for that whereof they
were not accus'd, which hath made
the Confessors to be laught at for
their error, as well as hated for their
crimes.</p>
            <p>Another Argument to inforce that
Vertue is more easie then Vice,<note place="margin">It is more natural to be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then vitious</note> is,
that seing nature is the spring of all
operations, certainly that must be
most easie, which is most natural;
and when we would expresse any thing
to be easie to a person or nation,
we say, it is natural to them, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93165:21"/>
are uneasie and difficult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they run the counter-tract of
nature, being either above, against or
beside it's assistance: But so it is
that Vertue is a more natural operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then Vice, both because it lesse
infests nature then Vice does, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
nature discovers more of a bent
to act vertuously then vitiously,
which are the only two senses in
which any thing is said to be <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That vertue of these two prejudges
nature least, is clear from this, that
sobriety cherisheth it, when it is run
down by intemperance, murder kills
it, gluttony choaks it, and jealousie
keeps it not alive but to torment it;
and generally when ever Nature is
distrest, it flyes to Vertue, either for
Protection, as to Courage, Justice
and Clemency, or for recovery, as to
Temperance, Industry and Chastity:
Few gray hairs owe their whitenesse,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93165:22"/>
except to that innocence whose Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
it is, Rapine, oppression, and
these other Vices, hightening their
insolence against man, to that point,
that he must serve them in being his
own Burrior, to be commended for
nothing else, save that they rid the
World of such who came only to it,
to deface that glorious Fabrick,
whereof the Almighty resented so
the pleasure of having created it, that
he appointed a day of each seven to
celebrat its Festivals. Are not some
sins said to be <hi>sins against our own
bodies?</hi> Not because all are not so
in some measure, but because some
are so in so eminent a measure, that
the Apostle, who knew much of all
mens inclinations, thought that there
being so much such, was enough to
restrain such persons from committing
them, as were yet so wicked, as not
to obey a Saviour who died for them.
And why is it that Laws are so severe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93165:22"/>
against Vice? but because it destroys
and corrupts the Members of the
Common-wealth? I have oft, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
of the Precepts of Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme,
which forbids me to be so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminat,
as to pity any thing, and
notwithstanding of the principles of
Justice, which forbids me to pity
persons who are flagitious, yet been
driven to that excess of compassion
for the state of vitious persons, that I
have no more remembred even the
wrongs that they have done me, to
see the Pox wear out a face which had
been so oft Fairded, and the Gout
felter feet, that as the Psalmist says,
<hi>were swift to do ill,</hi> are but too ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
encounters to excite compassion:
But to see the Wheel fatned with the
marrow of tortured miscreants, and the
Rack pull to pieces these Receptacles
of Vice, are great instances how great
an enemy Vice is to Nature; under
whose ill conduct, and for whose er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93165:23"/>
it suffers torments, which are
much sooner felt then exprest.</p>
            <p>Since then Nature is so oppos'd by
Vice, it cannot be it self so unwise in
the meanest of these many degrees
which we ascribe to many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
whom it makes wise, if it
disposed not mankind to entertain
an aversion for Vice, which is so much
its enemy. Shall the Sheep, the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
of all Animals, or the earth, the
dullest of all the elements, flee from its
oppressors? And shall Nature, which
should be wiser then these, because
it bestowes these inclinations upon
them, which makes them pass for
wise, be so imprudent, as not to
mould men so, as to incline them to
hate Vice, which so much hurts it?
Is there any Vice committed, to which
we may not find another impulsive
cause then Nature? And are not
most Vices either committed by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
by being mistaken for good,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93165:23"/>
by interest, or inadvertence, as shall
be shewed in the close of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course?
And seing Nature designs
to do nothing in vain, it is not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
that it should prompt us to
Vice, wherein nothing but vanity
can be expected, or from which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else can be reapt. These who
are so injurious to Nature (because
it appears Nature hath been less libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to them, of understanding, then
to others) as to fasten this reproach
upon it, of inclining men to Vice, do
contradict themselves, when they
say that Nature is satisfied with little,
and desires nothing that is superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
whereas all these Vices which
consist in excess, do stretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to superfluity; whilst upon the
other side, these Vices which consist
in defect, are yet as unnatural, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in these the committers deny
themselves what is necessary for
them, and so are most unnatural:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93165:24"/>
Nature desiring to see every thing
accomplish'd in its just proportions,
and satisfied in its just desires.</p>
            <p>All Vices have their own peculiar
diseases,<note place="margin">Each Vice brings a special disease.</note> to which they inevitably
lead; Envy brings men to a leanness,
as if it were fed with its Masters flesh,
as well as with its enemies failings;
Lust the Pox and Consumptions;
Drunkenness Catarhes and Gouts,
and Rage, Feavers and Phrensies;
which is a demonstration of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness,
and incommodiousness: And
I might almost say, that those Vices
are like Frogs, Lice, and other des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable
and terrible insects, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and kneaded out of excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humors; Lust is occasioned by
the superfluity and heat of the Blood;
Drunkenness by a dryness of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels;
and Rage by the corruption and
exuberancy of Choler. Consider
how much the grimaces of anger dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figures
the sweetest face, how much
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93165:24"/>
rage discomposes our discourse, and
by these and its other postures, ye will
find Vice an enemy to Nature: So
that in all these, Nature labours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some distemper, and is distrest in
its operations, and acts them not out
of choice, but as sick men rise to hunt
for what their Physitians deny them.
And from all this it follows, that vice
is neither natural in its productions,
nor in its tendencies, not being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by Nature in the one, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to preserve Nature in the
other.</p>
            <p>I confesse there is a rank of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which are supernatural, such as
Faith, Hope and Repentance, but
either there could be no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinction
of these from such as I
treat of, else these of which I hear
speak, must be natural; To deny
our selves, if we will follow Christ;
and that flesh and blood did not teach
<hi>Peter,</hi> to emit that noble confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93165:25"/>
of Christs being the Son of the
Eternal GOD, proves that some spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
truths, are above the reach of
reason, yet with relation to those
other moral Vertues, that same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Volumne assures us, <hi>that the

               <hi>do by
nature the things contained in the
Law, these not having the Law, are
a Law unto themselves, which shew
the work of the Law written in their
hearts, the Conscience also bearing
witnesse, and their Thoughts in the
mean time accusing, or else excusing
one another;</hi> and elsewhere the
wicked are said to be without <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 31.</note> are not all sins even in
the dialect of Philosophers and Law-givers,
as well as in the Language of
<hi>Canaan</hi> termed unnatural? What is
Paricide, Ingratitude, Oppression,
Lying <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the subversion of
these Lawes, whereof our own hearts
are the Tables? Doth not Nature,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93165:25"/>
by giving us Tongues to express our
thoughts, teach us, that to disguise
our thoughts, or to contradict them,
is to be unnatural: And seing the not
acknowledgement of favours, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs
the future relief of our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it must be as unnatural to be
ungrate, as it is natural to provide
supplies for our craving wants.</p>
            <p>I will not fully exhaust the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that wait upon Vice,<note place="margin">The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence makes Vice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie.</note> by telling
you, that no man who is really viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
sinneth without reluctancy in
the commission; But I must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
tell you, that though all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
disadvantages were salv'd,
yet the natural horrour which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
from the commission of Vice, is
great enough to render it a miracle,
that any man should be vitious, our
Conscience can condemn us without
Witnesses, though we bribe off all
Witnesses from without, or though
by Sophistry and Art, we render their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93165:26"/>
Depositions insuccessful: And though
Remissions can secure us against all
external punishments, yet the Arm
of that Executioner cannot be stopt;
and if ye consider how men become
thereby inconsolable, by the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of friends, and the advantage
of all exterior pleasures, ye cannot but
conclude that Vice is to be pitied, as
well as shun'd, and that this alone
makes it more uneasie then Vertue,
whereby the greatest of misfortunes
are sweetned, and outward torments,
by having their Prospect turned upon
future praise and rewards, rendered
pleasures to such as suffer them; and
are lookt upon as ornaments, by such
as see them inflicted, and draw praises
from succeeding ages.
<q>
                  <l>—Hic murus ahaeneus esto.</l>
                  <l>Nil conscire sibi, nulla palesscere

               </q>
was the determination of a Pagan,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93165:26"/>
who could derive no happinesse from
these Divine Promises upon which
we are obliged to rely for rewards;
which though they be too great to be
understood by the Sons of Men, yet
are not so great, but that they may
be expected by us, when we shall be
adopted to be the Sons of that GOD,
whose power to bestow, can be equal'd
by nothing, but by his desire to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie.
After successe hath crown'd
vitious designs, yet Vice meets with
this uneasinesse of remorse, wherein
the souls of men are made to forget
the pleasure of successe, and are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for having been successful: And
these will either not remember their
successe, in which case they want all
pleasure, or if they think upon them,
that thought will lead them back to
consider the guilt and basenesse to
which they owe it, which will vex
and fret them. Vertue afflicts at most
but the body, and in these pains, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93165:27"/>
consols us, but Vice afflicts
our Souls; and the Soul being more
sensible then the body (seing the
body owes its sensiblenesse to it.)
Certainly the torments of Vice must
be greatest, and this seems the reason
why our Saviour, in describing the
torments of Hell, placeth <hi>the worm
which never dies,</hi> before <hi>the fire that
never goeth out;</hi> And that the rebukes
of a natural Conscience, are of all
torments the most insupportable, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from this, that albeit death be
the most formidable of all torments
(men suffering Tortures, Physick,
Contumelies, Poverty, and the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of afflictions, to shun its encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
yet men in exchange of these,
will not only welcome Death, but
will assume it to themselves, adding
the guilt and infamy of self-murder,
the confiscation of an Estate, and the
infamous want of Burial, to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of an ordinary death; and al
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93165:27"/>
this to shift the present gnawings of
a Conscience. The horrours like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of a guilty Conscience doth in
this appear most disquieting, that
those who have their Conscience so
burden'd, do acknowledge, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confession, they find themselves
as much eased, as a sick Stomack is
relieved by vomiting up these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
whose disquietnesse maks
such as suffered them, rather sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
then Patients: Whereas what
ever be the present troubles which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth
from vertue, yet if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
not, they are tolerable; and if
they continue, custome, and the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of Philosophy will lessen their
weight, and at best, the pain is to be
but temporary, because the cause
from which they descend is but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany:
If they be not sharp and
violent, they are sufferable; and if
they be violent, they cannot last, or
at least the Patient cannot last long
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93165:28"/>
to endure them. Whereas these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
that disquiet us in Vice,
arising from the soul it self, cannot
perish whilst that hath any being.
And so the vitious soul must measure
its grief by the length of Eternity,
though Vice did let out its joys but
by the length of a moment, and did
not fill even the narrow dimensions
of that moment, with sincere joy;
the knowledge that these were to be
short lyv'd, and the fear of succeeding
torment, possessing much of that
little room.</p>
            <p>The first objection whose difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
deserves an answer,<note place="margin">Vertue si more pleasant then Vice.</note> is that Vertue
obliges us to oppose pleasurs, and to
accustome our selves with such ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors,
seriousnesse and patience, as
cannot but render it's practice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie;
and if the Readers own inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
supply not what may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
to this, it will require a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
that shall have no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93165:28"/>
besides its satisfaction, and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to shew by what means every man
may make himself easily happy, and
how to soften the appearing rigours
of Philosophy, is a design which if I
thought it not worthy of a sweeter
pen, should be assisted by mine, and for
which I have in my current experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
gather'd together some loose
reflections and observations, of whose
cogency I have this assurance; that
they have often moderated the weil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of my own straying inclinations,
and so might pretend to a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
ascendent over such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose
reason and temperament makes them
much more reclaimable: But at
present my answer is, that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
enjoyns not the crossing of our
own inclinations, but in order to
their accomplishment; and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
pleasure as it's end, as well as
Vice, though for it's more fixt esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment,
it sometimes commands
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93165:29"/>
what seems rude to such as are
strangers to it's intentions in them.
Thus temperance resolvs to highten
the pleasurs of enjoyment, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
us against all the insults of
excesse and oppressive loathing; and
when it lessens our pleasurs, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not to abridge them, but to
make them fit and convenient for us,
even as Souldiers, who though they
propose not wounds and starvings,
yet if without these they cannot
reach those Lawrels, to which they
climb, they will not so far disparage
their own hopes, as to think they
should fix them upon any thing
whose acquist deserve not the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these. Physick cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a cruel employment, because to
preserve what is sound, it will cut off
what is tainted; and these vitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whose laziness forms this doubt,
do answer it when they endure the
sicknesse of Drunkennesse, the toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93165:29"/>
of Avarice, the attendance of
rising Vanity, and the watchings
of Anxiety; and all this to satisfie incli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nations,
whose shortness allowes little
pleasure, and whose prospect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluds
all future hopes. Such as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
themselves by Anxiety (which
is a frequently repeated self murther)
are more tortour'd, then they could
be by the want of what they pant
after; that long'd for possession of a
Neighbours estate, or of a publick
employment, maks deeper impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of grief by their absence, then
their enjoyment can repair; and a
Philosopher will sooner convince
himself of their not being the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar
integrants of our happinesse,
then the miser will by all his assidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
gain them.</p>
            <p>There are but three instances of
time, and in each of these, vitious
persons are much troubled; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of usual insuccessefulness, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93165:30"/>
or inconveniences do torment
before the commission; horrour,
trembling and reluctancy do terrifie
in the act, and conscience succeeds to
these after commission, as the last,
but not the least of these unruly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And as to the pleasurs of
Vice, it can have none in any of these
parcels of time, beside the <hi>present,</hi>
which present, is by many Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
scarce allowed the name of
time; and is at best so swift, that it's
pleasurs most be too transient to be
possest. I confess that revenge is the
most inticeing of all Vices, and so
much so, that a wicked <hi>Italian</hi> said,
that GOD Almighty had reserv'd it
to himself, because it was too noble
and satisfying a Prerogative to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon mortals; yet it discharges
at once it's pleasure with it's fury, and
like a bee languishes after it hath
spent it's sting, and when it is once
acted, which is oft in one moment,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93165:30"/>
it ceaseth from that moment to be a
pleasure and such as were tickled
once with it, are afraid of it's remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
and think worse of it, then
they did formerly of the affront, to
expiat which, it was undertaken;
Thirty Pieces of Silver might
have had some letchery in them at
<hi>Iudas</hi> first touch, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved
to have a very unresembling
effect, when he took no longer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in them, then to have come the
next week to offer them back: and
because they were refused, to rid
himself of his life and them together.</p>
            <p>The pains of Vice may be conlud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
greater then these of Vertue, from
this, that vertuous persons are in
their sufferings assisted by all the
world, vitious persons doing so to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat
their own crimes, and vertuous
persons doing the same, to reward
the Vertue they adore: and if these
endeavours prove insuccessful, every
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93165:31"/>
man by bearing a share in their grief,
do all they can to lessen it; but vitious
persons have their sufferings augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the disdain, and just oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bries
thrown upon them by such as
were witnesses to their Vices; and such
as had any inclination for them, dare
not appear to be their well-wishers,
least they be repute Complices of
their crimes.</p>
            <p>I need not fear so much weaknesse
in this my Theam, as to bring up a
thousand of these instances to its aid,
that ly every where obvious to the
least curious observation. What is
more laborious then Pride? wherein
by robbing from others what is due to
them, the acquirers are still obliged
to defend their new Conquests with
more vigilance, then Vertue needs?
The proud man must be greater then
all others, and so must toil more
then they all, his task being greater
then all theirs joyntly. And the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93165:31"/>
man must never be satisfied, till
he know not only what is truth, but
what he fears to be so, being most
unhappy in this, that if he get assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of what he suspects, then he is
made really miserable; or if he attain
not to that assurance, he must still
toil for it, and must make himself
miserable by his pains, till he become
really so, by being inform'd of what
at one instant he wishes to be false, and
endeavours to make true. Revenge
is most painful, both in perswading
us that these are affronts, which of
their own nature are no affronts, and
then in bringing on us much more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
then their satisfaction can repay:
For one word spoke to us, which (it
may be) the speaker intended as no
injury, how many have by murdering
the speaker, or some such rash at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
deprived themselves of the
priviledge of seeing their friends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
horrour, or of coming abroad
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93165:32"/>
without imminent danger, skulking
in dens like theeves, imprisoned for
fear of prison, and dying daily to shun
the death they fear. Whereas <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
by laughing at him who spat
in his face, had then the pleasure to
see himself at present satisfied, and
did foresee the hopes of future praises.
Guiltinesse must search out corners,
it must at all rates secure favorits, it
must shun to meet with such as are
conscious to its guilt, and when ever
two men speak privatly in presence of
such as are vitious, they perswade
themselves that somewhat is there
spoke to their disadvantage; and like
one who labours of a sore, they must
still be carefull that their wound be
not toucht.</p>
            <p>To conclude then this Period, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that every thing that is uneasie
must be unpleasant, and that Vice is
more uneasie then Vertue, appears
from the whole foregoing Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:93165:32"/>
I hope the preceeding Discourse
hath cleared off all these doubts that
can oppose this (though new) yet
well founded truth,<note place="margin">Why most men are viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> leaving only
this objection here to be answered.
If Vice be lesse easie, and lesse na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
then Vertue; why do the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part of mankind range themselves
to its side? leaving Vertue as few
followers, as it professes to desire ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers?
In answer whereto, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that this objection proves men
to be mad, but not Vice to be easie;
even as when we see men throw away
their cloaths, run the fields over, and
expose themselves to storms, leaving
their convenient homes, and kind
family: we conclude such as do so to
be mad, but are not induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that what they do is easie.
And certainly Vice is a madness, as
may appear convincingly from this,
that when we see others run to these
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93165:33"/>
excesses (which we thought Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
in our selves, when we were
acting the like) we ask them seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
What, are ye mad? And
<hi>Hazael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 8. 13</note> when the cruelty he was
to (and did) commit, was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
him by the Prophet, did with
admiration ask, <hi>What? am I a
Dog, that I should do these things!</hi>
And the Prodigal, when he freed
himself from these vitious roavings,<note place="margin">Luke 15 17</note>
is said to have <hi>come to himself;</hi> by
which word Madnesse is usually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest:
Men are said to be mad, when
they offer violence to their Body;
and it is a more advanc'd degree of
madnesse, to offer violence to our
Souls, which we then do (besides
the ruining of our Bodies) when we
are Vitious. And to such as prefer
their Bodies to their Souls, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Survey of such Bodies, as
have wasted themselves in Stews and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93165:33"/>
Taverns, or have left Limbs upon
the Field where they last quarrelled
after Cups, for Vanity, or Mistrisses.
The second answer is, that men mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
ofttimes Vice for Vertue, and
are inticed to it by an error in their
Judgements, rather then any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravedness
in their Affections. Thus
Drunkenness recommends it self to
us, under the notion of kindness;
and Prodigality, under that of Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality:
Complacency likewise is the
great Pimp of much Vitiousness to
well disposed persons, and many are
by it inticed to erre, to gratifie a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in their friendship, for they are
perswaded that friendship and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are so innocent and sweet quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that it cannot command what
is not as just as it self.</p>
            <p>Custome also, as it is a second na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so it is a Step-mother to
Vertue, and whil'st we endeavour
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93165:34"/>
to shune the Vice of being <hi>vain,</hi>
and <hi>singular,</hi> we slip into these
Vices which are too familiar to be
formidable, and which we would
not have committed if the mode
and fashion had not determin'd us
thereto against our first and pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations;
thus the <hi>Germans</hi> beleeve
Drinking to be kindnesse, and the
<hi>Italian</hi> is by the custome of his
Countrey induc'd not to tremble
at, but to love <hi>Sodomie.</hi> We have
<hi>interest</hi> likewise to blame, for much
of that wickednesse, which we falsly
charge upon nature: For this brib's
us to oppose what naturally we
would follow, but above all want of
consideration, is the frequent occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of many of these disorders, so
that Vertue is not postpon'd by
choice, but by negligence; neither
would it be more difficult for us to be
vertuous in many of our actions, then
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93165:34"/>
it would be for us to consider what
we are about to do. And I may seal
up this Period with the blunt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
made by a poor woman, who
after her affection and interest had
forced from her many passionat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates
against her sons debordings,
concluded thus, alace! my son will
never recover, for he cannot <hi>think:</hi>
therefore I must conclude, that seing
it is easie to think, it must be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
easie to be vertuous.</p>
            <p>It is indeed hard for one who is
drunk to stand upright, or for one
who hath his eyes cover'd with mire
to see clearly; and yet, standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
or seeing clearly, are not in
themselves difficult tasks: Just so
Vertue is easie in it self, though our
pre-ingagement to the contrary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
rather then to the Vice it self,
renders it's operations somewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie;
whereas, if we had once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued
our Souls with a habit of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93165:35"/>
it's exercise would be far easier
to us, then that of it's contrary; for
it would be assisted by reason, nature,
reward and applause, all which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the other. He who becomes
temperate, finds his temperance
much lesse troublesome, then the
most habitual drunkard can his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
who can never render it so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar,
but that he will be constrain'd
to make faces when he quaffs off a
tedious health, and will at some times
find either his quarrels, the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his friends secret, or his crudities
to importune him. No lyar hath
so much accustomed himself to that
trade, but he will discover himself
sometimes in his blushes, and will be
oft distress'd, to shape out covers for
his falseness; whereas he who is free
from the bondage of that habit, will
alwayes find it so easie, that he will
never hear a lie, without admiring
with what confidence it could have
been forg'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:93165:35"/>
Whereas to know the easinesse of
Vertue, we need only this reflection,
that every vitious person thinks it
easie to conquer the Vice he sees in
another: He who whoors admires
the uneasiness and unpleasantness of
drinking; and the Drunkard laughs
at the fruitless toil of ambition, which
shews that Vice is an easie conquest,
seing the meanest persons can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
it.</p>
            <p>Though truth and newness do of all
other motivs court us soonest to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
and that my present Theme
can without vanity pretend to
both; yet so studious am I of success,
where I have a tenderness for the
Subject for which I contend, that for
further conviction of it's enemies,
I must recommend to them to go to
the Courts of Monarchs, and there
learn the uneasiness and unpleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Vice, from it's splitting those
in Oppositions and Factions, which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93165:36"/>
affoord the reasonable on-lookers as
disagreeable a prospect,<note place="margin">These proves the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness also of private quarrels and ill humors,</note> as that of a
ship-wrackt Vessel. And when
Faction has once dismembred a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
is it not strange to see what
pains and anxiety must be shewed by
both opposites, to discover and ruine
each others projects? Other men
toil only to make themselves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
but those must labour like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to keep their opposites from
being so; they must seek applause
for themselves, and must stop it from
their enemies; they must shun all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where these are entertained, and
all occasions which may bring them
to meet though inclination or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
do extreamly bend them
to go thither: they must oppose
the friends of their enemies, though
they be desirous and oblieg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many other scores to do them
good Offices: they grow pale at
their appearances, and are disordered
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93165:36"/>
at what praise is given those, though
bestowed upon them for promoving
that publick good wherein the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners
share for much of their own
safety: and it is most ordinar to hear
such factious Zealots swear, that they
would choise rather to be destroyed
by a publick Enemy, then preserv'd
by a Rival. From all which it is
but too clear, that all vitious persons
are slaves; which as it is the unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest
of states, so to shun a loss of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
most men refuse to be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
If we go to Physitians we will
find their shambles hung round with
the Trophies of Vice: For Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
Chastity or the other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
send few thither, but wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
repayes there it's one moments
pleasure with a years cure, and makes
them afraid to see that disfigured
face, for whose representation they
once doted upon their flattering mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
There lye such prisoners as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93165:37"/>
the drunken Gout hath fetter'd, and
there lye louring such as Gluttony
hath opprest. Let us go to Prisons
and Scaffolds, and there we will see
such furnisht out with the envoyes
of injustice, malice, revenge and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Let us go to Divines, and
they will tell us of the horrid excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of such, as have upon death-bed
seen mustered before them, those
sins, which how soon they had their
vizards of sensuality and lust pulled
off, did appear in figures monstruous
enough to terrifie a Soul which took
leisure to consider them.</p>

            <p>And though the consciences of

so deafned with warlike sounds or
welcome applauses, that they cannot
hear; and their eyes so cover'd with

neither could the wrongs done to

his cruelty, but that he and his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers

Philosophers Cell or House (for
Vertue is not like Vice, confin'd to
places) and there ye will see measurs
taken by no lesse noble or lesse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Pattern, then Nature. His
Furniture is not the off-spring of
the last fashion, and so he must not
be at the toil, to keep Spies for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
him, when the succeeding
mode must cause these be pull'd
down, and needs not be troubled, to
fill the room yearly of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
stuffe he but lately admir'd.
He is not troubl'd that anothers
Candlesticks are of a later mould, nor
vext, that he cannot muster so many
Cabinets or Knacks as he does.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93165:38"/>
He spends no such idle time as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for making great entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein Nature is opprest to
please fancy, and must be by the next
days Physick tortur'd to cure its er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors:
His Soul lodges cleanly,
neither clouded with the vapours,
nor cloy'd with the crudities of his
Table; he applyes every thing to
it's natural use, and so uses meat and
drink not to expresse kindnesse
(friendship doing that office much
better) but to refresh, and not to
occasion his weaknesse. His dreams
are neither disturb'd by the horrid
representation of his last days crims,
nor by the too deep impressions of
the next days designs, but is calm as
the Breast it refreshes, and pleasant
as the rest it brings; his eyes suffer
no such eclipse in these, as the eyes
of vitious men do, when they are
darkened with Drunkennesse or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
sorrow, for all his darknesses
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93165:39"/>
succeed as seasonably to his recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the day is followed in by the
night In his Cloaths, he uses not
such as requires two or three hours
to their laborious dressing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or which
over-awe the wearer so, that he
must shun to go abroad to all places,
or at all occasions, least he offend
their lustre; but he provides himself
with such as are most easie for use,
and fears not to stain these, if he keep
his Soul unspotted: He considers his
Body and Organs, as the casement
and servants of that reasonable Soul
he so much loves; and therefore he
eases them, not upon design to please
them, but to refresh them, that the
soul may be thereby better serv'd; and
if at any time, he deny these their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
he designs not thereby to
tortoure them, for Gratitude ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
him to repay better their servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(and a man should not be cruel
even to his beast) but he does so,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93165:39"/>
lest they exceed these measours,
whose extent Vertue knowes better
to mark out then they; or else he
finds that during the time he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to these appetites, he may be
more advantagiously employ'd, in
enjoying the pure and spiritual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surs
of Philosophy. But leaving
this utter Court, let us step into a
Philosophers breast (a Region as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
as the Heaven whence it came)
and there view, how sweet Vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires
gentle thoughts, whose storms
raise not wrinckles like billowes in
our face, and blow not away our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged
friends. Here no mutinous
passion rebells with successe, and
these petty insurrections of flesh and
blood, serve only to magnifie the
strength of reason in their defeat.
Here, all his desires are so satisfied
with Vertue as their reward, that
they need, nor do not run abroad,
begging pleasurs from every unkown
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93165:40"/>
object: And therefore it is that not
placing his happinesse upon what
is subject to the Empire of fate,
capricious Fortune cannot make him
miserable, for it can resume nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but what it hath given, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
seing it hath not bestowed Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Tranquillity, it cannot call
it away; and whilst that remains
all other losses are inconsiderable,
and as no man is griev'd to see
what is not his own destroy'd, so
the Vertuous Philosopher, having
alwayes considered, what is without
him as belonging to Fortune, and not
to him, he sees those burnt or robb'd
with a dis-interested indifference:
and when all others are allarum'd
with the fears of ensuing Wars and
Invasions, he stands as fixt (though
not as hard) as a Rock, and suffers all
the foaming waves of fate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
to spend their spit and froth at
his feet: Vertue and the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93165:40"/>
of what he hath done, and the
hopes that he will still act vertuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are all his treasures, and these are
not capable of being pillag'd; these
are his inseparable companions, and
therefore he can never want a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising
conversation: And seing he is
a Citizen of the world, all places are
his Country, and he is alwayes at
home, and so can never be banished;
and seing he can still exercise his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
equally in all places, he is never
(like vitious persons) vext that he
must stay in one place, and cannot
reach another; like a sick man, whose
disease makes him alwayes tumble
through all the corners of his bed.
He is never surprized, because he
forecasts alwayes the worst; and as
this armes him against discontents,
So if a milder event disappoint his
apprehensions, this heightens his
pleasure. He lives without all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
except that one of obeying his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93165:41"/>
reason; and therefore it is that he
can never be miserable, seing such
are only so, who are cross'd in their
designs; and thence it is, that when
he hears that his actions displease the
world, he is not troubled, seing he
design'd not to please them and if
he see others carry wealthy pretences
to which he had a title, he is little
troubled, seing he design'd not to be
rich. The frowns or favours of
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>andees alter him not, seing he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fears the one, nor expects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
from the other. He desires
little, and so is easily happy, seing
these are without contraversie happy
who enjoy all they desire; and that
man puts himself in great debt, who
widens his expectations by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:
Thus, he who designes to buy
a neighbouring Field, must straiten
himself to lay up what will reach it's
price, as much as if he were debtor in
the like sum; and <hi>desire</hi> leaves still
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93165:41"/>
an emptiness which must be filled.
He finds not his breast invaded (like
such as are vitious) by contrary pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
envy sometimes perswading,
that others are more deserving, and
vanity assuring that none deserves
so much. His passions do not inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse
him with extream concern in
any thing; and seing he loves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
too well, he grieves at the loss
of nothing too much; joy and grief
being like the contrary motions of
a swing, or <hi>pendula,</hi> which must move
as far (exactly) to the one side, as it
run formerly to the other. He looks
upon all mankind as sprung from one
common stock with himself, and
therefore is as glad to hear of other
mens happiness, as others are to hear
of their kindred and relations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.
If he be advanced to be
a States-man, whilst he continues so,
he designes more to discharge well
his present trust, then to court a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93165:42"/>
higher, which double task burdens
such as are vitious; and having no
private design, if the publick which
he serves find out one fitter for the
employment, he is well satisfied, for
his design of serving the publick is
thereby more promoved. And if
he be preferr'd to be a Judge, he looks
only to the Law as his Square, and is
not distracted betwixt the desires to
be just, to please his friends, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
his dependers, and to advance
his private gain. The Philosopher
is not rais'd by his greatness above,
nor deprest by his misfortunes below
his natural level: For, when he is in
his grandure, he considers that men
come to him but as they go to foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
not to admire it's streams
(though clear as crystal) but to fill
their own pitchers; and therefore,
he is neither at much pains to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that state, nor to highten mens
esteem of it; but considers his own
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93165:42"/>
power as he does a River, whose
streams are always passing, and are
then only pleasant when they glide
calmly within their Banks. Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do not reach him, for his Vertue
places him upon a hight above their
shot, and what calumnies or offences
are intended for him, do but like the
vapo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs and fogs, that rise from the
earth, not reach the Heaven; but
fall back in Storms and Thunder up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place, from which they were
sent: Injuries may strick his buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
but cannot wound himself, who
is sensible of no wounds, but of those
his Vices gives him: And if a
Tyrant kill his body, he knows his
immaterial Soul cannot be stabb'd,
but is sure it will flee as high as the
Sphears (nothing but that clog of
Earth hindring it to move upward to
that it's Centre) and that from
thence, he will great <hi>Pompey</hi>
(in <hi>Lucan</hi>) smile down when he shall
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93165:43"/>
see with illuminat eyes his own
Trunck to be so inconsiderable a
peece of neglected Earth. And to
conclude, the Philosopher does in
all his actions go the straightest way,
which is because of that the shortest,
and therefore the easiest.</p>
            <p>When I have constellat all these
touring Elogies, which Gratitude
heaps upon it's benifactors, which
foolish Youths throw away upon
their Mistresses, and which Flatterers
buzze into the deprav'd ears of their
Patrons, when I have impoverisht
invention and empty'd eloquence of
their most floury ornaments. When
I shall have decocted the pains of a
whole writing age, into one Panegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
to bestow a Complement upon
Vertue, for the ease it gives us,
and the sweets of it's Tranquillity;
I shall have spent my time better,
then in serving the most wealthy
or recreating Vice; and yet I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93165:43"/>
Vertue by it lesse, then by
acting the least part of what is
reasonable, or gaining the soonest
reclaimable of such as are vitious.
And therefore I shall leave off to
write, that I may begin to act ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously;
though one of my Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may find a defence for writing
moral Philosophy, in the examples
of <hi>Cicero, Du Vair</hi> that famous French

thousands of others.</p>
            <p>I have (to deal ingenuously)
writ these two Essayes, to serve
my Country, rather then my Fame

successful, Heaven has nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

bless my wishes: but if these suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
not, I know nothing else
