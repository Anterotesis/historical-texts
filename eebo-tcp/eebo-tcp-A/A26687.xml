            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

upon God, casting their care and burden upon him. O the sweet breathings of <hi>Davids</hi> soul! the strong actings of his Faith and Love, that we find come from him, when his condition was low and mean in the World. How close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he cling? How fully doth he Relie upon God? The Holy Ghost seems to make it a Priviledge to be brought to a necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ty of living by Faith, as, I think, I have formerly hinted thee, out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 10, 11. Where <hi>Canaan</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before <hi>Ægypt,</hi> in regard of its dependance upon God for the former and latter Rain, which in <hi>Ægypt</hi> they could live without, and have supplies from the River. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly could we that are unexperienced, but feel the Thorns of those cares and troubles that there are in gathering and keeping much, and the danger when Riches increase of setting our hearts upon them, we should prize the happiness of a middle condition much before it. Doubtless, Godliness with contentment, is great gain. <hi>Seekest thou great things for thy self</hi> (saith the Prophet to <hi>Baruch</hi>) <hi>seek them not.</hi> Certainly a good Conscience is a continual Feast, and enough for a happy Life: no man that Wareth intangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen him to be a Souldier. We should be but little incumbred with the things of this World, and withal free from a world of intanglements, which in a great place committed wholly to our charge, would be upon our Consciences as no small Burden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I take this for an undoubted truth, that a dram of Grace, is better than a Talent of Wealth; and therefore such a place where our Consciences would be free, and we had little to do in the World to take off our hearts and thoughts from the things of Eternity, and had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of abundance of means, and the daily opportunities of warming our hearts with the blessed Society and Conference of Heavenly Christians, and no temptations to carry us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor discouragements in our walking with God, and the due performance of our duty is (if we pass a true and Spiritual Judgement, as the Holy Ghost in Scripture would) without comparison before another place, void of those Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual helps and advantages. Let us think with our selves, what though our Purses, our Estates, may thrive better
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44944:3"/>
in a place of a large maintenance? yet where are our graces, our souls, like to thrive any way answerable to what they are in this? We should have but little in the World, and we could live hereafter; but alas, what is this if it be made up to us, as it will surely be in Communion with God and his People? If we thrive in Faith, and Love, Humility, and Heavenly mindedness, as above all places I know we are likely to do there, what matter is it though we do not raise our selves in the World? the thing it may well be accounted but mean; but alas, let us look upon it with a spiritual Eye, and then we shall pass another Judgement of it. Oh! who would leave so much Grace, and so much comfort in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ and his Saints, as we may gain there, for the probabilities of living with a little more gentility and handsomness in the World? 'Tis a strange thing to see how Christians generally do judge so carnally of things, looking to the things that are seen and Temporal, and not the things that will stick by us to Eternity. What is it worth a year? is the Maintenance certain and sure? What charges are there like to be? these are the questions we commonly ask first, when we speak of setling. But alas, though those things are duly to be considered too, yet what good am I like to do? what good am I like to get? (Both which questions I think might be as comfortably Answered concerning this, as any place in <hi>England;</hi>) These should be the main interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the chief things we should judge of a place to settle in. What if we have but a little in the World? Why then we must keep but a short Table, and shall make but a little noise in the World, and must give the meaner entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to our Friends. O but will not this be abund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ntly made up, if we have more outward and inward Peace, as we may well count we shall have. One dram of saving Grace will weigh down all this. Let others Hug themselves in their Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, in their fat Livings, and their large Tables, and their great resort, if we have more of the Light of Gods Countenance, more grace, more comfort, who would change with them? surely if <hi>Paul</hi> were to chose a Place, he would not look so much what 'twas a year, but would wish us to take that where we might be most likely to save our own and others Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44944:4"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the best and the surest way to have any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mercy, is to be content to want it. When mens desires are over-eager after the World, they must have thus much a Year, and a House well Furnished, and Wife, and Children, thus and thus qualified, or else they will not be content; God doth usually, if not constantly, break their wills by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them, as one would cross a froward. Child of his stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born humour: or else puts a sting into them, that a man had been as good he had been without them, as a man would give a thing to a froppish Child, but it may be with a knock on his Fingers, and a frown to boot. The best way to get Riches, is out of doubt to set them lowest in ones desires. <hi>Solomon</hi> found it so: Alas, he did not ask riches, but wisdom and ability, to discharge his great Trust; but God was so pleased with his Prayer, that he threw in them into the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. If we seek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the first place, and leave other things to him, God will not stand with us for these outwards, though we never ask them we shall have them as over measure; God will throw them in as the Vantage. And to this suits the experience of our dear <hi>Honorathius:</hi> and indeed (saith he, speaking of God) <hi>Honorathius</hi> finds that his only hiding place and refuge, and a place of succour, from the storms that fall upon him, and hath had such helps at dead lift there, that he is engaged for ever to trust the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e. For when he hath been lowest, and in the greatest straights, he hath gone and made his moan Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward, with free submission to the rightful disposer of all things, and he hath been so liberally supplied, as makes him very confident the best way to obtain any Mercy, or supply, is to be content to be without it: And he is perswaded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing set Gods Mercies farther off, than want of free suhmis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to want them. Certainly, God will never be behind hand with us. Let our care be to build his House, and let him alone to build ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That none ever was, or ever shall be, a loser by Jesus Christ. Many have lost much for him, but never did, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall any lose by him. Take this for a certainty, whatsoever probabilities of outward comforts we leave, whatsoever out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantages we balk, that we may glorifie him in our Services, and enjoy him in his Ordinances more than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44944:4"/>
we could, we shall receive an hundred fold in this life. 'Tis a sad thing to see how little Christ is trusted or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the World: Men will trust him no farther then they can see him, and will leave no work for Faith. Alas, hath he not a thousand ways, both outward and inward, to make up a little outward disadvantage to us? What doth our Faith serve for? Have any ventured themselves upon him in his way, but he made good every word of the Promise to them? let us therefore exercise our Faith, and stay our selves upon the Promise, and see if ever we are ashamed of our hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That what is wanting in the means, God will make up in the blessing. This I take for a certain truth, while a man commits himself and his affairs to God, and is in a way that God put him into: Now if a man have but a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if he have a great Blessing, that's enough to make it up. Alas, we must not account Mercies by the Bulk. What if an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other have a pound to my Ounce, if mine be gold for his sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I will never change with him. As 'tis not Bread that keeps men alive, but the Word of Blessing that proceedeth out of his mouth of God; so 'tis not the largerness of the means, but the blessing of the Lord that maketh rich. Oh! if men did but believe this, they would not grasp so much of the world as they do. Well, let others take their course, and we will take ours, to wait upon God by Faith and Prayer, and rest in his Promise; and I am confident that is the way to be provided for: Let others toyl to enlarge their income, (but alas, they will find they go not the right way to work) we will bless God to enlarge our blessing, and I doubt not but we shall prove the Gainers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That every Condition hath its Snares, Crosses, and Troubles, and therefore we may not expect to be without them where ever we be, only that condition is most eligible that hath fewest and least. <hi>I</hi> cannot object any thing against the proposal of <hi>Taunton,</hi> but the meaness of the maintenance; but if our income be but short, we can <hi>I</hi> hope be content to live answerably, we must fare the meaner, that will be all the inconvenience that <hi>I</hi> know, and truly <hi>I</hi> hope we are not of the nature of that Animal, that hath his Heart in his Belly. <hi>I</hi> know how <hi>Daniel</hi> thrived by his Water and pulfe, and think a mean Diet is as wholesome to the body, yea.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44944:5"/>
and far less hurtful than a full and libéral is; and perswade my self it would be no such hard matter for us contentedly to deny our flesh in this respect. But let us consider how little and utterly inconsiderable this inconvenience is, in comparison of those we must reckon upon meeting with, if God cast us into another place, and whether this be not a great deal less than the trouble we shall have for want of comsortable and Christian Society, for want of the frequent and quickening means we shall here have, in wrangling and contending with the Covetous, or else losing our dues, in the Railings and scandalous, and malicious Reports, that are we see raised upon the best by the wicked in most places, in their contentions about their right to the Sacraments, in our intanglement in the cares and troubles of this life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which we should be here exempted from. Upon these and the like considerations, I find my heart very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to accept of their offer at <hi>Taunton.</hi> I beseech thee to weigh, and throughly consider the matter, and tell me impartially thy thoughts, and which way thy Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The least intimation of thy will to the contrary, shall overballance all my thoughts of settling there, for I should account it the greatest unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness if I should thus settle, and thou shouldst afterwards be discontented at the straightness of our condition. But I need not have Wrote this, hadst not thou fully signified thy mind already to me, I had never gone so far as I have. Well, the Lord whose we are, and whom we serve, do with us as it shall seem good unto him. We are alwayes as mindful as is possible of thee here, both together and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.

               <p>MY extream straights of time will now force me to bind my long loves in a few short lines; yet I could not tell how to leave you unsaluted, nor chuse but write to you in a few words, that you should not be dismayed neither at our present sufferings, or at the evil tidings that by this time I doubt not are come unto you. Now, Brethren, is the time when the Lord is like to put you upon the trial; now is the hour of temptation come. Oh! be faithful to Christ to the death, and he shall give you a Crown of life. Faithful is he that hath called you, and he will not suffer you upon his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p n="1">1. If you seek by prayer and study to know the mind of God, and do resolve to follow it in uprightness, you shall not fail either of direction or pardon; either God will shew you what his pleasure is, or will certainly forgive you if you miss your way. Brethren, fix upon your souls the deep and lively affecting apprehensions of the most gracious, loving, merciful,

               <p n="2">2. That as sure as God is faithful, if he do see that such or such a temptation (with the forethought of which you may be apt to disquiet your selves, lest you should fall away when thus or thus tried) will be too hard for your Graces, he will never suffer it to come upon you. Let not, my dear Brethren, let not the present tribulations or those impending move you. This is the way of the Kingdom: persecution is one of your Land marks: self-denial and taking up the Cross is your <hi>A B C</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Brethren, the Cross of Christ is your Crown, the reproach of Christ is your riches; the shame of Christ is your glory; the damage attending strict and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diligence, your greatest advantage: sensible you should be of what is coming, but not discouraged; humbled, but not dismayed; having your hearts broken, and yet your spirits unbroken; humble your selves mightily under the mighty hand of God; but fear no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Approve your selves as good Souldiers of Jesus Christ, with no <hi>Armour,</hi> but that of righteousness; <hi>No weapons,</hi> but strong crying and tears; looking for no Victory but that of Faith; nor hope to overcome, but by patience: now for the faith and patience of the Saints, now for the harness of your suffering Grace: O gird up the loyns of your mind, and be sober, and hope to the end: <hi>Fight not</hi> but <hi>the good fight of Faith:</hi> here you must contend and that earnestly: Strive not but against sin, and here you may resist even unto blood: now see that you chuse life, and embrace affliction rather than sin. Strive together mightily and frequently by prayer: I know you do, but I would you should abound more and more: Share my loves

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44944:7"/>
Heaven would be glad of, if the Lord saw it fit to imploy them in this work! Well, I do not, I cannot repent, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the difficulties and inconveniences that do attend his dispised Servants, and hated ways, and that are like to attend them; for we have but sipped yet of the Cup; but I have set my hand to his plow; my Ministry I took up with you, and my Testimony I finished with you, though I thought I had espoused you till death; and when I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into that Sacred Office, which through rich Grace I was imployed in, I told you in the close of what I spake before the laying of the holy Hands upon me (most gladly do I take up this Office with all the persecution, affliction, difficulties an tribulation and inconveniencies that do and may attend it) and blessed be God, I am through his goodness of the same mind still, and my tribulations for Christ, do (to him be Glory, for to me belongs nothing but shame and confusion of face) confirm my choice and my resolution to serve him with much more than my labours. Verily, Brethren, it is a good choice that I have commended to you: Oh! that there might not one be found among you that hath not made <hi>Maries</hi> choice, I mean of that good part which shall never be taken away from you.

Alas! you have no reason to envy them: verily, they have a lye in their right hand: Ah! how soon will their hopes fail them: how soon will the crackling blast be out, and leave them in eternal darkness: they shall go to the generation of their Fathers, they shall never see light, like sheep they shall be laid in their Graves, and the upright shall have Dominion over them in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But for my Brethren, I am jealous that none of you should come short of the Glory of God. I am ambitious for you that you should be all the heirs of an endless life, the living hopes of the Saints, the inheritance incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fades not away.</p>
               <p>Ah my Brethren! why should not you be all happy? I am jealous for you with a Godly jealousie, lest a promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left you of entering into his rest, any of you should come short of it. O look diligently, lest any man fail of the Grace
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44944:7"/>
of God: Alas! how it pities me to see this Rest neglected: How it grieves me that any of you should fall short of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at last! That any of that flock over which the holy Ghost hath made be in part overseer, should perish; when Christ hath done so much for you, and when his under Officers (through his Grace, for we are not sufficient of our selves) have done somewhat to recover and save them. Ah dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! I was in great earnest with you when I besought you out of the Pulpit, many a time, to give a Bill of Divorce to your sins, and to accept of the match and the mercy that in the name of God Almighty I did there offer to you. Alas! how it pitied me to look over so great a Congregation, and to think that I could not, for my life I could not, perswade them, one quarter of them, in likelihood to be saved? how it moved me to see your diligence in flocking, not only to the stated Exercises, but to the Repetitions and to most ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous opportunities, for which you are greatly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, since the Law forbad my publick Preaching, and yet to think that many of you that went so far, were like to perish for ever for want of going further. I must praise your diligent attendance on all opportunities: Blessed be God that made a willing ministry and a willing people: for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how <hi>I</hi> have gone furnished with a Train! How <hi>I</hi> went with the multitude to the House of God, with the voice of joy and praises, with the multitude that kept Holy-days. The remembrance of which moves my soul, but, O my flock, my most dear flock, how fain would <hi>I</hi> carry you farther then the external and outward profession; O! how loath am <hi>I</hi> to leave you there! How troubled to think that any of you should go far and hazard much for Religion, and yet miscarry for ever by the hand of some unmortified lust! as secret pride or untamed passion, or an unbridled tongue, or which <hi>I</hi> fear most of all, a predominate love of the World in your hearts. Alas! must it be so, and is there no remedy but <hi>I</hi> must car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you to Heavens-gate and leave you there! Oh, that <hi>I</hi> should leave the work of your Souls but half done; and bring you no farther than the <hi>almost</hi> of Christianity, Hear, O my people, hear, although <hi>I</hi> may command you, upon your utmost peril in the Name of the Lord Jesus that shall shortly judge you, <hi>I</hi> beseech you, <hi>I</hi> warn you as a Father doth his

Children, to look to the setling and securing of your everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition; and for life take heed of your resting in the outter-part of Religion, but to be restless till you find the through-change of Regeneration within, that you are quite new in the frame and bent of your hearts: for here is the main of Religion in the hidden man of the heart: for Christs sake, for your Soul-sake look to it, that you build upon the Rock, that you be sure in the Foundation work, that you do unfeignedly deliver over your selves to the Lord to be under his command and at his dispose in all things: see that you make no exceptions, no reserve, that you cast over board all your worldly hopes, and count upon parting with all for Christ: that you take him alone for your whole happiness. Wonder not that I often inculcate this: If it be well here, it is well all; if unsound here, the error is in the foundation, and you are undone. Brethren, I see great tryals coming, when we shall see Professors fall like leaves in the Autumn, unless they be well setled: therefore is it that I would so fain have you look to your standing, and to secure the main. And for you whose Souls are soundly wrought upon, O make sure whatever you do: get and keep your evidences clear! How dreadful would your temptations be, if you should be called to part with all for Christ, and not be sure of him neither: get a right and clear understanding of the terms of life, which I have set before you in that form of Covenanting with God in Christ, that I commended to you. I would that none of you should be without a Copy of it: be much in observing your own hearts, both in duties and out-crying mightily to God for assurance: If you cannot discern your estate your selves, go to some body that is albe and faithful, and fully open your Case, your Evidences and doubts, and be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary strict and watchful in your whole course, and I doubt not but you will quickly grow up to assurance.</p>

My Lines did fall in a fair place when the Lord did cast my lot among you; for which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be thankful. God hath been pleased to work a mutual affection between me and you. I remember the tears and Prayers that you have sent me hither with, and how I saw your hearts in your eyes; How can I forget how you pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out your Souls upon me. And truly you are a People much upon my heart, whose welfare is the matter of my continual prayers, care, and study. And oh! that I knew how to do you good: Ah? how certainly should never a son of

you miscarry if I knew how to save you. Ah! how it pities me to think how that so many of you should remain in your sins after so many and so long endeavours to convert and bring them in. Once more, Oh? my beloved, once more hear the call of the most high God unto you. The Prison Preaches to you, the same Doctrine that the Pulpit did Hear, O Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hear; he that hath an ear let him hear. The Lord of Life and of Glory offers you all Mercy, and Peace, and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness: Oh, why should you die! whosoever will, let him take of the Waters of Life sreely; what miss of life when it is to be had for the taking? God forbid. O my Brethren, my soul yerns for you, and my bowels towards you. Ah! that I did but know what Arguments to use with you: who shall chuse my words for me that I may prevail with sinners not to reject their own Mercy: how snall I get within them? How shall I reach them? Oh! that I did but know the words that would pierce them? that I could but get between their sins and them. Beloved Brethren, the Lord Jesus hath made me, most unworthy, his Spokesman, to bespeak your hearts for him: And oh, that I knew but how to wooe for him, that I might prevail! these eight years have I been calling, and yet how great a part do remain visibly in their sins, and how few, alas! how few souls have I gained to Christ by sound conversion. Once more I desire with all possible earnestness to apply my self to you, I have thought it may be a Sermon out of a Prison might do that which I could not do after my long striving with you, but have left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: come then, O Friends, and let us reason together.</p>
               <p>Many among you remain under the power of Ignorance: Ah! how often have I told you the dangerous, yea, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estate that such are in. Never make excuses, nor flatter your selves that you shall be saved though you go on in this; I have told you often, and now tell you again, God must be false of his Word, if ever you be saved without being brought out of the state of ignorance: If ever you enter in at the door of Heaven, it must be by the Key of Knowledge, you cannot be saved, except you be brought to the knowledge of the Truth. A people that remain in gross ignorance, that are without understanding, the Lord that made them, will not have mercy on them. O why will you flatter your felves,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44944:9"/>
and wilfully deceive your own selves? when the God of Truth hath said you shall surely die if you go on in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: Oh, for the love of God and of your souls, I beseech you awake and bestir your selves to get the saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: you that are capable of learning a Trade to live by, are you not capable of learning the way to be saved? yea, I doubt not but you are capable if you would but beat your heads about it, and take pains to get it.

Search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture daily, get them read to you if you cannot read them. Improve your Sabbaths diligently, and I doubt not but in the use of these means you will sooner arrive to the knowledge of Christ than of a Trade. But for thee, O hardned sinner, that wilt make thy excuses that thou hast not time nor abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to get knowledge, and to sit still without it, I pronounce unto thee that thou shalt surely perish: And I challenge thee to tell me, if thou canst, how thou wilt answer it before the most High God when he shall sit in Judgement upon thee, that thou wouldest be contented to undergo a seven years Apprentiship to learn how to get thy living, and that thou mightest have got the knowledge of the principles of Religion in half the time, but thou wouldest not beat thy head about it.</p>

O what a long list will these and such like make up, if put together: it saddens me to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion such as these. O how crimsen is their guilt! how often
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44944:10"/>
have you been warned, and yet are still unreformed, yea loose and profane. Yet one warning more have I sent after you from the Lord to repent. Return, O sinners, what! will you run into everlasting burnings with your eyes open?</p>
               <p>Repent, O Drunkards, or else you shall be shut out of the Kingdom of Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. Repent, O swearers, else you shall fall into condemnation, <hi>James</hi> 5. 12. Repent, O lyars, put away lying, and speak every one truth to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; else you shall have your part in the Lake that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with fire and brimstone, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 8. Repent, O company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, forsake the foolish and live, but a Companion of the wicked shall be destroyed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. Repent you Deceivers of your unrighteous dealings, or else you shall have no Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. The Lord that made us, knows my earnest desire for your conversion and Salvation, and that I speak not this to you out of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will toward you, for I will lie at your feet to do you good, but out of a sense of your deplorable estate, while you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in your sins. I know there is mercy for you if you do soundly repent and reform, and bow to the Righteousness and Government of the Lord Christ: but if you go on, and say, you shall yet have peace, I pronounce unto you, that there is no escape, but the Lord will make his wrath to smoak against you, he will wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his Trespasses.</p>
               <p>Others have escaped the gross pollutions of the world, but stick in the form of Godliness, and content themselves with a negative Righteousness, that they are no Drunkards, nor Swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or at best with an outward conformity to the duties of Religion, or some common workings, instead of a saving. O I am jealous for you that you should not lose the things that you have wrought, and miss you reward for want of sincerity: for the Lords sake put on, and beware of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in the Suburbs of the City of Refuge: beg of God to make through-work with you, and be jealous for your selves; get a right understanding of the difference between a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite and a sincere Christian, and try you estates much, but only with those marks, that you are sure from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture will abide Gods tryal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44944:10"/>But for you that fear the Lord in sincerity, I have nothing but good and comfortable words: I have proclaimed your happiness in the last Token I sent to the Town: I mean the abstract for the Covenant of Grace, upon the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, comforts, mercies there summed up, and set before you. May your souls ever live; what condition can you devise wherein there will not be abundance of comfort, and matter of joy unspeakable, to you. O Beloved, know your own happiness, and live in that holy admiring, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adoring, praisings of your gracious God, that becomes the people of his praise. I have been long, yet methinks I have not emptied half my heart unto you: <hi>I</hi> trespass much, <hi>I</hi> fear, upon the Bearer, therefore in haste I commend you to God. The good will of him that dwelt in the Bush be with you all. The Lord Create a defence upon you, and Deliverance for you: the Lord cover you all the day, and make you to dwell between his shoulders; I desire your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, instant, earnest Prayers for me, and rest,</p>

But however it be for that, be sure to hold on your way: your name indeed is cast forth as evil, and you are hated of all men for Christs-sake, for your profession of his Gospel, and cleaving to his ways and servants: but let not this discourage you, for you are now more than ever blessed: onely hold fast, that no man take your Crown. Let not any that have begun in the Spirit, end in the flesh. Do not forsake God, till he forsake you; he that endureth to the end shall be saved: The Promise is to him that overcometh; therefore think not of looking back: Now you have set your hands to Christ's Pow, though you labour hard, and suffer long, the Crop will pay for all: now the Lord is trying what credit he hath in the World, and who they be that will trust him. The unbelieving World are all for present pay; they must have ready money, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in hand, and will not follow the Lord when there is like to be any great hazard and hardship in his service. But now is the time for you, my Beloved, to prove your selves Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, when there is nothing visible but present hazard and expence, and difficulty in your Makers service. Now it will be seen who can trust the Lord, and who trusts him not: Now, my Brethren, bear you up, stand fast in the Faith, quit you like men, be strong: now give glory to God by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. If you can trust in his Promises for your reward now, when nothing appears but the displeasure of Rulers, and Bonds, and losses, and tribulation on every side, this will be somewhat like Believers. Brethren, I beseech you to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon no other but crosses here. Let none of you dream of an Earthly Paradise, or flatter your selves with dreams of sleeping in your ease, and temporal Prosperity, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Heaven too. Think not to keep your Estates, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and consciences too: Count not upon rest till you come to the Land of Promise. Not that I would have any of you to run upon hazards uncalled: No, we shall meet them soon enough in the way of our duty, without we will balk it, and shamefully turn aside: but I would have you cast over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board your Worldly hopes, and count not upon an earthly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44944:11"/>
felicity, but be content to wait till you come on the other side the Grave. Is it not enough to have a whole eternity of happiness yet behind? If God do throw in the comforts of this life too into the bargain; I would not have you throw them back again, or despise the goodness of the Lord: but I would, my Brethren, that you should use this World, as not abusing it, that you should be crucified to the world, and the world to you; that you should declare plainly that you seek a Countrey, a better Countrey, which is an Heavenly. Ah! my dear Brethren, I beseech you carry it like Pilgrims an strangers, I beseech you abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against your Souls; for what have we to do with the customes and courses and fashions of this world, who are strangers in it! Be contented with Travellers lots: know you not that you are in a strange Land? all is well as long as it is well at home; I pray you, Brethren, daily and srequently to consider your condition and station: do you not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that you are in an Inn; and what though your be but poorly attended, and meanly accommodated? though you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>are hard, and lie hard? Is this a strange thing? what should Travellers look sor else? will you set forth in a Journey, and promise your selves nothing but sair way and fair weather? Shall a man put forth to Sea and reckon upon nothing but the calm? If you were of the World, the World would love his own. But now God hath chosen you, and called you out of the world, therefore the World hateth you: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, my Brethren, it is your duty to love them, even while they hate you; and to pray for mercy for them that will shew no mercy, nor do no Justice for us. This I desire you to observe as a great duty of the present times: And let not any so far forget their duty and pattern, as to wish evil to them that do evil to us, or to please themselves with the thoughts of being even with them. Let us commit our selves to him that judgeth righthously, and shew our selves the children of the most High, who doth good to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and is kind to the unkind and unthankful: And what though they do hate us? Their love and good-will were much more to be feared, than their hatred, and a far worse sign. Brethren, keep your selves in the love of God; here is Wisdom. O happy souls, that are his Favourites! For

the Lords sake look to this, make sure of something: look to your sincerity above all things in the World: let not any of you conclude, that because you are of the suffering par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore all is well: Look to the Foundation, that your hearts be soundly taken off from every sin, and set upon God above as your Blessedness: Beware that none of you have only a name to love, and be no more than almost Christians. For the love of your Souls, make a diligent search, and try upon what ground you stand, for it heartily pities me to think that any of you should be in so deep, and hazard so much as these must do that will now cleave to the hated ways of the people of God, and yet lose all at last for want of being thorow and sound in the main work, I mean conversion and Regeneration. None so miserable in all the world as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Professor of Religion now is, for he shall be hated and persecuted of the World, because he takes up a Profession, and yet rejected of God too, because he sticks in a Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but when once you bear the marks of Gods favour, you need not fear the Worlds frowns: Cheer up therefore, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be strong in the Lord, and of good courage under the Worlds usage: Fear not, in our Fathers House there is bread enough, and room enough; this is sufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us under all the inconveniences of the way, that we have so happy a Home, so worthy a Portion, so ready a Father, so goodly an Heritage, so sure a Tenure. Oh, comfort one another with these words: let God see that you can trust in his Word: let the world see that you can live upon a God. I shall share my Prayers and loves among you all, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to the Almighty God: the Keeper of Israel that never flumbereth nor sleepeth, be your Watchman and Keeper to the end, Farewel.

from the Prison to you: It is a Gospel worth the suffering for: see that you follow after holiness, without which no man shall see God: Oh! the madness of the blind World, that they should put from them the only Plank upon which they can scape to Heaven. Surely the Enemies of Holiness are their own Enemies. Alas for them! they know not what they do.

There is never a grace but hath its counterfeit: and there is nothing in all the World that is more common or more easie, than to mistake common and counterfeit Grace for true and saving: and remember you are undone for evermore, if you should die in such a mistake: Not that I would shake the confidence of any sound Believer, who upon often and through searce into the Scripture and his own heart, and putting himself upon Gods tryal, hath gotten good evidence that his Graces are of the right kind: Build your confidenee sure: See that you get the knowledge of the certain and infallible marks of Salvation, and make sure by great observing your own hearts that these marks be in you, and then you cannot be too confident.

they may be saved. It is not your Profession, nor performing external duties, nor partaking of external Priviledges that will save you: No, no, you must be converted or condemned. It is not enough that you have some love and liking to Gods ways and people, and are willing to venture something for them; all this will not prove you sound Christians: have your hearts been changed? have you been soundly convinced of your sins? of your da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Is Christ more precious than all the world to you? and are you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the through consideration of the strictness and holiness, and self-denyińg nature of his Laws, yet to take them all for the rule of your thoughts, words, and actions? and though Religion may be dear, do you resolve if God will assist you by his Grace, to go through with it, let the cost be what it will? happy the man that is in such a case. This is a Christian indeed, and whatever you be and do short of this, all is unsound.

               <p>I Have received your moving melting letter, and could not look over <hi>such</hi> tender expressions of your working affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, without some commotions in my own: I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently say, I spent more Tears upon those lines, than ever you did Ink: your deep sense of my labours in the Ministry, I cannot but thankfully acknowledge, and take notice of: yet withal, heartily and unseingedly consessing, that all was but the duty which I did owe to your precious and immortal Souls: which God knows, are very much short of my duty. The omissions, imperfections, defects, deadness, that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied my duties I do own, I must and will own; and the Lord humble me for them. But all that was of God (and that was all that was good) be sure that you give to God alone. To him I humbly ascribe both the Will, and the Deed, to whom alone be Glory for ever.</p>
               <p>My dear Brethren, my business as I have often told you, is not to gain your hearts, or turn your eyes towards me, but to Jesus Christ: his Spokesman I am, will you give your hearts to him? will you give your hands, your names to him? will you subscribe to his Laws, and consent to his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and be at through defiance with all his Enemies? This do, and I have my Errant. Who will follow Christs Colours? who will come under his Banner? this shall be the man that shall be my Friend; this is he that will oblige me for ever. Do these Letters come to none that are yet unsanctified? to no loose sinner? to no ignorant finner? to no unsound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor? Oh that there were none such indeed! oh that I had left no such behind me! but would they do me a kindness as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44944:16"/>
I believe they would, oh then let them come away to Jesus Christ at this call! lie no longer O sinner, in thy swill, be no more in love with darkness! stick no longer in the skirts and outside of Religion, demure no longer, dispute not, and waver no more, halt no further, but strike in throughly with Jesus Christ, except nothing, reserve nothing, but come off throughly to the Lord, and follow him fully. And then happy man that thou shalt be, for thou will be made for ever; and joyful man that I shall be, for I shall save a Soul from death. The earnest and pittiful beggings of a poor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, do use to move some Bowels: hear O Friends, will you do nothing for a Minister of Christ? Nothing for a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner of Jesus Christ? methinks I hear you answer, [yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what will we not do, he shall never want while we have it; he shall need no office of Love, but we will run and ride to do it.] Yea, but this is not that I beg of you; will you gratifie me indeed? then come in, kiss the Son, bow to the Name of Jesus; not in a Complement, with Cap and Knee, but let your Souls bow, let all your Powers bend Sail, and do him homage.

That this love should feast us, and feast over us, and our Birth-day should be kept in Heaven: that this should be the round at Heavens Table, and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Song above: [<hi>For this my Son was dead, and is alive,</hi>] and well, what remains but that you should be another manner of People, than ever yet you have been, more holy, more humble, more even, more resolved, more lively, more active? where is your Zeal for the Lord of Hosts? will slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der returns suffice you in answer to such a love?

               <p>WHose I am, and whom under God I desire to serve; to build you up in Holiness, and comforts hath been through grace my great ambition. This is that which I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for; this is that which I suffer for: and in short the end of all my applications to you, and to God for you. How do your souls prosper? are they in a thriving case? what progress do you make in Sanctification? doth the House of <hi>Saul</hi> grew weaker and weaker, and the house of <hi>David</hi> stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and stronger? beloved, I desire to be jealous of you with a Godly jealousie, lest any of you should lose your ground in these declining times: and therefore cannot but be often calling upon you to look to your standing, and to watch and hold fast, that no man take your Crown. Ah! how su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ely shall you reap in the end if you faint not! take heed therefore that you lose not the things you have wrought, but as you have begun well, so go on in the strength of Christ. and give diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end, 'tis your thriving, I tell you, I drive at.</p>
               <p>Do you need Motives?] 1. <hi>How much are you behind-band?</hi> Oh, the fair advantages that we have lost! what time, what Sabboths, Sermons, Sacraments, are upon the matter lost? how much work have we yet to do? are you sure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yet? are you fit to die yet? surely they that are in so much Poverty, under so many great wants, had need to set upon some more thriving courses.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Consider what others have gained, whilst we it may be sit down by the loss:</hi> Have we not met many Vessels richly laden, while our Souls are empty? Oh, the rich Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the golden Prizes that some have won? while we have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44944:23"/>
folded the hands to sleep! have not many of our own stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Religion left us far behind them?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Consider what a spending time there is coming:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and Tribulation seem to be not far from you: had you not need to be well stocked against such a day? go to the <hi>Ant</hi> thou sluggard, she layeth up her meat in the Summer. Happy man that can say to his Soul on good grounds, what he vainly spake, <hi>Thou hast much good laid up for many years:</hi> Who will not Victual the Castle against the Siege? and the Ship against the Voyage?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Consider you will find all little enough when you come to die:</hi> the Wise among the Virgins have no Oyl to spare at the coming of the Bridegroom; distress and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and death will put all your Graces to it. How much ado have many poor Saints had at last to put into this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? <hi>David</hi> cties for respite till he had recovered a little more strength.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Consider how little it will avail you to thrive in your Estates, and not thrive i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> your Souls:</hi> Poor <hi>Gehazi!</hi> what did he get by it when he gained <hi>Naamans</hi> Talents, and came off with his Leprosie?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Consider how short your time for gathering in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is:</hi> the Israelites gathered twice so much Manna against the Sabboth as they did at other times, because at that time there was no Manna fell. Brethren you know not how long you have to lay in for.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Consider Gods expectations are great from you:</hi> he hath been lopping and pruning you, and now he looks for <hi>more fruit:</hi> he hath had you for some time under his more severer Discipline, and therefore expects you should be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proficients: he hath tried new means with you, and is come to you with a Rod; and he will be angry with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness if he do not find you now to mend. Times of Afflictions use to be gaining times to Gods People; God forbid that you alone should be losers.</p>
               <p>Do you ask for marks how you may know your souls to be in a thriving case?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, If your appetites be more strong.</hi> Do you thirst after God, and after grace, more than heretofore? do your cares for and desire after the World abate? and do you hunger
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44944:24"/>
and thirst after righteousness! whereas you were wont to come with an ill-will to holy duties, do you come to them as a hungrie stomach to its meats?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, If pour Pulses beat more even.</hi> Are you still off and on, hot and cold. Or is the a more even spun thred of holiness through your whole course? do you make good the ground from which you were formerly often beaten off?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, If your natural heat do grow more vigorous, and your digestion more quick.</hi> Do you take more notice of God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, than heretofore? and let none of his works, nor words pass without some careful attention, and observation? do you ponder upon, and pray over his Word, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, If you do look more to the Compass, and latitude of Religion, and mind more than ever, the carrying on together the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Do you ear and sleep by rule? doth Religion form, and mould, and direct your carriage towards Husband, Wife, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Children, Masters, Servants! do you grow more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally consciencious? Is piety more diffusive than ever with you, doth it come more abroad with you, out of your Clossets into your Houses, your Shops, your Fields? doth it journey with you, and buy and sell for you? hath it the casting voice in all you do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, If the duties of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, If you are more abundant in those duties which are most displeasing to the Flesh.</hi> Are you more earnest upon the duty of Mortification? are you more strict and severe than ever in the duty of daily Self-examination, and holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? do you hold the Reigns harder upon the Flesh than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? do you keep a stricter watch upon your Appetites? do you set a stro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <salute>Most dearly Beloved,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have been through mercy many years with you, and should be willingly so many years a Prisoner for you, so I might eminently and effectually further your salvation. I must again, yea again, and again thank you for your abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and intire affections to me, which I value as a great mercy not in order to my self, if I know my own heart, but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your benefit, and I may thereby be a more likely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to further your good. Surely, so much as I do value your love, which is not a little, yet had I rather (if I am not unacquainted with my self) be forgotten and forsaken of you all, and buried in oblivion, So that your eyes and hearts might be hereby fixed on Christ, and sincerely engaged to him. Brethren, I have not be spoken your affections for my self: O that I might win your hearts universally to Jesus Christ, though I had lost them for ever! O that I might be instrumental to convert you to him though you were divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me. I am perswaded that I should much rather
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44944:25"/>
choose to be hated of all, so this might be the means to have Christ honoured, and set up savingly in the hearts of you all. And indeed there is nothing great but in order to God; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is much material or considerable as it is terminated in us: It matters not whether we are in Riches or poverty, in sickness or health, in honour or disgrace, so Christ may be by us, magnified in the condition we are in. Welcome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and poverty, welcome scorn and envy, welcome pains or contempt, if by these Gods glory may be most promoted. What are we for but for God? what doth the Creature sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie separated from his God? why just so much as the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher separated from the Figure, or the letter from the Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, we are nothing or nothing worth, but in reference to God and his ends. Better were it that we had never been, than that we should not be to him. Better that we were dead than we should live, and not to him. Better that we had no understandings than that we should not know him. Better that we were Blocks and Bruis than that we should not use our reason for him. What are our Interests unless as they may be subservient to his Interest? or our esteem or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, unless we may hereby glorifie him? do you love me? I know you do; but who is there that will leave his sins for me? I mean at my requests: with whom shall I prevail to give up himself in strictnese and self-denial to the Lord? who will be intreated by me to set upon neglected duties, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form accustomed sins? O wherein may you rejoyce me? in this, in this, my Brethren, in this you shall befriend me, if you obey the voice of God by me, if you be prevailed with to give your selves up throughly to the Lord? would you lighten my burden; would you loosen my bonds? would you make glad my heart? let me hear of your owning the ways and servants of the Lord in adversity, of your coming in, of your abiding and patient continuing in the ways of holiness. O that I could but hear that the prayerless Souls, the prayerless families among you, were now given to prayer! that the profane sinner would be awakened, and be induced by the Preaching of these Bonds, which heretofore would not be prevailed with, to leave their drunkenness their loose company, their lying and deceit, and Wantonness, by all the threatnings of God that could be pronounced against them,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44944:26"/>
nor all the beseechings, wooings, and entreaties that I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to use with them! will you not be made clean? when shall it once be? how long shall the patience of God wait for you? how long shall the Lord Jesus stretch out his hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you? O sinners, cast your selves into his Arm? Why should you die? why will you forsake your own mercy? will you perish when mercy wooes you? confess and forsake your sins, and you shall find mercy: will you part with Christ, and sell your souls to perdition for a little ease and delight to your flesh? or a little of the gain of unrighteousness? or a little Ale or vain mirth, or loose company? why these are the things that part between sinners and Christ.</p>
               <p>I know many are spun with a finer thred, and are not so far from the Kingdom of God, as the prayerless, ignorant, Sabbath-breaking, intemperate sort are. But I must once again warn you of staying in the suburbs of the City of Refuge. O what pity is it that any should perish at the Gates! that any should escape the pollutions of the world and do many things yea, and suffer it may be too, and yet should fall short of the glory of God, for want of a through work of grace! Oh you halting Christians, that halt between Christ and the World, that are as <hi>Ephraim</hi> like a Cake not turned, dow-baked, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, that have Lamps without Oyl, that cry, Lord, Lotd, but do not the will of our Father which is in Heaven! how long will you stay in the place of the breaking forth of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? and stick between the womb and the World? your Religion will carry you among the profane despisers of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, but do own the people of the Lord, and do love the Ministers and ordinances, therefore all is well. I tell you, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is a heart-work, it goes deep, and spreads far: unless the frame of your hearts, and the drifts of your course be changed, unless you be universally conscientious, and unreser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly delivered up to the Lord for all times, and conditions whatever be the cost, you are none of Christs, how far soever you go in common workings and external performances. Hear then, O people, and let not profaneness swallow you up: let not an almost Christianity deceive you, or ignorance carry you blindfold to perdition. Oh the thousands, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands that have been undone by one of these! Ah how often have you been warned against them, least you should split a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

               </opener>
               <p>TO tell you I love and long for you, seems somewhat needless. I cannot doubt of your confidence that you have a deep share in my tenderest affections: for this let my labours among you, and the hazards for you speak, rather that I my self. Beloved, I am, without a Complement the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted servant of your souls prosperity, and the interest of Christ in you: way the Lord Jesus be set up higher in your hearts; may his name ever live in you, and be magnified by you, and I have what I ask. If this work be not promoted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, I shall account all my letters but waste Paper, and all my pains but lost labour. Brethren, I beseech you, that none of you live to your selves, for this were directly to cross the very end of Christ's death: for therefore he died that you should not live to your selves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. Oh live to him that died for you! live to him that is the God of your life! live to him that bought your lives with the expense of his own! To him that bought you from destruction; and not only so, but bought your names into the eternal Inheritance, reserved in the Heavens for you. Will a man be easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to lose his life? how infinitely tender are men here! And yet in the worst sence the most of men do lose their lives, yea, lose them for nothing. Beloved, consider, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, that life is lost, that is not lived unto God. If you would not loss your lives that you live, see to him who is the end of your lives. Oh remember this, and reckon that day lost which you have not lived unto God! Brethren how great a part of our lives have we really, alas! to too really lost? I beseech you take heed: here you are careful about many things, but beware that other things do not put out this which should be the main of your cares, to wit, the spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your days and strength for him that made you. Would it not be dreadful for a man to find at last when he comes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44944:27"/>
to his account with God, that his whole life, or at least the main of it had been but damnable self-seeking. That a man should have so many years allowed him by God, and he should at last be found to have been but a false and wicked servant that had set up for himself with his Masters stock, and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his goods, and turned them to his own use? Well, that you may throughly learn the grand lesson of living unto God, take these Counsels:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Settle it upon your heart that it is the sum of all your business and blessedness to live unto God:</hi> 'Tis your <hi>business,</hi> for his pleasure you are and were created: what have you else to do but to serve your Maker in your general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Callings? what was the Candle made for (saith one) but to be burnt? beloved, what else have you strength for, but for God? doth he maintain servants, and shall not he look for their work; Would you endure it that the servants that you find with meat and wages should set up for themselves, that they should eat your bread and all the while do their own work? beloved, Gods service is your business, and he made you and keeps you for no other end; and it is your blessedness too. Labour to be under the rooted conviction of this principle, that your very happiness lies in pleasing and honouring of God. Let the sense of this live fresh upon your hearts, and it will regulate your whole course.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Remember what a dangerous, yea, damnable thing it is to live to your selves:</hi> To make it our main care and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to please and gratifie our selves, or to have applause from and reputation with others, or to grow rich in the world, and greaten our selves and posterity, is the certain evidence of a graceless heart. And though the Godly do make God their principle end in general, yet they must know, that for so much of their lives ar is spent besides, this end (which is too too much) they shall suffer loss.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Labour to keep alive upon your selves a deep sense of your strong obligations to God.</hi> Often think with your selves what a righteous, what a reasonable thing it is, that you should with all that you have serve the Lord. Beloved, sha I not the Vessel be for the use of the Potter that made it? Shall not the servant Trade for his Master with whose goods he is entrusted? do yot not fetch all your bread from Gods door?
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44944:28"/>
Is not he the Rock that begat you? the Author of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and well-being? is not this he that can crucifie you or release you? can save you or damn you at his pleasure? Is it not from him that you fetch every breath? your interest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges you to please him. Why should <hi>Beltshazzars</hi> charge be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you? that the God in whose hand your breach is, and whose are all your ways, you have not glorified, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 23.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Do not only intend God as the general end of your course, but in every solemn action actually mind your end.</hi> Though a man need not, cannot think of his Journeys-end at every step, yet with care he might come to this in every solemn acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, particularly and expresly to mind his end: a man cannot (nor need he) think at every bit that he puts into his mouth, I will eat this for God: yet he might every time he sits down to his Table, remember to eat and drink, not to gratifie his flesh, but to glorifie God, by getting strength for his work, you cannot think of it in every step in your Journey; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intending some glory to God by serving his will in your place and station? and so in your visits and labours.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Every morning let this be your first and firm resolution, I will set forth this day in the Name of God.</hi> Your first and last thoughts are of greatest consequence; and therefore I advise you to begin and end with this: when ever you lie down, say in your selves, I will make use of my Bed as an ordinance of God, that a servant of his may be refreshed and fitted for his work: when ever you rise up, think I will spend this day for God, and follow the business of my calling, because I am so appointed by God, <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 12. And <hi>they shall walk up and down in his Name, saith the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloved, I design the sweetness and comforts, as well as strictness of your lives. Live to God as you are directed, and you shall marvellously prosper in both. I am not sure yet, whether or no I shall see you at the Assizes, which I earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire to do I leave all things to our Fathers wise dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, and commending you to God, I divide my loves among you, and so rest</p>

               </head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Most dear Christians,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOur Prisoner in the Lord saluteth you with all dearness: your are the care of my heart, the desire of my Eyes, the joy of my Bonds, and the sweet of my liberty. I am much satisfied in the wise disposal of our Heavenly Father, whether he see it good for me to be a Bond-man, or a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, so I may but serve your souls to the greatest advantage. Methinks I begin to feel in my self, more than ever the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of your Prayers; the influences of Heaven, through the riches of Free-grace (to which alone be the Praise) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more fully sensible, and sweet upon me. I hope the Lord will restore us one to another in his time, much better than we parted; in the mean time, see that you stand fast in the hope of the Gospel. The Lord taketh infinite care for you, see that it be your care, the care of your very hearts, to please the Lord: Set your hearts to it as the business of your lives, and the very end of your beings, to walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleasing. Set home on your selyes such considerations as these.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>It is the very business you were made for, and sent into the world for, to please your Maker.</hi> For his pleasure you are, and were Created. Why should the Lord repent that he had made you? <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6 What treacherous and damnable falshood is this, that when the Lord hath given us Breath and Being, and sent us into the World on purpose on his service, we should like false and wicked servants, set up for our selves? why should your Creator say, he hath made you in vain?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If you set your hearts to please the Lord, you are sure you shall please him.</hi> It is not so with men, all the care in the World will not suffice to please some men. How often do Princes forsake their greatest Favourites? so that if you set
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44944:29"/>
to please men, you are not sure to attain your end at last; yea, rather you are sure not to attain it. But if the Lord doth see your very hearts be set to please him, he will accept you, though you come short, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. Read that sweet pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 75.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It will be a certain sign of your sincerity, when the pleasing of the Lord is your greatest business, Phil.</hi> 1. 20. To such the Promise runs, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 4. 5. It is a distinguishing evidence truly to seek and prize Gods favour, more then Corn, Wine, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>This will set all in order, and bring all your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to a Head, when you have set down this as the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that you are resolved to please the Lord, this will regulate your whole lives, and bring all your business into a little compass.</hi> A Christian hath but one thing to do in all conditions, and that is to carry it so in his present state, as that he may please God. A man-pleaser: <hi>O how many hath he to please!</hi> what an endless work hath such an one to do?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Consider but how careful the Man-pleasing Parafite, and time serving Hypocrite is to please m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> and shall not we take as much care to please our God? oh how doth the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Courtier study the humour of his Prince? be you as careful to study, and to be acquainted with the mind of God. What will not men do to screw themselves into the favour of the Mighty? oh that you were but as diligent, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied, and punctual in your endeavours, to get and to keep the favour of the Almighty?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Consider whose favour or displeasure is of that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to you, as the Lords is of.</hi> What if men should be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with you, have they the Keys of Hell, and of Death? no, no, fear them not. Can they undo your Souls? can they send you to Hell? Alas they cannot. See that you dread his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure that can. Alas what will their favour avail you? if they be pleased, can they stand between the wrath of God and you? can they pardon your sins? save your souls? se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your Eternal concernments? where is all their favour or good will, when they or you come to die? It will not be worth a Rush when most needed. Therefore beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whatever you do keep in with God. Resolve upon it, <hi>He must</hi> be pleased, though all the VVorld be displeased. Let
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44944:29"/>
it be enough to you to have his good will: let this be the <hi>One thing</hi> that you bend your selves to seek, and if you set to seek it, you may be sure to find it. The Messenger stays for me, and so I must here shut up my Letter, as <hi>Jude</hi> doth his. <hi>Ye Beloved, building up your selves in your most holy Faith, Praying in the Holy Ghost, keep your selves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto Eternal life.</hi> Unto his Grace I commend you all, and shall add nothing but to share my loves among, and so rest,</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <p>I Am now a Prisoner of the Lord for you <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and therefore have sent these few Lines, to beseech you by these Bonds which I gladly endure for your sakes, to hold forth, and hold fast the profession of your Faith without wavering. The Lord make you stedfast in the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine wherein you have been taught. I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole Counsel of God. O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that by the space of eight years, I ceased not to warn you every one, and kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have taught you publickly, and from House to House, warning every man, and teaching every man that I might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. Oh that Impenitent sinners would yet remember the Invitations, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44944:30"/>
the obsecrations, and the obtestations, that they have had! have they not been sought unto? have they not been intreated? have they not been followed from the Publick, to their own Houses? hath not the VVord been brought to their Doors? Hath not Mercy wooed them? have they uot been called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the VVings of Mercy? And yet they would not. Oh that they would consider it now in the latter dayes? <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 20. Oh that they would remember, and repent, that there might be yet an after Harvest? That they would yet come in and live! Are you yet willing to turn? hear how Wisdom calls after you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. <hi>How long ye simple ones will you love simplicity, and fools hate knowledge: turn you at my reproof.</hi> But if they will not hear, good were it for them that they had never been born: It shall be more, and better fot <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> then for them.</p>
                  <p>But for you that have taken upon you the Profession of strict Godliness, I shall only press you to follow on, and press towards the Mark. You have much work yet to do, and God hath given you no time to Loyter in. I beseech you to put on. That Person that sits down when he hath gotten to that pitch that he thinks will bring him to Heaven, is never like to come thither; Grace is one of those things that saith, <hi>It never hath enough.</hi> Let me urge upon you the Apostles Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Follow after Holiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Holiness is the choicest Ornament: it is an adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the sight of God, of great prize. It is the Glory of God, and will you count it your shame? <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. God is glorious in Holiness, and Grace is called Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. But we may now cry out as the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> in his complaint, <hi>O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my Glory into shame? Ps.</hi> 4. 2. But be of good comfort, the shame of Holiness is real Glory: how confidently doth <hi>Paul</hi> shake his Chain? <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 20. We read of some that did glory in their shame in a sad sense, that is in that which was real ground of shame, to wit, their sin, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. But we meet with others that in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py sense, did glory in their shame; that is in the shame of Religion, which is indeed a Crown of Glory. So did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, Acts</hi> 5. 41.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Holiness is the safest Muniment: Grace is not onely for Ornament, but for Use. Righteousness is a Brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44944:30"/>
that keeps the Vitals, and is a sure defence from any mortal wounds, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 14. When the Politicians have done their best with all their politick fetches, it is he <hi>that walketh uprightly,</hi> that <hi>walketh surely, Prov.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 25. Last. I desire no other Protection than Innocency. <hi>I</hi> desire to be no longer safe than these can preserve me; when <hi>I</hi> must let go my Integrity or my safety, I will chuse the danger rather than the sin:and yet will never doubt but my Integrity will save me harmless, and prevent me for ever coming off a Loser. Never perswade me that that man doth choose wisely or will consult in his own safety, that runs upon the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the infinite God, who is a devouring fire, to flie the danger of mans displeasure. Did you ever read or hear of a man so mad as to run upon the Swords point, to avoid the scratch of a Pin? or to run upon a roaring Canon, rather than danger his being wetshod? why this is the best wisdom of the distracted World, who will sin rather than suffer, and to save themselves harmless in the World, will run upon God, even upon his neck, and the thick Bosses of his Buckler, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 25. 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Holiness will be found to be your real happiness: Eat of this Tree, and you shall be indeed as God. Godliness is Gods likeness. The beauty of Holiness is this very Image; Sin is the disease of which Holiness is the Cure. Pride is the Timpany, passion the Feavour of the mind, how restlesly raging is the mind where they reign? holiness, humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, are a present ease, a present Cure, if the Patient can take but enough. O what peace and tranquility doth Holiness work in the Mind! <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and nothing shall offend them, Psalm</hi> 19. 165.

Believers, and do you follow after Holiness as others follow their Trades or Studies. Let Religion be your business, and not a thing by the by with you: follow as hard upon the pursuit of Grace, as if you did indeed believe riches and honour were in it.

Be you the votaries of Holiness: keep her, and she shall keep you.</p>

Then be sure you have a room in his heart: The Image of Christ is in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. Is this that which your very hearts are set upon? Do you thirst for Holiness? Do you follow after Holiness? Do you prize it above all prosperity and worldly greatness? Do you hate every sin and long to be rid of it as your most irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some burden? and use all Gods means against it as far as you know them? If it be thus with you, Christ hath set his stamp upon your hearts, and so you may be sure he hath set you as a Seal upon his heart.</p>
               <p>Rejoyce then, O Christians, and bless your selves in the happy priviledge that you have, in being under Christs care. Fear not little Flock; Stronger is he that is with you, than he that is against you: What though Satan should raise all his Militia against you, adhere to Christ in a patient doing &amp; suffering his pleasure and he shall secure you: The Lord will not forsake you, because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people: God hath entrusted you with his Son: You are his Care and his Charge: Many will be lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Beloved, We loose unutterably for want of considering, for want of viewing our own Priviledges, and Blessedness. O Man, is Christ thine, and yet dost thou live at a low rate and Comfort? Is thy Name written in heaven, and yet dost thou not rejoyce?

And shall the Grant of Heaven signifie little with thee? Or Christs Patent for thy Son-ship and Partnership with himself be like a Cypher? Shall <hi>Hamon</hi> come home from the Banquet with a glad heart, and glorying in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Riches, the multitude of his Children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him above the Princes? And shall we turn over our Bibles and read the Promises, and find it under Gods own hand, that he intends the Kingdom for us, that he will be a Father to us, that he gives and grants all his infinite perfections to us, and yet not be moved? Beloved Christians, live like your selves, let the Word see that the Promises of God, and Priviledges of the Gospel are not empty sounds, or a meer Crack.

               <p>I Have longed and waited for a little breathing time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I might write unto you, but I have been oppressed hitherto with so many cares, and such a throng of business, that till now (and scarcely now) I have had no time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, wherein I might sufficiently re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Alas poor <hi>Taunton,</hi> how should I bewail thee! did I look upon thee only with the Eye of sense, Alas! for thy wonted liberties, for thy former plenty, and variety wherewith the Lord hath blessed thee? he had spread a Table for thee in the midst of thine Enemies; Bread hath been given thee, and thy Waters have been sure: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

helpers are now disabled from giving thee supplies, Alas, how do thine enemies triumph, and thy Teachers and thine Inhabitants are become their Captives! and how great is the cry of thy poor, and thine oppressed!</p>
               <p>Such would be the language of sense, if that were suffered to be the Speaker. But faith will speak in another Dialect. And therefore amongst my other Counsels, that I shall send you, this shall be the first.</p>
               <p>Judge not of the present Providences, by the conduct of sense, but by the eye of Faith. Faith will see that we are then-most honoured, when we are most vilified, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and set at nought for the sake of <hi>Christ;</hi> and that we are then most happy, when the World hath done its worst to make us miserable. Faith will tell you, that GOD is a very present help, when you seem quite to fail of help; and will shew you the Well of water, that is near, when the Water in the Bottle is spent. What though you seem to have lost Ministers, Husbands, Friends for a Season? Faith will tell you, that they are well bestowed, and that it will be both your, and their advantage, in the Day of Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Brethren, what are you for? are you for the present world or for that that to come? are you for your temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or do you seek for Glory, Honour, and Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? If you are for this World, you have made a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent choice, in taking up the Profession of Godliness and cleaving to and owning the hated ways of the Lord; But if you are for Glory, and for Eternity, then be of good chear, all these things do make for us. You are witnesses how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten I have told you of these things, and I can say with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, I believe therefore have I spoken, and therefore I am nothing moved with all these things, nor with the things that do yet further betide me. I believe, and therefore. I told you, that you should never be losers by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Nay do I say I told it you, you know the Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed you, that the persecuted are doubtly blessed; that such should rejoyce, and leap for joy, because great is their reward in Heaven Hath not God said, that if we suffer with him we shall also Reign with him; and that these light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions work for us a weight of Glory? And if this be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44944:34"/>
true, I pray you, tell me whether GOD hath not dealt well with us in counting us worthy of this little Tribulation for his Name? Indeed the Sufferings is but little; but verily the Reward will not be little. I know whom I have trusted: I am well assured the Glasse is turned up, and every hour reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of our Imprisonment, and every Scorn and Reproach of our Enemies is kept in Black and VVhite. <hi>I</hi> believe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do <hi>I</hi> speak; GOD is infinitely tender of us, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though a Poor and despicable Generation. <hi>I</hi> value not the Pot gun threats of a frowning world; 'tis well with us, we are GODS Favourites. Come my Beloved, let us sit down under his Shadow: Here is safety, and rest, if God be for us, who can be against us? Verily he Bottles all our Tears, and tells all our wandrings: He numbers all our hairs, whosoever toucheth us shall not be Innocent. Know you not that we are the Apple of his Eye? Hath not he reproved the greatest for his Peoples sakes, saying reproach not mine anointed? And so we forget how he loved us. Are not we his Jewells? Doth he not own us for his Members, for his Children?</p>
               <p>Ah what a Block doth Unbelief make of man? VVhat, do you think that all this doth signifie nothing? Can you forget your Children? VVill you suffer your Jewells to lie in the Dirt, or make no reckoning of them whether they are lost?</p>
               <p>Verily <hi>I</hi> write not this without shaming reflections upon my own stupidity. VVhat, Beloved of God, adopted by God! VVhat, a Member of Christ Jesus! A Vessel of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! An heir of Glory? VVhat, and not yet swallowed up in the sense of Gods infinite love! Blush, Oh my Soul, and be còfounded before the most high, &amp; cover thy face with shame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> remember what the Heathen <hi>Seneca</hi> writes, observing the expressions of Gods love to man in his common Providence; <hi>Verum est, usque in delicias Amamur,</hi> That is, it is a very truth, we are Beloved of God even as his darlings.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, Have Faith in God. Believe his Promises: VValk in the sense of his love. Comfort your selves in Gods love towards you, under all the hatred and envy of men, and the contradiction of sinners that you meet with. Be strong and of a good Courage, God is for you. Be assured that he that walketh uprightly, walketh surely: Forsake not

the assembling of your selves together. Now see that you speak often to one another, and build up each other in the holy Faith. God knows <hi>I</hi> cannot do for you, as <hi>I</hi> would; <hi>I</hi> would have been larger to you, but <hi>I</hi> cannot. My most dear loves <hi>I</hi> desire you to share among you. <hi>I</hi> am greatly Yours. The Peace that passeth all Understanding keep your hearts and minds. <hi>I</hi> am</p>

               <p>YOu are a great Joy to me. <hi>I</hi> know not what thanks to render to the Lord for you, when <hi>I</hi> hear of your Constancy, and Fidelity, and Zeal, in adhering to him, and his ways, even in such a time as this, you are highly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Blessed be the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> that he hath regard ed the low Estates of his Servants: That he should ever Indulge you as he hath, and hover over you, even as the Eagle stirteth up her Nest, and fluttereth over her Young, spreadeth abroad her VVings, taketh them, beareth them on her Wings, for so hath the Lord your God dealt with you: He hath kept you as the Apple of his Eye, and since the Streams of <hi>Cherith</hi> were dried up, yet to this day he hath not suffered the handful of Meal to wast, nor the Oyl in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44944:35"/>
the Cruse to fail, but (though you have no certainty to trust to) hath continually provided for you to the full. How should I love and bless the Lord for this his great Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, while I live? Now I beseech you my Brethren, that you consider the Kindness of the Lord; for the Lord your God is he that careh for you, and that you love the Lord your God, and fear him for ever, for he is your Life, and the Length of your Daies. And as <hi>Job</hi> had a holy fear of his Children, least they should have offended: So my most dearly Beloved, I am jealous of you with a Godly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, lest any of you should receive this Grace of God in vain. <hi>I</hi> must not cease to put you in mind, that God doth look from no small matter from you. Remember my most endeared Charge, that the Lord doth look for singular things from you, that there be not a barren Tree nor a Dwarf Christian among you; where the Lord doth strow much, he looks to gather much; and where he soweth much, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to reap accordingly. Whose account my Beloved, is like to be so great as yours? O look about you, and think of the Master coming to Reckon with you for his Talents; when he will expect no small increase. Beloved, what can you do? How much are you grown? What spoil have you made upon your Corruptions? What progress in Grace?</p>
               <p>Suppose Christ should put the awakening question to you, What do you more than others? Beloved, God doth expect more of his People, than of any others in the world besides: And well he may. For</p>
               <p>First, <hi>He hath beftowed more on them than on others:</hi> Now where much is given, much shall be required: Can you think of that without trembling? He hath bestowed on them singular Love more than on others; <hi>Thou only have I known of all the Families on Earth.</hi> He hath a distinguishing Love and favour for his People, and he looks that his love should, be a constraining Argument to Obedience. Again he hath laid out a singular care on his People, more than on others: He cares for no man, for nothing in all the World, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of them. He reproveth Kings for their sakes. He will give Nations, and Kingdoms for their Ransome. So precious are they in his sight, and so dearly Beloved, that he will give men for them, and People for their Life. He
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44944:35"/>
withdraweth not his Eyes from the Righteous, he will not indure them out of his sight. The Eyes of the Lord are upon the Righteous, and first the eye of his more accurate Observation: God can winck at others as it were, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look what they do with little notice, but he hath a most eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Eye upon his People, he marketh their steps, &amp; booketh their words, he weigheth their Actions, and pondereth all their goings. And should they not walk more cautiously, and charily, than any alive, that are under so exact and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an Eye? Secondly the Eye of special Care, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Behold the Eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him. I will guide thee with mine Eye: And should not they be infinitely tender and careful how to please the Lord, who have his singular Care laid out on them? In short, God hath bestowed on them singular Priviledges, more than others: These are a peculiar Treasure to him above all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a Kingdom of Priests, an holy Nation, a singular sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated People, they dwell alone, they are diverse from all People: When the whole world lies in wickedness, these are Called and Chosen, and Faithful, Washed, and Justified, and Sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. The rest are the Refuse: These the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els: These are taken, and they are left. Shall not Gods Priests be Cloathed with Righteousness, and shall not Princes Live above the rate of Peasants?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He hath intrusted them with more then others;</hi> Not onely with the Talents of his Grace (for the increase whereof they must give a strict account) but also with the Jewel of his Glory. How tenderly should they walk, that are entrusted with such a Jewell? Remember, your makers Glory is bound up in your fruitful walking.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He hath qualified them more than others.</hi> He hath put into them a Principle of Life, having quickned them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Christ. He hath set up a light in their Minds, when others lie in Darkness. He hath given them other Aids, than others have, even his Spirit to help their Infirmities, when others lie like Vessels that are VVindbound, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stir.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He hath provided for them other manner of things than for others.</hi> These are the little Flock to whom it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44944:36"/>
is his good pleasure to give the Kingdom; great are the preparations for them. The Father hath prepared the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for them from the foundations of the World: the Son is gone to Heaven on purpose to prepare a place for them: The Spirit is preparing them, and making them meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light: and should these be like other People?</p>
               <p>Brethren beloved, God and Men do expect you should do more then others, see that that you be indeed singular. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you do no more for God than others, he will do more against you then others: <hi>You onely have I known, therefore will I punish you.</hi> The barren Tree in the Vineyard must down, whereas had he been in the Common he might have stood much longer. God looked for Grapes from his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, on which he had bestowed such care and cost more than ordinary, but when they bring forth wild Grapes, he will lay them waste in a worse manner than the Forrest When Christ came to the Fig-tree seeking fruit, and met with none, he curst it from the root, whereas had it been a Thorn or Bramble, it might have stood as before..</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you do no more than others, you must look for no more than others: If you should put off God with a common obedience, you must expect to be put off with common mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Except you do more than others, God will be disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured more by you than others.</p>
               <p>I have been too long with you, but I am earnestly desirous you should be sensible of Gods extraordinary expectations from you. And truly, as God looks for more from his own than others, so he looks for more from you than others, even of his own, because that he hath done more: See that you be shining Christians, that you be strong in the grace of God, that you press towards the mark. But I must conclude; I give my loves among you all, being able to add no more, but that I am</p>

               <p>THe reason why my Letters have not of late come so thick as formerly to you, is not because I forgot to love you, and to care for you; but because I have been busily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in other labors of sundry kinds for you. I am yours, and love to be so, being ambitious not to have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your faith, but to be a helper of your Joy. Christs Officers are so your Rulers in the Lord, as yet to Preach not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but the Lord Jesus Christ, and themselves your servants for Jesus sake. I have no greater felicity under God, than to serve the good of souls. Brethren beloved, how fares it with your souls? are they in health? do they prosper? I wish your temporal prosperity. It it a joy to me to hear when your trade doth florish: but these are but very little things if we look into Eternity. Brethren, my ambition for you is, that you should be Cedars among the Shrubs, that from you should sound out the Word of the Lord, and that in every place your Faith to God-ward should be spread abroad. That <hi>Taunton</hi> should be as a field that the Lord hath bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: that you should not only have the Name, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Life, Power, Heat, Growth, Vigour of Christianity among you. Let not <hi>Taunton</hi> onely have the name to live, and be noted for the profession of Religion, but see to it my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the Kingdom of God be with you: Oh that every one of your. souls might be a Temple of God! Oh that every one of your Families might be a Church of God! Beloved, look to it, that every one that nameth the name of Christ among you do depart from Iniquity, secret as well as open, of the heart as as well as of the life. Let no man think that to make an out-cry upon the <hi>Wickedness of the times,</hi> and to be of the <hi>Professing Party,</hi> will serve his turn; many go
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44944:37"/>
to Hell in the company of the wise Virgins. That no man may be a <hi>Self-deceiver,</hi> let every man be a <hi>Self-searcher.</hi> He that keeps no Day-book in his Shop, and no Account, no Record in his Conscience, his Estate aud his Soul will thrive both alike. Beloved, I would that you should remember whither you are a going. If a man be after a few Months to be Transported into another Countrey, never to return more, he will send over whatever he can, and make the best Provision that he may against he comes into another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Dear Brethren, you are Strangers and Pilgrims here, and have but a few Months abode in this Countrey, see that you Traffique much with Heaven. Christ is our Common Factor, O send over to him what possible you can. Give Alms plentifully, pray continually, be much in Meditation and Consideration; Reckon with your selves daily: Walk with God in your Callings: do all the duties of your Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as unto God: live not one day to your selves, but unto Christ: Set forth continually in his Name, so shall you be continually Transporting into another World, and laying up Treasure in Heaven: And O the blessed store that you shall find there after a few Years diligence in such a holy course! Beloved, while you are here in this World, You are but like a Merchants Ship in a strange Port, the day for your return is set, and you are to stay no longer then till your Fraight is ready. Be wise, know your season, improve you time, you are made or mar'd for ever, as you speed in this one Voyage. There is no returning again to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to mend a bad Market, God will call in all his Talents, time shall be no longer. Oh, come in, come and buy now while the Market is open, that you that want may have grace and you that have may have it more abundantly. Go and plead with the Lord Jesus, that he hath bid you <hi>come, buy and eat</hi> without Money, and without Price; that he hath counselled you to come buy of him Gold, Raiment, and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve; tell him you are come according to his call, and wait upon him for Grace, for Righteousness, for Light and Instruction: Lay hold on his Word, plead it, live upon it; he is worthy to be believed, worthy to be trusted, go out of your selves to him, unlearn your selves. There is a threefold Foot that ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is no small thing to know our selves to be nothing, of no might, of no worth, of no understanding, nor reality; to look upon our selves as helpless, worthless, foolish empty shadows. This holy littleness is a great matter; when we find that all our Inventory amounts to nothing but folly, weakness, and beggery; when we set down our selves for Cyphers, our gain for loss, our excellencies for very vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then we shall learn to live like Believers. A true Saint is like a Glass without a Foot, that set him where you will, is ready to fall every way till you set him to a Prop: Let Christ be the only support you lean unto. When you are throughly emptied and nullified, and see all comeliness to be but as a withered Flower, dead, dried, and past reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, then you will be put upon the happy necessity of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to Christ for all.</p>

               <p>I Know not what thanks to render to you, nor to God for you, for all the unexpressable love which I have found in you towards me; and not terminatively to me, but to Christ in me; for I believe it is for his sake, as I am a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger and Embassador of his to you, that you have loved me and done so much every way for me; and I think I may say of <hi>Taunton</hi> as the Psalmist of <hi>Jerusalem, If I forget thee, let my right hand forget her cunning, if I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.</hi> I would not, my dear Brethren, that you snould be dejected or discouraged at the late disappointments: for through the goodness of God I am not, but rather more satisfied than before: and this I can truly say, nothing doth sadden me more than to see so much sadness in your faces. As on the contrary nothing doth comfort me so much as to see your chear and courage. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beseech you, Brethren, faint not because of my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, nor of Gods delays, but strengthen the hands, and the feeble knees. And the Lord bolster up your hands, as they did the hands of <hi>Moses,</hi> that they may not fall down till <hi>Israel</hi> do prevail. Let us fear lest there be some evil among us, that God being angry with us, doth send this farther tryal upon us. Pray earnestly for me lest the eye of the most jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God should discern that in me which should render me unfit for the mercy you desire. And let every one of you search his heart, and search his house to see if there be not cause there: Let not these disappointments make you to be nevertheless in love with Prayers, but the more out of love
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44944:38"/>
with sin. Let us humble our selves under the mighty hand of God, and he shall exalt us in due time. And for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, you must know also that their foot shall slide in due time. Let the Servants of God encourage themselves in their God: for in the things wherein they deal proudly, he is above them: therefore fret not your selves because of evil doers; commit your cause to him that judgeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. Remember that you are bid if you see oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of Judgement and Justice in a Province, not to marvel at the matter: verily, there is a God that judgeth in the Earth: and you have the liberty of appeals: rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him, and fret not your selves, because of the men that bring wicked devises to pass: take heed that none of you do with <hi>Peter</hi> begin to sink, now you see the waters rough, and the winds boysterous: these things must not weaken your Faith, nor cool your Zeal: for they are great arguments for the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. What clearer evidence can there be for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture judgment and perdition of the ungodly, and Coronation of the Just in another life, than the most unjust proceedings that are here upon Earth: shall not the Judge of all the Earth see right to be done? We lee here nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and disorder, the wicked receiveth according to the work of the righteous, and the Innocent according to the work of the wicked. The Godly perish and the wicked flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish; these do prosper, and they do suffer. What, can it be ever thus! no doubtless, there must be a day when God will Judge the world in righteousness, and rectifie the present disorders, and reverse the unrighteous Sentences that have been passed against his servants. And this evidence is so clear, that many of the Heathen Philosephers have from this very Argument (I mean the unrighteous usage of the good) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that there must certainly be rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adjudged by God in another World.</p>
               <p>Nor yet lose your Zeal: now is the time that the love of many doth wax cold: but I bless God it is not so with you: I am sure your love to me is, as true Friends should be, like the <hi>Chimneys,</hi> warmest in the Winter of Adversity: and I hope your love to God is much more, and I would that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44944:39"/>
You should abound yet more and more. Where else should you bestow your Loves? Love ye the Lord, ye his Saints, and cling about him the faster now ye see the world is striving to separate you from him. How many are they that go to knock off your fingers! O methinks, I see what tugging there is. The World is plucking, and the Devil is plucking: Oh, hold fast, I beseech you; hold fast, that no man take your Crown. Let the Water that is sprinkled, yea, rather poured upon your love, make it to flame up the more. Are you not betrothed unto Christ? Oh rc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, remember your Marriage Covenant: did you not take him for Richer for Poorer, for better for worse: now prove your love to Christ to have been a true conjugal love, in that you can love him when most slighted, despised, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued, blasphemed among men. Now acquit your selves, not to have followed Christ for the Loaves, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the Accuser of the Brethren, who may be ready to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest of the best of you, as he did of <hi>Job, Doth he serve the Lord for nought?</hi> And let it be seen that you loved Christ and holiness purely for their own sakes, that you can love a naked Christ when there is no hopes of worldly advantage, or promoting of self-interest in following him.</p>
               <p>Yet beware that none of you do stick to the wayes of Christ and Religion upon so carnal an account as this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the way that you have <hi>already taken up,</hi> and you count it a <hi>shame</hi> to recede from <hi>your Principles:</hi> I am very jealous lest some Professors should miss of their reward for this: least they should be accounted Turn-coats and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites; therefore they will shew a stoutness of spirit in going on, since they have once begun, and cannot with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour retreat. Would you chose holiness and strictness, if it were to do again? would you enter your selves among Gods poor people, if it were now first to do. Would you have taken up the Profession of Christ, though you had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen all this that is come and coming? This will do much to evidence your sincerity.

               <p>MY continual solicitude for your State, will not suffer me to pass in quiet one week without Writing to you, unless I am extraordinarily hindred. Your sincerity, stedfastness, and proficiency in the grace of God, is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my earnest desire, and that which I should account my self happy in. I have a longing desire to see the Faces of you all, and (besides mine expectation) shall (I trust) speedily have the opportunity to see you at the approaching Assizes, which I shall greatly rejoyce in, notwithstanding our coming may be otherwise attended with many Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. In the mean time I send you a few Prison Counsels. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To improve for Eternity, the Advantages of your present State.</hi> Though you are at many disadvantages with respect to the publick Ordinances, yet you have many wondrous and most happy Priviledge, which Spiritual Wisdom would make no small improvement of. Oh what a mercy have you that you may serve God while you will in your Families! That you may be as much as you will with God in secret Prayer, and holy Meditation, and Self-examination! I beseech you
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44944:40"/>
consider what a Blessing you have above others, that have your Health, and a Competency of the Comforts of this life, and are free from those continual pains, or Heart-eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cares, that others are disabled by, from looking after God and their Souls, as you may do. Oh consider what a blessed Seed-time you have for Eternity! Now be wise and improve your happy Season, your day of Grace. Prepare for Death, make all sure: Press on towards the Mark, lay up in store for your selves a good Foundation against the time to come. In the morning sow your Seed, and in the Evening withdraw not your Hand. Treasure up much in Heaven: What profit is it that you have more than others? more Liberty, more Comfort, more Health, more Wealth, than others? except you love God more, and serve him better than others. Now ply your Work, and dispatch your Business, so as that you may have nothing to trouble You upon your Death-Beds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To Consider also the Temptations, and Disadvantages of your State.</hi> Study to know your own weaknesses, and where your danger lies that you may obviate Satan, and prevent your miscarrying: There is no Condition but hath its Snares. See that you acquaint your selves with his Devices, least you be beguiled by him, and caught in his Trap through your own unwariness. You that are well Provided for in the World, had need to watch your selves, least you fall in love with present things, least you be lifted up, least you trust in those Carnal props, and put confidence in the Creatures, least you warp, and decline, and baulk your duties through Carnal fear, and the desire of preserving your Estates. You that have little in the World, are not without your tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neither: Oh take heed of Envying others Prosperity, of murmuring and discontent, of diffidence and distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness, of using indirect means to help your selves: Be sure You make not the Worlds pressures upon you, an excuse from your daily serving of God in your Families, and in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Set this down as your Rule, and unchangeable Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that God and your Souls and your Families shall be looked duly and continually after, go the world which way it will. Consider what sins your Tempers, Relations, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, do most expose you to. Be not strangers to your selves. Prove your selves upright in keeping from your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>To Converse often with your Dust.</hi> Brethren we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we are going, the Grave waiteth for us: Oh forget not that Corruption is your Father, and the Worm your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and your Sister. These are your poor kindred that you must shortly dwell with, when you come to your long home: Remember the days of Darkness which shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Take every day some serious turns with Death. Think where you shall be a few days and nights hence, happy he that knew what to morrow meant for twenty Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Believe it, you will find it no little thing to die. Think often how you are provided, how you should receive the Sentence of Death. Were you never within sight of Death? How did it look? What did you wish for most at that time? What did then trouble you most? Oh mark these things, and live according. Often ask your hearts, VVhat if God should this night require my Soul?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>To serve your Generation with your might while you have time.</hi> You have but a very little time to bring God any Glory here, or to do your Friends any good; now up and be doing. Now or never live in the deep and constant sense of the very little time that you have for this world, and the great work you have to do. You are going whence You shall not return. There's no After-Game to be plaid. VVhat! But one cast for Eternity, and will you not be careful to throw that well?</p>
               <p>Most dearly Beloved, I covet after your furtherance in Mortification, and growth in Grace. And Oh that <hi>I</hi> could but represent Death to you, as shortly it will shew it self: Or could but open a VVindow into Eternity to You: How effectually would this do the work. Then the Cripple would fling away his Crutches, and betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Legs: Then the slothfull would pluck his Hand out of his Bosome, and shake off his Excuses, and be night and day at his work. Then the <hi>Laodicean</hi> would be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his benumed frame; then we should have no Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Religion, no lazy wishing and complaining; but men would ply the Oars to purpose, and sweat at their work.</p>
               <p>But Oh unhappy man, how powerfully hath the world bewitched thee! How miserably hath Sin unnmaned thee. that thou shouldst look no far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But you my Brethren, lift up your selves above the objects of sense: may you be men for eternity, and carry it like these that seek for glory, honour, and immortality. I am apt to be too long with you: I commend you to Divine Grace: my dearest loves among you, I am</p>

My dearly Beloved, I know you have many enemies, and above all, I fear your bosom Enemies: and as the Watchman of the Lord, I give you careful warning, and exhort you all not to be high-minded, but fear. Blessed is the man that feareth always. Look diligently, lest any of you fail of the Grace of God.

               <p>Suppose I should ask you one by one, where are your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences for Heaven? Could you make out your claim? can you bring me Scripture-proof? can you shew me the marks of the Lord Jesus? what m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What are your hands filled with Books, and your ears filled with Sermons, that tell you so plainly from the Word of God, how you shall know whether you are in Christ, and are you still to seek? Oh, stir up your own selves. Take heed, lest a Promise being left of entring into his rest, any of you fall short of it at last by unbelief. You are a professing People, you pray, and you hear, and you run upon some Adventures for Jesus Christ: But, O look to your since<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, not only what is done, but whence 'tis done, look to the root as well as to the Fruit. Eye not only your Actions, but your aims. Remember what a strict and severy eye you are under. The Lord Jesus makes strict observation upon all your works and ways. He observes who of you be fruitful, and who be barren and unprofitable. He knows who of you be thriving and who be declining. He observes who be warm, and who lukewarm: who be sound Christians, and who of you have only a name to live.</p>
               <p>Return, O backsliding Christians, you have lost your former

Your care is turned into security, and your tenderness into sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness. Oh, your case is dangerous. The Lord Jesus hath a great controversie with you. Oh, remember whence you are fallen, and repent, and do your first works. Strengthen the things that remain, and are ready to die. Oh, rub and chafe your swooning souls, and ply them with warm appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and rousing considerations, till they recover their former heat. And know ye from the Lord, that the backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in heart shall be filled with his own ways.</p>

               <p>In this, my dear Brethren, in this rejoyce, and again I
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44944:43"/>
say rejoyce, that God is ingaged in so near and so sweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to you. Doubtless your Souls shall lodge in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and be provided for carefully, and lie down in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing safety, that have the Almighty for our Shepherd. Blessed are the Flock of his hands, and the Sheep of his Pasture, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is the People that is in such a case.</p>
               <p>But who are Christs Sheep?</p>
               <p>Not all Professors, <hi>I</hi> beseech you take heed how you rest in Profession. It is not <hi>Profession,</hi> but <hi>Conversion</hi> that turns a man from a Swine to a Sheep. Let none of you be deceived, nor flatter your selves, that because you bear the name of Christians, and do many things, and have escaped the open gross pollutions of the VVorld, therefore you are surely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of Christs true Sheep. All this you may attain to, and yet be but washed Swine; here must be an inward deep and thorow and universal Change upon your Natures, Dispositions, Inclinations, or else you are not Christs Sheep.</p>
               <p>In a word, If you will be put out of doubt whether you are his sheep or not, you must trie it by this certain Mark that Christ sets upon all his Sheep, even your <hi>Sanctification,</hi> you that will stand to the trial, answer me truly and deliberately to these Questions. Do you hate every sin as the sheep doth the Mire? Do you regard no Iniquity in your hearts? Do you strive against, and oppose all sin, though it may seem never so necessary, never so natural to you, or have you not your secret haunts of evil? For every Swine will have his swill. Do you abstain from sin out of fear, or out of dislike? Are you at peace with no sin, or do you not hide some ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as a sweet morsel under your Tongue? Is there not some practice that you are not willing to know is a sin for fear you should be forced to leave it? Do you love the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that forbids your sin, or do you not wish it ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of the Bible, as that evil man wished God had never made the Seventh Commandment? Again, how do you stand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards Holiness? Do you love it? Do you choose it? Do you h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nger and thirst after it, &amp; desire it more than any Temporal good? Have you chosen the way of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and had rather live holily than be allowed to live in your sins? Do You in your very hearts prefer a Godly strict
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44944:43"/>
Life in communion with and conformity to God, before the greatest prosperity of the World? do you chose Holiness, not out of bare necessity, because you cannot go to Heaven without it, but out of <hi>love</hi> to it, and from a deep sense that you have of the surpassing excellency, and loveliness, and beauty of it? If it be thus with you, you are the persons that the Lord Jesus hath marked for his Sheep.</p>
               <p>And now, come ye blessed, all that have this mark upon you, come and understand your happiness; you are mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for preservation, and let it go how it will with the rest; that I know, it shall go well with you that fear the Lord, that fear before him. You are the separated ones, the sealed ones, upon whom the Angel hath set the Seal of the Living God; and so you are redeemed unto God from among men, being the first fruits unto God, and unto the Lamb, and have your Fathers Name written in your Fore-heads.</p>

and the workings of my heart towards you, are still calling upon me to stir you up by way of remembrance, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding you know and be established in the present Truth.

               <p>But now, my Brethren, I shall not with <hi>Paul</hi> call upon you so much to remember the resurrection of Christ, as the <hi>Return</hi> of Christ: <hi>Behold, He cometh in the Clouds, and every E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If the Lord return not, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my self undone, my Preaching is vain, and my suffering is vain, and the bottom in which I have intrusted all my hope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> is for ever miscarried. But I know whom I have trusted: We are built upon the foundation of that sure Word, we are not built upon the sand of Mortality. Nor do we run so as uncertainly, but the Word of the Lord abideth for ever, upon which Word do we hope; How fully doth this Word assure us that this same Jesus that is gone up into Heaven shall so return, and that he shall appear the second time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation, to them that look for him. Oh, how sure is the thing! how near is the time! how glorious will his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be!</p>
               <p>The thing is sure, the Day is set, God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the World by that man whom he

Doubtless he cannot deceive you, you have not only known, but seen and felt the truth of his promises.</p>

Wo unto you that ever you were born, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you should then be found to be <hi>New-born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you, O Children of the most high, how will you forget your travel, and be melted into joy. This is he in whom you have believed; whom having not seen ye loved. But how will love and joy be working (if I may so speak) with pangs unutterable, when you shall see him, and hear his sweet voice commending, applauding, approving of you, and owning you by name before all the World. Brethren, thus it must be, the Lord hath spoken it. See that you stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger not at the Promise, but give Glory to God by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>Again, the time is near, <hi>Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come. Behold, I come quickly,</hi> saith he: And again, <hi>The Lord is at hand:</hi> Sure you are, that death cannot be far off. O Christian, thou dost not know but the next year, nay, possibly the next week, thou mayest be in Heaven. Christ will not long endure thine absence, but will have thee up to him till the time of his general appearing; when he will take us up altogether, and so we shall be ever with the Lord.</p>
               <p>

If thou dost indeed, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but that thou shouldest live a life of love and praise; studying to do all the good thou canst till thou come to Heaven; and waiting all the days of thine appointed time till thy change shall come. O my Soul, look out and long. O my Brethren, be you as the Mother of <hi>Sisera,</hi> looking out at the Windows, and watching at the Latices, saying, why are his Chariot-wheels so long a coming. Though the time till you shall see him be but very short, yet love and longing make it seem tedious.</p>
               <p>My Beloved, comfort your hearts with these Words: look upon these things as the greatest reallities, and let your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be answerable to your expectations. I would not have told you these things, unless I had believed them: for it is for this hope that I am bound with this Chain. The blessing of the Holy Trinity be upon you, I am yours and will be.

               <p>But what do I speak of my love? it is the sense of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love of God your Father that I would have to dwell upon you. Forget me, so you remember him.

               <p>Brethren, Christ is real in all that he speaks unto you: He is not like a flourishing Lover, who fills up his Letters with Rhetorick, and hath more care of the dress of his Speech,

than of the Truth. Who ever gave demonstration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity of his love at so dear a rate as Christ hath done?

               <p>Brethren, possess your very hearts with this, that Christs love doth go out with infinite dearness towards you. Even now while he is in all his Glory, he earnestly remembers you still.

                     </gap>d are you among men.</hi> Sure your Lot is fallen in an happy place; what in the bosom of Christ? yea, and verily you may believe, and doubt not. I may apply that of <hi>Gabriel, O Daniel, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> art greatly beloved,</hi> unto you; you are beloved indeed, to have your Names written upon the very heart of Christ now he is in Glory.</p>
               <p>Oh, let his <hi>Name</hi> be written then on <hi>your</hi> hearts. Do not write his Name in the Sand, when he hath written yours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>own Brest!</hi> Do not forget him who hath taken such care, that while he is, he may never forget you, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded your names not onely on his <hi>Book,</hi> but on his <hi>Flesh,</hi> and set you as a Seal upon his heart. He hath you upon his heart, but why? For a memorial before the Lord continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so saith the Text. Beloved, your Lord is so far from forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you in all his Greatness and Glory, that he is gone into Heaven on purpose, there to present you before the Lord, that you may be always in remembrance before him O Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, Glory, yea, and Triumph in his love; Doubtless it must go well with us. Who shall condemn? It is Christ that died, and rose again, and is now making Intercession. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is potent. He is always present. Our Advocate is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of Court. Never did cause miscarry in his hand. Trust you safely in him. Happy is that man for whom he shall undertake to speak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:44944:47"/>Oh, the Riches of Christs love! he did not think it enough to die for you. His love and care doth not end with his natural life on Earth, but he ever liveth to make Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for us. His love is like his life, ever, ever: knowing no remission in degree, nor intermission of time, no cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of working, but is ever, ever, in motion towards us.</p>
               <p>But when shall I end, if I suffer my soul to run out its length, and my running Pen te enlarge according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of this boundless Field of Divine Love? If the Pens of all the World were imployed to write Volumes of love, if the tongues of all the living were exercised in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but talking of this love; If all the Hearts that be were made up of love; and all the powers and affections of the mind were turned into one, to wit the power of love, yet this were no less than infinitely too little, either to conceive, or to express the greatness of Christs love.</p>
               <p>O my dearly beloved, may your souls be swallowed up in this love. Think, and think while you will, you can never think how much you are beloved. See that ye love again by way of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> though not of <hi>Requital:</hi> what though your souls be but narrow, and your powers but little, yet love him with all you have. Love him with all your hearts, and all your strength. To the Meditations, and to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of Divine love I leave you, thinking it now not worth while to tell you of my Love, Remaining</p>

Here is no danger of being over much <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;</hi> neither can the Christian exceed his bounds in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing his own riches, and happiness in Christ. I am greatly pleased with the Lot that is fallen to me: the Lord hath dealt bountifully with me, and none shall stop this my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of boasting in Christ. But as my lot in him is above all, so I will assure you, it is no small content to me, that my lot is fallen with you. And though many difficulties have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to my lot among you (for I have broken my health and lost my liberty once and again, for your sakes) yet none of these things move me. I wish nothing more then to spend and to be spent upon the service of your Faith. I bless the Lord for it as an invalnable mercy, that ever he called me to be an Embassador of the Lord Jesus Christ to you-wards. In this station I desire to approve my self to him, and that I am withdrawn from my Work for a season, it is but that I may return to you refreshed, and inabled for my work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you. You may not think that I have forgotten you, and consulted my own ease and pleasure: but if God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper my intentions, I shall be found to have been daily ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you in this retirement. I will assure you, I am very
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44944:48"/>
tender of preserving all that little strength that God doth add to me entirely for your sakes: being resolved not so much as once to broach the Vessel till I draw forth to you. I bless the Lord, I am in great tranquility here in this Town, and walk up &amp; down the Corporation without any Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning me. Only it hath pleased the Lord to add to my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction since my coming, by taking away my dear Father, the day of whose glorious Translation was the day after my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving here. But I bless the Lord, I do believe and expect the return of the Redeemer with all his Saints, and the most glorious Resurrection of my own dead Body with all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: and this makes me to rest in Hope, and fills me with unspeakle more Joy than the death of my self or any other Saint can with grief. And now <hi>I</hi> make it my business to be rendred serviceable to you; and do by this, return you my hearty thanks for your earnest Prayers and Intercessions to God in my behalf, for it is he that must do the Cure: I seem to my self to be retired to this place, as a Vessel rent and shatter'd and torn in the Service, that it come to recruit in the <hi>Harbour:</hi> And here <hi>I</hi> am as it were rigging, and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Victualling to put sorth again in the Service: which I shall do with the first Wind, as soon as I am ready.

               <p>Be warned, my dearly Beloved, that you fall not upon those dangerous Rocks upon which so many Professors have been split.</p>
               <p>There are three things which I beseech you carefully to beware of.</p>

                  <hi>First, Lest while Christ is in your mouths, the world run away with your hearts:</hi> There is many a seeming Professor that will be fòund a meer Idolater? Many a Soul goes down to <hi>Hell</hi> in this sin, in the midst of his Profession, and never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it till it be too late. Remember, I beseech You, that the <hi>Oxen,</hi> the Farm, Wife, Merchandize, all of them lawful Comforts, did effectually keep men from a sound and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving closing with Christ, as the vilest lusts of the worst of men.

Little do most Professors think of this, while they please themselves in their estates, while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themselves so freely in their Children, in their Wives, in their habitations and possessions; that these be the things that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>re like to undo them for ever. How little is that Scripture thought of, which speaks so dreadfully to worldly Professors; <hi>Love not the World, for if any man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Are there not many among us, who though they do keep up Prayer, and other holy Duties; yet the strength and vigour of their hearts goeth out after earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things? And these are their chief care and their chief joy. Such must know, that they are none of Christs, and they were better to understand it now, and seek to be renewed by Repentance, then hereafter when there shall be no place for Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Lest while Iniquity doth abound, your love to Christ doth wax cold.</hi> Remember what an Abomination <hi>Laodicea</hi> was to Christ because she grew so luke-warm; and what a controversie he had with <hi>Ephesus,</hi> a sound Church, because she did but flacken and grow more remiss in her love. A friend is born for adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and now is, the time, if you will prove the sincerity of your love and friendship to Jesus Christ, by following him zealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, resolvedly, sully, now he is more rejected and opposed.</p>

Nay, it oft times happens in the Trade of Religion, as it doth in trading in the World, where many keep on in trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still, till for want of care and caution, and examining their accounts whether they go forward or backward, they trade themselves out of all. Oh, look to it my Brethren, that none of you rest in the doing of duties, but examine what comes of them. Otherwise as you may trade your selves into Poverty, so you may hear and pray your selves into hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart, and desperate security, and formality.

I remember your kindness to me in my Bonds, when once and again I was delivered up to a Prison for your sakes. I remember with much delight, how you refreshed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me in my Tribulations, how open your hearts were, and your hands were not straightned neither, for I was in want of nothing I may not, I must not forget what painful Journies you took to visit me, when in places remote the hand of the Lord had touched me, and though my long sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness almost incredible expensive to me, yet your Supplies did not a little lighten my Burthen.</p>
               <p>And though I put it last, yet I do not mind it least, that you have been so ready in returning Praises to God in my behalf, your thanksgiving to God, my dear Brethren, do administer abundant cause to me of my giving thanks unto you.</p>
               <p>And now my heart methinks is big to tell you a little of my love to you surely you are dear unto me; but though it be sweet to tell the story of love, yet in this I will restrain my s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>lf For I fear least as the wise man saith of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of strife, so I should find of the beginning of love, that it is like the letting forth of the Water; and the rather I do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But if I sing the song of love, O let Divine Love overcarry the praise; I found my self in straights when I began to speak of the natural love between my dear people, and an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Minister of Christ to them; and it seemed that all that I have said was much too little, but now I have to speak of the love God, it seems to be by far too much.</p>
               <p>O infinite love never to be Comprehended, but ever to be admired, magnified, and adored by every Creature! O let my heart be filled, let my Mouth be filled, let my papers be filled ever, ever filled with the thankful Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this matchless love. O turn your eyes from other objects! O bury me in forgetfulness, and let my love be no more mentioned nor had in remembrance among you, so that you may be throughly possessed and inflamed with the love of God. This, my Beloved, this is that love which is ever to be commended, and extolled by you. See that you studie this love, fill your souls with wonder, and feast your souls with joy, and be ravished with rich contentment in this Divine Love: Take your daily walk, and lose your selves in the Field of Love: Drink, O Friends, yea drink abundantly, O Beloved, fear no excess. O that your souls may be drencht and drowned in the love of Christ, till you can every one say with the ravisht Spouse, <hi>I am sick of love.</hi> Marvel not that I wander here, and seem to forget the bounds of a Letter, this love obligeth me, yea, rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth me. Who in all the Earth should admire and commend this love if I should not? I feel it, I taste it, the sweet savour thereof reviveth my soul, it is light to mine eyes, and life to mine heart; the warm Beams of this blessed Sun, O how have they comsorted me, ravished, and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me both in Body and Soul! my benumbed Limbs, my withered hands, my feeble knees, my bones quite naked of flesh do yet again revive through the quickning, healing, and raising influence of Divine Grace and Love. Now my own hands can feed me, and my own seet can bear me, my appetite is quick, my sleep comfortable, and God is pleased to give some increase continually though by insensible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and shall not I praise that love and grace that hath done all this for me? yea, what is this to all I have to tell you? My heart is enlarged, but I told you Paper could not hold what I have to speak of the goodness of the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Gracious God, in which I live. I am forced to end, least you should not bear my length. My dearly Beloved, I send

               <opener>

               </opener>
               <p>MY hearts desire and Prayer for you is, that you may be saved. This is that which I have been Praying and studying, and Preaching for these many <hi>Years:</hi> and this is the end of my Venturing, and Suffering, and Writing at this present time. God that knoweth all things, he knoweth that this is my wish; Oh that I could but come at their Souls! And that this is the prize and the gain that I run for, that I might win souls. I seek not other gifts, give me your hearts, let me but part between your sins and you; suffer me but to save you; give me leave to carry you over to Jesus Christ, and I will not ask you any more. I will serve you gladly, I will suffer for you thankfully, so I may but save you. Do not wonder why I follow you so pressingly, why I call upon you so frequently; let not my importunity be grievous to you, all this is but to save you. Christ did not bethink his Blood, and shall I think my Breath, or Ink, too dear in order to your salvation? what pitie is it, that any of you should
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44944:51"/>
miscarry at last, under the power of Ignorance, or by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane negligence, or a formal and lifeless profession of strict Godliness.</p>
               <p>Beloved, I am afraid of you lest (as to many of you) I have run in vain. I cannot but most thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that (considering the paucity of those that are saved) there are not a few of you who are the joy of your Ministers, and the Glory of Christ. But it cannot be dissembled, that far the greater number give little ground to hope, that they are in the state of Salvation. And must not this be a pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought to a compassionate Teacher, to think, that he cannot for his heart perswade men, but that the most of them will wilfully throw away themselves? Is it not a wosul sight, to behold the Devils driving a great part of our miserable Flocks (as they did once the Herd of Swine, the Keepers themselves amazed looking on.) I say, driving them vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently down the hill, till they be choaked in the Water, and drowned irrecoverably in the Gulf of endless Perdition? Ah mserable spectacle! What through the wilful blindness of some, what through the loseness and sensuality of others, what through the halving, and Cold, and customary Religion of others, how great a number of our poor Flocks, is Satan like to carry utterly away from us, after all that hath been done to save them?</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot but call after them. Hearken unto me, O ye Children. How long will ye love Vanity, and follow after leasing, and trust in lying Words? As the Lord liveth you are lost, except you turn: Wherefore turn your selves and live ye. Ah how Mercy woeth you! How it waiteth to be gracious to you? Hear, O sinners, hear. See you not how the merciful Saviour of the World stretcheth forth his hands all the day long, and spreadeth forth his Wings, and calleth you as a Hen doth her Chickens! hear you not the soundings of his Bowels? He had no need of you; Yet how do his compassions melt over perishing sinners? his heart is turned within him, and shall not this turn your hearts? his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are kindled together; and shall not this lead you to repentance? Behold, he standeth at the door and knocketh. O man wilt thou keep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Lord? Oh his melting love to sinners! He calleth after them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. He weepeth over them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41, 42. He crieth to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23. How long ye sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones, will you love simplicity? Will you not be made clean? When shall it once be? Why will you die? Turn you at my Reproof: Behold, I will pour out my Spirit upon you. Sinner, art thou not yet melted? Oh come in at his loving Calls, Come out from thy sins: Touch the Scepter of Grace and live: Why shouldest thou be dashed in pieces by his Iron Rod? Kiss the Son: Why shouldst thou perish in the way? Set up Jesus as thy King, lest he count thee sor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Oh how dreadful will this Case be, to perish under the pittiful Eyes of his Mercy, and to die by the hand of a Saviour! Oh double hell, to have thy Redeemer become thine Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner! And the hand that was so long stretched forth to save thee, to be now stretched forth to slay thee! And the merciful heart of Christ himself hardned against thee, so as that he should call thee forth, and with his own hand hew thee in pieces, (as <hi>Samuel</hi> did <hi>Agag</hi> before the Lord.)</p>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> have been too too long in prefacing to what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended forthwith to have fallen upon: Indeed <hi>I</hi> am apt to run out in matters that do so nearly touch upon your greatest Concernments.</p>
               <p>Beloved, I despair of ever bringing you to Salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sanctification: Or possessing You with Happiness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perswading you to Holiness. God knows <hi>I</hi> have not the least hope ever to see one of your Faces in Heaven, except You be Converted and Sanctified, and exercise your selves unto Godliness. This is that I drive at. <hi>I</hi> beseech you study to further <hi>Personal Godliness,</hi> and <hi>Family Godliness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Personal Godliness.</hi> Let it be your first care to set up Christ in your Hearts. See that you make all your worldly Interests to stoop to him, that You be entirely and unreser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly devoted unto him. If You wilfully, and deliberately, and ordinarily harbour any sin, You are undone. See that You unfeignedly take the Laws of Christ, as the rule of your words, thoughts, and actions; and subject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

a true respect to all Gods Commandments, you are sound at heart. Oh study to get the Image and impress of Christ upon you within. Begin with your hearts, else you build without a foundation. Labour to get a saving change within, or else all external performances will be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And then study to shew forth the power of Godliness in the life. Let Piety be your first and great business. 'Tis the highest point of Justice, to give God his due. Beware that none of you be a Prayerless person: sor that is a most certain discovery of a Christless, and a graceless person, of one that is a very stranger to the fear of God. Suffer not your Bibles to gather dust. See that you converse daily with the Word. That man can never lay claim to Blessedness, whose delight is not in the Law of the Lord. Let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>editati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and self-examination be your daily exercise, else the Papists, yea the Pagans, will condemn us. That the short questions, which I have given you as a help to self-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be daily perused by you, is the matter of my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate request unto you. If ever you come to any growth in Holiness, without the constant use of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But Piety, without Charity, is but the half of Christia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

See therefore that you do justly, and love mercy, and let Equity, and Charity run like an even Thred, throughout all your dealings. Be you temperate in all things, and let Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, and and Sobriety, be your undivided Companions. Let truth and Purity, Seriousness and modesty, Heavenliness and gravity be the constant ornaments of your speech. Let patience and humility, simplicity &amp; sincerity shine out in all the parts of your conversations.

your conversations to all men. Let none of your Relations want that love and loyalty, that reverence and duty, that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, care, and vigilancy, which their several places and capacities call for. This is throughout Godliness. I charge you before the most high God, that none of you be found a swearer, or a Lyar, a lover of evil company, or a scoffer, or malicious, or covetous, or a drunkard, or a glutton, unrighteous in his dealing, unclean in his living, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="2">2. Family Godliness. He that hath set up Christ in his heart, will be sure to study to set him up in his house. Let every family with you be a Christian Church; every house, a house of Prayer; every houshold a houshold of saith. Let every housholder say, with <hi>Joshua, I, with my House will serve the Lord,</hi> and resolve with <hi>David, Psalm</hi> 121. 2. <hi>I will walk within my house, with a perfect heart.</hi> Let me press upon you a few duties, which <hi>I</hi> have been long harping upon, but Alas (<hi>I</hi> speak it to your shame) with many (too too many) of you, to little purpose in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Let Religion be in your Families, not as a matter by the by, (to be minded at leisure, when the world will give you leave) but the standing business of the house.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Settle it upon your Hearts, that your Souls are bound up in the Souls of your Family. They are committed unto you, and (if they be lost through your neglect) will be required at your hands; Sirs, if you do not, you shall know that the charge of Souls is a heavy charge, and that the Blood of Souls is a heavy guilt. O man, hast thou a charge of Souls to answer for, and dost thou not yet bestir thy self for them, that their Blood be not found in thy Skirts? Wilt thou do no more for immortal Souls, than thou wilt do for thy Beasts that perish? What dost thou do for thy Children, and Servants? Thou providest Meat and Drink for them, agreeable to their Natures, and dost thou not the same for

as it is darkly drawn there, and tell me, what think you of that worthy portion, that goodly Heritage? will not all this make you amends for your stay? Why then act like Believers. Never bethink the pains, nor expences of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Let no man fear he shall come off a loser. What though you are much upon the spending hand? I might tell you, God is beforehand with you however: but I would have you principally to look forward.

Be ye also patient, stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

Oh, if he were but sure, that every Corn would bear a Crown with what exaltation and joy, rather than pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, would he go through all his cost and labour. Why, Brethren, such is a Believers increase. Every Grain shall produce a Crown; and every Tear shall bring forth a Pearl; and every minute in pains or Prayers, an age of Joy and Glory. Besides, the Husbandman <unclear>hath</unclear> long patience, and will not you have a little patience? It is not long patience th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Or the Merchant sit down and give up his hopes, when within sight of the Harbour? Or will the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band man despond, and give up all for lost, when he sees the Fields even <unclear>white</unclear> for the Harvest? Or shall he do more for

a crop of Corn, than you will do for a crop of Glory? far be it. Behold the Judge is even at Door. The Lord is at hand. He cometh quickly, and his reward is with him. He comes with the Crown in his hand, to set upon the head of patience. Therefore cast not away your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. The Prisoners of the Lord, your Brethren in the patience of Jesus, can tell you, it is good suffering for such a Master.

It is the Joy of our Bonds, Beloved, to hear that the Word is not bound, and that Satan hath not his design upon the People of God, who doubtless intended by these Sufferings to have struck Terrour into them, and to have made their Hands weak. Know, dear Christians, that the Bonds of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are not tedious through Grace unto us, that Christ is a Master worth a suffering for, that there is really enough in Religion to defray all our Charges, to quit all the Cost and Expence you can be at in or upon it; That you may Build upon it that you can never be losers by Jesus Christ, that Christs Prison is better than the Worlds Paradise, that the Divine Attributes are alone an All-sufficient Livelihood, that the Influences of Heaven, and shines of Gods Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance are sufficient to lighten the darksomest Dungeon, and to perfume and sweeten the noisomest Prison to a poor Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; that if you can bring Faith and Patience, and the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the Divine Favour with you to a Prison, you will live comfortably in spight of Earth &amp; Hell. These are Truths that the Prisoners of Christ can in a measure Seal unto; and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44944:58"/>
I would have you to be more soundly assured of, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in. Brethren we are of the same mind in a Prison, that we were os in the Pulpit; that there is no life to a life of Holiness; that Christ, and his Yoak, and his Cross, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation; that it is the best, and wisest, and safest and gainfulllest course in the World to stick close to Christ and his Ways, and to adhere to them in all hazards. Come on, Beloved Christians, come on, stack not your pace, but give diligence to the full assurance of Hope unto the end, and be ye followers of them who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises. Strengthen the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees. If you faint in the day of Adversity, your strength is small. Chear up, my Brethren, look what a Crown, what a Kingdom here is; What say you? Is not here a worthy Portion, a goodly Heritage? Were it not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to lose all this for want of Diligence and Patience? Come, dear Christians, and fellow Travellers, <hi>I</hi> pray you, let us put on: Pluck up the weary Limbs, our Home is within sight. Lift up your Eyes from the <hi>Pisga</hi> of the Promises: You may see the Land of Rest. Will any of you think of returning into <hi>Egypt?</hi> God forbid: A little patience, and Christ will come. Behold, the Husbandman waiteth for the precious fruits of the Earth, and hath long patience till he receive the early and later Rain: Be ye also patient, stablish your Hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. He is not a Christian indeed, that cannot be content to tarry for his Preferment in another World. Cast upon it, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that your Kingdom is not of this World; that here you must have Tribulations, and that all is well as long as we are secured for Eternity. Exhort one another daily: strive together in Prayer, unite your strength therein, and pull a main: Mercy will come sooner or later, however we will be content to wait till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ah how surely will he come! He will render Tribulation to them that trouble us, and to us that are troubled, rest with him. Onely believe and wait: What not watch with him one hour? Why the Judge is even at the door! And how blessed will you be if you do but continue and hold fast till he come! Watch therefore, and stand fast, quit you like men, be Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and let your hearts be strong: God is your Friend, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44944:59"/>
you may trust him. He is able to bear you out, and bear you up: faint not therefore, but be stedfast, unmoveable, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the works of the Lord. Speak often one to another, provoke to love, and to good Works. Let the Bay of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Godliness, make the Torrent of your Zeal break over with the more violence. But it's time to end, I have been bold to call upon you, you see; and to stir you up by way of remembrance. May the Spirit of the most high God excite you, encourage you, enflame you: may these poor lines be some quickning to you: may the good-will of him that dwelt in the Bush dwell with you. My dear loves to you all, pray sor the Prisoners. Farewel dear Brethren, farewel in the Lord, I am</p>

               <p>WHom this will find you, or when, or where, I know not; but I have shot this arrow at a venture. Once you were an Associate with me in <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> where I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your blameless Conversation, and your zealous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for, and adhesion to the ways and people of God. May you be still found in the same paths of holiness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man shall see God. The vows of God are upon me (which, I confess, I have been to slack to pay) that I would put you in remembrance, and in all Brotherly tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness advise you, to remember from whence you are sallen. I was informed, before your leaving of <hi>England,</hi> of many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy miscarriages, which the great reproach of your holy profession, you had been too manifestly guilty of, I am not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44944:59"/>
without some hope, that the Lord may have since recalled you, and brought you back to himself: and yet not without more fear, lest, if the power of corruption were so strong, as to precipitate you with such violence, at such a time as that was, and in such a place as <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Oxon</hi> where you had so many encouragements, and inducements, examples, and faithful friendly, watchful observers, you may now much more be carried away, in such a place, and among such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as now you may be likely to be in. Sir, I beseech you to be assured, that nothing but the conscience of my duty hath engaged me, now you have been so many years a stranger to me, and are at so many thousand miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from me, to write notwithstanding to you. And I beseech you, bear a little with me. Is it wisdom after you have begun in the Spirit, to end in the flesh? you did run well, who hath hindred you? I remember your strict walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, your holy converse, your many tears: will you-lose the things that you have wrought? have you found out another, a nearer way to Heaven? do you hope to get in at the wide Gate, in the broad way? need I to mind you, that it had been better for you never to have known the way of Life, then after you have known it, to turn aside from the Holy Commandment? can you ever enter into Gods Hill, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you be of clean hands, and a pure heart? I know, you are not ignorant, <hi>That strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it:</hi> and will you yet do as the most, and decline the way of strictness, and whole self-denial, and give the flesh the reins? what, when God, that cannot lie, hath said, <hi>If you live after the <unclear>fleshe</unclear>, you shall die?</hi> Do you not know that you do in vain name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, except you depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity?

               <p>THou seemest to have been long from me: let nothing any longer detain thee, but my Sisters necessity, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Authority. I am very sorry that thou should lose two Sacraments. I am in a comfortable state of health, through Divine goodness, to which be glory for ever. See that thou love and admire that Fountain of our life, and peace; and be ever mindful that 'tis all thy business to love, and serve, and praise thy Creator and Redeemer. I have no other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness but this to write to thee about: but this is all our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness What be use to call business is but vanity and pastime and some by matter in comparison of this. Remember and forget not that 'tis thy chief end to glorifie God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him for ever. Learn well that Lesson, and know that it is the only thing necessary. Every morning remember that thy serving and pleasing of God, is the whole business of that day, and therefore set out accordingly with an express design and intention to please God in thy eating, drinking, visiting, conversing, calling, and duties of thy Relations throughout the day. My most dear heart, I have nothing in the world that doth concern thee, or me so much to write of to thee, as this is. Oh that thou mayst still be laying up in Heaven! still furthering thy account; still adding to the heap, and encreasing thy glorious reward! nothing is done for God, but thou shalt hear of it again. Whatever is not done for God, is but so much lost. Those things which others do being led by their natural affections and desires, those things do thou do with holy aims, for spiritual ends, and then God will put it on the account, as so much done for him. So it is my dearest, God keeps a true account. See that thou believe it, and so plow in hope, and sowe in hope, pray and hear with an eye to the sure reward. Let thy hopes be strong and lively, and then thy hands will be strong, and thy resolutions and affections will be strong.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44944:61"/>
My time is very precious, and I would not lose any inch of it. See thou to it, that my time in writing this letter be not lost time. Love God the more, and set thine heart the straighter towards him, and do but practice this one thing, in every solemn action to look to thy ends, and then I have got well, and thou better by these Counsels.

               <p>MY heart is now a little at rest to write to thee. I have been these three days much disturbed, and set out of frame. Strong solicitations I have had from several hands, to accept very honourable preferment in several kinds, some friends making a Journey on purpose to propound it, but I have not found the invitations (though I confess very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and such as are or will be suddenly embraced by men of far greater worth and eminency) to suit with the inclinations of my own heart, as I was confident they would not with thine. I have sent away my friends satisfied with the reasons of my refusal, and am now ready with joy to say with <hi>David. Soul return unto thy rest.</hi> But alas, that such things should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb me, I would live above this lower region, that no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages or providence whatsoever might put me out of frame, nor disquiet my soul, and unsettle me from my desirest rest. I would have my heart fixed upon God, so as no occurrences might disturb my tranquility, but I might be still in the same quiet and even frame. Well, though I am apt to be unsettled, and quickly set off the hinges, yet methinks I am like a Bird
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44944:61"/>
out of the nest, I am never quiet till I am in my old way of Communion with God, like the needle in the Compass that is restless, till it be turned towards the Pole. I can say through grace with the Church, with my soul have I desired thee in the night, and with my Spirit within me have I sought thee early, my heart is early and late with God, and 'tis the business and delight of my life to seek him. But alas, how long shall I be a seeking? how long shall I spend my days in wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and desiring, when my glorified Brethren spend theirs in rejoycing and enjoying? look as the poor imprisoned captive sighs under the burdensome clog of his Irons and can only pear through the Grace, and think of, and long for the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that liberty which he sees others enjoy: such me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks is my condition: I can only look through the Grate of this Prison my flesh, I see <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>HAd not my right hand long since forgot her cunning, and the Almighty shook the Pen out of my hand. I should long ere this have been writing to thee: but it is a wonder of Divine Power and goodness that my soul had not before this time dwelt in silence, and that death had not put the long period to all my writing and converse.</p>
               <p>O my <hi>Pylades,</hi> what shall I say unto thee now I begin to write, where shall I begin, when shall I end? methinks I am as a full Bottle quite inverted, where the forward pressing of the overhasty liquor makes the evacuatin more flow, and my thoughts are like a thronging croud sticking in the door.</p>
               <p>Long is the song of love that I have to tell thee, I rejoice in the constancie of thy love, that the waters of so long a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and so great a distance have not yet quenched it, but thy desires are towards me, and thy heart is with me, though providence hath hindred me from thy much desired compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I will assure thee it hath been a pleasure to my heart a good part of this summer to hope that I should come one half of the way to give thee a meeting; but such is my weakness hitherto, that I am forced to put off those hopes till the Spring, when, if God give me strength to ride, I intend to see thee before mine own Home. I thank thee for all the dear expressions of thy fervent love: Methinks I see it, and feel how it runs through all the veins of every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

every Line? I needed not so chargeable a Testomony as thy golden Token, with which I was somthing displeased, because <hi>I</hi> thought thou needest more than my self: but the love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by expressed is most dearly welcome to me. What thou talkest of Retribution, and of Justice, doth not so well relish with me, because the Phrases seem improper to the love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest between us, <hi>I</hi> never lookt for any return from thee but love, which is the paying of all thy Debts: my expences have indeed been vast and almost incredible; but surely goodness, and mercy hath followed me, and do follow me in every place, and in every change of my condition; so that as to temporals I have lack of nothing, and as for spirituals I abound and superabound, and the streams of my comforts have been full and running over; the joy of the Lord hath been my strength at weakest, and in the multitude of my thoughts within me, his comforts have refresh'd my Soul, I have found God a satisfying portion to me, and have sat down under his shadow with full delights, and his fruit is most sweet to my taste: he is my strength and my Song, for I will talke of him, and write of him with perpetual pleasure. Through grace, <hi>I</hi> can say, methinks <hi>I</hi> am now in my Element, since I have begun to make mention of him, I am rich in him, and happy in him, and my soul saith unto him with <hi>Divid,</hi> Thou hast made me most Blessed for evermore, and happy is the hour that ever I was born to be made partaker of so blisful a Treasure, so endless a felicity, so Angelical Prerogatives, as <hi>I</hi> have in him; O sweet are his converses, how delightful it is to Triumph in his Love!</p>
               <p>Suffer me to be free with thee, where should I pour out my Soul, if not into thy bosom? did the poor woman call upon her friends and neighbours to rejoyce together with her at the finding of a lost Groat? and shall not I tell to thee the keeper of the Secrets of my Soul, &amp; the friend of my inmost Bosom, what a friend is the Lord to me, though an unworthy sinner, shall not I run and tell thee what a treasure I have found.

               <opener>
                  <salute>Most Honoured Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>MAny charges have passed over both you and my self, since my last Writing to you, but I am glad to hear that in that great change of your condition, you have made so wise and happy a choice. Mine unfeigned desire to God is for your Temporal and Spiritual prosperity; and that the blessings of both Worlds may be heaped up upon you. Yet I should desire you not to expect too much here, nor to count it a strange thing, if you meet with disappointments. Is it enough if you have the Lord for your portion, and Heaven for your Inheritance; though the World should not answer your expectations. I doubt not but you will be likely, as well as we, to meet with manifold temptations: the Lord make you, when you have done all to stand. Hold out a while in faith, patience, and self-denial, and you shall be as sure as God can make you of the Crown. Now arise and shine, and hold forth the power of holiness in all your converse. We have lived in times when Religion was the way to credit and esteem, and then it was more difficult to discern sincerity of ones profession, because men might be drawn to it upon worldly ends. But now is the time when God will prove us, if we will appear for him, and own his ways, when they are the common scorn of the World. Oh Sir, think it not hard if God do call you forth to own him in such a time as this, when few of your rank and quality will bear you company: but look upon it as a special advantage to prove your sincerity, and your fidelity to the Lord your Maker. The holy and blessed life of that noble Marquess <hi>Galeacius,</hi> I should much commend to your reading and imitation. Court not the World nor its preserments, <hi>Moses</hi> his self-denying choice. which the World would have branded for unparalled folly, when he voluntarily left all the Court-preferments and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, the wisest Judge commends for the great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that you will be yet more vile. Remember who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the reproaches of Christ greater riches, than the Treasures of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Verily it is a greater honour to you to be vilified for Christ, than to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now then is your time to get the true honour. <unclear>Few</unclear> of your places and dignity, will take this way to get it: But he that can but use the prospective os Faith, and look as far as the approaching Judgement, will easily see the vanity of the worlds riches and flattering pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and the everlasting glory and honour wherewith the dispised Saints shall surely be Crowned. Fix your eyes and Meditations here, and that will set you above the worlds temptations, when by its offers or threatnings it would make you to warp, and to let go your hold-fast of Eternal life. Now is the time for you to make Heaven sure, and when that is done, you are prepared for the worst that can come. I desire you to accept of my service and respects, and my Wives, which I do hereby present unto you, and to your most deserving yoak-fellow, whom I unfeignedly honour though I never saw her, not so much for her noble blood, which yet calls sor great respects, as for her far more noble qualifications, and priviledges of her second birth.

               <p>THough I have been in the valley of the shadow of death, though I have had more than one foot in the Grave, and have been in deaths often, yet the love and remembrance of you, ever liveth on my heart: I have long had neither feet to walk nor hands to write, yet I have borrowed hands as you see, rather than I would stay any longer from warning and admonishing of you. Dear Couzin, that soul of yours, that precious-immortal soul is of no light value with me! I pray hard for its Salvation: I have a Godly fear for you, lest your soul should miscarry in a crowd of worldly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of earthly cares Ah, my dear Niece, it comforts me that you are so setled for this world, and are in want of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I bless the Lord for this, but me thinks this doth not satisfie me. Oh, that I could be sure that you were once safe setled in Christ; though you are, I trust comfortably fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with earthly things, yet in this you are but half pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for: have you a Treasure in Heaven? have you laid hold on eternal life? have you made sure work for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting? have you past the straits of the New-Birth? do you bear upon you the marks of the Lord Jesus?</p>

               <p>Ah, dear Couzin, rouze up your self make conscience, to deal plainly and freely with your soul, say within your self, I have hopes for Heaven? but where are my grounds and my

Evidences? do I not build without a foundation? do I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my Salvation upon meer uncertainties? What have I, what do I more than others? I pray, I hear, I read, but may not a meer Hypocrite do all this? I run not with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the wretched practice of Lying, and Couzening, Whoredom, and the like; but what is this more than a Pharisee may have to say for himself? can I prove by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture my claim to Heaven? can I produce Chapter and Verse to justifie my self?</p>
               <p>Oh Couzin, fear, least a Promise being left of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rest, you should by any mistakes, or self-deceits fall short through unbelief; fear lest you should take Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of your immortal soul is dear to me, and is the matter of my sollicitons care and prayer. <hi>Dear Cousin,</hi> methinks I feel a Godly jealousie of you within my heart, lest you should lose your soul amongst a croud of worldly cares and business. O remember the story of him in the Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> who relates that he had a Soldier committed to his keeping, upon condition that he should lose his life if he did let him go: <hi>But while thy servant went hither and thither, the man escaped.</hi> But the King replies presently, <hi>Even so shall thy judgement be; thy life shall go for his life.</hi> Ah <hi>Cousin,</hi> take earnest heed, lest while you are going hither and thither, minding many things, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

Consider, that whatever your business be, you must and will have an eating time, and a sleeping time. Oh be as sollicitous every day to keep your praying times, which are a thousand times more necessary than a time to eat in, or sleep. Be sure that there doth not a morning or evening pass over your head, in which you have not perfumed your Closer with solemn and fervent prayer. And take heed, it you love your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, lest Saran beguile you with the bare outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duties a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There is no hopes of your Salvation, without a sound mortification to the world; you must be mortified to your worldly expectations: look not for much from tbe world; promise not your self much from the world; seek not great things for your self: say unto God, So I may have thee for my portion, and thy Kingdom for my inheritance, give or deny me what thou wilt, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or riches, any thing or nothing, I will be contented with my Lot. Say unto your soul, So I may but have Christ, so I may but carry it for the other world, let this world go which way it will: I must be converted or condemned; I must be born again, or else would I had never been born: but of this present world there is no such necessity; I may be poor, and yet happy: but wo unto me if I remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified: I must have grace, or perish for ever. <hi>Dear Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin,</hi> if I live, you shall find me a friend to your worldly prosperity; but whether I live or die, I charge you by the Lord, that you be infinitely tender of your immortal souls everlasting concernments.

                  <salute>Dear Cousin,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE welcome tydings of your safe arrival at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> is come to my ears; as also the News of your escape from a perillous sickness, for which <hi>I</hi> bless the Lord, and desire to be thankful with you: for <hi>I</hi> am not without a care for your well being, but do look upon my self as really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in you. <hi>I</hi> have considered, that God hath be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>est you of a careful Father, and that your Mother takes but little care for you; so that you have none nearer than my self to watch for your Soul, and to charge and admonish you in the Lord, and to take care of you. But yet, <hi>Dear Cousin,</hi> be not discouraged by these things, but look to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, flie unto Jesus, put away every known sin, set upon the conscientious performance of every known duty; make Christ your choice, embrace him upon his own terms; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up your self, body and soul to him; see that you have no reserves nor limitations in your choice of him; give him your very heart; cast away your worldly hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, make Religon your very business. O Cousin, these things do, and you shall be sure of a friend in Heaven to take the care of you; and, if I may be any comfort to you, you shall not fail, while I live, to have one friend on earth to take care for you. You are gone far from me, even to the uttermost parts of the Earth; but I have sent these Lettters to call even thither after you; yea, not onely to call, but to cry-in your Ears, O what is like to become of your Soul! Where is that immortal Soul of yours like to be lodged for ever? Amongst Devils, or Angels? Upon a Bed of Flames, or in the joys of Paradise? Dear Cousin, go aside by your self in secret, retire from the noise of the World, and say to your self, <hi>Oh my Soul! whither art thou going? do not I know in my very heart that I must be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or condemned? That I must be Sanctified, or I can never be Saved?</hi> Oh my Soul! what seekest thou! what designs do
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44944:68"/>
I drive at? what is my chief care? which way do <hi>I</hi> bend my course? Is it for this World, or the World to-come? Do I first seek the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof? Do I think Heaven will drop into my mouth? that Glory and immortality will be got with a wet finger, with cold Prayers, and heartless wishes, while the World carries the main of my heart? Do I think to be Crowned, and yet never fight? to get the race, and never run? to enter at the strait gate, and never strive? to overcome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers, and never wrestle? No, no; say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your self, Oh my Soul, either lay by the hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever, or else rouse up thy self, put forth thy strength in seeking after God and Glory; either lay by thy World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hopes, or thy hopes of immortality; away with thy sins, or thou must let Christ go for ever; think not to have Christ and the World too, to serve God and Mammon, it cannot be: If thou follow the World as thy chief desire and delight; if thou live after the flesh, thou must die, count upon it, the Lord hath spoken it, and all the World can never reverse it. Thus reason the case with your own Soul, and give not rest to your self night nor day, till you are gotten off from the World, broken off from the wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ull practice of every known sin, and gotten safe into Christ. Dear Cousin, I charge you by the Lord, to observe these things; pray over them, weep over them, read them again and again; do not pass them over as slight and ordinary things: your Soul is at stake, it is your Salvation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them; think not I am in jest with you. Ah Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, I travel in birth with you, till Christ be formed in you. Why should you die? Oh repent and live, lay hold on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, win Christ, and you win all. O be thankful to the Lord, that now you are fatherless and friendless, yet you have one Remembrancer to warn you to flie from the wrath to come. God forbid that I should find you at last in the place of Torments, for your not embracing the Godly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. To conclude, in short, I charge you as a Minister, as a Father to you, Take heed of these three things:</p>

               </list>
               <p>God abhors that the proud should come near him: Oh labour, whatever you do, for an humble heart; be little, be vile in your own eyes; seek not after great things; be poor in Spirit; without this, Heaven will be no place for you, God will be no friend to you. Dear Cousin, your lot is fallen, as I fear, in a place of great wickedness, where your Soul is in much danger, where your temptations are many, and your helps for Heaveu but few; where Godly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are rare, and many will entice you to sin and vanity. O! if you love me, or love your Soul, look about you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider your danger, fear lest you should miscarry for ever by worldly loss and vain company, which proves to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the fearful cause of their eternal perdition. <hi>I</hi> can but warn you, and pray for you: but though you have none to oversee you, remember the strict and severe eye of God is upon you, to observe all your actions, and that he will sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring all your practices into his Judgement. Your Aunt, with my self, commend our dear love to you; and I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the Lord, and remain,</p>

               <p>THough you are removed far from me, out of my sight, and the Seas as a great Gulf are fixed betwixt you and me; yet my Prayers follow you, and my good wishes for your present and everlasting welfare, like the wings of a Dove, take speedy flight. I look upon my self, now God hath removed my Brother, to be as in the room of a Father to you, yea and of a Mother too; for I know you have but little help from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:44944:69"/>My Dear Neece, my heart is careful for you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> cannot cease, while I am in being in this World, to warn and admonish you, as my Children, and to call upon you in the Name of the Eternal God, to awaken your selves with all Godly fear and holy diligence, lest by any means you should come short of the glory of God.</p>
               <p>Let me mind you, dear Cousins, of the dangerous place your stand in, and look about you with trembling. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I see Satan watching for your Souls, as the Dragon did for the Seed of the Woman, waiting to devour it as soon as she should be delivered. Know you not, that you must wrestle with Principalities and Powers? Methinks <hi>I</hi> see Temptations surrounding you, and belaguering you, as the enemy about the Walls of the Treacherous party with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, <hi>I</hi> mean carnal affections and corruptions, complo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge how to deliver up the Castle. Know you not, that your fleshly Lusts do war against your Souls? and that your own hearts are not true to you, but deceitful above all things? Lord, what need have you to bestir your selves, and to flie unto Jesus! to distrust your selves, and to trust onely in him and his Righteousness! Oh work your Salvation with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ear and trembling: Do you ever think to escape these mighty enemies, to conquer the power, and avoid the plots and snares of those potent adversaries, without most pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diligence? O cry to Heaven for help; watch and pray; fear, lest a promise being left of entring into rest, either of you should come short of it.</p>
               <p>My dear Neeces, you have many do watch for your souls, to devoor them; but I doubt too few, except my self, do watch for your Souls, to save them: therefore I look upon my self, who am now upon the matter your only Monitor, to be the more concerned to awaken my self to your help, and to look after you, and to watch for you, left by any means you should miscarry by the deceits and temptations wherewith you are encompassed. <hi>I</hi> would not have you over-careful for the things of this lise, though <hi>I</hi> commend your laudable care and diligence, that you may not be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome to any man; but <hi>I</hi> commend to you a better a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

for the things of the Lord.</hi> Ah, let this be your eare; seek first the Kingdom of God, and the Righteousness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and then all these things shall be added; you have Gods sure promise for it: If the Lord give me to live and prosper, you shall see and know, that <hi>I</hi> am not a friend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in words to you; but however that shall be, see that you embrace the Counsels of God from me. Oh make sure of Heaven betimes, walk humbly with God, beware of a proud heart and a lofty spirit; abhor your selves, else God will not be pleased with you; condemn your selves, that God may acquit you. The leven of pride will sowre the whole lump, and mar all your Profession and Religion, and render your Persons, and Prayers, and all, an abomination to the Lord, if it prevail in you. Oh therefore be not high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but fear; and by prayer and watchfulness restrain and root up this wretched corruption of pride, which is a sin so natural to you, that you had need to use an infinite care and caution to keep it under.</p>
               <p>As to my self, these may acquaint you, That I have been often at the very gates of death: I have lost all my limbs; but prayer hath redeemed me from my extremities, and God hath blessed the use of the <hi>Bath</hi> to me. Oh praise the Lord, praise him for my sake, and give glory to the God of my Life. Love him, honour and glorifie him, whose favour and friendship hath filled my Soul with comfort, and given a resurection to my body. I can now walk alone, and feed my self, but am altogether unable to write, which is the reason why these come to you in another hand. Dear Cousin, you may think me too tedious; but you must pardon me, if <hi>I</hi> erre in my love and zeal for your welfare: And now I shall trespass no more, but with my own and dear Wives love to you, I commend you to God, and rest,</p>

                  <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have received yours of the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> but it came to me in the time of my sickness, in which I was much a stranger to writing; it con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nued upon me five months, and to this day so much weakness remains in my arms, that I am not able to put off or on my own clothes. Your Letter was exceeding welcome to me, not only as reviving the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our old friendship, but also, as bringing me news of some spiritual good that you received by me, which is the best tidings that I can receive: for what do I live for, but to be useful to souls in my generation? I desire to know no other business than to please and honour my God, and serve my generation in that short allowance of time that I have here, before I go hence, and shall be seen no more. Shall I commend to you the Lesson that I am about to learn? But why should I doubt of your acceptance, who have so readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced me in all our converses?</p>
               <p>The Lesson is, <hi>To be entirely devoted unto the Lord, that I may be able to say after the Apostle, To me to live is Christ.</hi> I would not be serving God only for a day in the week, or an hour or two in the day; but every day, and all the day. I am ambitious to come up towards that of our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>To do always those things that please God.</hi> I plainly see, that self-seeking is self-undoing; and that then we do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our selves best, when we please God most. I find, that when I have done all, if God be not pleased, I have done nothing; and if I can but approve my self to God, my work is done: I reckon I do not live that time I do not live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p>I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ain to cut off so many hours from my days, and so many years from my life (so short as it is) as I have lived unto my self. I find no enemy so dangerous as my self, and O that others might take warning by my hurt! O that I had lived wholly unto God! then had every day and every
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44944:71"/>
hour that I have spent, been found upon my account at that great day of our appearing before God: then I had been rich indeed, in treasure laid up there, whither I am apace removing; then I had been every day and hour adding to the heap, and encreasing the reward which God of his meer grace hath promised, even to the meanest work that is done to him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24. I verily perceive I am an external loser by acting no more as for God; for what is done to my self, is lost; but what is done for God, is done for ever, and shall receive an everlasting reward. Verily, if there be another world to come, and an eternal state after this short life, it is our only wisdom to be removing, and, as it were, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting and transporting what we can, from hence, into that Countrey to which we are shortly to be removed, that what we are now doing, we may be reaping the fruit of for ever more. The world think themselves wise; but I will pawn my soul upon it, that this is the true wisdom.</p>
               <p>Well, let us be wholly swallowed up in the concerns of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and know no other interest but Jesus Christs. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, I have already attained; but this is that my heart is set to learn, That in all that I do, whether sacred or civil actions, still I may be doing but one work, and driving on one design, <hi>That God may be pleased by me, and he glorified in me;</hi> that not onely my Praying, Preaching, Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be found upon my account; but even my eating, drinking, sleeping, visits, discourses, because they are all done as unto God. Too often do I take a wrong aim, and miss my mark; but I will tell you what be the rules I set my self, and do strictly impose upon my self from day to day: <hi>Never to lie down, but in the Name of God;</hi> not barely for natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment, but that a wearied servant of Christ may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited and fitted to serve him better the next day. <hi>Never to rise up but with this r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>y for Eternity. Never to enter upon my calling, but first thinking, I will do these things as unto God,</hi> because he requireth these things at my hands in the place and station he hath put me into. <hi>Never to sit down to the Table, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, I will not eat meerly to please my appetite, but to strengthen my self for my Masters work. Never to make a visit,

but upon some holy design, resolving to leave something of God where I go; and in every company to leave some good savour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</hi> This is that which I have been for some time a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and am pressing hard after; and if I strive not to walk by these Rules, let this Paper be a witness against me.</p>
               <p>I am not now in my former publick capacity, such things being required of me to say and subscribe, as I could by no means yield to, without open lying and dissembling with God and Men: yet, that I am unuseful, I cannot say; but rather think, that possibly I may be of more use than heretofore. I thank the Lord, I have not known what it is to want a ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue to speak, but in my sickness; nor a people to hear; but so, as that we both, follow the things that make for peace.</p>
               <p>I perceive you are otherwise perswaded in some things, than I am: but however, I trust we meet in our end. Since you are in, may it be your whole study to gain souls, and to build them up in holiness, which is with too many the least of their cares. One duty (miserably neglected) I shall be bold to commend to you from my own experience, and that is, the visiting your whole Flock from house to house, and enquiring into their spiritual estates particularly, and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plainly and truly with them about their conversion to God: to the usefulness of this great work, I can set my <hi>Probatum est.</hi>

               <p>I Owe you a Letter, and more than a Letter, for your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular respects to me, your brotherly sympathy, your multiplied and earnest prayers, your tenderness of my health, your welcome Jewel in M. <hi>Ruths</hi> Letters, from which I trust my soul and others may reap no small benefit. Much more do I owe you for your common respects to the people of my desires; and not only to them, but to the whole Church of God; and in all whose concernments, I see, you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Your indefatigable labours with us, we do with all thankfulness accept, as the undoubted evidence of your great love: For all which may he requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e you, who will shortly say, <hi>Inasmuch as thou didst it unto the least of these my Brethren, thou didst it unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was but a little after my release from my own confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I heard of yours; and now write to you, as one that hath taken a higher degree than ever, and more truly honourable, being commenced Prisoner of Christ. I was once affected with the Picture of a devout man, to whom a voice came down from Heaven, saying, <hi>Quid vis fieri pro te,</hi> To which he answered, <hi>Nihil domine nisi pati ac contemni pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e.</hi> Undoubtedly, Sir, it is our real glory to be throughout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Jesus Christ, not onely in his sanctity, but in his sufferings. <hi>Paul</hi> counted all things but dung for this, that he might win Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and know the fellowship of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and be made conformable to his death. I doubt not but your consolations in Christ do much more then super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound in all your tribulations for him: Yet let me add this one Cordial, That now you have a whole shoal of Promises come in to you, which you had not before; I mean, all the Promises to suffering Saints, in which they have not so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, but only a remoter right, unless in a suffering state:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44944:72"/>
And doubtless he hath gotten well, that hath gotten such a number of exceeding great and precious Promises. If the men of the world do so rejoyce when such or such an Estate is fallen to them? should not you much more, that have such a Treasure of Promises fallen to you?</p>
               <p>I can tell you little good of my self; but this I can tell you, That the Primises of God were never so sweet in this world to me, as in and since my imprisoned state. Oh the bottomless riches of the Covenant of Grace! It shames me that I have let such a Treasure lie by so long, and have made so little use of it. Never did my soul know the Heaven of a Believers life, till I learnt to live a life of praise; and by more frequent consideration to set home the unspeakable riches of the Divine Promises, to which, I trust, through grace I am made an heir. I verily perceive, that all our work were done at once, if we could but prevail with our selves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to live like Believers; to tell all the world by our selves and others to live like Believers; to tell all the world by our course and carriage, that there is such pleasantness in Christs wars, such beauty in holiness, such reward to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as we profess to believe. May ours and our peoples conversations but preach this aloud to the world, that there is a reality in what God hath promised; that Heaven is worth the venturing for; that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us!</p>
               <p>Verily, Sir, it is but a very little while that Prisons shall hold us, or that we shall dwell in dirty flesh. <hi>Porphyry</hi> tells us of <hi>Photinus,</hi> that he was ashamed to see himself in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; to see a Divine and immortal soul in a Prison of flesh, (for so they held the body to be;) but the worst shackles are those of sin. Well, they must shortly off all together; our Lord doth not long intend us for this lower Region: Surely he is gone to prepare a place for us: Doubtless it is <unclear>so</unclear>; yea, and he will come again, and receive us to himself, that where he is, we may be also. And what have we to do, but to believe, and wait, and love, and long, and look out for his coming, in which is all our hope? 'Twill be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us to be preferred then. We know before hand who shall then be uppermost. Our Lord hath shewed us

               </p>
               <p>If that miserable wretch leapt chearfully off the Ladder, saying, <hi>I shall be a Queen in Hell:</hi> With that joy should we do and suffer for God, who have his Truth in pawn, that we shall be Crown'd in Heaven?

Why should it not be thus? <hi>I</hi> am sure God and heaven do as well deserve to be thought on, and talked of by us, as fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Every thing is so to a beginner. Besides, is not ours a Religion of self denial? Further, if we do but force our selves a while to holy Thoughts, and Heavenly Discourse, it will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>row habitual to us, and then it will be most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, familiar, and Heavenly sweet. Oh what gainers will you be, if you do but learn this Lesson?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:44944:73"/>Verily, 'tis the shame of Religion, that Christians are <unclear>so</unclear> unlike themselves, unless upon their knees. Sirs, our lives and language should tell the world what we are, and whether we are going. Christians, let little things content you in the world, but aspire after great things in the grace of God. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny real Christians do little think what high frames of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they might grow up to, even in this life, with pains and diligence. Sirs, be you men of great designs: think it not enough if you have wherewith to bear your charges to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but aspire with an holy ambition to be great in the Court of Heaven, favourites of the most High, of tall growth, great experience, singular communion, that you may burn and shine in your place, and convince the world; that you may savour of Heaven where ever you come, and that there may be an even-spun thred of Holiness running through your whole course. 'Tis the disgrace of Profession, that there is so little difference to be seen in the ordinary conversation of Believers from other men: It is not a shame, that when we are in company with others, this should be all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is to be seen, only that we will not curse and swear, as do the worst of men? Christians, if you will honour the Gospel, bring forth your Religion out of your Closets (the world can't see what you do there) into your Shops, Trades, Visits, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and exemplifie the rules of Religion in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of all your Relations, and in your ordinary converse. Let there be no place or company that you come into, in which you do not drop something of God: this will be the glory of Religion, and we shall never convince the world till we come to this. May you come my Brethren, out of your Prisons with your faces shining, having your minds seasoned, and your tongues tipt with holiness: may your mouths be as a Well of Life, from whence may flow the holy Streams of edifying discourse: may you ever remember, as you are sitting in your houses, going by the way, lying down, rising up, what the Lord doth then require of you, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To improve their present retirements from the World, for the setling of their spiritual Estates.</hi> 'Tis a common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint amongst Christians, that they want assurance. Oh, if any of you that wanted assurance when you came to Prison, may carry that blessing our, what hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>y gainers would you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44944:74"/>
be! Now you are called more than ever to self-searching. Now bring your Graces to the Touchstone. Be much in self observation. See what your hearts do with most love and delight, go out unto: what are your greatest hopes, and your chief designs. See whether God's Intrest be uppermost in you: prove this, and prove all. Rest not in probable hopes. Think not that is enough that you can say, you hope 'tis well. God looks for extraordinary dispensation. Be rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less till you can say, that you know 'tis well? that you know you are passed from death to life.</p>
               <p>Think not that this is a priviledge that onely a few may expect. Observe but these three things:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>To acquaint your selves throughly with the condition of Life, and take heed of laying the marks of Salvation either too high or too low.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>To be much in observing the frame, and bent, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your own hearts.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>To universally conscientious, and to be constant in even and close walkings,</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
and then I doubt not but you will grow up speedily to a settled assurance, nad know and feel that peace of God that passeth all understanding: and this will be somewhat worth your carrying out of Prison.</p>
               <p>But I return to your self. But what shall I say? I have more need to receive from you, than ability to give; only I will tell you my wishes for you: I wish that your body may prosper, as your soul also prospereth. I wish, that you may see the travel of your Soul; that you may find your people thriving under your hands iu all manner of holy conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and godliness, that whosoever converses with them, may see and hear by them, <hi>that God is in them of a Truth.</hi> I wish your enlargement from your bonds, and your enlargement in them: that your Prison may be but the Lanthorn through which your Graces, Experiences, Communion, and Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artainments, may shine most brightly to all beholders. I wish your Prison may be a Paradice of Peace, and a <hi>Patmos</hi> of Divine discoveries. <hi>Lord Jesus set to thy</hi> Amen. <hi>I</hi> am, Sir,</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THis Letter cometh to you, like the men of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> crying to you, <hi>Come and help us.</hi> O how insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent do we find our selves for the praises of God! what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have we to call upon our selves, and to call upon all our Friends! and yet we foresee that all will be too little a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at last, and to slender a return to the most High God, God, who hath made us such wonders of Mercy, and such signal instances of his Divine Power and rich Grace. You are not ignorant of our Estate, how the Sentence of death had passed upon us; how our flesh and our hearts failed, and friends an Physicians gave up their hopes: but God, that raised the Dead, was pleased to make us the Monuments of his wondrous mercy. O that the same God would make us the special instruments of his praise and glory. Of a Truth Sir, we perceive our hearts are too little, our Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues are too short, our expressions are too low, either to conceive or utter what we owe to the great God. O help! help! bless the Lord, O our souls: bless the Lord, O our friends: O that all that have wrestled with God for us, might joyn hand in hand to make some suitable returns to the God of our lives, and may bring in every one his Sacrifice, and all contribute to make one common stock of Praises, that many thanksgivings may abound to God on our behalfs. O what hath Prayer done for us! while we live we must honour Prayer, and admire the power of Prayer, we owe our limbs and our lives to prayer. O that a goodly crop of praise may grow up unto God as a return for his Mercies: that the seed of prayers, and showers of tears, may procure sheaves of joy, and songs of deliverance.</p>
               <p>But O what shall we render? wherewithall shall we come before the Lord, or bow our selves to the most high God?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44944:75"/>
O where shall we find a fitting sacrifice? Verily we will give our selves and our all to him. But alas, what are we, and what is this little that we call <hi>our All?</hi> Therefore have we found in our hearts to write to you and others, that we might excite you to the Divine praises with us. And O that the Lord might be loved the better, and glorified the more for our sakes: Will you tell us wherein we may shew our love to him? wherein we may best please and serve him? O that you would! herein assuredly you would most highly gratifie us. O that we might do some singular thing for God; for certainly they aré not common things that he hath done for us. We pray you call upon those that fear the Lord, to help us in celebrating his loving kindness. O how it pleaseth our very hearts to think that God should be loved and honoured the better for us: that we may be instruments, if it be but for the blowing up of one flash, nay, the kindling of one spark of Divine love in the heart of his Children towards him! Sir, you cannot pleasure us in any thing so much as in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s, to love and admire God, and spread his praise more and more; that what is wanting through our weakness, may be made up in your abundance. But we have need to crave your pardon for our length; but the love of Christ constraineth us, and we hope you will pass by an error of love.</p>
               <p>While we have been devising what to do for our God, we thought we could no way better him, than by providing such as you are to set up his great Name with us. We love and honour you, not only as you are a Member, but a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ Jesus our Lord, and therefore deserve to be doubly dear unto us: And because we could think of no more pleasing a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving, we have stirred up our selves and friends with us, to send to you a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, this poor token of love, which though but small, yet we trust will be a sweet savour unto God, and will be accepted with you, being our two Mites cast into God's Treasury. But look not upon your self as obliged to us hereby: but put it upon the account of Christ, to whose precious Name we dedicate, and from whom (although he be so much already before hand with us, yet) we expect a <unclear>recompence</unclear> at the Resurrection of the Just.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:44944:75"/>And being further desirous to promote the work of God in our low and slender capacities, we have been bold to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke your self, with other our Fathers and Brethren in the Ministry, to set about that necessary and much neglected work of Catechising; not a little pleasing our selves in the sweet hope, that by your means we may be instrumental to spread the sweet savour of the knowledge of our God, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place: and being well perswaded of your readiness to forward so blessed a work, we have stirred up our selves and our friends to expend a considerable sum of money to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Ministers with Catechisms, a hundred whereof we have sent unto you, beseeching you to use your best prudence and utmost diligence for the spreading of them, and for others improvement by them, that our labour and charge in so good a work, prove not at last of no effect.</p>
               <p>Sir, we shall humbly propose unto you, but not impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. But let us be bold with you in Christ, to lay our requests before you as touching this concernment, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed what judicious friends and brethren have thought fit to propound.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That that people be publikely and privately instructed about the high necessity and great usefulness of this duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Catechisms be freely given to all that will promise to use them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That you would be pleased to acquaint your self with all the Schools that are within your Verge; and that you would do your utmost to engage the Teachers thereof to teach their Scholars this Catechism; and that you would furnish all their Scholars that are capable and willing to learn.</p>

               <p n="5">5. That you will appoint set-times wherein to take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the proficiency of all such as have promised to learn; and that, if it may be, they may be engaged to learn weekly a proportion, according to their Capacities.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That you would favour us so far, as to let us know as speedily as you may, of the receit of these lines; and, if we may presume so far upon you, we pray you to indulge us some

assurance under your hand, that you will to your power promote this happy design, and that by our <hi>Lady-day</hi> next you will acquaint Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> what progress is made.</p>
               <p>Sir, our souls will even travel in Birth for the success of this undertaking; and therefore we request you for the love of God, and by the respect which we are perswaded you bare to us, that you will labour to comfort and encourage us in our endeavours for God, which you can no way in the World do so well, as by letting us see, that there is some blessed fruit of our cost and pains; and that we have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain. If there be any of these Catechisms remaining in your hands that you cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of by our <hi>Lady-day,</hi> be pleased to send them to Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> or to Mr. <hi>Rositer</hi> in <hi>Taunton.</hi> If you should need any more, give us speedy notice, and you shall not fail to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with what number you desire.</p>
               <p>Thus upon the bended knees of our thankful souls, we commend our poor sacrifices, together with your self, to the eternal God, and remain,</p>
