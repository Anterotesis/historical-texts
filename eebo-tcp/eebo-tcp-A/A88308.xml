            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You are pleaſed to intimate: I muſt humbly
begg Your Excuſe, that I am not able to ſatisfie
Your Commands in that particular. Indeed Our
Force is very ſmall, and Our Enemie very great;
and I ſhall be unwilling to ſet any thing on foot,
that may breed Jealouſie amongſt Us; And finding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115132:4"/>
many Officers decline the Signing all Papers of that
Nature, and rather propenſe to declare their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
to the Parliaments Authority, and their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
adherence thereunto, I have thought it My
Duty to ſuſpend the Execution of Your Deſires,
leaſt it may make a breach of Affections amongſt
Us. And I further humbly offer to Your thoughts,
That the Petition having been already Preſented,
and in Part Anſwered by the Parliament, Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
therein cannot be any ways advantageous.
I ſhall not interpoſe Mine own Judgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, but do earneſtly deſire that Matters of ſuch
great waight may not be impoſed upon us, who are
not preſent at the Debates, nor Privie to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils

and led to ſuch Actions. I ſhall not further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
You, but only Repreſent to Your thoughts the
great neceſſity We have to labour for Unity, in this
day of Our fears. I ſhall not need to tell You, That
miſ-underſtandings between the Parliament and
Army are the great hopes of Our Adverſaries, and
there is no other way to gratifie their deſigns. I
bleſs the Lord for thoſe evidences that I ſee, of a
Peaceable Spirit, in Your Addreſs. I do, and I
ſhall always endeavour, and pray, That God
would not break the ſtaff of Our Beauty, or ſtaff of
Bands, That he would make all good men (though
of different Judgements) one in his Hand, that
We may arrive at that bleſſed Settlement, for which
We have expended ſo much blood and Treaſure:
