         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe reaſons are many which induce me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to direct theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers firſt to you, and to tell the world how much I honour you: firſt my perſonal ancient obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to you: ſecondly, Principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, your approved wiſdom and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and taking part with the waies of Charity and Peace, in your most publick capacity in theſe try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times: thirdly, your Relation to the Noble Author on whoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting I here Animadvert; which as it is your honour to be the Brother

of ſo learned and ingenious a Lord, and the Brother of ſo excellently ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as well as learned and ingenious a perſon, as Mr. <hi>George Herbert,</hi> Orator to the Univerſity of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and a faithful Paſtor in the Engliſh Church; ſo it obligeth me the more to give you an account of this Animadverſion. It is long ſince I ſought after the Book, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the Title and the honour of the Authors name, and received it from you as your gift. The premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Letter from an unknown perſon of the ſame name, occaſioned me to review it: The ſad caſe of many of my acquaintance, and the increaſe of Infidelity of late, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong debauched ſenſual Gallants, and the danger of <hi>England</hi> hereby, and the Temptations against which the best of Chriſtians have need of help, were the Reaſons of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, it being my <hi>Calling</hi> to propagate and vindicate the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

Faith: I am ſo far from wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt his whole Book, that I take moſt of his Rules and Notions <hi>de Veritate,</hi> to be of ſingular uſe. And had ſo great a wit had but the <hi>Internal Conditions</hi> due to ſuch an <hi>Intellectual</hi> apprehenſion, as his and your holy and excellent Brother had; no doubt but our ſupernatural Revelations and Verities, would have appeared evident to him, and poſſeſt his ſoul with ſo ſweet a guſt, and fervent aſcendent holy <hi>LOVE,</hi> as breatheth in Mr. <hi>G. Herbert's</hi> Poems, and as would have made them as clear to him in their kind, as ſome of his <hi>Notitiae Communes.</hi> The truth is, as he was too <hi>low to us,</hi> who number not our Divine <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> with the <hi>Vereſimilia,</hi> but with the <hi>Certain Verities;</hi> ſo he was too <hi>high</hi> for the <hi>Atheiſtical Senſualiſts</hi> of this age: And I would they would learn of him, that the <hi>Being and Perfections of God,
<pb facs="tcp:97215:4"/>
the duty of worſhipping him, and of holy Conformity and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, and particularly all the ten Commandments, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of true Repentance, and the Rewards and Puniſhments of the Life to Come, with the Souls Immortality,</hi> are all <hi>Notitiae Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes</hi> and ſuch <hi>Natural Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> as that the denyal of them doth unman them.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Was right glad, when I firſt heard that you had written, and put to Print, a Book of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Chriſtian Religion; and I did immediately buy the Book, hoping that in the Reading and Peruſing of it, I might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſatisfaction as to any doubt or ſcruple, and an anſwer ſatisfactory to all Objections, that in Reaſon may be raiſed againſt the Grounds of the ſaid Chriſtian Religion; becauſe I did think you to be as able to ſay and write as much as any man in that thing, having as I thought ſtudied it as much as any that I had heard of; but in the reading and peruſing it, I contrary to my expectation found it to be ſhort of giving me ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>For the greateſt occaſion of any doubt or ſcruple in any thing tending or relating to the Chriſtian Religion that I at any time had or have, were from that variouſneſs and contrariety,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97215:5"/>
if not contradictions, which are, or at leaſt ſeem to be, in the writings of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts and other Books received for Scripture.</p>
               <p>But you in anſwer to that Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>page</hi> 412. ſay, Nothing but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance maketh men think ſo; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand once the true meaning, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for the errors of Printers, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, and Tranſlators; and there will no ſuch thing be found.</p>
               <p>But you neither tell me which are thoſe errors, nor yet how I may know them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore I humbly pray you (in writing) to tell me, whether that which is written in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, <hi>verſe</hi> 8, 9. where <hi>Matthew</hi> writes, that <hi>Joram</hi> begat <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zias</hi> and <hi>Ozias</hi> begat <hi>Joatham,</hi> be any error of the Tranſcribers, Tranſlators or Printers, or the contrary to it, which is written in the ſecond book of the Kings, and in the books of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles; if not, how may they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, for in thoſe books it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that <hi>Joram</hi> was Father to <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and <hi>Ahaziah</hi> was Father to <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and <hi>Joaſh</hi> was Father to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97215:5"/>
was Father to <hi>Azariah,</hi> and <hi>A zariah</hi> was Father to <hi>Joatham;</hi> by the account of which Books, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred Years between the death of <hi>Joram</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> and <hi>Joatham,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And Secondly, Whether that which is written by <hi>Luke</hi> in his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Chapter 24. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. 22, 23. where <hi>Luke</hi> writes, that <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> and other Women, told the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that they had ſeen a Viſion of Angels, which ſaid, that Jeſus was riſen from the dead, and was alive; whether this be any error of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, Tranſlators and Printers, or any of them; or the Contrary which is written by St. <hi>John</hi> in his Goſpel, for he writes Chap. 20. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. That <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> told two of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſaid to them, They (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe meaning the Adverſaries) have taken away the Lord out of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and we know not where they have laid him.</p>
               <p>If not how may I underſtand them to be both true Teſtimonies or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, for it ſeemeth by <hi>Luke, ver.</hi> 11, 12. and 23, 24. of his 24. Chapter,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97215:6"/>
that <hi>Mary</hi> and the other Women had told thoſe things of their ſeeing the Angels, which ſaid that Jeſus was riſen and alive, before that <hi>Peter</hi> ran or went to the Sepulcher.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And Thirdly, Whether that which is written by <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the <hi>28th.</hi> Chapter of his Goſpel, that the Angel ſaid to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and the other <hi>Mary,</hi> fear not ye, for I know that ye ſeek Jeſus which was Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he is not here, for he is riſen, as he ſaid, Come ſee the place where the Lord lay, and go quickly and tell his Diſciples that he is riſen from the dead, and behold he goeth before you into <hi>Galilee,</hi> there ſhall you ſee him, ſo I have told you,</p>
               <p>And they departed quickly from the Sepulcher with fear and great joy, and did run to bring his Diſciples word, and as they went to tell his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, behold Jeſus met them, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>v.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether I ſay was this which is written in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, that I have here Tranſcribed, ſaid to the Women, and that the Women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Sepulcher to tell the

               <p>Sir, I ſhall trouble you with no more but theſe few places which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in three Queſtions or Particulars, although there are ſeveral other Texts, that I do not underſtand how they may be reconciled, but if you ſhall by ſtrength of Argument Grounded upon ſound Reaſon, make appear that it was nothing but Ignorance hath made me to think that thoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies agree not, but are contrary one to the other; and that they may be ſo underſtood as that no ſuch thing will appear in them, then I ſhall be ready and will with you conclude and ſay ſo too, and for the future ſuppoſe that other places of thoſe books which are received for Scripture, as ſeem to be contrary to one another, may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97215:7"/>
Reconciled, though I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how;</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, if you do not endeavour by ſuch ſound and plain Arguments to make it appear that theſe Texts here Tranſcribed by me, may be underſtood ſo as that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is in them.</p>
               <p>I muſt think that it was nothing but Ignorance that made you ſay that which you have ſaid, in anſwer to that and ſome other objections,</p>

               <p>If you judge I have erred from the truth, I hope you will endeavour to to convert me from the error of my way, if any ſuch be; which if you ſhall do, no doubt but it will be a good work, ſee <hi>James</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>TWo ſorts of perſons uſe to trouble me and others, with their Objections againſt the Chriſtian Religion. Firſt, Some <hi>Papists,</hi> who profeſs to believe it, but in <hi>deſigne</hi> do act the part of Infidels, that they may looſe men from all <hi>Religion,</hi> in hope to bring them over to <hi>theirs,</hi> when they have taken them off all other. For he that can make another man believe that he was hitherto totally miſled is likeſt to become the Maſter of his Faith: For men are apt to think that none can ſo eaſily and certainly ſhew them the truth, as he that hath ſhewed them <hi>their error.</hi> And when men once think that according to the Grounds of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> they can have no <hi>certainty of Faith,</hi> they will the eaſilier be brought to the way of thoſe men, who promiſe them that certainty which they make them believe that others want.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97215:8"/>
Secondly, The other ſort are <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dels,</hi> who of late are grown numerous and audacious, and look ſo big and ſpeak ſo lowd, as to acquaint us that it is not they that are ſilenced (in their ſpeaking place) nor driven five miles from every City and Corporation.</p>
               <p>Which ſort you are of, I know not: I read your <hi>name,</hi> and that you are a <hi>Sojourner;</hi> but finding that you write not as a <hi>tender Doubter,</hi> who deſireth to be <hi>concealed,</hi> but as a <hi>Confident gain-ſayer</hi> of the Chriſtian Verity, and not knowing how ſafely to ſend a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the place where you ſay you ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ, I have thought that it will be moſt pleaſing to you to come to you by the ſame way, as the book did which you except againſt (which was written upon the provocation of a paper Scattered among the Schollars of <hi>Oxford,</hi> when the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath and Act were made in the time of the great Plague, as by one that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied in the Grounds of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but I ſtrongly ſuſpected was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a Papiſt, it was made ſo ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their deſigns.)</p>
               <p>In two things you have not dealt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97215:9"/>
righteouſly and ingeniouſly with me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that you have not <hi>anſwered</hi> the <hi>Grounded Proofs</hi> of the Chriſtian Verity which I have laid down, but nibble at the Anſwer to ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is not the way of a Lover of the truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that you take no notice of, or make no anſwer to, the <hi>ſecond part</hi> of my anſwer to that <hi>ſame objection,</hi> about ſuppoſed Contradictions in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; where I ſhewed you at large, that if that which you object were granted, it would not overthrow the certainty of the Chriſtian Faith. Both thoſe ſhould have been done by an impartial man.</p>
               <p>The method which the nature of the Cauſe requireth me now to uſe, in my anſwer to you, ſhall be in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting theſe following Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Prop. 1. <hi>That if it could not by us be proved that every word of the Scripture is true, nor the pen men infallible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectible in every particle, yet might we have a certainty of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That yet all that is in the</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97215:9"/>
                  <hi>Scriptures as the word of God is certainly true; and no error or contradiction can be proved in it, but what is in ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies by the fault of Printers, Tranſcribers or Tranſlators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 3. <hi>That he that first proveth the Truth of the Chriſtian Faith by ſolid evidence, may and ought to be certain of that truth, though he be not able to ſolve all ſoeming contradictions in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or anſwer all objections which occurre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 4. <hi>The true method of one that would arrive at certainty, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf and others, is to lay firſt the fundamental proofs, and examine them till he is thereby confirmed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to try the by-objections as he is able; And not to begin firſt at the anſwering of ſuch by-objected difficulties, and judging of all the cauſe thereby.</hi> Of theſe I ſhall now ſpeak in order.</p>
               <p>And whereas you beſpeak <hi>Plaineſs</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> in the Anſwer, I ſhall grant you the <hi>firſt</hi> as far as in ſuch haſt and brevity I am able; And the <hi>ſecond</hi> as far as the nature of the cauſe will bear. But if you account all Chriſtians <hi>deceived fools,</hi> you muſt not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97215:10"/>
expect to be called <hi>wiſe,</hi> nor that I ſhould <hi>flatter</hi> you, and tell you that <hi>Apoſtaſie is a ſtate of ſafety;</hi> For I that believe <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. and 10. muſt think that this were not <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> but <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and worſe than to kill you for fear of diſpleaſing you.</p>
               <p>Prop. 1. <hi>If it could not by us be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that every word of the Scriptures is true, nor the Pen men infallible or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible in every particle, yet might we have a certainty of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon is, Becauſe every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> in the Scripture, is not an <hi>eſſential part</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> (no nor any <hi>Integral</hi> part, if you take the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> ſtrictly, for the Doctrine of neceſſary <hi>Belief, Deſire</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:)</hi> And that part which is indeed the <hi>eſsence</hi> (yea or <hi>Integrity)</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, may be certainly proved and believed, without our being able to prove the certainty or truth of all the reſt which is in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The Holy Scriptures contain <hi>all our Religion,</hi> and <hi>ſomewhat more;</hi> that is, the <hi>Accidents and appurtenances of it.</hi> As the <hi>body</hi> of a man, beſides the <hi>parts</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97215:10"/>
                  <hi>Eſſential and Integral</hi> hath its <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;</hi> ſuch as are the <hi>Hair</hi> and the <hi>Colour</hi> (and ſome <hi>Humours)</hi> which are for <hi>Beauty</hi> and other uſes, though not <hi>Parts.</hi> So far are the Papiſts from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the right, who think that the Chriſtian Religion is not <hi>all</hi> (but <hi>part)</hi> contained in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that there is <hi>more than all</hi> that is <hi>neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> even the <hi>appurtenances</hi> which have an aptitude to the <hi>adorning</hi> and <hi>promoting</hi> of the reſt.</p>
               <p>To know who was the Father of every perſon mentioned in the Bibles <hi>Genealogies,</hi> to know what age each perſon was of whoſe age is there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; to know the <hi>name</hi> of every <hi>perſon,</hi> and every <hi>Town;</hi> to know how <hi>far</hi> each City was from another whoſe diſtances are there expreſſed; with a multitude of ſuch like <hi>Hiſtorical, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogical, Chronological, Topographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Phyſical,</hi> incidental paſſages, is but an <hi>appurtenance,</hi> and not ſtrictly a <hi>part (Eſſential or Integral)</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, of Holineſs or Religion.</p>
               <p>Yet remember that we maintain as certain, that they are all Lyars who accuſe God of Lying; And that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97215:11"/>
ſome ignorantly talk to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>God cannot lie.</hi> See the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Ameſius</hi> his Diſputation, of this Queſtion, <hi>An falſum ſubeſſe poteſt fidei divinae,</hi> after his <hi>Medulla Theologiae</hi> (which book with his Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and <hi>Alſtedius</hi> his <hi>Encyclopaediae,</hi> may (after the Scriptures and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance) make a good Divine, and be a better Library than the Fathers of the fourth <hi>Council. Carth.</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.) He that thinketh God can lie, deſtroyeth the <hi>Objectum For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male fidei divinae,</hi> and therefore can have no Faith. If God could <hi>lie in one thing,</hi> we ſhould <hi>never</hi> be ſure that he revealeth the truth, unleſs by <hi>ſenſe</hi> it ſelf and <hi>after-experience.</hi> All Faith goeth upon ſuch a Syllogiſm as this <hi>[Whatſoever God ſaith is true: But this God ſaith, Ergo, it is true]</hi> So that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth every word in the Scripture to <hi>be Gods word,</hi> muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it all to be <hi>true,</hi> or he can believe none of it at all.</p>
               <p>But yet it is poſſible for a man to believe one part of the Bible to be Gods Word, and not another part; which needeth no proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97215:11"/>
Becauſe that many of the ancient Churches for a certain time, doubted of, yea, received not the Epiſtle of <hi>James, Peter 2d.</hi> the <hi>Heb. Apocal.</hi> &amp;c. and yet were truly of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We deny not but that there are many falſe and wicked ſayings <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically</hi> recited in the Scripture (as the ſaying of <hi>Cain, Pharaoh, Gehezi,</hi> the falſe Prophets, the Devil (of <hi>Job,</hi> to Chriſt, &amp;c.) but the Scripture is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs true: For it is true that all theſe untruths were ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Diſciples of Chriſt were not <hi>abſolutely and in all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> as all Chriſtians do Confeſs. They were not as perfect in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as now they are in Heaven. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Barnab as</hi> was miſtaken about the fitneſs of <hi>Mark</hi> to go with them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There was a <hi>greater aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of the Spirit promiſed them when <hi>two or three of them were aſſembled in Christs name,</hi> than when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſingly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. But there can be nothing above <hi>perfect infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97215:12"/>
Fourthly, We confeſs that Chriſts Diſciples were not <hi>indefectible</hi> or <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</hi> As their <hi>understandings,</hi> ſo their <hi>wills and lives,</hi> had ſtill ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. <hi>Marke, Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did not all perfectly do their duties, in the caſe they differed about. <hi>Peter</hi> did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in avoiding the Gentile Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when <hi>Paul</hi> blamed him openly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. And <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others did not do well in being drawn away to the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>lation. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Timothy, I have no man like minded</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd of others, <hi>They all ſeek their own,</hi> He took not <hi>all Chriſtians that had the Spirit</hi> to be perfect: If any man had not the Spirit of Chriſt, he was none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. And the very wrangling de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>ng <hi>Galathians,</hi> had <hi>received the ſpirit, Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. And ſo had the wrangling <hi>Corinthians Chriſt in them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 8. 5.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, We confeſs that he who is <hi>either infallible</hi> or <hi>defectible</hi> (lyable to <hi>error or ſia)</hi> is of <hi>himſelf</hi> capable of being <hi>deceived</hi> and of <hi>deceiving</hi> others. If he were <hi>Infallible</hi> in reſpect of the Knowledg of all the Truth, yet while he <hi>can ſin</hi> (of himſelf conſidered) he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97215:12"/>
can be heedleſs, careleſs, raſh, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and for by reſpects ſpeak too little or too much. It is the Devils laſt method, to <hi>undo</hi> by <hi>overdoing,</hi> and ſo to deſtroy the authority of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles by over magnifying them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will not uſe his methods, nor deny any of this.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Moreover, we confeſs that it is poſſible for a good Chriſtian to doubt whether thoſe that were but Evangeliſts (as <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke)</hi> had the ſame promiſe of the Spirits infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſiſtance with the Apoſtles; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we find not that promiſe ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any where made to them. And thereupon he may poſſibly think that ſome errors may conſiſt with their meaſure of the Spirit, as it did with many Chriſtians who had the ſame Spirit.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, And we do not believe that the extraordinary operations of the Spirit were alwaies equally in the Apoſtles themſelves; we ſuppoſe the Prophets could not alwaies Propheſie, nor thoſe that ſpake with tongues, uſe that gift at their own pleaſure, nor yet thoſe that did miracles, healed the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97215:13"/>
ſick, or raiſed the dead: But that the Spirit wrought, as in various ſorts and meaſures in ſeveral perſons, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.) ſo alſo at various times, and in various meaſures in the ſame perſon. Whereupon it is poſſible for a good Chriſtian to doubt, whether every word in Scripture was written then, when the writer had the gift of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility and indefectibility.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, And we do confeſs our ſelves, that the Apoſtles had not the infallible Spirit given them for <hi>every uſe</hi> or <hi>thing</hi> that they had to do; but for <hi>thoſe matters</hi> about which they had <hi>ſpecial need of it</hi> and <hi>uſe for it,</hi> to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill their office. The Spirit <hi>was</hi> not ſo neceſſary for them to diſcern thoſe things by, which the <hi>common ſenſe and underſtanding of a man,</hi> was ſufficient to diſcern. They could taſt ſweet from bitter, feel heat from cold, diſcern light from darkneſs, without an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible extraordinary</hi> Spirit. And ſo being <hi>eye and ear witneſſes,</hi> of what Chriſt did and ſaid, of his words, his miracles, his reſurrection, his aſcenſion, they might infallibly know them by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means. And ſo a good Chriſtian
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97215:13"/>
may doubt whether they had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit infallibly, to tranſcribe and cite every paſſage in the old Teſtament, viſible to all, or to relate the things which they ſaw done with their eyes; or to report the hiſtory of ſeveral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were then done: (as what was the place and power of <hi>Herod, Archelaus, Pilate, Falix, Feſtut, &amp;c.)</hi> and ſuch other parts of common Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, And we all confeſs that the <hi>words</hi> are but as the <hi>Body</hi> of the Scripture and the <hi>ſenſe</hi> as the <hi>Soul:</hi> And that the <hi>words</hi> are for the <hi>ſenſe.</hi> And there is more of the <hi>Spirits</hi> aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture than in the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>body:</hi> And that there is in the <hi>phraſe</hi> and <hi>method</hi> ſomewhat of (blameleſs) humane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection: And that as <hi>David</hi> was not ſtronger then <hi>Goliah,</hi> nor his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons more excellent in themſelves, but God would overcome ſtrength by the means of the more weak; ſo an <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> may be more accurate in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and a <hi>Demoſthenes, Varro</hi> or <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cro</hi> in words and phraſe than an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; And they may be left to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97215:14"/>
of their ſeveral gifts (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified by nature or education) in their ſtile. And God may hide that from the wiſe and prudent which he revealeth to babes; And by the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of Preaching may ſave belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and confound the wiſdom of the world, and by things that are not, bring to nought things that are, that no fleſh may glory in his ſight. Nor do we ſay that no man may ſeek or attain more Logick, Philoſophy or Grammar than he findeth in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, As Proteſtants receive not ſo many Books as Canonical as the Papiſts do, ſo ſome Proteſtants have not received ſo many as the reſt: And ſo many poſſibly erre in thinking that ſome part of the Scripture is not the word of God, and conſequently may think it of more uncertain credit.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, Some have thought that <hi>Matthew</hi> being at firſt written in Hebrew or Syriack, and after tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Greek, that the Tranſlator being unknown, the credit of the Tranſlation muſt be the leſs certain, becauſe they know not whether the tranſlator was one that had a promiſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97215:14"/>
of Infallibility, though doubtleſs they erre who ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Some think, that as certainly there are a great number of various Readings, which all prove that ſome of the Copies erre, ſo it is uncertain to us, whether <hi>all thoſe</hi> which we have, may not in ſome <hi>words</hi> or <hi>particles</hi> differ from others which we have not, and from the autographs; ſeeing each ſcribe had not a promiſe of Infallibility.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, If ſome particular Books of Scripture were not extant, or never known to ſome men, yet the reſt may teach thoſe ſame men, all the Chriſtian Religion, to their Salvation. Therefore if they may be Chriſtians and ſaved without knowing of that particular Book, they may poſſibly be ſo, without knowing that it is Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, or of Divine and certain truth.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, Yea more, no doubt but it is poſſible to be ſaved (and to be good Chriſtians) without being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what is contained in any one Book of the Bible, totally; for he that cannot Read, may poſſibly not hear
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97215:15"/>
the whole Book from another, at leaſt ſo as to underſtand and remember it: And yet he may hear the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines out of another Book. Yea more, it is paſt doubt that a man may (in ſome caſes or circumſtances) be a true Chriſtian who knoweth not that <hi>there is any Scripture</hi> which is <hi>Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible word.</hi> For firſt ſo all the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the old world were ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Law; And the Chriſtian Churches were gathered and thouſands converted to Chriſt, many years before a word of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament was written. Secondly, And all the thouſands and millions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who cannot read, do know that there is ſuch a Book which hath ſuch words in it, but on the credit of other men. Thirdly, And we know not but the Papiſts, (who are too great undervaluers of the Scriptures, and lock it up from the Laity, and over magnifie Tradition) may keep thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands among them without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that <hi>there is a Book which is Gods word;</hi> And yet may teach them the Chriſtian Religion by <hi>other means,</hi> after to be mentioned: And it ſeemeth by

the <hi>Epist. Jeſuit. &amp; Maſaeus Hiſtor. Judic.</hi> and other writings, that in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, Congo, China,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> they did teach them onely by Creeds, Catechiſmes, and preachings: And I remember no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they gave to moſt of them of the Scriptures: And yet the moſt cruel torments and martyrdoms never before heard of, which the Chriſtians in <hi>Japan</hi> endured (of which ſee <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentus</hi> hiſtory) doth put all ſober rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders paſt doubt, that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent Chriſtians. And if <hi>other means</hi> may make men Chriſtians who are <hi>never told</hi> of the holy Scriptures, than thoſe <hi>ſame means with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> may make them Chriſtians, who are made believe that all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture paſſages are not the infallible dictates of Gods Spirit.</p>
               <p>I have given you inſtances enough, to prove that many may be Chriſtians and have a <hi>certain faith,</hi> who are not <hi>certain of all things</hi> in the Scriptures: And therefore though all theſe perſons are herein defective or erroneous, yet that Chriſtianity may be otherwiſe known and proved: Yea though the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97215:16"/>
caſe of the Scriptures were as theſe miſtaking perſons think. And I told you how many waies, beſides Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the ſumme and neceſſary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Chriſtianity is delivered down from the Apoſtles to the world; <hi>Reaſ. of Chriſt. Rel. pag.</hi> 336, 337. Firſt, in the very ſucceſſive Being of Chriſtians and Churches, who are the Profeſſors of this Doctrine. Secondly, In a ſucceſſion of Paſtors, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was to preach it. Thirdly, In a ſucceſſion of Baptiſm, which is that ſolemnizing the Chriſtian Covenant, in which the ſum of the Goſpel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Fourthly, In the three brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates or ſymboles of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Creed, Lords Prayer and Decalogue, which all the Chriſtian Churches ſtill uſed. Yea every one that was baptized at age (and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for the Infant) did openly make profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, and of Religion in all the eſſential particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Fifthly, In the Churches uſe of Catechiſing thoſe who were to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, that they might firſt know that Religion which they were to enter. Sixthly, In that conſtant Communion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97215:16"/>
of all the Churches in their ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and ſetting apart the Lords day to that uſe; where in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of God, they expreſſed and excerciſed their Religion. Seventhly, In the conſtant preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by the Paſtors. Eightly, In the conſtant Celebration of the Sacrament of Chriſts Body and Blood; wherein the ſumme of the Goſpel was recited and expreſſed. And the cuſtome was alſo to repeat the profeſſion of their Belief. Ninethly, The frequent diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Chriſtian Paſtors for their Religion againſt all Heathens, Infidels and Heroticks. Tenthly, The writings of the ſaid Paſtors, Apologies, Doctrinal, Hiſtorical, Commentaries, Devotional. Eleventhly, The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Sufferings of the Martyrs. Twelfthly, The Decrees, Canons and Epiſtles of Councils or Aſſemblies of the Chriſtian Paſtors. Thirteenthly, And after theſe the Decrees and Laws of Chriſtian Princes: in all which we have no need of any peculiar Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenthly, Yea, we may adde the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Adverſaries, who tell us
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97215:17"/>
part of the Chriſtians Religion; as <hi>Pliny, Celſus, Julian, &amp;c.</hi> All theſe waies ſet together, told men what Chriſtianity was. Fifteenthly, But the fulleſt and ſureſt diſcovery of it was, by the holy Scripture of it ſelf, which was conſtantly read in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Chriſtians. In all this I have but told you, by how many waies and means materially the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Doctrine was made known.</p>
               <p>Now the great Queſtion is, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by all theſe means we might come to a certainty of the truth of the Chriſtian Faith, in caſe we could not prove every word or particle of Scripture to be Gods word, and ſo to be true.</hi> They that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, ſay, <hi>That he that can miſtake or be deceived in one thing, may be ſo in another, and we cannot take his word as certain, who ſometimes ſpeaketh falſly; for we can never be ſure that he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the truth,</hi> But I affirm the thing queſtioned, and ſhall ſhew the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this reaſon of the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It muſt be remembred that we aſcribe <hi>Infallibility Primitive</hi> and <hi>Abſolute</hi> to God and no other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97215:17"/>
we are <hi>certain</hi> that ſo much is <hi>true</hi> as is <hi>Gods word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We are Certain that <hi>all that is the word of God,</hi> which he hath ſet his <hi>ſeal or atteſtation to,</hi> which I have largely opened in the Book which you oppoſe; All that which hath the <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutive</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant</hi> and <hi>ſubſequent Atteſtation of God</hi> there opened, we are <hi>certain is of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are Certain that the <hi>Perſon of Chriſt, and his own Doctrine</hi> had all this fourfold Divine Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: And therefore that <hi>Chriſt and his Doctrine</hi> are of God, and true. And conſequently that Chriſt was the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, the Head of the Church, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he affirmeth himſelf to be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We are certain that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as <hi>Preachers of this Goſpel, and performers of the Commiſſion Delivered them by Chriſt,</hi> had the <hi>ſame atteſtation</hi> in kind as Chriſt himſelf had: They had the ſame <hi>SPIRIT.</hi> Though the <hi>antecedent</hi> teſtimony by <hi>Propheſie</hi> was not ſo full of <hi>them,</hi> as it was of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which they <hi>preached</hi> and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97215:18"/>
left in writing Firſt, Hath in it ſtill viſibly to the eye of every truly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning perſon, the Image of Gods <hi>Power, Wiſdome and Goodneſs.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The ſame Goſpel as preached and delivered by them had the Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Teſtimony of abundant certain Miracles, Propheſies and holy works. Thirdly, The ſame Goſpel maketh that impreſſion on the ſouls of true receivers, which is the Image of Gods power, wiſdome and goodneſs, and ſo proveth it to be of God. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of theſe three is a full and certain proof.</p>
               <p>Now if there be any <hi>doubtfulneſs</hi> in any of this, it muſt be, Firſt, Either <hi>what it is</hi> that theſe <hi>Atteſtations</hi> prove, Secondly, Or whether they are <hi>really Divine Atteſtations.</hi> Thirdly, Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Divine Atteſtations are a certain proof of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To begin at the laſt. Firſt, If Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teſtimony be not a certain proof of Truth, then there is no poſſible proof in the world. For there is no <hi>Veracity</hi> in any Creature, but deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from God: And then it muſt be either becauſe a Lie is as perfect and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97215:18"/>
                  <hi>Good</hi> as <hi>Truth</hi> (which humanity, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and all the world contradicteth, and humane ſociety abhorreth, there being no ſavages ſo barbarous as to think ſo) or becauſe <hi>God</hi> is <hi>imperfect,</hi> either in <hi>wiſdome</hi> to <hi>know</hi> what is <hi>True</hi> and ſit, or in <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to <hi>chooſe</hi> it, or in <hi>Power</hi> to uſe it: That is, that God is not God, or that there is <hi>no God</hi> (and conſequently no Being) for an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect God, an <hi>unwiſe,</hi> an <hi>ill,</hi> an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Being,</hi> is <hi>no God.</hi> And verily all our Controverſies with the <hi>Infidel</hi> and the <hi>Impious,</hi> and the <hi>Perſecuter,</hi> muſt finally come to this, <hi>Whethen there be a God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. And that theſe were really Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Atteſtations, I have fully proved in the Treatiſe. Firſt, They are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Effects, and the Divine <hi>Veſtigia</hi> or Image. Secondly, And ſuch as none can do but God. None elſe can give that full Antecedent Teſtimony of Propheſie: None elſe could have done what Chriſt did; in his Life, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion: None could heal all Diſeaſes, work all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, raiſe the Dead with a word: None elſe could do what the Apoſtles
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97215:19"/>
did; in Tongues, and Miracles, and wonderous gifts, and theſe wrought by ſo many, before ſo many, for ſo long a time. No other Doctrine could it ſelf bear Gods Image of Power, Wiſdome and Goodneſs ſo exactly, nor make ſuch an Impreſſe of the ſame Image on the ſouls of men: Nay though this ſame Doctrine by the Spirit of God be adopted to ſuch an effect, yet would it not <hi>do it</hi> for want of <hi>Powerfull</hi> application, if God by the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> did not ſet it home: ſo that the ſanctification and renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſouls, is a Divine Atteſtation of this ſacred Goſpel. And beſides all the paſt Teſtimonies (of Chriſts and his Apoſtles Miracles) here is a double Teſtimony from God ſtill vouchſafed to all true Believers to the end of the world; The one is <hi>Gods Image</hi> on the holy Scriptures; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, The ſame Image by this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (and the Spirit that indited it) printed on all true Chriſtians ſouls. Divine, Power, Wiſdome and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath imprinted it ſelf firſt upon the <hi>ſacred word,</hi> or <hi>doctrine,</hi> and by that produceth unimitably, holy <hi>Life,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:97215:19"/>
                  <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in holy ſouls. True Chriſtians know this: They feel it: They profeſs it: They have this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in them, illuminating their minds, ſanctifying their wills, and quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to vital operation and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And this is Chriſts <hi>Advocate,</hi> and <hi>Witneſs</hi> ſtill dwelling in all his members. I ſpeak not of an <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate verbal</hi> or <hi>impulſive revelation</hi> in us, but of a <hi>Holy indwelling nature, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, operation,</hi> conforming the ſoul to God, and proving us to bear his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. This is <hi>Chriſts Witneſs</hi> in us, that He is Chriſt indeed and True; And this is <hi>Our Witneſs,</hi> that we are the Children of God: And it is our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent earneſt</hi> and <hi>pledge, firſt fruits and foretaſts</hi> of the glory which Chriſt hath purchaſed and promiſed. If you know no ſuch thing in your ſelf as this, you have reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, or Quenched the Spirit. And if you <hi>would</hi> not have him dwell and operate in <hi>your heart,</hi> no wonder if you cannot ſee him in the <hi>holy word:</hi> And if you would not conſent that he <hi>Rule your Mind and Life,</hi> no wonder if you deny him alſo in that word which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97215:20"/>
he did make to Rule you.</p>
               <p>If you queſtion the Real exiſtence of theſe ſeveral Teſtimonies of Gods Spirit, Firſt, Thoſe that were given to <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles,</hi> I have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved to you in the Treatiſe, were delivered down to the world three waies. 1. By the <hi>moſt credible humane Teſtimony,</hi> to produce a <hi>humane Faith.</hi> 2. By ſuch a <hi>Connexion and ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> of thoſe <hi>humane Teſtimonies</hi> as amount to a <hi>Natural Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> (As we have of the Wars in <hi>England,</hi> and that there was ſuch a man as K. <hi>Charles,</hi> K. <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. and that our Laws were made by the King and Parliament, that <hi>London</hi> was burnt, that there is ſuch a City, &amp;c. even to them that ſee not any of theſe.) 3. By <hi>new Divine Atteſtations to theſe Atteſtations;</hi> ſo that there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth. Firſt, A <hi>full humane Faith.</hi> Secondly, A <hi>Natural Certainty.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> to the aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that Chriſt did die, riſe, aſcend, work miracles, give the Spirit, and by it the Apoſtles wrought the like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And the <hi>other two</hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97215:20"/>
ſtill ſhew themſelves: They are yet in <hi>Being.</hi> The ſacred <hi>Goſpel</hi> is among is and on it the Life, Light, Love fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcribed. The <hi>Believers ſanctified</hi> by this Goſpel are among us; and have within them the Impreſſed <hi>Life, Light, Love.</hi> We ſee it (where diſtance, ſelfiſhneſs, prejudice or malignity hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not) ſhining (though as through a Lanthorn) and <hi>working</hi> (though imperfectly) in <hi>others:</hi> And they that have it may ſo feel it in themſelves, as will preſerve them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cavils of Unbelievers.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Great Creator</hi> hath his ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teſtimony in the <hi>Natural</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mankind, which in deſpight of the Devil ſhall keep up ſome <hi>Natural Religion</hi> in the world; And they that have not a <hi>written Law,</hi> are a <hi>Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves,</hi> ſhewing that God hath a <hi>Law</hi> in their <hi>hearts;</hi> So the <hi>Gracious Redeemer</hi> hath his ſtanding <hi>Witneſs</hi> in the ſanctified, even his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> the <hi>New Creature,</hi> the <hi>Image of God, the Father, Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> dwelling in them, by <hi>Divine Life, Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> ſo as ſhall keep up a Church of holy ones to Chriſt, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97215:21"/>
of all the powers of Hell, even the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and of <hi>Malignity;</hi> And ſo much for the Validity of Gods Atteſtation.</p>
               <p n="3">III. All then that remaineth doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or further to be ſpoken to, is, <hi>What it is that God hath thus atteſted by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Firſt, We are ſure it is not <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> It is not <hi>nothing</hi> that all this is done for: nor <hi>nothing</hi> that maketh this change on ſouls. Secondly, We are ſure it can be no leſs than the Truth of the Perſon, Office and Doctrine of Chriſt himſelf: He hath certainly by this proved his own Verity and Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: for his own Miracles and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection were ſeals affixed hereunto: Thirdly, We are ſure that the <hi>ſame Gospel</hi> ſpoken by himſelf, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed alſo when ſpoken or written by his Diſciples. Elſe the ſame ſhould be ſure and not ſure. Fourthly, We are ſure that the Apoſtles Miracles, &amp;c. confirmed all their Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work. I have proved this in my Treatiſe of the <hi>Lords Day.</hi> Whatever Chriſt <hi>Promiſed</hi> them the <hi>Spirit</hi> for, that he gave them the <hi>Spirit</hi> for. He
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97215:21"/>
that findeth his <hi>Promiſe</hi> with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,</hi> may know that it was the <hi>Promiſe</hi> which was <hi>Performed.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our work is to find out that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Firſt, We find their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Go and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple me all Nations, Baptizing them into the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all things whatever I have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you.</hi> And the Promiſe is, <hi>Lo, I am with you alwaies to the end of the world.</hi> And Joh. 16. 7, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Advocate will not come unto you: But if I depart I will ſend him unto you. I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but you cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when he the ſpirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all the truth: For he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that he ſhall speak; and he ſhall ſhew you things to come: He ſhall glorifie me; for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhew it unto you,</hi> Luk. 24. 49. <hi>And behold I ſend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of my Father upon you: But tarry ye in the City of Jeruſalem, till ye be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:97215:22"/>
                  <hi>with power from on high;</hi> ſo Act. 1. 5. <hi>Ye ſhall be Baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many days hence,</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>But ye ſhall receive power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be witneſſes to me, both in Jeruſalem and to all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermoſt parts of the earth.</hi> John 17. 8. <hi>I have given to them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them,</hi> Verſe 17, 18. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth: thy word is truth: As thou haſt ſent me into the world, ſo I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſent them into the world: And for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the truth.</hi> John 14 26. <hi>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, &amp; bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Adde to theſe the Texts which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Performance</hi> of theſe <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 20. 22. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3, 4. <hi>So great ſalvation, which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him: God alſo bearing them witneſs, both with ſignes and wonders,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:97215:22"/>
                  <hi>and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will,</hi> 1 Pet 1 12. <hi>The things which are now reported unto you, by them that have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpel unto you, by the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven.</hi> Rom. 15. 19, 20. <hi>Through mighty ſigns and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, ſo that from Jeruſalem, and round about by Illyricum, I have fully preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 3. 2. <hi>This onely would I learn of you: Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all this it is evident, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was given them to enable them to underſtand the Goſpel, and to preach it to the world; to remember all that Chriſt had taught them: to help them to deliver the Covenant of Grace, and draw men into it, and Baptize them; To gather Churches, and to teach them to obſerve all that Chriſt had commanded them, and made part of his Laws. To teach them all truth which was Evangelical or part of their Miniſterial Office. To enable them to be moſt certain and full in their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of what they had heard from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97215:23"/>
Chriſt, and ſeen him do, which was part of the Goſpel. In a word to to perform all their proper Office.</p>
               <p>I do not at the preſent ſuppoſe you to take theſe Texts for the word of God: For I muſt ſuppoſe you to be an Infidel: But I onely offer them as part of the certain hiſtorical evidence, concurring with all the forementioned hiſtory and evidence of the fact, to prove <hi>what it was</hi> which the Apoſtles miracles were uſed to confirm. This ſame Goſpel they preached every where, when they wrought theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. And if they confirmed not <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> or Chriſtian Religion, they confirmed <hi>nothing.</hi> So that it being <hi>certain</hi> that this <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> were real, and <hi>certain</hi> that they were the Teſtimony of <hi>God,</hi> and certain that it was the <hi>Truth of Chriſts perſon, actions, doctrine, ſufferings, reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſcenſion, and Covenant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> which they atteſted, and all that is properly the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion,</hi> what hindereth our certainty of all this. If it were a doubt whether the Spirit atteſted <hi>more,</hi> it is never the more doubtful, whether he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97215:23"/>
atteſted this much. The Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly preached this Goſpel; They Baptized perſons into the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; They opened the Articles of the Faith to them, and cauſed them to profeſs that Faith; They engaged them into the promiſe, and directed them in the practice of a godly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and ſober life: And they confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all this by miracles. And is not all this then made ſure? (Yea, before they wrote any of the Scriptures:)</p>
               <p>And now to the Objection, <hi>[He that ſpeaketh falſly in one thing is to be believed certainly or as infallible in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing]</hi> I again anſwer, it is a blind Objection. God onely is abſolutely infallible. All men are fallible in ſome things: We are not to believe that the Apoſtles could erre in nothing at all. <hi>Peter</hi> knew not what he ſaid, when he talkt of dwelling on the Mount. They <hi>could erre,</hi> and they <hi>could ſin:</hi> And he that <hi>ſinneth, erreth:</hi> They were not abſolutely perfect; But it is in <hi>certain particulars,</hi> even in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that <hi>God would not ſuffer them to erre or to deceive.</hi> Thoſe words which the Holy Ghoſt did by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97215:24"/>
inſpiration dictate to them, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all thoſe words the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt atteſted: That is, <hi>To all the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>thus much</hi> being paſt doubt, what if we were now at a loſs about ſome Appurtenances of the Goſpel, whether they were any of the Spirits dictates, or any part of the word of God: or any proper part of that which the Apoſtles were Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and Spiritually Enabled to teach? What if in ſome points which they could know by common ſenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly as well as other men, any one ſhould think that they were left meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that certainty of ſenſe. What if one be uncertain which are the <hi>Parts,</hi> and which but the Appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of the Goſpel in ſome things which ſalvation is not laid on? Or were uncertain whether the Spirit did determine the Speakers tongue or pen about every ſuch Appurtenance? What's this to the invalidating of any of the reſt? If indeed when they ſpeak by the Spirits Revelation, they ſpake falſly at any one time, we could never be ſure that they ſpake true.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97215:24"/>
But when we are ſure that all is <hi>true which they ſpeak by the Spirit,</hi> and ſure that <hi>they ſpake</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>delivered</hi> the Chriſtian Religion by the Spirit, and are onely not ſure whether every word in Genealogy, or by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were ſpoken by the Spirit, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will follow hence, but that <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word of God is true,</hi> and <hi>every word of the Apoſtles which was a word of God:</hi> And it is perverſneſs to argue, <hi>They<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may erre when they ſpeak their own words as men: Therefore they may erre when they ſpeak Gods words by the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The Teſtimony of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſanctifying Spirit, is infallible. And ſo much as this Spirit atteſteth to me is true, And I am ſure that this Spirit atteſteth the truth of the Goſpel in me; for the ſubſtance of the Goſpel is imprinted on my heart; and by the <hi>impreſſion</hi> I know the <hi>ſeal.</hi> But what if I find on me no part of Gods Image, which was made by the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Jorams Father</hi> or <hi>Son;</hi> what if I feel no Teſtimony of the Spirit in me, which tells the age of ſuch or ſuch a man there named; Nor can prove by the <hi>Spirit</hi> in me, how far <hi>Bethany</hi> was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97215:25"/>
from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> What if the mention of <hi>Pauls Cloak and Parchments</hi> did not ſanctifie me? Muſt I be uncertain of <hi>that which did?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What if I read a promiſe in the Scripture that God will never fail me nor forſake me? but will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me in ſafety to his Kingdome? If I were uncertain whether this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe extended to every hair of my head, ſo that none of them ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh? or to the preſervation of my Colour, and ſuch like accidents; Will it follow, that I cannot be ſure that I my ſelf, my ſoul, my perſon, ſhall not be forſaken?</p>
               <p>What if I have a promiſe that <hi>all things ſhall work together for my good;</hi> And I am uncertain whether ſins or my own follies, or raſhneſs, or the creeping of every worm in the world, or the ſhaking of every leaf be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with thoſe <hi>[All things.]</hi> Muſt I be uncertain therefore whether <hi>any thing</hi> ſhall work for my <hi>good?</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſufferings for Christ</hi> ſhall do it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What if I be uncertain whether the vegetative faculties or ſoul in man, be material or immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97215:25"/>
Muſt I be as uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man have an immaterial (or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal) ſoul? and whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual powers be ſuch or not?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What if I be in doubt when the Law doth ſummon a man to any place, or command him any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, whether it meant that he ſhall not change his cloaths, or leave them off, nor cut his hair or nails, but bring all with him? Doth it follow that I muſt be as uncertain whether the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelf muſt come or not?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, What if I be diſputing whether a Tree be wood? and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether the leaves, their ribs, or ſtalkes be truly wood or not? muſt I therefore be uncertain of all the reſt?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, What if we diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Kings officers are to be obeyed? and it be a doubt to me, whether a Prelate or an Apparator be the Kings Officers? can I therefore be aſſured of no others?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, When a witneſs ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to any writing, that it is true, or to any interrogatories; If I be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether it be the true ſpelling,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97215:26"/>
or Syntax of the words, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of every phraſe, or every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the matter which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth, muſt I therefore be uncertain whether he atteſt any thing at al?</p>
               <p>This one conſideration may ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of ſuch concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; That all Syſtems Phyſical and Moral, have their great Eſſential or principal parts, and their ſmaller Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grals, and their Accidents, which are no proper parts. And the Great and Principal parts are <hi>few, plain, diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the being or the greateſt Ends: The <hi>Integrals</hi> are <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, ſmall, hardly diſcernable,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> only to Perfection. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents are ſome of them yet of a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nature, leſſe neceſſary, nnd leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable. At the maſter trunks its eaſie to know which is a vein, and which an Artery, and which a Nerve, and what is their number: But when you go to their extremities, they will appear innumerable, ſmall, and ſcarce diſcernable. I can know many grand trunks or boughs a tree hath, when I cannot know the number of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſprigs at the extreamities,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97215:26"/>
nor juſt where the woody nature ceaſeth, and the leaves or frutex doth begin. So I can eaſily know in the frame of Grace, that Faith, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Even ſo in our preſent caſe we can eaſily prove that all that is Gods word and <hi>uttered</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> by his Spirit is true. But to come to a <hi>full certainty</hi> of <hi>every book</hi> whether it be truly Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and <hi>every Copy</hi> that varieth in ſome <hi>readings</hi> from others, or of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Genealogical Chronological Topogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,</hi> or <hi>Historical</hi> word; every phraſe, location, order of ſentences, citation of the Prophets, whether it were certainly all done by the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, is a thing that requireth more knowledg than every true Chriſtian hath, as not having the ſame clearneſs and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Evidence as the <hi>Gospel</hi> or <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſtianity</hi> hath.

               <p>The Reaſons why I have premiſed the former Propoſitions is, Firſt, For your own ſake, Secondly, For the ſake of many Infidels that now have the ſame miſ-apprehenſions, Thirdly, And for the ſake of many thouſand weak, dark and tempted Chriſtians: That you may not think that you may renounce Chriſtianity, if you could prove a Contradiction or miſtake in the Scriptures; there being greater certainty of our Religion, than of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſingle word in the Bible. And that every Chriſtian may not think that he muſt needs doubt as much of Chriſtianity it ſelf, and of all the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97215:27"/>
to another; And that he can have no more certainty of the Goſpel, than he hath of <hi>Jorams</hi> ſon, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Matthew</hi> did rightly apply the Propheſie that Chriſt ſhould be called a <hi>Nazarene, Mat.</hi> 2. 23. or the name of <hi>Jeremy, Mat.</hi> 27. 9. or whether <hi>Jude</hi> be Canonical, and the Epiſtle to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Rom. ad Cor.</hi> not Canonical; or whether <hi>Henochs</hi> propheſie cited by <hi>Jude</hi> be Divine; with many ſuch like. We need not ſpread the ſails ſo wide to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan as if we muſt let go all, if we doubt of the divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any one word.</p>
               <p>But yet that <hi>indeed every word</hi> is <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>ſure,</hi> which is delivered as <hi>Gods word,</hi> I now aſſert.</p>
               <p>My meaning in that limitation is this: There are ſome paſſages (as I ſaid) ſpoken only <hi>hiſtorically,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Narration of ſome words of the Devil (as to <hi>Job, Chriſt,</hi> and as moſt think, to <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Endor</hi> &amp;c.) and ſome words of wicked men, and ſome words of weak and common perſons: And all theſe are not mentioned as the words of God: As the words of <hi>Job</hi>'s
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97215:28"/>
Friends, which God reproved; The words of the old Prophet that lyed in the name of the Lord to the young Prophet to his deſtruction: The words of <hi>Jonas,</hi> I do well to be angry; and the words of Chriſts Enemies, Perfecutors, &amp;c. Yea the mention of the Old Prophet remembreth me, that all words ſpoken as <hi>in Gods name,</hi> and that by a pretended, yea by a <hi>real Prophet,</hi> are not therefore the <hi>words of God; Micheah</hi> onely may ſay true, while <hi>Zidkiah</hi> and all the reſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs</hi> Prophets may lie, as in the name of the Lord. <hi>Balaam</hi> and the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid old Prophet, and many ſuch may ſay true, when Gods Spirit doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them, and yet lie at another time in Gods name. And what <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth by his <hi>[not the Lord but I]</hi> I leave to conſideration. Whether in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. all thoſe that he correcteth for a diſorderly uſing even the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gifts of tongues and propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. had their Timeing and <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of their gifts from the ſame Spirit that gave them the gifts, you may judge. And ſome Proteſtant expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have doubted, whether <hi>James</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:97215:28"/>
and the reſt were guided by the Spirit, when they perſwaded <hi>Paul</hi> to go into the Temple, to ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> that he obſerved their Law: Though I think that Counſel was of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> concurred in obeying it. But one inſtance I more doubt of my ſelf; which is, when Chriſt and his Apoſtles do oft uſe the Septuagint in their Citations out of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be alwaies their meaning to juſtific each <hi>tranſlation,</hi> and <hi>particle of ſenſe,</hi> as the word of God and rightly done; or onely to uſe that as tolerable, and containing the main truth intended, which was then in uſe among the Jews, and therefore underſtood by them: and ſo beſt, as ſuited to the auditors. And ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every citation of numbers or Genealogies from the Septuagint, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an approbation of it in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry points in which it differeth from the Hebrew Copies; ſuch plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, being promiſed I aſſert that <hi>All that is ſaid in the Bible as by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> by <hi>men that had the promiſe of his Spirit,</hi> and <hi>eſpecially</hi> by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> is <hi>certain Truth</hi> and <hi>hath</hi> no
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97215:29"/>
                  <hi>Contradiction in its parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I give you my Reaſons, I think it meet to remove all ambiguity of the words, <hi>[Infallible or Certain]</hi> that I may be rightly underſtood.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The conſent of all ſober Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Philoſophers teacheth us to diftinguith between <hi>objective</hi> and <hi>ſubjective certainty,</hi> that is, The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth of the <hi>Thing,</hi> and the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of our own apprehenſion of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The word <hi>certain,</hi> when applyed to the Apprehenſion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſignifieth an infallible apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſometime a clear and ſtrong apprehenſion, excluding both deceit and <hi>doubts;</hi> and by ſome abuſively to a <hi>ſtrong Apprehenſion,</hi> which excludeth <hi>Doubts</hi> but not <hi>Deceits.</hi> Thirdly, In the <hi>object Infallibility</hi> ſometime ſignifieth nothing but <hi>Verity,</hi> which whoever believeth is not deceived: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſignifieth alſo ſuch clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as is in its kind ſufficient to baniſh all conſiderable doubting. And now I conclude.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whatever is <hi>True,</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>Infallibly</hi> true;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97215:29"/>
ſo far as that no man in Believing it true, is therein <hi>deceived</hi> or miſtaken. All Truth is Certain Infallible Truth in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Few Truths in the world are ſo <hi>Evident</hi> as that a <hi>blinded preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced indiſpoſed</hi> perſon, may not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them, or erre about them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All Truths in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture have not <hi>equal evidence,</hi> that they are the <hi>word of God</hi> (though all that is known to be the word of <hi>God,</hi> if equally ſo known, have equal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the formal reaſon of ſaith, that they are true.)</p>
               <p>Fourthly, All <hi>known</hi> Truth is <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly</hi> known; that is, He that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> it, is not <hi>deceived,</hi> nor can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be deceived by taking it to be <hi>true:</hi> ſo that as <hi>Infallibility</hi> ſignifieth <hi>[not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being deceived]</hi> all true knowledge is <hi>ſubjectively infallible</hi> and certain; that is, its true.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, No man can know that <hi>Infallibly,</hi> which is not <hi>objectively cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi> that which is not <hi>True,</hi> cannot be <hi>known</hi> to be true. The ſtrongeſt and moſt confident belief of a falſhood, is a <hi>falſe</hi> belief, and more than <hi>falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> 
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:97215:30"/>
or <hi>uncertain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, All Gods word being <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually true</hi> and <hi>infallible,</hi> the belief of it is alſo equally true and infallible. But being not All <hi>equally intelligible, evident</hi> (to be his word,) and <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the <hi>underſtanding and belief</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part is not equally <hi>eaſie, ſtrong, paſt doubting,</hi> or <hi>neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, There is a ſuperficial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Divine Revelations (even the Goſpel) which a natural man may have by extrinſick means. And there is a more clear apprehenſion, which a Commoner ſort of Grace may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: But that Belief which is ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> as truly to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and ſave the ſoul, muſt be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the ſpecial operation of the Holy Ghoſt (who yet hath a courſe of appointed means in which we muſt receive it.)</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The reaſon of this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Spirits operation of <hi>faith,</hi> and then <hi>by ſaith,</hi> is not becauſe the Goſpel wanteth due <hi>Aſcertaining E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi> or an aptitude to convince and ſanctifie a ſoul: For its highly <hi>Rational</hi> (though myſterious) and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97215:30"/>
                  <hi>Good.</hi> But becauſe by corruption and pravity the mind of man is ſo undiſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>know, believe,</hi> and <hi>love truths</hi> of ſuch a <hi>nature,</hi> as that there is need of a ſpecial Internal higher Operator to ſet home the work as the hand of a man ſetteth the ſeal upon the wax, and to do that by it which the bare word alone, with the excellenteſt preacher, cannot do.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, Yet is no wicked Infidel excuſeable, that ſaith, <hi>If I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, I will not believe it;</hi> Becauſe Firſt, It is his pravity which is his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability; Secondly, He is more <hi>able</hi> for a common ſuperficial belief, than for a ſpecial effectual belief. Thirdly, And if he did by the help of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon belief, do what he might, and God appointeth him in the uſe of means, to obtain a ſpecial Faith through grace, he ſhould find that God hath commanded no man to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſeek after grace in vain; and if any man have not that grace and power which is of neceſſity to his faith and ſalvation, it is long of himſelf, who uſeth not his commoner power and grace as he might uſe them. And
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97215:31"/>
ſo much to prevent miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Now my Reaſons why I take every <hi>Hiſtory, Chronology, Genealogy</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as <hi>certainly true,</hi> and <hi>every other word,</hi> which is ſpoken by a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Apoſtle as by the Spirit, (and not diſowned by the Scripture it ſelf) but eſpecially ſuch as you accuſe in the Goſpel, are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A <hi>Priore,</hi> Becauſe it ſeemeth to me that the <hi>writing of the whole Books of the New Teſtament by them,</hi> was done in the diſcharge of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion given them by Chriſt: And he promiſed his Apoſtles his Spirit for the performance of all their Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed office work. This <hi>writing</hi> is part of the <hi>preaching</hi> which Chriſt ſent them for. And no doubt but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did cauſe them to write all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial part: And therefore we have reaſon to think that the ſmalleſt parts are from the ſame Author, and that he aſſiſted them in the leaſt as well as in the greateſt. Yea the very <hi>accidents</hi> may have a perfection in their place, though leſs perfect in themſelves. Though all the Evangeliſts uſe not the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97215:31"/>
ſame Method, or Order, nor repeat Chriſts ſayings in the ſame terms; yet in reſpect to the whole frame, it may be beſt that there ſhould be that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of words, and order, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and declare the ſame ſenſe and things. And even their plain and leſs accurate ſtile and method, may be beſt as fitteſt to its uſe and end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A <hi>Poſteriore:</hi> There is no Caviller that yet hath proved any falſhood or contradiction in any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Scripture; Though the clearing of ſome of them require more than vulgar knowledge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Saving the controverſies about the few queſtioned Books and ſome few ſentences, and words, the Church which received the Scriptures as Gods word, did receive the whole as his word, and as certainly true in every part.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe that Spirit of Miracles in the Apoſtles, and that Spirit of Holineſs in us, which atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Chriſtian Religion, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it and atteſt it as found in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, (though not as there alone:) And it putteth no exception
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97215:32"/>
againſt any part of the ſacred record: Therefore while it <hi>particularly</hi> atteſteth the <hi>chief parts,</hi> it inferreth an atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſmalleſt. (for that <hi>word</hi> or <hi>line</hi> which is not ſtrictly a <hi>part</hi> but an <hi>accident</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion, is yet a <hi>part</hi> of the Bible which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.)</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And though all the reaſons which I have given, prove, that the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion may be certainly proved, though we could not prove every by expreſſion in the Scripture to be true; and though we deny not but the Pen-men manifeſted their humane imperfections in ſtile and method; yet if each paſſage were not True, it would be ſo great a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to the weak, and make it ſo difficult to know in ſome points what is true, in compariſon of what it would be, if <hi>all be true,</hi> that we have no reaſon to imagine this difficulty to our ſelves, while its unproved.</p>
               <p>And having ſaid this, I am here in order to anſwer your objections: which yet you ſhould not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from me, whilſt ſo great a number of books are already written

               <p>Firſt, Your firſt Caſe is of <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>Joram begat Ozias,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here are two difficulties to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Firſt, whether <hi>Joram begat Ozias,</hi> (called alſo <hi>Azarias.)</hi> Secondly, why <hi>Matthew</hi> leaveth out <hi>Ahazariah, Joas</hi> and <hi>Amaziah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the firſt is it not ſtrange that you ſhould number this with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions? Are we not all called the <hi>Children of Adam?</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Father of all the Jews?</hi> Is there not a <hi>mediate</hi> as well as an <hi>immediate</hi> Generation and Progeny? Is not <hi>cauſa cauſae, cauſa cavſati?</hi> Did not your <hi>Great Grandfather</hi> beget <hi>you in cauſa,</hi> while he begat him who begat him, who begat you immediately? What more common among the Hebrews, than to call <hi>Poſterity</hi> the <hi>Children of their Anceſtors.</hi> Even Chriſt is called <hi>The ſon of David?</hi> And uſe is the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and expoſitor of <hi>words.</hi> And you were born too late, to teach either God or the World, in what ſenſe to uſe words ſo many hundred years
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97215:33"/>
ago? This Language was well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them that uſed the like.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, For the next que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion you muſt underſtand the <hi>ſcope</hi> of an Author and his undertaking, if you will underſtand his words. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> deſigne was not to name every perſon in all theſe periods of time, from whom Chriſt deſcended; But firſt to ſhew for Memory ſake, how the line of Chriſts Progenitors may be mentioned by <hi>three fourteens</hi> in <hi>three ſeveral periods</hi> of time: one from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and one from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid to the Captivity,</hi> and one from <hi>thence to Chriſt:</hi> Therein commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating as many as God was pleaſed hereby to make memorate, to their honour, and to ſhew the truth of the deſcent of Chriſt from <hi>Abraham and David.</hi> Secondly, And God is not bound to give us a reaſon, why he <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth</hi> any of their names: But this probability is obvious, that ſeeing <hi>Matthew</hi> would for memory keep himſelf to the number of <hi>fourteen,</hi> none were fitter to be left out than the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Athalia,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel;</hi> which God hath fortold
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97215:34"/>
ſhould be blotted out or aboliſhed, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 21, 22. And therefore he that would have the names of the wicked to rot would not here honour them with a place among the Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors of Chriſt: And yet the ſecond Commandment limiting Gods viſiting the ſins of the Fathers on the Children to the third and fourth Generation, it is no wonder that the omiſſion doth extend no further; And ſo ſuitable is Gods <hi>word,</hi> to his <hi>providence,</hi> that <hi>theſe three men</hi> were all cut off by the ſword, whoſe memory is here cut off by <hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. As to your ſecond pretended contradiction, Firſt, Remember that it was none of the purpoſe of any of the Evangeliſts to ſay all that could be ſaid, even of the ſayings and doings of Chriſt himſelf; much leſs of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And therefore if that be ſaid in one which is not ſaid in another it is no wonder: And you muſt remember what Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> hath noted of <hi>Luke,</hi> that <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. profeſſing that he received his knowledg from others (though directed by the holy Ghoſt) he delivered the things themſelves,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97215:34"/>
with leſs reſpect to the time and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when every thing was ſaid and done, than the other did obſerve, it being not his deſign to tell the time and order of each.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, ſet them all together and you will find that, Firſt, <hi>Mary Magdalen, Johanna, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Jacobi,</hi> and <hi>Sallome,</hi> having bought ſpices and going to anoint the body of Jeſus, ſaid, <hi>[who will roll away the ſtone for us?]</hi> And when they came they found the ſtone rolled away by an Angel that ſate upon it. Secondly, That Angel with another, ſpeaks to the women, ſaying, <hi>Fear not; I know you ſeek Jeſus that was Crucified; why ſeek ye the living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead; he is not here, he is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, as he ſaid, Come ſee the place where the Lord was laid, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, Then the Women run and tell the Diſciples, They have taken away the Lord and we know not where they have laid him. Fourthly, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> run to the Sepulchre, and ſaw the clothes and returned. Fifthly <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> being come back, ſtood weeping at the door of the Sepulchre, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97215:35"/>
in, ſhe ſaw <hi>two Angels, one at the head, another at the feet of the place where Jeſus lay;</hi> who ſay, <hi>Woman why weepeſt thou? ſhe ſaid, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</hi> Sixthly, Having ſaid this, ſhe looked behind her and ſaw Jeſus, not knowing him, who ſaid <hi>Woman why weepest thou? whom ſeekeſt thou? ſhe thinking him to be the Gardiner, anſwered, If thou haſt taken him away, tell me where thou haſt laid him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jeſus ſaid to her touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended, &amp;c. But go to my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſay unto them, I aſcend to,</hi> &amp;c. Seventhly, <hi>Mary runs and tells this to the Diſciples, that ſhe had ſeen the Lord, and what he ſaid to her:</hi> But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her not. Eighthly, Either at the ſame time before <hi>Mary</hi> was gone, or perhaps after ſhe had overgone them to tell the Diſciples, Jeſus met the reſt of the women, and ſaid to them, <hi>All hail; and they laid hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his feet, and worſhipped him. And Jeſus ſaid to them, fear not, go tell my brethren that that they go into Galilee, and there they ſhall ſee me</hi> Take all the Evangeliſts, and tell me. Firſt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97215:35"/>
here be any more than All <hi>ſet</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſay? Secondly, Whether in all this there be any Contradiction?</p>
               <p>But if you ſhould take Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> ſhorter Suppoſition, Firſt, That <hi>Mary</hi> and the women came to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and find that before they came the ſtone was rolled away by an Angel (who had affrighted the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) Secondly, They go in and miſs the body. Thirdly, <hi>Mary</hi> runs and tells <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> Fourthly, They run and ſatisfie themſelves, and return to the reſt. Fifthly, The women ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sepulchre, ſee the Angels; firſt one, on the ſtone, and on the right ſide of the Monument, and then two, one at the head and another at the feet of it. Sixthly, The Angels ſpeak all that the Evangeliſts mention; and <hi>Mary</hi> to them. Seventhly, She turneth back and ſeeth Jeſus, who ſpeaketh to her, and to the reſt what is recorded. Eighthly, Then ſhe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and telleth all to the Diſciples. If this order be ſuppoſed, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is here?</p>
               <p>Where you ſay in <hi>Luke the women told the Diſciples of the Angels firſt, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:97215:36"/>
                  <hi>Peter went,</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſuppoſe that they firſt told them of the words of the Angels that were <hi>without the Sepulchre</hi> before <hi>Peter</hi> went, and after of the Angels within the Sepulchre (which might be the ſame Angels, but not the ſame; apparition) or whether you only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Luke,</hi> as in Chriſts Doctrine ſo in theſe by-matters of fact, to intend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deliver the <hi>matter,</hi> and not to tell juſt the <hi>time and order,</hi> There is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth nor contradiction in either ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Your third queſtion is fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the anſwer of the Former. According to the firſt Harmony or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Matthew</hi> onely mentioneth one of the Apparitions of the Angels, and one of <hi>Maries</hi> goings to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And ſo this written in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> was partly before <hi>Maries</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt <hi>(viz.</hi> The Angels firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) and partly after <hi>(viz.</hi> her going the ſecond time upon the ſecond appearance of the Angels to tell them.)</p>

               <p>Prop. 3. <hi>He that firſt preveth the Truth of the Chriſtian Faith by ſolid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, may and ought to be certain of that Truth, though he be not able to ſalve all ſeeming contradictions in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or anſwer all objections which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur!

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, What if the Queſtion be, <hi>Whether God be perfectly good?</hi> Cannot I be ſure of it, till I can anſwer all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97215:38"/>
their Objections, who ſay <hi>[perfect goodneſs</hi> would make all things perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good: and would not let the world he in ſo much wickedneſs, nor ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tormenting Diſeaſes to afflict us, nor the innocent Horſe and Oxe to be laboured, tired, tormented and killed by us at our pleaſure, &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What if the Queſtion were, <hi>Whether God be Almighty?</hi> Cannot I know it, till I can anſwer them who ſay, that [He that cannot make an infinite world is not infinite in power? He that hath a will which men can violate; he that indureth all the ſin in the world, which he hateth, and the ruine and miſery of ſo many millions whom he loveth, is not Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?]</p>
               <p>Fifthly, What if the Queſtions <hi>Whether man be a rational Creature? whether he have any free will? whether bruits have reaſon? whether plants and ſtones have ſenſe?</hi> Can I know none of theſe till I can anſwer all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the Somatiſts againſt the Soul? and all the Objections of <hi>Hobs</hi> againſt free will? and all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Chambre</hi> for the reaſon of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97215:38"/>
beaſts? and all that <hi>Campanella</hi> hath ſaid <hi>de ſenſu rerum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a Word, What ſhall we know in the world, if we can know nothing till we can ſolve all difficulties and Objections. Therefore I adde</p>
               <p>Prop. 4. <hi>The true method of one that would arrive at certainty, and not deceive himſelf and others, is to begin at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and diſcern things in their neereſt, intrinſecal and moſt certain evidences: and afterwards to try the by-objections as he is able: And not to pore firſt upon the objected difficulties, and judge of all the cauſe by thoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The plain truth and caſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is, that if God had not done more for them by giving them his <hi>Spirit</hi> by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> of its truth in the effects, than their Teachers have done by a right inſtructing them in the evidences of Faith, or than the Reaſon of the moſt doth in a clear diſcerning of thoſe evidences in the thing or word it ſelf; it were no wonder if Apoſtates were more numerous than they are,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97215:39"/>
when ſo many build on the ſand, and are ſtrangers to the true foundation, and will never ſee the evidences of the Chriſtian Verity in it ſelf; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if poor Objejections ſhake them, that never underſtood the nature and Reaſons of their own Religion. If the Tree grow all in top, which expoſeth it to the winds, and little in the <hi>roots</hi> which muſt hold it faſt, no wonder if it be overthrown. When men never knew the great clear evidences of the Chriſtian Religion, but take it up by Cuſtome, Education and on the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit only of the time and place in which they live, no wonder if every ſeeming weakneſs, error or contradiction in Scripture make them doubt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Look to all Learning, Arts and Sciences? Do not learners that would know, begin at the Elements and Foundation? Do we not begin in Grammar with our Letters, Syllables, Words, and chief rules? And in all Arts and Sciences with the Elements and Principles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And Reaſon telleth us that the points that are moſt <hi>neceſſary, clear</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> muſt be held accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97215:39"/>
with a more <hi>clear, aſsured confidence</hi> than thoſe that are <hi>unneceſſary</hi> &amp; <hi>dark;</hi> And that <hi>uncertainties</hi> muſt be reduced to <hi>certainties,</hi> and not <hi>certainties</hi> to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties;</hi> And that all arguing ſhould be a <hi>notiore,</hi> and not a <hi>minus not is.</hi> And as I ſaid before, as the Trunks of the Tree, the <hi>Veins,</hi> the Arteries, the Nerves are few and viſible, and eaſily and ſurely known, when the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of little branches are hardly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or numerable: ſo is it with the ſchemes of truths. He therefore that will begin at theſe numerous ſmall branches will <hi>dote</hi> rather than <hi>know</hi> or learn.</p>
               <p>As in the former inſtances. Firſt, When I ſee with my eyes, the effects of <hi>Power, Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in all the viſible works of God, I am ſure that it is perfect Power, Wiſdome and Goodneſs which is the cauſe of this: I am certain that nothing can give that which <hi>(formaliter</hi> or <hi>eminenter)</hi> it hath not to give, nor can the effect exceed the totall cauſe: I am certain that he from whom all Creatures Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Goodneſs doth proceed, muſt needs himſelf be more Great and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97215:40"/>
Wiſe and Good, than all the world of Creatures ſet together which he hath made. To this fundamental certainty therefore I muſt hold if I will not dote whatever little Objections or pratlings may be uſed againſt it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Eternity is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, which quite ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up my underſtanding; and many little things be ſaid againſt it? But I am <hi>certain</hi> that <hi>nothing</hi> can make <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> And if ever there had been <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> there never would have been any thing: And to this certainty I will hold.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A <hi>holy</hi> life hath a great many of cavilling Objections raiſed againſt it by corrupted nature. And ſhall I there begin to make my trial of it? No: I am firſt ſure that a <hi>Ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al free</hi> Agent and Subject of God, is bound to obey him, and that the <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Good</hi> ſhould be <hi>Greatlieſt loved,</hi> and that we are totally our <hi>Creators own,</hi> and ſhould be totally devoted to him: I am ſure I <hi>cannot love the infinite Good too much,</hi> nor <hi>be too Good,</hi> nor <hi>do too much Good to others</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> nor make too ſure of my own <hi>felicity,</hi> nor
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97215:40"/>
too much ſeek my ultimate end. And ſhall not this aſſurance hold me faſt againſt all the ſnarlings and pratlings of the doating drunken world?</p>
               <p>So here, I have in the Treatiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened thoſe grounds on which we may be <hi>certain</hi> of the <hi>neceſſity of this ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> of the <hi>life to come;</hi> and of the <hi>truth of the Chriſtian Faith and hopes.</hi> And becauſe God in mercy hath not put off the world with the skeleton of a bare Creed, but alſo given them the compleat body of ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to be a full perpetual Record of this truth, ſhall I turn his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a ſnare and ſin, and queſtion all, even the Articles of the Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the Scriptures there are ſome things accidental to Religion, and ſome things hard to be underſtood, which the ignorant and unskilfull wreſt to their deſtruction? This is but to be Devils to our ſelves, and fooliſh enemies of our own peace and comfort: As <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks againſt them that pleaded for the ſouls mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, as if it were a deſireable thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:97215:41"/>
You have <hi>nothing elſe</hi> that ſuiteth the Nature and Intereſt of a man, and agreeth with the Nature and Intereſt of God, to <hi>ſet againſt</hi> the Chriſtian Religion in <hi>Competition.</hi> If you would have <hi>no Religion,</hi> you would have <hi>no Hopes, no Safety, no Buſineſs or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> but Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

And if you would not die in deſperation, but have the hopes and foreſight of a better life, you have little Reaſon to quarrel with a Meſſenger from Heaven, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Life and Immortality to light.

            <head>THE SECOND PART OF THIS APPENDIX; BEING Some ANIMADVERSIONS On the foreſaid Treatiſe <hi>De Veritate,</hi> Reſolving ſeveral Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there included or implyed.</head>
            <p>HAving let fall the mention of that noble Authors Treatiſe, it came into my mind, that it having never been anſwered, might be thought unanſwerable, and ſo the more conſiderable. Therefore I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97215:44"/>
ſo much of my Animadverſion, as the cauſe in hand requireth.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, I muſt give the Author the Honor of his great Learning and ſtrength of wit. Secondly, I muſt confeſs that the Teachers of the Church, have been too often ſuch, as have given him the ſcandal which he ſo oft expreſſeth, as more regarding their Intereſt than Truth, and not making clear the truth which they have taught, and often wronging it by their omiſſions or additions, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound explications. Thirdly, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the body of his Treatiſe contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many very conſiderable things, in order to the diſquiſition of truth; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially about the ſutableneſs of the faculties to the object, the conditions requiſite to a true apprehenſion, and ſomewhat about the nature of truth it ſelf: Though that which he calleth <hi>Veritas apparentiae,</hi> I had rather call, <hi>Evidentia Veritatis rei.</hi> And I am not willing to think that I have <hi>as many different faculties</hi> as there are <hi>different plants</hi> in my Garden, or <hi>Books</hi> in my Study, or <hi>Sentences</hi> in thoſe Books; And in ſeveral things I miſs that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs

            <div n="1" type="question">
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>Whether if Chriſt, and not onely our Repentance, and belief in God, be taken for a ſacrifice and price given to God for mans Redemption, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low that moſt of the world are damned by Gods will without any Remedy, to which they covld have recourſe for ſalvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, It is ſtrange that men ſhould be left Remedileſs, if Chriſt, and not onely their <hi>Repentance</hi> be the Remedy? Surely if Chriſt had given ſinners <hi>nothing,</hi> yet he hath <hi>taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We all confeſs the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Repentance?</hi> But this is partly <hi>coordinate</hi> (as the <hi>end)</hi> and partly <hi>ſubordinate</hi> (as an <hi>effect)</hi> and therefore not <hi>contrary</hi> to the neceſſity of a <hi>Redeemer? Repentance</hi> is our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> and our begun Recovery from ſin: And will it follow that the <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:97215:45"/>
is unneceſſary becauſe <hi>health</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi> are <hi>neceſſary?</hi> Yea, and <hi>ſufficient</hi> in their kind?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How doth it follow that the <hi>Remedy</hi> was not Univerſal, when <hi>Redemption</hi> by <hi>Chriſt was univerſal?</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſo far</hi> died for all men, as by his death he procured them any Grace. But he procured <hi>Grace</hi> (though not <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Grace) for all:</hi> You confeſs an <hi>univerſal Grace,</hi> and yet an <hi>inequallity</hi> of <hi>benefits:</hi> we ſay, that Grace was procured by Chriſt: Do we <hi>narrow</hi> it at all, by ſaying, <hi>Chriſt procured it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, I perceive ſome mens miſ-explication of theſe things was your ſnare and ſcandal. Firſt, We diſtinguiſh between Chriſts procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our pardon and ſalvation by his <hi>ſacrifice and merit with God,</hi> and Chriſt as the <hi>object of mans faith,</hi> or as <hi>Believed in</hi> by man. We do not make the <hi>latter</hi> ſo univerſally neceſſary as the <hi>former.</hi> For we hold that <hi>Infants</hi> are ſaved, that believe not. But we hold that no one is ſaved for whom Chriſt did not ſatisfie Gods Juſtice and merit ſalvation. Secondly, And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97215:46"/>
that this much cauſleſsly offend you not, we ſay, That this ſatisfaction and merit conſiſteth not in an <hi>identity</hi> or gradual proportion of Chriſts pains or ſufferings to all mankinds, but in an <hi>Aptitude</hi> of his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to attain the ends of God the ſovoraign of the world, (the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of his truth, holineſs and right couſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> together with <hi>triumphant love and mercy)</hi> better than the remedileſs damnation of all the ſinning world would have done. Read but Maſter <hi>Trumans Great Propitiation,</hi> which ſheweth you the true ends of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt, and this unjuſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence will vaniſh. Thirdly, And we maintain (as is ſaid) that the merit and Propitiation wrought by Chriſt, is not to make our <hi>Repentance needleſs;</hi> But to <hi>procure</hi> it, and to make it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to its ends. <hi>He giveth us Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and Remiſſion of ſins. You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that we may and muſt make a <hi>New Covenant</hi> with God upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: In that Covenant <hi>God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth</hi> us Grace, as <hi>we conſent</hi> to be his ſervants and children. Now if Chriſt did <hi>procure</hi> (and as Gods Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97215:46"/>
Adminiſtrator) <hi>Give</hi> us that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of pardon and ſalvation to the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Penitent,</hi> doth not this <hi>more</hi> oblige us to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and not <hi>leſs?</hi> And the <hi>merit</hi> of Repentance (if you will ſo call it with the Ancients) is quite of another order, rank and nature than the merit of Chriſt. Its one thing for the Innocent ſon of God to merit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and pardon to all that will Repent; And another thing by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting (through his grace) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Condition of the further Grace of pardon or ſalvation. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, And yet further to heal your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt offence, we do not hold that Chriſt maketh God <hi>more merciful</hi> than he was, or that his Redemption is the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> of our recovery and ſalvation, cauſing God to be <hi>willing,</hi> who was unwilling before: But that <hi>Gods love</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> and his <hi>own good will</hi> is the <hi>firſt cauſe,</hi> which gave us Chriſt for a Redeemer as a <hi>ſecond cauſe,</hi> an effect of his love, and the Head of all the <hi>means</hi> of our Recovery; and the true meriting cauſe of that Grace and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which God will give us. Nor ſo meriting as to <hi>change God,</hi> but ſo
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97215:47"/>
meriting as to remove the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his grace as to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and as to become the <hi>ſitteſt Inſtrument of the Fathers love and mercy,</hi> by whom to Govern the lapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, and to communicate grace and life to ſinners. Fifthly, And yet fullier to ſatisfie your objection, we hold that. <hi>All mankind is brought by Chriſt under a Covenant of Grace,</hi> which is not vain, nor repealed by God; but as their abuſe of the Grace of the Covenant may caſt them out. For as a Covenant of <hi>Entire Nature</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency</hi> was made with <hi>all mankind</hi> in <hi>Innocent Adam;</hi> ſo a Covenant of <hi>Grace</hi> was made with <hi>all mankind</hi> in <hi>Lapſed Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſeed:</hi> and renewed again with <hi>all mankind in Noah.</hi> No man can prove either a <hi>limitation</hi> of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>ſome,</hi> (till the reſt by violating it become the Serpents ſeed, at leaſt) nor yet that ever God did <hi>abrogate</hi> it, as it was made to all the world. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, And we further acquaint you, that it was not the <hi>exiſtent humanity</hi> of Chriſt, that procured Grace and Life to the world, for thoſe (about) 4000
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97215:47"/>
years before his Incarnation. The meer <hi>Decree and Promiſe</hi> did ſerve for mans ſalvation all that time, without the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of his Humanity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, Therefore when you grant a neceſſity of Believing <hi>in God, as merciful,</hi> you muſt needs include <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Divine ſubſiſtence, for you muſt needs grant that the eternal <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>wiſdome</hi> of God, muſt be the fountain and <hi>determiner</hi> of all thoſe means by which his Love and <hi>mercy</hi> would communicate recovering grace and life to man. You will not <hi>divide God</hi> as the object of our faith, and leave out the <hi>wiſdome</hi> that muſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage all. Eighthly, And yet further to remove your ſcandal, we maintain that the Jews themſelves were not bound to believe many that are now Articles of our Faith <hi>(that Chriſt was born of the Virgin Mary, ſuffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried, deſcended to hades, and roſe again the third day)</hi> And that his very death and reſurrection, were not believed by his own Apoſtles till he was riſen. Nor underſtood they the Article of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. So that before a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97215:48"/>
belief in the Meſſiah did ſerve the Jews themſelves; That all this is ſo we are ſatisfied by this evidence. Firſt, By the ſilence of the Old Teſtament in the Matter, giving us no proof that ordinary (much leſs <hi>all)</hi> believers, had ſuch a particular knowledge of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt: And what is not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is not to be believed. Secondly, From <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Where faith is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed (as in its latitude) to be the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things hoped for, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that God is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, and a looking for a better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and for a City that hath founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whoſe builder and maker is God and a believing the word and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, &amp;c. And the Holy Ghoſt when he purpoſely deſcribeth the faith which the ancients had been ſaved by, would never have left out the chief or any eſſential part. The ſame I ſay of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. and 5. 1, 6, 7. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2 &amp;c. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Text expreſly telleth us. Firſt, Of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection, and conſequently the offering himſelf
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97215:48"/>
a ſacrifice for ſin, and ranſom for the world, and dying for us, that the Apoſtles themſelves were ignorant of it till after his Reſurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21, 22. When <hi>Chriſt told them that he muſt be killed and raiſed again the third day, Peter took him, and began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee Lord, This ſhall not be unto thee,</hi> Luke 9. 44, 45. <hi>The ſon of man ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the hands of men: But they underſtood not this ſaying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not.</hi> Again, Luke 18. 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>All things written in the Prophets concerning the ſon of man ſhall be accompliſhed, for he ſhall be delivered to the Gentiles, and be mocked, and ſpitefully intreated and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it on, and they ſhall ſcourge him and put him to death, and the third day he ſhall riſe again. And they underſtood none of theſe things, and this ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were ſpoken:</hi> So Mark 9. 32. Luke 24. 21, 25, 26. <hi>We truſted this had been he that ſhould have Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iſrael-O fools and ſlow of heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that the Prophets have ſpoken, ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:97215:49"/>
                  <hi>things and to enter into his Glory: And beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, he expounded to them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelf.</hi> Here you ſee that they knew not that he muſt die for our ſins,, riſe again and aſcend to Glory: And that it is no proof that all that were juſtified before underſtood theſe things, becauſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets had foretold them; For the Apoſtles themſelves underſtood it not in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. Secondly, They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not aright the doctrine of his <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> and that he muſt go to the Father and then be their high Prieſt, and that they muſt come to God by him, and ask in his name. For it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 16. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Now I go my way to him that ſent me, and none of you ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me whither goeſt thou? but becauſe I have ſaid theſe things to you, ſorrow hath filled your hearts—but it is expedient for you that I go away.</hi> v. 24. <hi>Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ye have asked nothing in my name,</hi> v. 26. <hi>At that day ye ſhall ask in my name.</hi> As for them that ſay that the Apoſtles knew that they were to come to God onely by a Mediator (as all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97215:49"/>
did of old) but yet they knew not that they muſt come to him <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> and in his name. Firſt, There was no Mediator exiſtent but God before the Incarnation, though there was <hi>to be a Mediator</hi> after. Seconnly, This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth that the Apoſtles knew not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to be the Chriſt, and that they went to God by ſome other Mediator, which are both falſe. Thirdly, And if by <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi> be meant the ſatisfactory price of his Sacrifice, they knew not that he was to die and to be a Sacrifice for Sin. Fourthly, And it is plain that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not rightly the nature of his <hi>ſpiritual Kingdome</hi> and <hi>Reign;</hi> But had got an opinion of an Earthly Kingdom for the Jews deliverance and exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that Chriſt abideth for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 34. in oppoſition to his heavenly abode was then a common opinion, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. We hoped this had been he that ſhould have redeemed <hi>Iſrael:</hi> one would have ſat on his right hand and another on his left: and they ſtrove who ſhould be greateſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. Lord wilt thou at this thime reſtore the Kingdome to <hi>Iſrael? Jeh.</hi> 16. When the Advocate was to be ſent he was to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97215:50"/>
teach them all things, and to teſtifie of Chriſt, and to convince the world of <hi>the ſin of their unbelief,</hi> and of the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of Chriſt, and of his <hi>Judgment</hi> or <hi>Kingdome</hi> and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as conſiſting <hi>(quoad exercitium)</hi> in the debellation or dejection of the Kingdome of Satan, and deſtroying the works of the Devil. By all which (and much more) it appeareth that the Apoſtles, (though then in a ſtate of Juſtification,) had a very general and defective knowledge of the Office of Chriſt; and that though his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office was ordinarily believed <hi>(Joh.</hi> 4. The <hi>Samaritane</hi> woman could ſay, when the Meſſiah cometh, he will tell us all things) and a temporal Kingdom expected, yet his <hi>ſpiritual Kingdom,</hi> and eſpecially his <hi>Prieſtly office,</hi> by his <hi>ſacrifice, death, reſurrection, heavenly interceſſion</hi> (for all the old Types and Sacrifices) was little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Diſciples. Yea, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſorbad them and others to tell men that <hi>he was the Chriſt,</hi> becauſe the great evidences of his <hi>Reſurrection, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion and Spirit,</hi> by which it was to be evinced, were yet to come. And
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97215:50"/>
we believe not that all that were ſaved before, had more knowledge than the Apoſtles, ſo that though all the faithful Jews believed in the <hi>promiſed ſeed,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as one that was to be ſent to be their Deliverer and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, yet it was by a ſaith that was very general, and far from that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs, which after the Reſurrection of Chriſt was required, of all to whom the Goſpel was promuglate, which I have ſaid the more of to you, leſt you think that we hold what we do not, and ſo take occaſion to erre by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us to err, <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Juſtin Martyr, Arnobius, Lactantius.</hi> and other old Chriſtians do go yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then yet I have conceded to you.</p>
               <p>And our very learned Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> doth argue that God could have ſaved the world without a Redeemer if he had pleaſed, becauſe he ſaved the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful under the old Teſtament without any exiſtent Mediator (except God himſelf) or any exiſtent ſacrifice or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or intercſſion of him, and becauſe he ſaveth Infants without faith. But for the firſt I take it to be at beſt too great temerity or audacity to diſpute
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97215:51"/>
whether God could have done things <hi>better</hi> or <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> which he has done ſo well: (of which I have ſaid more in my Premonition before my Treatiſe, called the <hi>unreaſonableneſs of Infidelity.</hi> (Though I know that <hi>Wallaeus,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other learned Proteſtants ſay the ſame.) And as for <hi>Infants</hi> they are not ſaved without the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> though they know him not; nor are they in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant without the faith of their <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>Owners,</hi> which is as their own. And if the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Prorphets</hi> be called the <hi>Spirt of Chrict,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 11. And the <hi>reproach of Moſes</hi> was the <hi>reproach</hi> of Chriſt <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. We may much more conclude of the ordinary Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before his coming, that Chriſts <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> and his <hi>Spirits operations</hi> and <hi>help,</hi> extended much further than mens <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> of him, his undertaking and his future work. No doubt but the eternal <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that had undertaken mans Redemption, and thereupon was our Lord Redeemer, gave even to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Plato, Cicero, Seneca, Antonine, Epistotus, Plutarch,</hi> &amp;c. What light and mercy they had, though they

underſtood not well from whom or upon what grounds they had them.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, And alſo we hold that the Jews were not the whole of Gods Kingdome or Church of Redeemed ones in the world (as I have fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved elſewhere,) But that as the Gove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made with all mankind, ſo amongſt them God-had other Servants beſides the Jews; Though it was <hi>they</hi> that had the <hi>extraordinary benediction</hi> of being his <hi>peculiar ſacred People.</hi> Tenthly, And we hold that as the Jews had by Promiſes, Propheſies and Types, <hi>more means</hi> to know God and the Meſſiah to come than other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo they were anſwerably oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>more knowledge and faith</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations were, that had not, nor could have, their means.</p>
               <p>If then <hi>all the world</hi> be under the <hi>first Covenant</hi> of Grace, and if you confeſs this to proceed from the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God, and that men are bound ſo to believe, and if Chriſt ſince his Incarnation hath dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed none of the mercies of God to the world, but rather greatly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and ſo where the Goſpel is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97215:52"/>
not preached, nor cannot be had, they that refuſe it not, are in no worſe caſe than they were before, how can you ſay that <hi>they are Remedileſs,</hi> if Chriſt be the ranſome and remedy?</p>
               <p>We know that all men partake of a great deal of mercy from God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the notorious demerit of their ſin. We know that this mercy telleth them aloud, that God dealeth not with them according to the firſt Law of Innocency; They <hi>ſee</hi> he pardoneth them, they <hi>feel</hi> that he pardoneth them in part; that is, that he uſeth them not as they deſerve. We know that all this mercy obligeth them to hope, that he will yet be further merciful; and to repentance, obedience, thankfulneſs and love. We know that the Heathen are no left as the Divels, without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but all the Nations are under Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine obligations, to uſe certain means, which have a tendency to their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: And we know that God biddeth no man to uſe his means in vain.</p>

Chriſtian Doctrine of the way of mans ſalvation, <hi>for the firſt</hi> 4000 <hi>years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Incarnation</hi> of our Lord?

The <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Divine Vital Active Power,</hi> was eminently glorified in the <hi>Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Divine wiſdome</hi> is eminently glorified in the making of the <hi>Remedying Medicine;</hi> And the

                  <hi>Divine Love</hi> and Spirit is eminently glorified in the operation of it, to the <hi>Health</hi> and Salvation of the Soul.

And all together will be glorified in our glorification.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And if it be the terms of life that do offend you. Firſt, It is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the terms of ſatisfying the Juſtice of God. Secondly, Or the terms of conveying the benefits to man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the firſt, there is nothing in it, to give offence. For we dream not of any extrinſecal agent or action (much leſs that which was not exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent till 4000 years after) having any proper caſuality to change Gods mind or will; The ſum of the Chriſtian Doctrine about the Interpoſition and <hi>Redemption</hi> by the <hi>Son,</hi> for man upon his fall, is but this; As if God ſhould ſay <hi>I will not deſtroy or damn ſinful man remedileſly, according to the ſtrict termes of the Law of Innocency which he hath broken; but will give him a remedying Covenant of Grace; becauſe I will in</hi>

                  <hi>the fulneſs of Time, provide better for the glorifying of my Truth and Holineſs, wiſdome and goodneſs, juſtice and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than the remedileſs deſtruction of mankind would do; even by the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doctrine, ſacrifice, merits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the eternal word.]</hi> So that this <hi>grand work of God</hi> is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate works:</hi> but not the <hi>cauſe</hi> of any <hi>real</hi> (but only <hi>relative</hi> or <hi>denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) mutation in himſelf.</hi> This all ſound Chriſtians are agreed in; And can this offend you?</p>
               <p>Secondly, And for the <hi>termes</hi> of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> of Grace to man, it is either Firſt, <hi>The New Covenant</hi> as a Gift of pardon and life, Secondly, Or the <hi>conditions</hi> which it requireth of man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The former you neither do find fault with nor can do (That God ſhould give the world a Recovering and pardoning Law.) Secondly, The ſecond is all that is here liable to your exception. And what do you think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in that?

                  <hi>as pardoning ſin,</hi> is required of man for that alſo you plead for.</p>
               <p>But you would have <hi>his goodneſs and mercy to be a ſufficient ſatisfaction to his Justice? Anſw.</hi> Firſt, I hope you will not exclude his <hi>wiſdome,</hi> becauſe you abhorre Atheiſm as folly. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, And I hope you will diſtinguiſh <hi>between,</hi> the <hi>prime ſatisfying Cauſe,</hi> and the <hi>ſatisfying means;</hi> Theſe plainly differ. The <hi>prime ſatisfying Cauſe is Gods wiſdome</hi> contriving and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fitteſt way to <hi>communicate</hi> his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>ſpirit.</hi> But the <hi>prime ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying means</hi> is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was to do that which was fitteſt to attain the foreſaid ends.</p>
               <p>But that which you will accept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt is, that the <hi>Belief in Chriſts fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture incarnation was made then neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation. Anſw.</hi> Firſt, See that you feign not the Chriſtian Doctrine to ſay more of this than indeed it doth, which I have opened to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I told you how narrow the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles own faith was before Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. We know that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews, knew not ſo much as <hi>they,</hi> nor ſo much as the Prophets, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97215:56"/>
more illuminated men: And we know that the reſt <hi>of the world</hi> had not ſo full a revelation as the <hi>Jews.</hi> But we know that all that had the notice of his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> were to believe the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And thoſe that had not the <hi>word of promiſe</hi> made known to them, had the <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of <hi>many ſuch mercies</hi> as that <hi>promiſe</hi> gave, and as intimated much of the ſame grace which the <hi>promiſe</hi> did: Thefore none could be bound to leſsthan to believe, that <hi>God of his mercy would pardon ſin and ſave penitent Believers, by ſuch a means of ſecuring the honour of his holineſs, truth and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as his infinite wiſdome ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide.</hi> This much you cannot deny. And that the <hi>promiſe of the Victorious ſeed</hi> (though it ſeem too obſcure to bind men to ſo diſtinct a faith, as ours is) was by Tradition told to <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, and that they had a General belief of ſuch an expiation for ſome time, ſeemeth intimated in the <hi>early</hi> and almoſt <hi>univerſal</hi> uſe of <hi>ſacrificing,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak more anon. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto then I have vindicated the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine of mans ſalvation for the firſt 4000 years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:97215:57"/>
Secondly, And is there any thing ſince which ſhould make it more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to you? Firſt, As to the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> I have ſaid enough in my Treatiſe (the Reaſon of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.) Verily I think it far harder to confute thoſe that feign <hi>all the world to be animated by God as the univerſal Soul, and to conceive how God,</hi> who is moſt intimate to all things, in whom we live, and <hi>move</hi> and <hi>are,</hi> ſhould not be as <hi>neerly united</hi> to all things, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians believe him to be to the humane nature of Chriſt (though undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not ſo) than that he ſhould have that <hi>neer union with his humane nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, And as to Chriſts work, I have ſo largely ſhewed you the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, the reaſonableneſs and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical congruities that I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them. In a word, The New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is the Doctrine of the eternal <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>wiſdome or word of God Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to communicate the Divine Spirit, and love to man, to be a ſacrifice for ſin, the Conqueror of Satan, Death and Sin, the Head over All things to the Church, the Author of Redemption, the grand</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:97215:57"/>
                  <hi>Administrator of the new Covenant, the Reconciler and Reſtorer of man to God, the Teacher, Ruler and High Preiſt of the Church, in order to this our Restorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, But if it be the <hi>Time</hi> of his coming that doth offend you, I have anſwered that, and further adde. Firſt, What is there in fooliſh man that ſhould encourage him to dream, that he better knoweth the fitteſt ſeaſon for Gods works, than God himſelf. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Man was not all the while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without the <hi>Benefits</hi> of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigned and undertaken Redemption: He was ſtill under a Covenant of Grace. Thirdly, Conſider well that God did not intend to give mankind that had ſo heinouſly ſinned (by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Devils word before his,) a <hi>preſent</hi> and a <hi>perfect pardon,</hi> but onely to give a new Law and Covenant which ſhould be a conditional gift of pardon, to be obteined in full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in time, and by degrees, we had made our ſelves voluntarily the Slaves of Satan: And God would not deliver us all at once. We had forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heavenly aſſiſtance of the holy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97215:58"/>
ſpirit, and God would not give it us all at once. Mans time of healing the wounds of his own ſin is the time of this life: and the perfect cure will not be done till our entrance into the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect world. And as it is with <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual</hi> men, ſo it is with the <hi>world of all mankind. Grace</hi> mitateth <hi>nature</hi> and doth all by degrees, darker Revelations were meeter for the Infancy of the world, and <hi>clearer at noon day,</hi> and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per knowledge fitter for its maturity. And when Satan by Divine permiſſion had plai'd his part, and ſeemed to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the ſinful world, it was time for Chriſt to come, by <hi>Power, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> meanly cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to caſt down his Temples and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, to ſubſidue his Kingdoms, and to triumph over the Triumpher.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, But if it be the <hi>preſent conditions</hi> of the <hi>new Covenant</hi> ſince Chriſts Reſurrection, that offendeth you, <hi>viz,</hi> that the world is required to believe in him, I have anſwered that, and now adde. Firſt, Remember what I ſaid before, that <hi>no mans condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made worſe by Chriſt,</hi> than it was <hi>before his incarnation.</hi> They that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97215:58"/>
neither <hi>have</hi> nor <hi>could have</hi> the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace</hi> in the <hi>laſt edition,</hi> are under it as they <hi>were before</hi> in the <hi>firſt edition,</hi> further than as their after ſins have deprived them of any of its benefits. Therefore the coming of Chriſt hath not <hi>narrowed the Church,</hi> nor repealed or diminiſhed any grace that before was given, but added much more. Secondly, When there was <hi>more Grace</hi> to be given, it was needful that the <hi>Condition</hi> ſhould be ſuited to it. Would you rather be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Graces</hi> and benefits, than be obliged to <hi>Believe:</hi> would you be cured by one that you would not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> nor take for your Phyſician? would you be <hi>taught</hi> by one that you will not <hi>believe</hi> or take for your Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? would you be <hi>ruled</hi> by one that you will not believe is your Ruler? IInd I have proved to you, that God bideth no man believe either without a <hi>meet object,</hi> or <hi>meet evidence</hi> of the <hi>credibility,</hi> yea the certain verity of that which he is commanded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And the belief required of us, is but a <hi>means</hi> to our love of God and our belief of the everlaſting glory,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97215:59"/>
and conſequently is needful to our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duty, to our perfection and our felicity. Do you not think your ſelf, that the greateſt demonſtrations of the Divine Love, are fitteſt to breed Love in us to God? And is not this wonderful work of mans Redemption a wonderful demonſtration of Gods Love; If you ſay that it is <hi>incredible</hi> becauſe <hi>wonderful</hi> and <hi>incomprehenſible,</hi> I anſwer you, It is the <hi>more credible</hi> becauſe ſo <hi>wonderful.</hi> I cannot believe that any thing is a work of God, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially one of his <hi>great tranſcendent works</hi> which mortal man can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. The work of the <hi>Father</hi> and of <hi>Omnipotency</hi> in <hi>Creation</hi> is <hi>wonderfully;</hi> will you therefore ſay that there is no <hi>world?</hi> The <hi>work</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Regeneration</hi> is wonderful, &amp;c. eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our <hi>perfection</hi> in Glory. And will you ſay therefore that there is no <hi>Sanctification</hi> or <hi>Glorification?</hi> ſo the work of the <hi>Son and Divine wiſdome and word incarnate</hi> is wonderful; And it is the fitter to be thought a <hi>work of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And would you not ſay your ſelf
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97215:59"/>
that if God ſhould ſend an Angel from Heaven, to tell you his will, and tell you what is good and evil, and to tell you the certainty of the life to come and the Joyes thereof, would it not be a ſingular help to your <hi>Belief</hi> of all theſe things revealed, if he did but give you ſufficient proof that he is ſent of God? What perverſneſs is it then to quarrel with Gods greateſt mercy as incredible, meerly becauſe it is wonderful and great, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit for God to give. Thefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here the error of thoſe men, that overlook the <hi>Benefit,</hi> and taking all <hi>Duty</hi> for a <hi>Burden</hi> diſpute againſt the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the <hi>Duty:</hi> whereas all our <hi>Duty</hi> is our <hi>Benefit,</hi> like the duty of <hi>feaſting, rejoycing, receiving</hi> money or honour when given us? And the true ſtate of our Queſtion ſhould be, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all they that by the Goſpel have the offer of a Saviour and Salvation, and all thoſe treaſures of mercy which are brought to mankind by Chriſt above what they had before his incarnation, are bound to believe that procurement and offer, and to accept ſo great a gift?</hi> When the ſame men that queſtion this, can be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97215:60"/>
willing to accept of wealth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, without diſputing whether they may not live without them, and will ſay, <hi>Quis inſimentis inops oblatum reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puit aurum?</hi> And he that can make a ſorry ſhift with a Candle, will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute whether it be his duty to open his Windows &amp; let in the light of the Sun; It is Riches of Mercy which all they diſpute againſt, who think they ſpeak againſt the neceſſity of ſome difficult duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And remember again that your ſelf confeſs an <hi>Inequality</hi> of Gods <hi>Benefits,</hi> and that he is not bound to give them to all alike, though there were no inequality of demerit in the Receivers, If then he give <hi>more to the Church</hi> by <hi>Chriſt Incarnate,</hi> then he did before his Incarnation, or more than he giveth to the <hi>world</hi> that never hear the Goſpel, <hi>their Eye</hi> ſhould not be evil becauſe he is good; much leſs <hi>ours</hi> who receive the benefit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And I am glad that all that you require of God for <hi>All the world,</hi> is but that their Salvation or Damnation may be brought to their own <hi>free choice,</hi> and not their perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97215:60"/>
be a thing unavoidable by Gods meer will, without their culpable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chooſing. And all this we maintain as well as you: And you can never prove that the Chriſtian Religion doth deny it. Nay tell me if you can what <hi>mercy your doctrine</hi> giveth to <hi>all the world,</hi> which <hi>ours</hi> giveth them not? Do <hi>you</hi> ſay that they are not under the <hi>meer Law</hi> of <hi>Innocency</hi> made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> but under the <hi>Law of grace,</hi> which after was given him? ſo do we. But you ſay, that this <hi>Law of Grace is the Law of Nature?</hi> Let not <hi>names</hi> abuſe us: It is not the Law of <hi>Innocent Nature:</hi> But it is ſo fitted to mans <hi>Lapſed State,</hi> and doth alſo ſo fitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>Gracious Nature of God,</hi> and alſo hath ſuch evidences in Gods <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful providence</hi> and dealing with the ſinful world, that in all theſe reſpects, if you call it the Law of Lapſed and <hi>reprieved nature under its reparation,</hi> we will not contend about the name.</p>
               <p>But you ſay that all men may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if they reject not their ſalvation: ſo ſay we, that all ſhould be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that means and Law that is given them, their Conſciences accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

or excuſing them in the day when Chriſt ſhall judge the world, as the Goſpel telleth us. And none periſh now for the meer ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> nor meerly for want of the Innocency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the firſt Law; but for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing and abuſing ſome mercy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt, which had an apt tendency to their Repentance and Recovery.</p>
               <p>But you lay the main ſtreſs on this, that <hi>All men may be ſaved by true ſaith in God and true Repentance without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in</hi> a Crucified Chriſt. And <hi>we ſay</hi> that no man in the world ſhall periſh that hath <hi>true faith</hi> in <hi>God</hi> and true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> For all ſuch do <hi>Love God as God,</hi> and do devote themſelves to his glory, to obedience and Love: and do hate ſin as ſin; and ſo are holy. And God cannot caſt that Soul into Hell that loveth him and beareth his Image. Holineſs hath ſo much of God and Heaven in it, that this would be to caſt Heaven and Gods Image into Hell, and to jumble Heaven and Hell together. Do we not then grant you as much as you can reaſonably deſire. Tell us but what Heathens or Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97215:61"/>
are <hi>Holy, truly penitent for all ſin, and devoted to God in obedience and love,</hi> and we will grant you that they ſhall all be ſaved.</p>
               <p>But you were ware that we would tell you that this Repentance and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not a thing, which ſinful man is ſo eaſily brought to: And therefore the Queſtion muſt be, <hi>whether really theſe Heathens do truly Repent and Love God as God or not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Here you may perceive that though before you did but require that ſalvation be brought down to the Sinners choice, yet now that will not ſerve the turn: Yea, though <hi>Faith in God, and true repentance</hi> were the terms that you were ſatisfied ſhould be impoſed on all, yet now you are loth to ſtand to that, unleſs we grant that all theſe men have the <hi>power</hi> ſo to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive</hi> and <hi>repent.</hi> Well if by <hi>power</hi> you mean a <hi>Natural faculty</hi> we grant that they have the power of <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Uolition.</hi> And if it be the <hi>object</hi> that is in queſtion, we grant that the <hi>object</hi> of that <hi>Faith and Repentance</hi> which you mention your ſelf is certain and exiſtent; And if it be the <hi>evidence</hi> of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97215:62"/>
the <hi>object</hi> that is in queſtion, we grant that the <hi>Being, Power, Wiſdome, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Holineſs, Truth, Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God,</hi> are revealed to manking, by an evidence ſufficient in its kin, if their ſouls be but rightly diſpoſed to receive it: And that <hi>ſin</hi> to be <hi>repented</hi> of, is diſcernable in themſelves is doubtleſs. <hi>Amyraldus</hi> largely labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to prove, that as God bindeth no man to natural impoſſibilities, that is, to any Act without, Firſt, A <hi>faculty</hi> that can do it.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as would procure their felicity if duly apprehended. See alſo Mr. <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Treatiſe of Natural and Moral Impotency.</p>

But <hi>indeed</hi> when all is done, the wit of man that is offended with God, as if he gave not all men a <hi>power</hi> to be <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> will not be ſatisfied if that be granted, unleſs alſo he actually ſave them. Should we grant you all the reſt, if ſome yet <hi>are damned,</hi> when God <hi>could have</hi> ſaved them, it will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them that will be above God, and will judge their Judge.</p>
               <p>But becauſe you ſeem ſatisfied with leſs, ſuppoſe all the queſtion come to this, <hi>Whether or no thoſe that never had the Gospei, do ever come without it to true faith in God, and true repentance and ſo to be ſaved?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, And when we have granted you what you firſt deſired, that none periſh but thoſe that are <hi>willfully impenitent and believe not truly in God,</hi> why muſt the controverſie be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mens <hi>hearts,</hi> and <hi>acts.</hi> I can read <hi>Gods Law,</hi> but I cannot know or read the <hi>hearts</hi> of millions whom I never ſaw. Muſt I be obliged to know the thoughts of every man in <hi>China, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Japan,</hi> or the <hi>Antipodes?</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, What <hi>number</hi> is it that you put the queſtion of, and whoſe <hi>Repentance</hi> you
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97215:63"/>
aſſert? Is it <hi>All</hi> or but <hi>ſome?</hi> If <hi>All,</hi> he muſt be mad that believeth it, that <hi>All men are true penitent Belivers in God.</hi> If but <hi>ſome,</hi> Firſt, Would not your wit quarrel ſtill with God for damning all the reſt? Secondly, And muſt it be the <hi>greater</hi> part or the <hi>leſſer?</hi> or would you know on what number or where to find ſatisfaction? And what have we to do to judge anothers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: To their own Maſter they ſtand or fall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And methinks you ſhould eaſily grant at <hi>leaſt,</hi> Firſt, That <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> is <hi>far eaſier</hi> to them that have the Goſpel, than to them that never heard it. Secondly, And that they are far more <hi>common.</hi> And ſo that <hi>far more Chriſtians</hi> are <hi>holy and ſaved</hi> than of others. For, Firſt, Tell me; If God ſhould ſend an Angel from Heaven as aforeſaid, with mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous evidence of his miſſion, to call men to repentance and belief in God, and Glory, would it not be eaſier for thoſe men to repent, than for others? Nay would not you the eaſilier believe in Chriſt your ſelf if you had but ſuch an Angel to confirm you? why then
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97215:63"/>
ſhould not the word of Chriſt, who by his Miracles, Reſurrection and the donation of ſuch a Spirit to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, proved his miſſion from the Father, be a help to our Faith and Repentance. Eſpecially when his word hath a ſelf evidencing Light alſo in the Image and ſuperſcription of God upon it. Secondly, You will not deny but that the difference of common lower means, doth make Repentance much eaſier or harder to one than another. Take one man that is born in <hi>Braſile</hi> or <hi>Soldania</hi> or among any other ſavage People; or that is bred up in a Tavern, Ale-houſe or Whore-houſe, or Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe, among thoſe that make a ſcorn of godlineſs; and take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is bred up to Learning, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Godlineſs, among them that by doctrine and example do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and command a godly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſober life. And hath not one of theſe abundance more hinderances to his Repentance than the other. Thirdly, And will not <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> make you certain that the Chriſtian part of the world, hath
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97215:64"/>
more ſuch helps than all the reſt. Is there not more Reaſon, Learning, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, Doctrine, all ſorts of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there than among the reſt. Were it but that Chriſtianity hath furniſhed the World with more <hi>helps</hi> to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> the caſe were clear. Fourthly, And a little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the World, and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of it, may fully ſatisfie you, that <hi>de facto,</hi> there are actually far more <hi>knowing, penitent, holy Perſons</hi> among Chriſtians than among any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. When therefore the fact it ſelf is undeniable, and we ſee that more Souls are <hi>healed</hi> by Chriſt in the Church, than in the World without, what need we any greater evidence.</p>
               <p>And if there were no more in it than this, that the actual knowledge or belief of Chriſt incarnate, doth make ſo great an addition to the helps and hopes of Sinners, and maketh <hi>converſion</hi> from ſin to God, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo much more <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>common</hi> (as <hi>Aquinas Cont. Gent.</hi> argueth ſhould not this be received with the greateſt thankfulneſs, rather than with unreverent arrogant Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:97215:64"/>
But I proceed to overthrow your Fundamental Error <hi>[That repentance alone with the mercy of God is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſatisfaction for our ſins to divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, If it be but proved that <hi>de facto</hi> God hath required and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for ſatisfaction, then you cannot call <hi>Repentance alone</hi> ſufficient. But this is proved fully.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the great work of our Redemption by Chriſt, have all thoſe bleſſed ends, tendencies and effects and bring all thoſe benefits to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which in the treat forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned I proved; If it was ſo actual a demonſtration of Gods wiſdom and love, of his holineſs and truth, his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> as is there mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted and proved; If it have brought men ſuch helps to Repentance and Holineſs as are forementioned, how perverſe will it be then to ſay that our <hi>Repentance</hi> was ſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> which did procure and behow it: How ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd is it to ſay that the Cure of our Diſeaſe is ſufficient for us, without

the Phyſician, the <hi>Medicine,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary,</hi> the <hi>Application,</hi> which we ſee by certain experience are the things that <hi>work</hi> this <hi>Cure.</hi> And which you your ſelf cannot deny but that they effect this Cure (of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Holineſs) far more <hi>eaſily and commonly</hi> than it is ever wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them? (Nay it is certain that the <hi>Grace of Chriſt,</hi> is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Repentance and holineſs in any one in the world, <hi>(whatſoever be thought of the neceſſity of the knowledge of Chriſt incarnate.)</hi>

               <p>Firſt, By all humane Laws and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.

Firſt, It would encourage the moſt in the world to live in all manner of wickedneſs: If the hearts of men are fully ſet in them to do evil, becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not <hi>ſpeedily executed</hi> but <hi>delayed;</hi> How much more, if they were ſure it ſhould <hi>never</hi> be executed?

Fifthly, And his mercy is ſo great, that through Chriſt he will forgive the <hi>eternal puniſhment,</hi> and will judge men as he <hi>findeth them,</hi> and not as they have <hi>been,</hi> before converſion: So that without Chriſt you cannot imagine how God ſhould neither ſend one to Hell or miſery that loveth him, and hath his Image; nor yet expoſe his Government, Laws, and the common good to ſo much miſchief, as the Proclamation of a pardon to all villanies that are but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of at laſt (alone) would cauſe.</p>

               <p>And that there are more <hi>Notitiae Communes</hi> about Religion than the five forenamed is eaſily manifeſted.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, To the laſt part firſt I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, in your converſe with men, you will think him unnatural, unſociable, mad, that will either <hi>believe all things or believe nothing.</hi> There is <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible</hi> truth, and there is <hi>incredible fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood:</hi> And will you beleive that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God ſaith all that every Lyar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth on him, or elſe that he never revealeth his will to mankind any otherwiſe than by his common works. When God hath made a Revelation of his Will to the World, the Devils uſual way of hindring the beleif of it is by <hi>imitation,</hi> and by putting ſuch names and colours on falſhood (by falſe Prophets) as God doth on the truth: Shall we therefore conclude that either all or none is the word of God. Or that God ſaith not true
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97215:71"/>
unleſs the Devil ſay true alſo. Secondly, And will you mark the groſs error of ſuch Reaſoners about the <hi>Notitiae Communes.</hi> Firſt, It is certain that no <hi>actual Knowledge (conceptive</hi> or <hi>intellectual Verity)</hi> is <hi>born</hi> in man, Infants know not theſe <hi>Common. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> at all. As the Eye is not born with the actual Species of all things afterward ſeen, but only with a ſeeing, power and diſpoſition; ſo theſe are called <hi>common Notions,</hi> becauſe mans intellect is ſo <hi>able</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to know them, as that they will be known eaſily upon the firſt due evidence or notification of the Object, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore almoſt all men know them. Secondly, It is certain that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty in man (as this noble Lord ſaith) requireth its proper conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for its true apprehenſion of the Object. Now ſome mens underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have the help of theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons far more than others have (he nameth to you the conditions him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.) Thirdly, It is certain that the underſtanding performs not all its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions at once or at firſt, but by degrees and in time as the Objects are
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97215:72"/>
duly preſented. As an Infant ſeeth not the firſt day all that ever he muſt ſee; nor a Schollar learneth not the firſt day all that he muſt learn. Fourthly, It is certain that the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> apprehenſions are as ſure, if not more clear then the firſt: As he that lived twenty years at home, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward travelleth to <hi>London,</hi> doth as certainly then ſee <hi>London</hi> as before he did his Fathers houſe; ſo a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar doth afterward as certainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Horace, Virgil</hi> or <hi>Homer,</hi> as at firſt he underſtood his Primmer. Fifthly, It is certain that as particular <hi>notices</hi> are multiplied <hi>quod actus</hi> in <hi>time</hi> by uſe and information, ſo the <hi>knowing diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>faculty</hi> is increaſed: And the notice of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand truths doth ſo advance the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and befreind other truths not yet received, that ſuch a man can know more afterward in a day, than an ignorant man can learn in a year. Sixthly, By all which it is a moſt evident thing, that to make <hi>common Notions</hi> to be the only certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is a weakneſs below a rational man: And it is to make the intellect
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97215:72"/>
of an Infant to be the ſtandard or meaſure of all certain intellectual ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and to make the Schollar even before he goeth to School as wiſe (as to certainties) as his Maſter and to make a new born Child to have ſeen as many Objects as <hi>Drake,</hi> or <hi>de Noort,</hi> or <hi>Sandys,</hi> or <hi>Ludovics Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> in all his travels. In a word the <hi>Notitiae Communes</hi> being the very loweſt degree of knowledge are thus equalled with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the greateſt Philoſopher or Divine or Judge: Was this learned Lord when he wrote this Book ſure of nothing, but theſe <hi>common Notions</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Religion. Seventhly, To which I might add that even in mens natural capacities, there is a wonderful dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: As Ideots know little, ſo Dullards not much: And muſt the wiſeſt go no higher than theſe. Eighthly, And will Lawyers, Stateſmen, Phyſicians, Philoſophers, make this conſent of all mankind, the teſt of all their certainties? If not, why ſhould we do ſo in our ſearch after the greateſt Verities, which are moſt worthy of all the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:97215:73"/>
Nothing viſible is ſo analogous to mans ſoul as fire. The nature of which is to be ever of an active illuminative and calefactive faculty; but doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etciſe it in ſuch various degrees as the fuel doth occaſion. There is fire in a flint or ſteel, yea in all things: But is it the beſt way to know what fire is and can do, by judging of it onely as it is in a ſtone? No: but take your ſteel and ſtrike the flint, and adde the combuſtible fuel, and that which is in a ſtone can ſet a City on fire? And <hi>nil agit quod agere non poteſt,</hi> whatever act is produced, proveth an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent power. So if you would judge what mans <hi>ſoul is,</hi> and can do, and what truth is in the Intellect, it is not in fools but in the wiſe that you muſt diſcern it.</p>
               <p>And by this thoſe may ſee their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who are tempted to think that mans ſoul is but highly ſenſitive and imaginative, or not made for <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> employments, becauſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ignorant and wicked people are otherwiſe diſpoſed: whereas the <hi>Power</hi> and ſo the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>mans</hi> ſoul is certainly gathered from what the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97215:73"/>
                  <hi>wiſest</hi> do attain: Becauſe nothing can <hi>act</hi> beyond its <hi>Power:</hi> And if the attainments and acts of <hi>ſome mens</hi> ſouls do prove ſuch a <hi>Power in them, all ſouls</hi> of men are of the ſame ſpecies, and therefore the reſt might attain it if they had the ſame objects, eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, excitations and improvements. I think all this is plain truth.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, And if by <hi>believing</hi> you will heartily give up your ſouls to Chriſt and his Spirit, you will find that there is yet a more excellent addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledg and certainty to be obtained than by all other means could be procured: At leaſt, as to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion</hi> and <hi>clearneſs</hi> of the Act, if not as to the <hi>extenſion</hi> of it to more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>

The Kingdom of God</hi> ſignifieth, Firſt, All that <hi>de jure</hi> are obliged to ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience; And ſo all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind on earth are of his Kingdome, even Rebels. Secondly, Or it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that <hi>conſent</hi> to <hi>ſubjection</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> and <hi>profeſs</hi> it: And theſe are Firſt, Such as profeſs ſubjection to God under ſome lame, defective, falſe conception; (as one that allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to worſhip Idols under him, or to live in wickedneſs, or one that Governeth not the world by a Law, or will not make a Retribution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, or as one that will pardon and ſave men, onely for their ſuperſtition or without a Saviour) And thus all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Heathens and Infidels are of

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, It is ſuppoſed that all that pretend to Propheſie and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not to be believed: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we muſt try the Spirits whether they be of God; and that all

Secondly, It muſt therefore next be underſtood, whether the Truth of the Goſpel be to be known as a <hi>ſimple term,</hi> or a <hi>ſelf evident propoſition,</hi> or as a <hi>true concluſion.</hi> Firſt, The firſt kind of knowledge onely apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>words and ſenſe;</hi> but not the <hi>Verity.</hi> It is the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Doctrine that we enquire of. Secondly, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divines aſſert the ſecond way, and ſay it is <hi>Principium indemonstrabile;</hi> Like <hi>[eſt vel non eſt:]</hi> Doubtleſs this is not true as to the <hi>Natural Evidence</hi> of the propoſition, principle or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

And I am perſwaded that this increaſed by more experience, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97215:76"/>
Love and inward guſts, doth hold moſt Chriſtians faſter to Chriſt, than naked reaſoning could do: And were it not for this unlearned ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were ſtill in danger of Apoſtaſie, by every ſubtile Caviller that aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. And I believe that all true Chriſtians have this kind of internal knowledge, from a ſuitableneſs of the Truth and Goodneſs of the Goſpel to their now quickned, illuminated ſanctified ſouls. Thirdly, But yet I believe that this is not All the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth of the Goſpel which we have: There is a <hi>common Belief</hi> of its truth by other means which moſt uſually <hi>goeth before</hi> this Generative ſpiritual reception and belief; uſually they that are converted to holineſs by the Goſpel are ſuch as had <hi>ſome Belief</hi> of it before, and not ſuch as took it to be falſe to that moment.

               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:97215:76"/>
Thirdly, The premiſes from which this concluſion is proved <hi>[The Goſpel is true]</hi> are both of them truths of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible evidence, viz. <hi>[Whatſoever doctrine is atteſted by ſo many and ſuch miracles extrinſecally, by the ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing impreſs of Divine Power Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſs intrinſecally, and by the effecting the like Impreſſion in holy Life, Light and Love on the ſouls of all ſincere receivers, is certainly true, being atteſted by the ſpirit of God: But ſuch is the doctrine of the Goſpel: Ergo it is true as atteſted by the ſpirit of God.</hi> I ſaid before the firſt is a natural Verity; The ſecond propoſition is partly of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and partly of internal and partly external experience, as is largely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.</p>
               <p>Now as to the Queſtion, Firſt, No doubt but our <hi>Natural faculties</hi> muſt be uſed in trying ſupernatural Truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No doubt he that diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with or preacheth to an unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo as to prove what he delivereth to be true, muſt deal with him upon ſome common principles which both parties are agreed in; or elſe there is no room for proof or for diſpute.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97215:79"/>
God: And yet the <hi>moral Evidence</hi> of truth which is in Gods word, when <hi>known</hi> to be his word, is as ſure as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>natural Evidence</hi> of the thing: There being the ſureſt natural evidence <hi>ab effect is</hi> at leaſt that there is <hi>a God moſt perfect, that cannot lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, The <hi>Eſſences</hi> of all things are but imperfectly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to us; The <hi>exiſtences</hi> of <hi>corporeal</hi> things that are <hi>preſent</hi> and duly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are fully evident. The <hi>exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence</hi> of things <hi>abſent</hi> beyond the reach of ſenſe, is evident only to the <hi>diſcurſive intellect;</hi> not by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate natural evidence of the things themſelves, but by a borrowed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from Cauſes or Signes; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe improving the Fundamental common truths, for the knowing of the reſt, by proving a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between them. The <hi>Praterition</hi> of things, and the <hi>Futurition,</hi> are both like the <hi>distant exiſtence,</hi> unknown to ſenſe, and the immediate appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the intellect; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt both be known alſo by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection as concluſions in diſcourſe, or not at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:97215:79"/>
Seventhly, Man was not born to know only things preſent in their <hi>exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence</hi> by ſenſe, but alſo to know <hi>things abſent,</hi> things as <hi>paſt,</hi> and things as <hi>future.</hi> And herein he chieſly differeth from a Bruit.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Though the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is moſt confident of things ſenſible &amp; preſent, yet about things <hi>abſent, paſt</hi> and <hi>future</hi> it oft doubteth more and is leſs ſatisfied in its own concluſions from <hi>natural</hi> principles, than from moral. Becauſe ſometimes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles themſelves (though not the firſt, yet the ſecond, or third) may be ſo obſcure as to leave the mind unſatisfied. Secondly, And the connexion among many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars may be obſcure and doubtful. Thirdly, And in the long <hi>Series</hi> of collection or arguing, the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſpecteth its own fallibility: ſo that when Concluſions are far fetcht, though from natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the mind may be ſtill in doubt about them. And on the contrary when in the way of Revelation the grounds are clear, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath fewer Collections
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97215:80"/>
to make and a ſhorter journey to go, it may be far better ſatisfied of the truth.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Mans own neceſſity is the reaſon why God doth give us ſupernatural Revelation, and call us to know by the way of <hi>Believing.</hi> For, Firſt, Moſt men are naturally dull. Secondly, Few have leiſure by Learning to improve their intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects. Thirdly, And fewer have leiſure &amp; diſpoſition to exerciſe them by long ſearches &amp; argumentation upon every thing that they ſhould know. Fourthly, And therefore where Revelation was not, few were wiſe or virtuous; And the Philoſophers themſelves were all to pieces among themſelves, and their diſagreements and doubtfulneſs tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the gulfe of utter Scepticiſme. Now as nothing is more neceſſary than Religion (as you well profeſs) ſo Religion conſiſteth very little in the ſenſible apprehenſion of of preſent exiſtences, but in the knowledge of things <hi>abſent</hi> or <hi>inſenſible things paſt,</hi> and <hi>eſpecially things to come,</hi> the <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> to be attained, and the <hi>miſery</hi> to be eſcaped. Now if all the Poor
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97215:80"/>
unlearned Men and Women in the World muſt have known all theſe things only by <hi>natural diſcourſe,</hi> how little <hi>Religion</hi> would have been in the World, when the Philoſophers knew ſo little themſelves. And though your learning and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the immortality of the Soul ſo clear to you and the rewards and puniſhments of another life, as that you number it with the <hi>common notices;</hi> yet were not the old Philoſophers themſelves, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly agreed on it as they ſhould have been; much leſs all the common People. And if you ſay that now almoſt all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth it, I anſwer it is Gods great mercy that it is ſo. But conſider whether it be not more by the way of believing, than of naturall inſtinct or knowledge. For all the Chriſtians, and all the Mahometans (who believe the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt alſo) take it by the way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. And ſo do moſt of the Heathens: The <hi>Japonians</hi> have their <hi>Amida</hi> and <hi>Zaca:</hi> The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:97215:81"/>
the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Siamenſes</hi> the <hi>Peguans,</hi> &amp;c. have all their Prophets: And the very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of all the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> (or <hi>America)</hi> have their Idols, Oracles or Wizards, whom they far more depend on than their natural diſcourſe about things <hi>Inviſible, Paſt</hi> or <hi>Future.</hi> So that really if <hi>Commonueſs</hi> go with you for a proof that any point is of <hi>natural inſtinct</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> as a <hi>Notitia Communis,</hi> this will be one of the chiefeſt of them, that <hi>[Religion conſiſting in the notice of, and due reſpect to things abſent, inviſible, paſt and future; is to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world by divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Faith, and not by the immediate evidence of things, nor by meer diſcurſive Collections from things ſo evident.]</hi> So that <hi>Mans weakneſs</hi> with the quality of the Objects maketh Revelation ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that without it, the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar (who are the main body of the World) would have next to no Religion; And on the contrary how eaſie and pleaſant, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97215:81"/>
is it for all theſe poor People (yea to the moſt learned) to have theſe myſterious truths brought by Revelation to their hands. Now through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, all our common People, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, Servants and day-Labourers, may know more with eaſe, than ever <hi>Democritus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus, Antiſthenes, Zeno,</hi> yea <hi>Socrates, Plato</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could reach by all their ſtudies to the laſt: More I ſay of Religious neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knowledge.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, And this being ſo <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> and ſo great a mercy to mankind, I wonder that you put it not among your <hi>common notices,</hi> that God being perfect in love and wiſdom, and having made man purpoſely to be <hi>Religious,</hi> here, and <hi>happy</hi> hereafter, will certainly provide for his <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> and ſo <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> a means as <hi>Revelation</hi> is, God being the Father and Lover of light and of Souls, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil being the Prince and Friend of darkneſs; Conſider whether
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97215:82"/>
you may not ſtrongly infer from the very nature of God, and the nature and neceſſity of man, and the other communications of Gods mercies to the world, that he will certainly give them this great mercy alſo.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, It is certain that God hath ways of communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light to mans underſtanding immediately and not only by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick ſenſible objects. The Father of Spirits who communicateth ſo much to the corporeal world, is not further from Souls, nor more out of love with them; But (if there be any difference) may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thought to hold a neerer more immediate communion with them than with Bodies, and to be himſelf to the mind, what the Sun is to the Eye, and more.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, It is certain that God <hi>can</hi> give the ſtanders by that have no Revelation immediately them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a fully ſatisfactory atteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or proof, of the truth of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Revelations. He that denyeth this, maketh God to be impotent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:97215:82"/>
Thirteenthly, It is certain that the Atteſtation which I deſcribed in the Reaſons of Chriſtian Religion was ſuch (ſuppoſing that ſuch were given, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Antecedent Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of fulfilled Propheſie, the Conſtitutive Teſtimony of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit apparent in the effects on <hi>Chriſt; perſon</hi> and on his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> And the <hi>Concomitant</hi> Teſtimony of all his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And the <hi>ſubſequent</hi> Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Spirit, on the Apoſtles, their Miracles and doctrine, and on the ſouls of all ſerious Chriſtians to the worlds end) Theſe are things (ſet all together) Firſt, Which none but God could do. Secondly, And which God would <hi>not do</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world; Thirdly, Yea, which God would not <hi>permit</hi> to be done to deceive them in ſo high a matter; Becauſe he is the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Omniſcient, Gracious Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the world; And if theſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies were not of God, it were impoſſible to know <hi>any</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to be of God; And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> have no ſurer, it would
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97215:83"/>
be mans Duty to Believe and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and be Ruled by a Lie. And if it be our <hi>Duty</hi> to Believe God to be ſo defective either in <hi>Power, Wiſdome</hi> or <hi>Goodneſſe, Holineſſe, Truth, Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Mercy</hi> as to rule the World, and the beſt of the World in the greateſt matters, by lying and deceit, as if he wanted better means: What Wit can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe any remedy againſt ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit as ſhall be ſo atteſted as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid? Or if deceit can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, how can it be mans <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to Believe it, ſeeing mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect is naturally made for Truth, and abhorreth falſhood? And how can it be Good to Obey Deceit and Lyes? And when the Devil is the Father of Lies, what blaſphemy is it to charge them on God? By this it will be apparent, that the Queſtion muſt be in the upſhot, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a God or no God? and ſo whether there be any thing or nothing?</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, There is ſome <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtorical Evidence</hi> of the truth of <hi>things paſt,</hi> which is as certain,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97215:83"/>
and much more ſatisfactory than the <hi>Natural Evidence of Concluſions,</hi> raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a long <hi>ſeries</hi> of argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yea, ſome which is truly a <hi>Natural Evidence</hi> though it depend on the credit of free Agents. The proof and reaſons I have given in the Treat. Firſt, The <hi>Will</hi> though free is <hi>Quaedam Natura,</hi> and hath its Natural propenſity to <hi>known good,</hi> as the <hi>underſtanding</hi> alſo is, and hath its Natural propenſity to <hi>Truth.</hi> And the underſtanding is not free, of it ſelf, but acteth <hi>per modum Naturae.</hi> Secondly, There are ſome of the acts of the <hi>Will</hi> it ſelf, which are ſo <hi>free</hi> as yet to be <hi>neceſſary.</hi> As to will <hi>Good ſub ratione boni;</hi> to will our own <hi>Felicity,</hi> and nill our own miſery; to will Life and Pleaſure, with a ſimple complacency, though not alwaies by election: To will all that is fully diſcerned to have <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modam rationem boni,</hi> and nill all that is diſcerned to have <hi>omnimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam rationem mali:</hi> Now it oft falls out that Hiſtorical Narratives ſhall proceed from ſome of theſe <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:97215:84"/>
                  <hi>acts. Salvation, Life</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and the <hi>neceſſary means</hi> of all, may be the Motives. Thirdly, There are other acts of the will which though they are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>neceſſary,</hi> are yet ſo <hi>neer</hi> to <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that they alwaies go <hi>one way,</hi> except in ſome very <hi>rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> caſe. As for example, It is not of <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> that a man <hi>feed</hi> or <hi>cloath</hi> himſelf, or that he murder not himſelf: But yet he will ordinarily do the firſt and forbear the latter, becauſe he is neceſſarily a lover of himſelf, and life, and therefore will not caſt himſelf away, nor deſtroy himſelf, without ſome conceived cauſe. Fourthly, There are no cauſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <hi>in rerum Natura</hi> for the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs</hi> of ſome ſuch actions: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is certain they will not be done, becauſe there can be no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without its cauſe; And the turning of the will to a mans known corporeal deſtruction is an effect which hath no common cauſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a point of more <hi>Natural Evidence</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi> than many
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97215:84"/>
Concluſions from Natural premiſes are, that <hi>all the people</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>England</hi> will not to morrow kill themſelves, nor go naked, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh or wound themſelves, &amp;c. And conſequently that formerly all never did ſo, ſince it was notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſo much their intereſt to do otherwiſe. For, there was no cauſe to produce ſuch an effect.</p>
               <p>If it muſt be a Miracle <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> which ſhould make all the Europeans or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to go naked to morrow, or to kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than it is <hi>Natural</hi> to them to do the contrary, or not to do <hi>this</hi> (for a Miracle is the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering of Nature.) But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent is evident, to reaſon, from experience. Ergo, &amp;c. There may be Cauſes for <hi>one</hi> mans actions, which can never fall out to All, or to very many.</p>
               <p>All the Phyſicians in <hi>England</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did perſwade all men againſt Phyſick, nor all the Lawyers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law; nor all the Covetous men in <hi>England,</hi> the Labourers or Beggars, were never againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieving
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97215:85"/>
Meat, Drink and Money; Becauſe there never was a <hi>cauſe</hi> of ſuch effects: And as it muſt be a great, powerful, common Cauſe, that muſt do this: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if the queſtion be <hi>whether</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there were a Parliament in <hi>England?</hi> Whether ever they made Laws with the Kings? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our ſtatutes were made by ſuch Kings and Parliaments as they are aſcribed to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is ſuch a concurrent conſent of competent Witneſſes, as could not be to it, were it falſe, becauſe it would be an effect without a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cauſe. Yea, againſt the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency or diſpoſition of mans <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> which would have cauſed the wills of ſome to contradict it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a miracle had hindred them. For among ſo many there are croſs intereſt notorious. Some Mens intereſt is againſt the thing, while other Mens are for it: And to make multitudes go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their apparent Intereſt, and Friends and Enemies of the event to agree, muſt be done by the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97215:85"/>
power of truth, or by a miracle: ſupoſing the caſe ſuch as they could not be all deceived in.</p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, But there is yet a fuller natural evidence of the truth of ſome reports; Even when beſides the report, there remain ſome viſible unimitable effects of the reported actions, which could be cauſed by nothing elſe. As if their Fathers told the Grand-Children of <hi>Noah</hi> of the deluge, they might ſee ſuch effects of it as might aſſure them that it was true. If the Parents of the man born blind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. were told by him that his eyes were cured, when they ſaw it in the effects they muſt believe it: If uncontroulled Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tell our Children that <hi>London</hi> was burnt and new built, that <hi>Pauls</hi> Church was burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that multitudes died of the Plague the year before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they ſee the City, the Church, the Graves, the change of Inhabitants, the proved Teſtaments of the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beſides uncontradicted teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony here is a <hi>natural evidence</hi> to aſſure it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:97215:86"/>
Sixteenthly, Though ſome half witted Philoſophers boaſt much of the certainty of their Phyſicks in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Morality, the truth is, the moſt of Phyſicks are meer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and the wiſeſt ſee it, and buſily pull down others doctrines, but confeſs they are yet but ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and groping by extrinſick ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and experiments to know what to ſet up in the ſtead: And ſo did others before them: And long may they ſo ſearch before they find. Whereas there is a more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying Evidence in much of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, as being <hi>Natural to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> and ſuch as will no ſooner ceaſe to be believed than man will ceaſe to be man: whereon all the affairs of the world are turned, and converſe, Societies, and all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Comforts of Nature are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: God hath made known to us what pleaſed him, according to his own wiſdome and not at our direction or choice. And he hath choſen that for us which is moſt uſefull: It is more uſefull to us to know how to live well, and how
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97215:86"/>
to be happy, and how to pleaſe and glorifie God and do good to one another, than to know Gods skil or myſteries in his workes; to know what is in the center of the earth, or how the active Nature doth ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on the paſſive, whether cold be a privation or poſitive, what is the cauſe of the continued <hi>motus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectorum?</hi> Whether Light and Heat be bodies? or Subſtances? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they penetrate other bodies? &amp;c. As it is more uſeful for me to know how to keep my Clock in order than how to make one; to know how to plow, ſow, eat, drink to my health, than to know by what myſterious operations, the Corn or other things do grow, and my food is digeſted, &amp;c. Therefore this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lord doth truly and wiſely enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate his <hi>Notitiae Communes</hi> in Morality and Religion as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the denial whereof doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man us. God hath left ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, powers, inclinations, and conſcience in humane nature, as ſhall naturally (though with ſome degree of freedome in the exerciſe)
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97215:87"/>
be an inſuperable witneſs in the world to himſelf, and to our common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and duties.</p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, The Hiſtorical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the Goſpel of Chriſt is ſuch as hath all the advantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed, in its kind. He liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and preached and wrought his miracles <hi>frequently,</hi> before thouſands, friends and foes: His miracles were never controlled as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the Magicians, by greater, nor by any certain Truth which they contradicted: The eye witneſſes themſelves were unbelieving till forced by Cogent Evidence: They delivered his Doctrine, Miracles, Reſurrection to the world, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by credible report, and to the ruine of their worldly pleaſures and intereſts, with the loſs of their lives, and all this meerly for the hopes of a reward in heaven, from God that well knew whether all were true or not; But alſo they did all in the power of the ſame Spirit which Chriſt did work by, doing ſuch Miracles as Chriſt had done: And this not a few nor in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97215:87"/>
but in many Countries of the world, and that by many thouſand Chriſtians in one kind or other (tongues, healing, prophecie, or the like) as well as the Apoſtles. The certainty of which fact is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by the very exiſtence of all the Churches converted by it, with all their Baptiſmes, Profeſſions and the reſt of the Tradition before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. No Chriſtian of all this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, by any terrours, death, time, was brought to the laſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and ſay that he had deceived the world by a lie, Many Apoſtates falling off for fear of ſufferings, but none with any ſuch recantation: No adverſary confuting the Hiſtory, but commonly confeſſing moſt of it with more ſuch evidence which I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the Treat. and muſt not oft repeat leſt I be tedious, And that which is ſtill the <hi>Natural Evidence</hi> is, that <hi>[There is ſtill exiſtent, Firſt, On the ſacred Goſpel, Secondly, On the ſouls and lives of all ſerious Chriſtians by its impreſs the unimitable Image of the Divine Power, Wiſdome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Life, Light and Love, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:97215:88"/>
                  <hi>atteſtation]</hi> Only as this noble Author requireth to all true <hi>Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Intellections,</hi> ſo do we to this, that there be but the neceſſary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the mind of the receiver.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miracles are reported a hundred years after; Here it was otherwiſe: The Jews were enraged by them for fear of the <hi>Romans!</hi> The Apoſtles and others wrought them openly; <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>John</hi> that wrote Chriſts Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory lived with him and ſaw what they wrote: ſo did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James: Paul</hi> wrote what he ſaw and heard from heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> wrote the Acts of <hi>Paul</hi> which he ſaw, being his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in travels. The thouſands were converted, and Churches in many Countries planted, not by bare words, but by the Conviction of the Miracles of the Apoſtles themſelves: ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church and Chriſtian was a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of them. And all this they were moved to, with the hopes of heaven, where truth is known, to deny the world, and mortifie the fleſh, and ſuffer whatever the Goſpel would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, to preſerve their hopes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97215:88"/>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>All the Mahometans and Chriſtians uſe no bloody ſacrifice.</hi> But that is becauſe, Firſt, Chriſtians believe that Sacrifices were but types of Chriſt and that he put an end to them by his perfect Sacrifice. 2dly, And <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> received it from Chriſt, being but Chriſtians degenerate firſt into <hi>Arrians,</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97215:89"/>
Carnal Paſtors in the Churches, that are Chriſtians for the caſe, honour and wealth. Secondly, But that this ſhould be ſo with all, I ſhall diſprove, and prove that none on earth are ſo credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this caſe as Divines. Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have made it the buſineſs of their lives to ſearch out the truth: and therefore (ſome of them) muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have the greateſt advantages to know it. So that for <hi>Ability</hi> they have no ſort of men that are Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors. For <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> are the improvers of underſtanding. And all men are found beſt at their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; Lawyers in the Law, Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in Medicine, Philoſophers in Philoſophy, &amp;c. And for your ſelf, your next words are, <hi>[Nobis tamen ad alia omnia fere quam literarum ſtudia (uti oportuit) exequenda, otium fuit: Partim armis in diverſis regionibus, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim quinquennali Legatione, partim nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis tum publicis tum privatis, vacavimus]</hi> And is not this your diſadvantage? Who is a good Linguiſt, Lawyer, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, &amp;c. that hath had but little lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for his ſtudies?</p>
               <p>Secondly, And as for Will and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:97215:90"/>
it is notorious that thouſands of the Miniſtry have ſo little ſet by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſt, as that it is upon the terms of <hi>greateſt</hi> ſelf-denyal to the fleſh, that they take up and exerciſe their office; being moved onely by the great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of their own and others ſouls: Their voluntary diligent labours, their holy lives, their contempt of the world, may convince any of this, that are not blinded by prejudice or malice. There are few Learned men in the Reformed Churches, but might far better uſe their ſtudies and labours, if they took that for beſt which is moſt profitable, advancing or pleaſing to the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You had a Brother of your own, ſo holy a man, as his ſincerity was paſt exception; and ſo zealous in his Sacred Miniſtry, as ſhewed he did not diſſemble; And I ſuppoſe had it been neceſſary, you would have ſo maintained him, that he ſhould not have fled from truth for fear of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, What can you think of all thoſe that gave up their lives for the Chriſtian ſaith and hopes? Did they go upon ſuch carnal grounds as you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:97215:90"/>
Fifthly, The revolutions of States, and the diverſity of Sentiments, and eſpecially the Intereſts of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part, do bring it to paſs (by Gods over-ruling of all) that uſually the moſt ſerious Chriſtians and Paſtors, are the ſufferers of the age they live in: ſo that how much hath God done hereby to confute ſuch ſuſpicions and accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! There are now in <hi>England</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and worthy men, in Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, which doubtleſs do not ſo love them as to buy them with the loſs of truth, and that to keep up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion againſt their Conſciences. But if you did ſo accuſe <hi>them,</hi> ſure the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred ſilenced Miniſters now in <hi>England</hi> that live in poverty, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them want Bread, when they might have preferment as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do live out of the reach of this accuſation: I write not this at all as meddling with their Cauſe, but as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering your Exception. I have my ſelf got no more for Preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel theſe nine years, than if I had been a Lay-man; I mean I have Preached for nothing, if the ſucceſs on mens ſouls were not ſomething, and Gods
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97215:91"/>
acceptance (ſo far as I did Preach:) And more than that, I would offer any man my ſolemneſt oath to ſatisfie him, that I believe and profeſs the Chriſtian Doctrine for its proper evidence, and for the hopes of the bleſſedneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thereby; which if they prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not with me above all the riches, preferments and pleaſures of this world, I would never have been a Preacher or a Chriſtian, nor would continue in my calling and profeſſion one day, much leſs on the ſelf-denying terms as I now do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, O my Lord, thou hast been to me a faithful Saviour, a happy Teacher, a ſupporting Comforter, in my greateſt dangers, diſtreſs and fears: Thy ſervice hath been ſweet and good! Thy word hath been a powerful</hi> Light, <hi>a</hi> Quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>a</hi> changing, <hi>an</hi> elevating, <hi>a</hi> guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>a</hi> comforting <hi>word. So far am I from Repenting that I am thy</hi> Diſciple <hi>or thy</hi> Servant, <hi>that (now I am not far from my departure from this world) I do vehemently protest, that I beg no greater mercy of thee in this world than that I may Believe in thee more firmly, and Hope in thy promiſes more confidently, and by</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, And I may add, that it is not only Clergy men that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: Beſides them the Learned'ſt men in the world have defended or ſtuck to the Chriſtian Faith: I need not name to you either men of your own rank, ſuch as the two <hi>Mirandula's,</hi> the great <hi>Du Pleſſis, Marnixius de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Anhaltinus,</hi> (a Prince though a Divine,) <hi>Bacon,</hi> and many a worthy Noble man of theſe Kingdoms, and of many other: nor ſuch Laymen as the <hi>Scaligers, Salmaſius, Grotius, Cauſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, Thuanus,</hi> and multitudes more. Were all theſe <hi>larvati vel palliati</hi> by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by price or fleſhly intereſt? He that is not a Chriſtian for Spiritual and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Intereſt, taking up his Croſs and following a Crucified Chriſt, on terms of ſelf-denial, even to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of all for him, not excepting life it ſelf, and doth not by his Croſs even Crucifie the fleſh and the world, which is the proviſion for its luſts, is indeed no real Chriſtian at all.</p>

Church, a man of moſt entire fidelity and of eminent knowledge and honeſty of life: He told me of his Grandfather of the ſame name with himſelf, <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Mercatus ſenior,</hi> between whom and <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> a man of a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wit, there was an intimate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, contracted and increaſed by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical ſtudies, in which they both were followers of <hi>Plato.</hi> It happened on a time that as they uſed, they were gathering from <hi>Plato</hi> (but not without doubting) how much or what of man remained after death; which <hi>Platonick</hi> documents where they failed, were to be under-propt by the Sacraments of the Chriſtian Faith: (for of that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is extant a learned Epiſtle of <hi>Marſilius</hi> to this <hi>Michael Mercatus,</hi> of the Immortality of the Soul &amp; God.) And in their diſcourſe when they had long diſputed, they thus concluded it; and giving each other their right hands, they Covenanted, that which ever of them firſt died, if he could do it, he ſhould certifie the other of the ſtate of the other life. And having thus covenanted and ſworn to each other, they departed: And after a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ſpace of time, it fell out, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael ſenior,</hi> being early in the morning at his Philoſophical ſtudies, unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly he heard the noiſe of a horſe ſwiftly running, and ſtopping at his door, and withall the voice of <hi>Marſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> crying out <hi>[O Michael, O Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, thoſe things are true.] Michael</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling at the voice of his friend, roſe up and opening the window, he ſaw him whom he heard, with his back toward him, in white, riding away on a white horſe, and called after him, <hi>Marſilius, Marſilius,</hi> and looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, but he vaniſhed from his ſight.
